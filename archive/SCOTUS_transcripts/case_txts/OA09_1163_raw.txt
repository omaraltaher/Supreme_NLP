 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 09-1163, Milner v. The 

Department of the Navy.

 Mr. Mann.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID S. MANN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MANN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 There are four points I would like to make 

this morning.  First, the plain language of Exemption 2 

dictates an extremely narrow category of materials, 

those related solely to internal personnel policies and 

rules.

 Second, even if you look beyond the plain 

language and look to the legislative history, the 

legislative history is focused, and the additional 

legislative history from the House is focused, only on 

law enforcement or investigatory materials, items that 

were covered through the 1986 amendments to FOIA, making 

any additional judicial High 2 unnecessary.

 The third point:  Because of FOIA's purpose, 

if you find that the language, the plain language, is 

not clear or if you find that the legislative history

isn't sufficient, then the focus must be on an 

interpretation that supports disclosure, not secrecy.

 And finally, Congress, in enacting FOIA, 

conducted the balancing.  In reserve for it, itself, the 

authority to add to or expand FOIA through Exemption 3. 

It did not leave agency discretion available for the 

agencies to decide what documents they can provide or 

not.

 Moving into our first argument, the plain 

language.  At issue is a very short sentence related 

solely to internal personnel rules and procedures -­

rules and practices.  Congress chose to use the words 

"related solely" on purpose.  That's an extremely narrow 

view.  Now, we understand if you look at the words in 

isolation, perhaps you could see that there is some 

conflict between them.  "Related" could be broad; 

"solely" is extremely narrow.  But when read together, 

as they should be in this statute, "related solely" is 

an extremely narrow class of documents.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I ask you this?  The 

D.C. Circuit's decision in Crooker has been the leading 

decision in this -- on this issue for nearly 30 years, 

and there has been a great deal of reliance on it, 

certainly by the lower courts in general, and perhaps 

also by Congress and by the executive branch.  Do you

think there's anything to be said for deference to that 

decision based on the fact that it has been -- there has 

been reliance on it to such a great degree for such a 

period of time?

 MR. MANN:  No, Your Honor.  When Crooker 

came down, the court was faced with an extremely -- a 

circumstance dealing with these FBI or ATF search and 

seizure manuals, and the court adopted and created the 

High 2 exemption.  But, again, we believe in 1986 

Congress dealt with that expressly, explicitly, and took 

the exact same language and inserted into a stand-alone 

exemption, Exemption 7(A), making Crooker no longer 

needed or necessary.  In the past, the Court -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  I ask -- I ask the question 

because the world has changed in a lot of ways since 

1981, and one is that there is now, I think, much 

greater concern about the disclosure of information that 

has perhaps profound security implications.  That was 

not as much of a concern in -- in 1981.

 If you think about, for example, suppose 

there's a Federal building with a hallway that is 

accessible only to somebody who has a code key.  Would 

that be -- is that -- does that have to be disclosed 

under FOIA?  Or architectural plans for a Federal 

building that would disclose the size of the bomb that

would be necessary to bring the building down or bring 

part of the building down; is there any FOIA exemption 

that covers things like that?

 MR. MANN:  Well, Your Honor, there could be 

a variety of FOIA exemptions -- it could fit under 7 

depending on whether or not it's law enforcement­

related.  For example, if it's FBI instructions on 

guarding a facility or guarding individuals, perhaps 

that would be law enforcement.  And if it's protecting 

individuals within that building, under 7(F).  Or it 

could be something addressed specifically through 

Exemption 3.

 And coming to your original -- the original 

part of your question, that times have changed, we 

recognize that; and Congress recognized certainly that 

times could and would change when it adopted it, and 

that's why we believe Congress kept for itself 

Exemption 3.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even though -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  7 and 3 -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even though you -- you 

said that there is now 7, Exemption 7, the amendment to 

that, so you don't need 2 -­

every court of appeals that has weighed in has accepted 

Crooker.  And I was a little puzzled why you were so 

intent on rejecting so-called High 2, because after all, 

in this very case, Judge Fletcher, dissenting -- it's 

true -- but he said he accepts Crooker, he accepts High 

2, and he still thinks you win.  So you don't need to 

reject Crooker to prevail.

 MR. MANN:  We don't need to reject -- under 

Judge Fletcher's viewpoint, we did not need to reject 

High 2 to prevail.  But, again, he was the dissent.  But 

more importantly, Crooker -- again, we think this 

language -- this case rises and falls on the plain 

language of the statute, and Crooker was an expansion of 

that, and we need to accept that Crooker was an 

expansion of that.  And Congress accepted that it was an 

expansion when they came up with 7(E).

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why does that show that?  I 

mean, why doesn't it show acceptance of Crooker?

 MR. MANN:  Well, I think -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, if that -- Crooker 

was -- was interpreting section 2 -­

MR. MANN:  I think -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- that was the 

interpretation.  Everyone had followed it, every court. 

Nobody disagreed.  All your four arguments Judge Edwards

went into thoroughly.  Everyone but Judge Wilkey 

approved it.  And so Congress reads that, and they make 

it specific in 7, but they say nothing about 2.

 MR. MANN:  I think there are three points to 

look at on that.  First of all, Congress originally did 

look at amending section 2 -- Exemption 2, at the same 

time they looked at amending Exemption 7.  They chose 

not to.  Now, we don't -- we can't read everything into 

that, but they chose not to.  They made 7 specifically, 

and 7 covered all of the language that we would be 

looking for.  So really, if you're still reading 

Exemption 2 to include a High 2, then 7(E) becomes 

superfluous.

 And then a final point and I think a very 

important point -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you had a different 

Congress.  I mean, the Congress that passed the law is 

not necessarily the same Congress that -- that failed to 

amend the law.  Are we to consider laws to be in effect 

only for so long as the Congress that passed them is 

sitting, and then the failure to make any changes in 

light of judicial decisions by later Congresses 

effectively amends the law?

 MR. MANN:  No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's an extraordinary

proposition.

 MR. MANN:  No, that's not the proposition 

I'm making.  The proposition I'm making is that when the 

1986 -- '84 through '86 took place, and they looked at 

this and they saw the issue with Jordan and they saw the 

issue with Crooker, their decision was to consolidate 

that exemption, what had been called "High 2," into 

7(A).

 JUSTICE BREYER:  How do you know?  What we 

have is 7(E) in front of us; 7(E) says we want to be 

sure something like Crooker's interpretation of 2 

applies with law enforcement.  It's simply a case -- so 

they apply it with law enforcement.  Absolutely now it's 

guaranteed.  Crooker is not guaranteed because it could 

be overturned.  You never know what will happen.

 But what in that suggests they don't want 

Crooker to apply to the Fed for example, or to the Navy, 

or to -- which is here storing -- it's storing 

explosives.  Why would -- I mean, I can't get anything 

one way or the other from the fact they passed 7.

 MR. MANN:  Well, I should -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why should I get one rather 

than the other?  For every argument you make, I can see 

an argument the other side -- that they make.

 MR. MANN:  Well, another point that I would

like to make -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  What's your answer to that? 

It was a question, really.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MANN:  Well, my answer is, is you are 

correct that they did not read -- they did not 

specifically state what they were doing or why.  So all 

we can do is look at what they did in its totality.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But there was a proposal 

to amend 2 -­

MR. MANN:  There had been an original -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And there was a 

conscious decision by Congress not to do 2 to conform to 

Crooker more generally, but to only pass 7.  So there 

has to be a meaning to the decision to limit the 

amendment.

 MR. MANN:  I -- I would believe that they -­

backing up to Crooker, if you look at the arguments in 

Crooker and you look at I believe every point in 

Crooker, where they discuss either the legislative 

history or they discuss other case law analysis leading 

to High 2, it was focused on these investigative 

materials:  examiner's materials, manuals, manuals that 

we didn't want the regulator to have an opportunity to 

have.  And that's all now captured in 7(E).

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you interpreting -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Mann, do you assume 

11

that there's always a reason for Congress's not passing 

a law?  I mean, it's hard enough to figure out their 

reason for passing a law -­

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- but there could be an 

infinitude of reasons why a law is not passed.

 MR. MANN:  I accept that, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you know of any case in 

which the failure of Congress to amend a law in order to 

overrule a court decision other than a decision of this 

Court has been held to be an implicit approval of that 

decision?  Do we have a single case where we've said, 

oh, there was a line of court of appeals cases, and 

since Congress failed to amend the statute to take 

account of those court of appeals cases, Congress must 

have approved them.  Do we have any case like that?

 MR. MANN:  No, we don't, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know of any.

 MR. MANN:  Your Honor, but I would like to 

make one additional point on this.  What -- by doing 

what Congress did in 1986 -- and, again, they're not 

telling us this, but we can look at the statute -- what 

they've done is preserve once again that clear, distinct

line between the exemptions.  Exemption 2 on its plain 

-- now Exemption 2 under its plain language is for use 

related solely to internal personnel matters.  That's an 

isolated exemption.  We don't need to go back to it to 

look abroad and start looking for other exceptions.  We 

have Exemption 7(E) now to handle that.  So there's a 

clear, sharp dividing line.  And as this Court said in 

Rose, actually quoting Vaughn, that we needed that sharp 

dividing line to let agencies know -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, in Rose we 

talked about a legitimate public purpose in seeking 

information.  I tie my question to Justice Alito's, 

which is at what point does -- is it legitimate for the 

public to seek information, internal information, 

relating to the rules and practices of personnel?  Can 

the public seek information that places the community at 

a severe security risk?  Is it possible for us to say 

that that kind of information, given our line of 

reasoning in Rose, could not be legitimate public 

information?

 MR. MANN:  But it does not have to be using 

the Exemption 2, as it's stated, for -- for the internal 

personnel policies.  There are other reasons and ways 

that some materials that might create a security risk 

can be protected.

Congress has -- there's over 150 -- I 

believe the number currently is 153 statutes that 

they've enacted under section 3, using section 3.  That 

includes as recently as last -- last year, when the 

Department of Defense v. ACLU case came before you. 

Congress stepped -- that was dealing with the Abu Ghraib 

photos.  Congress stepped in and passed an amendment to 

the Securities Act to exempt those documents 

specifically from release, in order to protect.  And 

that was using the proper authority.  It didn't require 

an agency to go back and rely on an "Expand 2," 

Exemption 2.

 And that's the danger of the expansion we're 

looking at, is it allows Exemption 2 to be used for an 

open-ended -- any time an agency feels it may be 

appropriate that it might not want to release something, 

it can rely on Exemption 2.  That was never the intent. 

Congress tried from the beginning to preserve for itself 

that discretion and that authority and to remove the 

discretion.

 As we point out -- as we've set out for you 

in our briefs, if you look at the legislative history, 

many of the agencies and Department of Justice that came 

before Congress asked for that discretion, and Congress 

did not give it to them.  They reserved, and, instead,

we have Exemption 3.

 So what we're saying is that you do not need 

to -- there may be reasons that you want to take high 

security information and have it isolated from the 

public's review, but it's not through using an exemption 

that was really designed for minor internal matters.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Of course, if that's -- if 

that's the outcome of this case and if you prevail, that 

would mean that more things will be classified and 

withdrawn wholly from scrutiny; whereas, if other 

exemptions are used, they can be shared to a greater 

extent.  So really what you're arguing for is for 

withholding more information from more people.

 MR. MANN:  I don't think I am, Your Honor, 

because I believe that, through the Exemption 3, they 

can't limit it to.  For example, in this case if there 

was a need for Congress to adopt a specific protection 

for these maps, it could.

 The problem that we have here in this case, 

again, is these maps at this base have been given out. 

And, again, it's a map.  It's a map showing the range, 

the size of an explosion, and its effect on the 

surrounding community.  That map has been given out from 

this base to some people, and some of those people they 

gave it to actually gave it to the newspaper.  It's been

not given out to others, including my client.  Other 

bases nearby, our Bangor Trident Submarine Base, gave 

out the map upon request.

 If this map that we're looking at is that 

secure, then perhaps it should be that secure and 

protected across the board.  But that's not what we 

have.  We have -- instead, we have an individual within 

an agency making a decision to withhold a certain 

document from some people and not others, and when they 

give it out to the others, they have no control over 

what those people do with that map.  And that's not a 

correct use of the Exemption 2.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why do you want to 

know?  How wide the corridors are in some Federal 

buildings, and terrorists could use that to bad purpose, 

but we want to give it to the firemen because they'll 

use it for a good purpose.  We want the policemen to 

know, we want different civic groups sometimes to know, 

but we want to keep a limitation.  We want it 

restricted, restricted to minimize the chance it will 

get into the wrong hands.  I mean, I don't see anything 

illogical about that.  What's -- what's illogical about 

that?

 MR. MANN:  But it shouldn't be through 

Exemption 2 because it's not --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?

 MR. MANN:  It's not an internal -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that's a different 

argument.

 MR. MANN:  Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, your four arguments 

seem to me to be the same arguments that Judge Edwards 

and the D.C. Circuit considered, and they are excellent 

arguments, and there are arguments on both sides, and 

then they considered it and came to a conclusion.  But 

this is a different argument you're making here, and I 

was addressing that.

 MR. MANN:  It's a different argument in the 

sense that what Judge Edwards was looking at and the 

Crooker decision was looking at was a specific group of 

documents, these manuals of policy and procedure.  And, 

again, we believe that that was addressed through the 

7(E) in 1986.

 So we're back now to:  Should there still be 

a High 2 category?  Is that how we want to read this -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, it's only addressed 

for law enforcement.  It's -- there are many 

dangerous or -- for example, this isn't law enforcement; 

this is munitions.  The Navy thinks, rightly or wrongly, 

I guess you can -- that they don't want these maps

circulated because they think it would make it easier to 

blow up the munitions.  They want the firemen to have 

them, they want the civil defense workers to have them, 

but they don't want people who might blow them up to 

have them.

 MR. MANN:  Well -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, that's -- that's their 

reasoning.  Now, that isn't addressed, it seems to me, 

in 7, because 7 deals with law enforcement.

 MR. MANN:  I would agree that this, perhaps, 

is not addressed in 7.  7 was -- was argued before the 

Ninth Circuit, but not answered on whether or not these 

fit under 7.  But, again, it should not come back to the 

use of Exemption 2.  Perhaps another exemption -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  As I -- as I read the 

D.C. Circuit decision, you -- you are assuming or you're 

suggesting that the D.C. Circuit saw a gap that Congress 

hadn't provided for, and it filled that gap.  And now 

the add-on that the D.C. Circuit made is no longer 

necessary, so we lop it off.  But the judges on that en 

banc court thought that they were interpreting the 

statute going through all of the steps that you 

outlined.  Language is rarely so plain that there's no 

room for a different interpretation.

legislative history to see how that might inform the 

decision, but -- but really, to suggest that Crooker was 

just sort of a stopgap until Congress amended the 

statute I think is not fair to that decision.

 MR. MANN:  Your Honor, the issue here is not 

so much Crooker as it is what the Ninth Circuit has done 

to, we believe, expand Crooker, because you're correct. 

I mean, obviously, the Crooker decision was a 

well-written, long, and very detailed decision, both the 

en banc as well as the dissents, but -- the dissent.

 But even there, they were looking at that 

same legislative history, and it's the same legislative 

history that this Court looked at in Rose, and there is 

a limit.  They didn't say that it needed to reach all 

the way out to cover anything as broad as a category of 

what the Navy's proceeding with here.  They looked at 

manuals of procedure, the disclosure of which would 

enable the regulated community to circumvent those 

agency regulations.  Again, you addressed that as 

arguably dicta, but that's the statement you had made in 

Rose, that it was by the regulated to circumvent 

regulations.

 The documents we have, for example, in this 

case are not.  The regulated entity under the 

Operating-5 manual is the Navy.  It's how the Navy

stores and moves its munition around.  So even under a 

reading of -- of Crooker, what Crooker was looking at, 

looking at the House report, taking the House report on 

its face, taking the testimony before Congress that was 

on its face -- again, that was still dealing with these 

operating rules and guidelines for government 

investigators or examiners, but not -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Mann, I thought you 

disagreed with the premise of Justice Ginsburg's 

question; that is, that you assert that the language 

related solely to the internal personnel rules and 

practices of an agency is quite clear.

 MR. MANN:  I do.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought maybe you were 

abandoning that.

 MR. MANN:  No, no.  I mean, I -- but what I 

was saying was that we do believe it was quite clear. 

But if -- even if you went beyond, which obviously they 

did in Crooker, and obviously you could argue from the 

House report -- even if you go beyond, it's still a 

limited category that does not reach so broad as what 

the Ninth Circuit has opened up here, and as what the 

Navy is arguing before you now, which is even broader 

than what the Ninth Circuit reached.

broader?  I -- I looked for the words.  I just missed 

them, and you can point them out.

 When I read about the circumvention, what 

Crooker says is:  "We hold that since the document for 

which disclosure is sought meets the test of 

'predominant internality,' and since its disclosure 

significantly risks circumvention of federal statutes or 

regulations," it is exempt.

 It didn't say anything about circumvention 

because there is a regulated entity and it is that 

regulated entity that will circumvent.  It just spoke of 

circumvention, as far as I saw.  But maybe there's 

another place where it talks about regulated entity.  Is 

there?

 MR. MANN:  Well, I believe it's addressed in 

the decision during the context leading up to the 

decision, but it is addressed by this Court in Rose -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, that's -- but that -­

if we're looking at Crooker, I just read the words 

"would there be circumvention" -­

MR. MANN:  Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and it seemed to me, in 

this case, the Navy has plans and they use those plans 

to store munitions safely, and the risk that they worry 

about is someone will get ahold of the plans and use the

positions of those munitions in order to make them 

unsafe, for example, blowing them up.  So that seemed 

like a very serious circumvention of what the regulation 

was there for.

 MR. MANN:  But not by the regulator -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's correct, and I 

didn't find anything in Crooker that said -- and I don't 

know why you'd have such a theory.  I don't know what 

the point of the theory would be, that you would care 

whether blowing up took place by somebody who 

technically was regulated by the Navy or blowing up took 

place by some other person, whom they're worried about.

 MR. MANN:  Because the basis -- it's -- the 

basis for that is, again, this Court's language in Rose, 

where it looked at -- again, we're going back to a very 

few words in the House report, and the House report is 

looking at these guidelines and manuals of procedure for 

government investigators or examiners.

 This Court took that language and looked at 

it and pointed to -- well, and it's a logical extension, 

that if we're looking at it from these investigators or 

examiners, what we're concerned about is people being 

investigated or examined.  So we don't see that that 

expands here.

 And, again, it's coming back to the basis of

this material shouldn't be under (i)(2).  I mean, we can 

discuss and debate the merits of the safety of these 

maps.  This is, again, a map.  It's not the operating 

guidelines, the Operating-5 manual.  That's not what was 

requested or it's not what's before you, but what's 

before you is the map, the map which shows that the 

largest target, no surprise, is the loading dock.  The

There are -- there are identified, I believe it was 14, 

but I may be incorrect, separate maps in the Vaughn 

index.  We know, if you read -- the portions that we 

have from the Operating-5 manual say they can move 

munitions around as long as they stay within the 

confines of the ESQD map, but it appears the map can be 

amended.  And, again, that's the -- that's the 

prevailing question here, is we're talking about public

waters, private land around the base, and whether or not 

that land stays secure.  That's the great significant 

public interest here, is we have a city within a mile 

and a half of this base and of this very visible loading 

dock that can be seen from everywhere.  On the 

waterfront restaurants in town, this loading dock stands 

out.  So whether that map changes over time would be 

important to know.

 If there are no further questions, I'd like 

to reserve a couple minutes.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. YANG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Petitioner has asked this Court to disrupt 

30 years of FOIA practice by rejecting an interpretation 

of Exemption 2 that has prevailed and has provided a 

workable standard for agencies and the courts since the 

D.C. Circuit's en banc decision in Crooker.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you tell me what 

the textual basing for Crooker's "predominantly 

internal" and "circumvention of agency regulation" 

requirements is?  Where in the text are those words, and

how do you create them except through sort of judicial 

crafting?

 MR. YANG:  Well, I think the -- as our brief 

explained, there are three basic elements to Exemption 

2.  The first is the internal element, and we believe 

that means that the records at issue must be properly 

maintained within an agency and not for general release. 

And -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The problem with that in 

this case is that it's a mixed document.  It is 

predominantly for internal use, but not exclusively.

 MR. YANG:  Well, I think -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how do you square 

that with the words "related solely to internal"?

 MR. YANG:  Right.  If I could just finish 

the internality and then talk about how it relates 

solely -- relates to that, I think that would be 

probably easiest.  The internal -- and when a document 

is properly held within an agency as internal reflects 

the FOIA balance that's at issue throughout the 

exemptions.  It involves the balance between the public 

interest in knowing information about the government and 

the need for the government to maintain certain things 

in confidence.  And in this context, Rose addressed two 

other contexts.  Rose explained that when there is no

legitimate public interest, things may be properly 

internal.  There's simply no reason to disclose it. 

In -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the case summaries 

there were internal solely.  They were created only for 

purposes of the agency's honor code review or discipline 

review.

 MR. YANG:  Well, if it was -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And yet we ordered it 

disclosed.  We created an exception to the -­

MR. YANG:  Well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- plain language of the 

rule, it seems to me.

 MR. YANG:  I don't believe this Court 

created an exception to the statute.  I think what the 

Court did was construe the statute.  And although it is 

not clear from the text of Rose exactly the textual 

foundation for that decision, I think it is best read as 

turning on the internality.  And understanding what is 

properly internal under Exemption 2 must be understood 

in light of what FOIA is doing and what the legislative 

history suggests for the exemption.  And so what we -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Oh, I agree.

 MR. YANG:  This case -­

distinction it made was that it's only internal rules 

and practices of the agency, a personnel agency, if the 

public has no legitimate interest in it.

 MR. YANG:  I think it said that that's the 

case where there's no countervailing interest on the 

other side.  At least where there's no risk of 

circumvention, is what the Court was saying.  What we 

have here is a different FOIA balance.  What we have 

here is something strong on the government interest 

side.  There are certain things that just cannot be 

disclosed to the public and have the government function 

well.  This is one of these.  This would be the 

location, type, amount of munitions stored on a Naval 

facility.  Location -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Yang, but the 

information about location I thought was disclosed, 

where these explosives were stored.

 MR. YANG:  There are -- there is -- for 

instance, the appendix includes a map of buildings.  It 

doesn't explain where munitions are stored, the type of 

munition -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we know they're in 

the building.  We may not know the type of munition.

 MR. YANG:  Maybe not in every building.

sites, but you don't know which ones, how much, the 

types of munitions.  And what we're talking about is 

more than a map.  What we're talking about is more 

generally the ESQD information in the disclosed records, 

which includes -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And I thought that that 

information was given out for the Bangor facility.

 MR. YANG:  There appears to have been a 

release -- and the record does not provide us detail as 

to why -- before 9/11 by the Bangor facility of some 

arcs.  Now, it's important to know that arc maps have 

different levels of importance.  For instance, you might 

have an arc map around a bomb squad on a base, because 

bomb squads need to maintain a small amount of 

munitions, but that arc isn't particularly sensitive. 

So arc maps might be released in certain contexts, and 

the Navy here actually does conduct a case-by-case 

balancing to see whether or not it would be appropriate 

to release this information.

 Here, what we do know is that the Navy 

looked at the arc maps here, which are highly sensitive 

maps, as well as the associated ESQD information, and 

determined that releasing this information would provide 

a road map to those with bad intent to circumvent the 

very safety procedures that --

local responders.  The Navy here has shared -­

 MR. YANG:  When you classify a document, it 

restricts access to people with a Federal need to know, 

people who have been adjudicated as eligible to receive 

classification, receive the proper training.  The Navy 

in this instance needs to share limited arc information 

with the local fire department and the police department 

to make plans for in the event of an emergency.  And

Government?

circumstances, but there are other -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could you

preventing their release before they're released?

provide us with the opportunity, I think the Navy could 

consider that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I mean, isn't it 

the case when a government agency has to go through its 

records in response to a FOIA request and comes upon 

records that would otherwise be disclosable, they can at 

that point say we're going to classify this so we don't 

have to disclose it.

 MR. YANG:  The relevant executive order that 

governs classification does allow classification of 

materials which have been disseminated beyond the 

government.  But there are certain thresholds that have

to be met.  I'm not an original classifying authority, 

so I would not be in a position to say whether these 

types of things could be classified in this instance. 

It's at least theoretically possible.

 But I -- what I want to underscore is that 

the reason that these materials are not classified in 

this instance is because it is important to share with 

the local fire department.  Now, the local fire

a need to -- it says:  "It is the policy of the Federal 

Bureau of Investigation to share with law enforcement 

personnel pertinent information regarding terrorism." 

And it provides a procedure for sharing that classified 

information.

 MR. YANG:  It is -- I don't mean to suggest 

that only Federal Government employees can have 

classification.  You can -- you have contractors.  There 

are instances where you can classify material and share 

it with nonfederal entities which have been given

you're asking us to do your job.  You've got to go

unambiguous reading of the statute, but a fair reading 

of the statute, and it's a reading that has prevailed 

for almost 30 years now.  And then quite beyond -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So can we talk about that 

reading, Mr. Yang?  Let's talk about the meaning of the 

statute.

 MR. YANG:  Sure.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  The key word is -- the key 

term is "personnel rules and practices."  If I said to 

you what's a personnel file, what would you say?

MR. YANG:  Well, it depends on context.  You 

may be referring to Exemption 6.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  It could be referring to 

Exemption 6, or it could be referring to just generally, 

just in a conversation?  Your personnel file -- what 

does it mean?

 MR. YANG:  Well, in the context of Exemption 

6, I think it refers to files pertaining to personnel.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can you think of another 

context in which it means something other than that?

 MR. YANG:  I think the term -- the phrase 

"personnel file" itself is normally referred -- normally 

used to refer to personnel, but what-­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's a kind of H.R. file, 

right?

 MR. YANG:  That's generally true, but -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So why should there be any 

difference if you look at the term "personnel files and 

practices," that these are H.R. files and practices?

 MR. YANG:  Well, it's certainly one reading. 

We think that personnel rules and practices of an agency 

can fairly encompass instructions that you provide to 

personnel.  For instance, if you were to instruct 

personnel that they are to appear at work at 9:00 and 

leave at 5:00, or they are to perform a certain number

of duties, 10 cases per day, or you need to process 

these cases in a certain manner -- all of those I think 

would be fairly characterized as personnel rules and 

practices of an agency, and -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  All the rules of an agency 

would -- would be sucked in, wouldn't it?

 MR. YANG:  Well, no, I think -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, all the rules the 

agency promulgates are supposed to be enforced by the 

personnel of the agency.

 MR. YANG:  I should think so.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They become personnel rules 

and practices.

 MR. YANG:  The focus on personnel in the 

statute helps to distinguish between rules and practices 

which govern personnel, and rules and practices which 

also are there to govern the public in its interactions 

with the agency.  And this goes back to the question 

that we initially started on.  "Relates solely" -- when 

you're related solely to the internal personnel rules 

and practices of the agency, it -- it extends just 

beyond just the rules and practices of themselves, but 

it makes sure that the focus -- solely -- is still on 

personnel.

 So there are things -- for instance, if the

rule is that you need to file a FOIA request in a 

certain way, and the agency instructs personnel to 

process it in a certain way, those rules also would 

affect the public.  The public would need to comply.  If 

there is a dual purpose, a dual function of the rule or 

practice, it would not relate solely to the internal 

personnel rules.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that begs, I 

think, Justice Scalia's question.  One could argue that 

everything that the agency develops except rules telling 

the public how to come to the agency with a complaint, 

et cetera -- virtually everything will govern either the 

internal personnel practices or the agency's practices 

vis-à-vis the public.

 MR. YANG:  But not everything that the 

agency does will relate solely or exclusively to govern 

the internal personnel -- the rules and practices for 

personnel.  When there is a dual function, that is, it 

both instructs personnel how to do their duties and it's 

also something that the public must take into account -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if the -- if the 

agency has a rule that says put explosive A in building 

1 and put explosive B in building 2, that's hard for me 

to explain that it's just a personnel rule, other than,

-- and we still do, thank goodness, do things.  But the 

focus of the exemption in context -- the exemption 

applies to matters that relate solely to the internal 

personnel rules and practices of an agency.  Personnel 

helps to focus the inquiry on the rules, and, again, 

only relating solely, on rules that govern agency 

personnel, as opposed to rules that might govern those 

personnel and govern the public's interaction with the 

agency.  That's the key -­

Personnel Management has a pretty broad charter, then, 

on your theory of what the adjective means.  OPM must be 

a very powerful agency.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. YANG:  Well, I -- it certainly is.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. YANG:  The -- but I think what we're 

saying is that personnel can have different meanings in 

different contexts.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can we go back to the --

I mean, the origin of the Exemption 2?  I thought there 

was a concern in Congress that, under the APA, section 3 

was shielding too much from the public, and so they 

wanted to have a narrower category.  Listening to you, I 

really don't see how we have something that's narrower 

-- narrower than the old section 3 of the APA.  And if 

you can give me an example, this is what the APA 

shielded that would not be shielded under section 2, 

maybe I would -­

MR. YANG:  Well, there were -- I can give 

you a few examples from the legislative history, for 

instance.  One of the problems that Congress was 

concerned with is that the old exemption, exemption in 

section 3, had been construed to apply to internal 

management, including things such as phone books, agency

phone books for personnel.  That would no longer be 

encompassed.  Things like budgets that the agency 

produces, that arguably would -- internal management, 

that that would not be under the internal personnel 

rules and practices of the agency.

 And I think it's important to remember that 

when Congress drafted this statute, it initially started 

with internal personnel -- or, excuse me, internal 

employment rules and practices and changed that to 

personnel.  In the report that effectuated that change, 

the explanation and the only explanation was that that 

change was similar -- made the exemption similar but 

more tightly drawn than the APA's management exemption, 

which at the time existed in another part of the 

statute; it was a cross-reference.

 When Congress then continued to revise the 

statute, the House made very clear in the hearings, in 

the House Report, and on the floor that its intent was 

to cover these types of -- manuals and instructions to 

agency personnel when doing so would risk the functions 

that are at issue here.  And when Congress in 1986 

amended FOIA by adding -- or amending Exemption 7(E), it 

ratified the existing rule.  And it did so because -- it 

ratified it and it had to -- it extended it in two 

important ways.

Crooker left open the question or at least 

made it vague as to whether prosecution guidelines would 

be protected by Exemption 2.  The reason that was 

unclear is because the D.C. Circuit had previously 

concluded in Jordan that Exemption 2 did not apply. 

Crooker rejected all of Jordan's rationale, but then 

someone enigmatically said, but we would reach the same 

result.  Justice Ginsburg's concurrence explained in 

Crooker that this muddied the waters, and when Congress 

revisited FOIA and Exemption 7(E), it specifically 

provided an exemption for law enforcement investigations 

and prosecutions.  In doing so, it made clear that 

whatever existed of Jordan was gone.  It also did 

something else -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would have thought 

that the amendment to Exemption 7 really cut the other 

way.  They amended Exemption 7; they didn't amend 

Exemption 2.

MR. YANG:  Well, no, I think what it did is 

it took Crooker as understood, but what it did is with 

respect to law enforcement records -- and remember it's 

only records compiled for law enforcement purposes that 

would disclose techniques, procedures, or guidelines for 

investigations or in prosecutions.  In that context, 

Congress lowered the bar.  It provided more protection 

for those law enforcement records than Crooker did.

 This is part of what Congress was doing in 

Exemption 7 more generally, and this Court's decision in 

Reporters Committee discusses this.  Before '86, 

Exemption 7 applied where disclosure would cause much of 

these harms, these enumerated harms.  Congress changed 

"would" through most of the sub-provisions of Exemption 

7 to "could reasonably be expected to," and they did so 

also in Exemption 7(E) where -- with respect to the 

guidelines provision.

 When guidelines for law enforcement 

investigations or prosecutions could reasonably be 

expected to circumvent the law, that's what the 

exemption covers.  In doing so, it's providing --

Congress decided to extend Crooker.  It extended the 

protections by lowering the bar in '86, and it also, as 

we have discussed, did so to specifically address the 

D.C. Circuit's decision in Jordan, or at least what

might have been left of that after Crooker.

 We see that as simply building on the back 

of Crooker, and it did so specifically in the -- the law 

enforcement context, but it did so with the premise that 

Crooker had properly understood Exemption 2.  And it's 

important to remember that law enforcement context in 

the Exemption 7(E) will only apply in a certain subset 

of instances.  It has to be compiled for law enforcement 

purposes; it has to be -- disclose techniques, 

procedures, or guidelines for law enforcement 

investigations or prosecutions -­

it is practical.  Plus, in many contexts, there won't 

have -- there won't be national -- cognizable injury to 

the national security, which is the touchstone of 

classification.  So there are things -- you know, there 

are many types of information out there -- for instance, 

internal procedures regarding computer security for 

agencies -- that just would not normally be thought of 

as something that's classified.

 Agencies also provide guidance to personnel; 

for instance, in screening Medicare claims that come in.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  You 

wouldn't regard internal security procedures for 

computer systems as confidential?

 MR. YANG:  Not classified as confidential. 

In order to be classified, there has to be a 

determination by the original classifying authority of 

many things, but, among other things, it has to show 

that disclosure of the information could reasonably be 

expected to damage the national security.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you classify those 

as internal procedural rules -- personnel rules?  And 

would you also classify architectural specifications as 

internal personnel rules?

the computer security instructions to personnel, how you 

access and what criteria you must build your computer 

systems to be secure at -- I think that would be deemed 

as internal rules and practices for -- of an agency.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What about architectural 

specifications?

 MR. YANG:  It can.  I mean, I think it's a 

little misleading to talk about architectural 

specifications or maps.  Those are simply methods by 

which you convey information.  You could also write 

things out longhand.  It would take a lot longer, but 

you could write out the same information longhand.  So 

long as it fits within the rubric of internal personnel 

rules and practices of an agency -- that is, it is 

providing guidance, it is providing rules and practice 

for the agency's personnel to follow in conducting the 

agency's function -- it could well be deemed to fall 

within Exemption 2.  Not everything would be, but 

certain things can.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, basically, anything 

that the agency uses to craft its internal employee 

practices and rules gets swept up as private, as 

internal?

 MR. YANG:  No.  No, no, no.

comes in, of Crooker, and we believe that in order to be 

properly deemed internal, the disclosure would 

significantly risk circumvention of the agency's 

functions.

condition of the disclosure.  You're saying if any

essentially two things that the court is getting at

at issue can have an impact beyond the agency.  That was 

kind of one -- one aspect of it.

 And, two, the Court was concerned about not 

having secret law; that is, things that the public would 

have to know and use in interacting with the agency.  We

 The -- I think I ought to just note two more 

things.  Petitioner's reading of the legislative 

history, I think, needs to be corrected in two respects. 

The 1964 Senate report that Petitioner relies upon talks 

about rules regarding parking, lunch hours, and sick 

leave.  That does not concern Exemption 2.  That 

provision is regarding what ultimately became section 

552(a)(C)(2).

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I just nail down one 

particular point?  It is the view of -- you're 

representing the Government, and it is the view of the 

Government that classification is not a practicable 

solution to the problem that's highlighted here.

would fall within -- excuse me -- not in this case, but 

within the matter of Exemption 2, would not be able to 

be classified.  Exemption 2 addresses a special problem. 

It addresses the problem of releasing documents where 

the very release would frustrate the function of having 

those documents in the agency -- for the agency.

 And so there's no other exemption that does 

that.  And requiring Congress -- remember, this has been 

the way this has worked for almost 30 years.  There 

would have to be a very large number of Exemption 3 

statutes.  Congress would have to go and enact them one 

by one.  It's not a feasible solution.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID S. MANN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MANN:  There are two points I'd like to 

focus again on, coming back to, is the word "personnel" 

matters.  When this case came to me, my client told me 

that he could not get these maps that he had gotten 

previously because the Navy was classifying them as 

personnel documents.  What is my reaction as a lawyer? 

What?  What are you talking about?  I can read the 

language of this statute.  It's talking about a narrow 

exception, which is exactly what Congress set up.  Nine

narrow exceptions.  The one open-ended one is the one 

that Congress kept for itself, Exemption 3.

 If the Navy doesn't believe that these 

documents can be or should be classified, but the Navy 

doesn't want to release these documents for some reason, 

then the Navy's recourse is to go to Congress as other 

agencies have done and seek a special protection for 

these documents.  But it's not to distort the words 

"personnel practices and rules" to expand to every 

document that is used by personnel.

 And that's precisely what the Navy is asking 

for, on page 51 of their brief, and we responded to it 

in our reply.  They're looking for an exemption that 

covers a wide range of information concerning internal 

rules and practices where disclosure would risk 

circumvention and where other FOIA exemptions are 

unavailable.  They're asking you to create for them what 

they -- what Congress wouldn't give them in 1964 or '66, 

broad discretion.  And it doesn't belong.  It certainly 

doesn't belong under the very narrow Exemption 2.

 If there are no other questions, I'm 

complete.
