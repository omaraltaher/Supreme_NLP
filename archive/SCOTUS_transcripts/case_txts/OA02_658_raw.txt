CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 02-658, Alaska Department of Environmental


Conservation v. the Environmental Protection Agency.


Mr. Franklin.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. FRANKLIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The question in this case is whether the Federal


Environmental Protection Agency has the legal authority to


override by fiat a discretionary determination that


Congress expressly directed be made instead by the State 

of Alaska, which Congress trusted to exercise its own


independent judgment according to local priorities and


local conditions.  We submit that the answer to that


question is no. 


When Congress wanted to give EPA the authority


to -- under the Clean Air Act to review and approve the


substance of individual State determinations of the best


available control technology, or BACT, Congress said so


expressly.  It gave EPA no such role in the circumstances


of this case.


QUESTION:  Well, do you think that the statute

allows EPA to at least say, Alaska, you didn't go through


the proper analysis here, you didn't consider, as


contemplated by the statute, some of the costs and


concerns that would enable a State to say, fine, you go


ahead with less than the ultimate equipment?  Now, can


EPA, under the statute, say, Alaska, you just didn't


follow the required procedures? 


MR. FRANKLIN:  EPA can say, yes, Alaska, you did


not consider the statutory factors, but that is not the


contention that's being made in this case, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Well, isn't that an element here in


fact?  Wasn't that part of EPA's concern?  Is it true that


the owner of the mine wouldn't even furnish certain


financial information to enable the State to make that


analysis? 


MR. FRANKLIN:  Two points, Your Honor.  The


contention that's being made here is not that Alaska


failed to consider the factors that Congress set forth. 


The contention is that they didn't do it in the way that


-- that EPA might have done it if EPA were the permitting


authority with regard --


QUESTION:  Well, that's a -- that's a pretty


fine line.  I mean, I'm -- I'm really surprised by -- by


your concession.  I -- I would have thought a much more


rational interpretation of the statute is that, yes, the

State has certain obligations under the statute to


consider the factors, but if they were not considered, the


person who would bring them to account for not considering


them is initially the State courts and then, on


certiorari, to this Court.  I thought your position was


that this is none of EPA's business --


MR. FRANKLIN:  It is our --


QUESTION:  -- that this -- that this


discretionary determination is given to the States, and


when the States are reviewed, they should be reviewed in


court.


Honor. 


MR. FRANKLIN:  That is our -- our position, Your


QUESTION: 


Well, why isn't it for -- for the --

for the hypothetical that Justice O'Connor gives as well


as for everything else?


MR. FRANKLIN:  I think that the -- the line is


whether the requirements of the statute were followed or


not.  In this case, Alaska has done precisely that which


it --


QUESTION:  Well, assuming they weren't followed,


is your position that when they are not followed, EPA can


call them to account? 


MR. FRANKLIN:  EPA has the authority to enforce


the requirements and prohibitions of the act, but we

believe that authority should be narrowly circumscribed to


the bounds that Congress set for the EPA. 


QUESTION:  Well, let -- let me intervene and --


and suggest this.  Could you have answered Justice


O'Connor's question this way?  Oh, yes, the EPA can -- can


complain and make its case that the State did not exercise


its discretion the right way, but it can't do so by just


issuing an order.  It has to go through the judicial


review process.  Would -- would that -- would that answer


your case or --


MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- or am I misstating the theory


here?


MR. FRANKLIN:  No, you're not, Your Honor.  The


-- the question in this case is not whether the claims


that EPA raises here will be subject to review.  The


question is how, when, and in what manner, and --


QUESTION:  Okay.  Now, could -- could the EPA


have gone to Federal court and say, oh, well, this


discretion was exercised in good faith and so forth, but


it was -- it was wrong?  It didn't comply with the


statute.  Could it go to Federal court?


MR. FRANKLIN:  if it's contention is it didn't


comply with the express terms of the statute --


QUESTION:  In -- in this case -- in this case --

 MR. FRANKLIN:  In this case, no.


QUESTION:  -- as Justice O'Connor said, it


didn't give -- oh, it cannot go to Federal court? 


MR. FRANKLIN:  Not in this case, Your Honor.  It


could under the State review procedure, and I think


there's an open question as to whether --


QUESTION:  Well, why couldn't it?  Why couldn't


it?  They simply proceed under 28 U.S.C. 1345.


MR. FRANKLIN:  Exactly.


QUESTION:  Now, what they do is they say, we're


now in Federal court.  There's a State law here.  The


State law happens to say that you cannot be arbitrary.


MR. FRANKLIN:  Correct.


QUESTION: 


And so now they say, we're making the 

same claim identically.  They were arbitrary, capricious,


abuse of discretion.  But it's under State law.  And now,


my goodness, what is this case about? 


MR. FRANKLIN:  Exactly.


QUESTION:  You say that they should have gone


into the Ninth Circuit under 1345 arguing it was


arbitrary, capricious under State law, and they say that


they should be in the Ninth Circuit arguing that it's


arbitrary and capricious under Federal law, where I've


never heard that there's any difference between arbitrary


and capricious under State law or under Federal law.  It's

just whether it's arbitrary and capricious.


MR. FRANKLIN:  There are two important


differences, Your Honor, and -- and I think they would


have -- 1345 is the statute I was just about to cite, and


I think they would have the authority to go into Federal


court under State law.  Two important distinctions.


First, Your Honor, the -- the -- going through


the State process would require that they go through, in


addition to the State judicial review process, the State


administrative review process.  In Alaska, that would have


allowed Alaska's Department of Environmental Conservation


a de novo administrative hearing at which they could have


presented a full administrative record, additional


witnesses, and they would have had the opportunity to 

further clarify and defend their decision. 


The second point, Your Honor, is that under the


fiat that they have exercised here by order, it does not


accord Alaska's determination the kind of deference that


it would have received under the State process.


The point that we're making, Your Honor, is that


the State review process is adequate to address all the


concerns --


QUESTION:  They do go into Federal court, and I


do see your point.


What I am curious about is I think there are

like maybe a handful of administrative law experts who


might have thought there was really some kind of


difference between whether you're in Federal court under


the State words or in Federal court under the Federal


words when the words are identical.  And there may be


somebody who thinks there's a difference between what you


told Justice O'Connor and what you've told Justice Scalia,


but I'm not one of them.  I don't understand how you


reconcile those things. 


So if we assume Congress is not an expert, why


wouldn't they have just meant by this, well, EPA, you stay


out of it unless you think what they're doing is


unreasonable?  If what you think they're doing is


unreasonable, you have the authority to come in and go to 

Federal court if you want.  That would be simple.


Everybody would understand it. 


MR. FRANKLIN:  If Congress had made that clear


in the statute, Your Honor, we would not be here.  The


reason that Congress did not is that when Congress wanted


to give EPA the authority to review and approve the


substance of individual State BACT determinations, it said


so expressly in section 7475 --


QUESTION:  Mr. Franklin --


MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- perhaps I misunderstood your

brief, but I thought that you were making the distinction


in your brief between the substance of a decision and the


procedural motions.  I thought you conceded that if the


Alaska agency simply said, well, the company wants Low


NOx, so they're going to get it, and we're not going to go


through any feasibility analysis.  I thought your brief


conceded that if that were the case, there would be access


to the Federal court on the part of EPA. 


MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes, Your Honor, but that is not


what we are here about today.  What we are here about


today is EPA --


QUESTION:  Well, why isn't it, going back to


Justice O'Connor's question, when the EPA is saying, in


essence, you didn't really go through the feasibility 

analysis because you didn't even ask for the relevant


information? 


MR. FRANKLIN:  To get back to that, Your Honor,


the -- what EPA is saying is that we did go through the


factors, but we didn't weigh them the way EPA would.


And with respect to the economic considerations,


Your Honor, Alaska has followed EPA's own guidance on this


which says quite clearly that the individual circumstances


and finances of a permit -- an applicant are not to be


considered in the analysis.  So it was not relevant


whether the technology would have bankrupted this company

or not.  What Alaska found to be relevant and what it was


its statutory prerogative to find relevant and as a matter


of its own local priorities was a comparison of the costs


between this applicant and other similarly situated


applicants in recent decisions.


QUESTION:  So you want --


QUESTION:  Mr. Franklin, it's not just a


question of coming into Federal court. 


MR. FRANKLIN:  No.


QUESTION:  It's not just a question of the


agency coming into Federal court the way a private citizen


would and challenging the State action.  It's a matter of


the agency issuing an order --


MR. FRANKLIN:  Exactly.


QUESTION:  -- which order is presumptively valid


and which would have to be deferred to by the Federal


court presumably unless the order was arbitrary or


capricious.


MR. FRANKLIN:  And that is what I was --


QUESTION:  So you'd be deciding in Federal court


whether it was arbitrary or capricious for EPA to find the


State to have been arbitrary or capricious, a very -- a


very refined determination, to put it mildly.


MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes, Your Honor, and that is --


QUESTION:  But isn't that the problem?  It isn't

just a matter of getting into Federal court.  It's a


matter of how you get into Federal court. 


MR. FRANKLIN:  Exactly.  As I was saying before,


it's not a question of -- of whether these things will be


reviewed but how, and more specifically, whether these


issues which are --


QUESTION:  But it is.  There's a difference


because you're -- you said that the review -- the


reviewing authority would be the State court.  So you


aren't talking about whether there would be Federal court


review, and I think in response to Justice Scalia, now you


are saying that the route is the State court.  You're


agreeing with him when he said the route is the State


court and this Court on cert. 


Do you see any role for the Federal courts? 


MR. FRANKLIN:  Well, as Justice Breyer pointed


out, it's an open question.  We believe that the Federal


courts -- if EPA were instituting this, the State review


procedure, under section -- 28 U.S.C., section 1345, there


may be Federal jurisdiction because that confers original


Federal jurisdiction on any action brought by a Federal


agency.  But that's a narrow, limited scope.


QUESTION:  Well, but the action has to properly


lie in order for it to be successful, and when you have --


on what basis would the agency be suing?

 MR. FRANKLIN:  They would be suing under the


State review procedure, Your Honor.  It would be their


option we think, and it's an open question.  It's not one


that I think this Court --


QUESTION:  I don't think they could do it.


Suppose that the -- a State agency decides the


best available control technology is a ceiling fan that


they brought up to New Orleans -- from New Orleans.  They


bought it and brought it up to Alaska.  Now, EPA looks at


that and says, no, no, this is going too far.  Now, what


in your opinion is supposed to happen?


MR. FRANKLIN:  Well, in -- in our opinion in


that situation, Your Honor, it would be subject to the


APA-type review and it would be struck down. 

Again, the


question is not whether that kind of review of --


QUESTION:  What's the role of the Federal court?


MR. FRANKLIN:  Well, if EPA is the one bringing


the action, I -- I would accept Your Honor's premise that


once it has proceeded through the comment process, once it


has proceeded through the administrative review process --


and frankly, we think that that particular matter would


end there.  No State would do that because the States take


their responsibilities seriously to implement these


statutes. 


If, however, there were any question that

remained at the end of that process, which EPA


circumvented in this case by fiat, then and only in that


event would EPA be able to seek judicial review, but it


would be an APA case.  It would not be --


QUESTION:  Well, I don't -- I don't understand


anyway because the statute that we're looking at, section


113(a)(5) says that if EPA finds a State is not acting in


compliance with any requirement or prohibition of the PSD


program --


MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- EPA can stop construction and


issue orders.  It can also bring a civil suit for


injunctive or monetary relief. 


Suppose it just puts out an order and says, 

look, Alaska, you did not determine what costs would mean


to the mine in terms of profitability, employment, or


global competitiveness, and therefore you didn't meet the


requirements of the PSD statute, and you stop any


construction now on the mine expansion.  That would put


the onus on the mine owner or the State to go to court


somewhere, wouldn't it? 


MR. FRANKLIN:  It would and -- and that's


precisely the reversal of the kind of presumption of


regularity that the States are entitled to in these kinds


of cases.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Franklin --


QUESTION:  So under 17 -- or what is it --


7413(a)(5)(C), which is 14a of your brief toward the


bottom, you say that in this case the agency cannot invoke


that section to issue an order or to go to court.


MR. FRANKLIN:  That is correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  All right.  You have to say that to


be consistent.


MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Now, if you want us to write the


opinion your way, you would say under 17 -- 7413(a)(5),


the State -- the EPA cannot issue an order barring


construction unless.  Now you fill in the blank.


MR. FRANKLIN:  Unless a State has -- if there


was a demonstrated violation of an express statutory


requirement.  For example, a State has not --


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. FRANKLIN:  -- issued a permit to begin with


or a State has not put a BACT limitation into a permit. 


Those are the kind --


QUESTION:  Unless there's a violation of an


express statutory requirement, but the Government is going


to come up and say, there was a -- there was a violation


of the statute defining BACT.


MR. FRANKLIN:  But in this case, Your Honor,

that is not with respect to -- to the EPA, that's not what


they're saying.  They're saying that we did go through the


various factors that the BACT statute requires us to go


through.  In their opinion we didn't weigh them the proper


way and under the proper policies.  We, in fact, disagree


strongly with that, but that is a contention that is


raised every day of the week under administrative


procedure law.  It's not a contention that the express


requirements of the statute --


QUESTION:  What your formulation is, is that


they did not follow a requirement of the statute.  And I


just don't see how that gets you there.


QUESTION:  You're making a distinction between


the express requirements of the statute and the obviously 

implicit requirements of the statute?  Certainly it -- it


is implicit in the statute that the State's decision must


be made rationally and not arbitrarily.  Don't you think


that that's a requirement of law?


MR. FRANKLIN:  It is certainly a requirement of


law, Your Honor, but it is a background principle that


derives ultimately, we think, from the Due Process Clause


not a unstated requirement of the Clean Air Act.


And the important thing is what did Congress


intend for EPA to be able to --


QUESTION:  I mean, that isn't going to get --

the reason I think we're -- I'm having the same trouble


Justice Scalia is because the kind of -- in my mind


anyway, I tend to think of a classical definition of


arbitrary and capricious as sometimes involving they


didn't follow what the statute told them to do.  Sometimes


they did what the statute told them not to do.  Sometimes


they didn't get the weight right.  And I put all those


things -- and I think a lot of people do -- in the same


box called arbitrary and unreasonable, capricious, and you


try to draw some kind of line between those things.  I


don't know how to do it, and I don't think many judges


would.


MR. FRANKLIN:  Well, I think that judges would,


Your Honor. 


It doesn't usually come up because a court, 

reviewing such a procedure, could -- could find the -- the


order invalid under either basis, either it didn't comply


with the statute or it didn't comply with the APA. 


Here, though, Congress specifically


circumscribed the EPA's authority and it did so for a good


reason. 


QUESTION:  Where is --


QUESTION:  But the language of 113(a)(5) doesn't


really seem to be limiting -- I'm over here. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes, Your Honor.

 QUESTION:  It doesn't seem to be limiting the


authority of EPA.  And I'm just wondering just -- I'm not


sure I totally follow the argument, but I'm just looking


at the -- that statutory provision.  And are you saying


that statutory provision does not apply even if the State


acted arbitrarily and capriciously?


MR. FRANKLIN:  The statute governs how the


agency's -- gives the agency the discretion.  How the --


the agency exercises that discretion is a separate


question and one that is traditionally reviewed on a full


administrative record by a court, not by EPA acting on its


own fiat.


QUESTION:  Well, but this -- that provision


gives the -- the EPA the authority to issue certain 

orders.


MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And is it your position that they did


not have the authority to issue the order here or that the


order was wrong?


MR. FRANKLIN:  Our -- that they did not have the


authority because there was not a -- a violation of the


requirements of the act, which is the only basis --


QUESTION:  Even if there were a violation of the


requirements of the act, would you say they -- if -- if


there were a violation of the act, would they have the

authority to issue it -- issue that order?


MR. FRANKLIN:  If there -- if there were a


violation of the express requirements of the act, then --


then that's what the statute says.  But it has to be read


in context.  It has to be read in context.  Particularly


when Congress wanted to give EPA the authority to review


and approve the substance of these determinations, it said


so expressly in one narrow instance that is not applicable


here.  When a State has --


QUESTION:  That's in advance of the permit.  The


fact that -- that Congress specified that for certain


pollutions, you must, before you give any permit, go to


the EPA doesn't exclude that you could have the review


after. 
 But I would -- after the permit issues. 

But I would like to ask you.  You seem to be


saying, well, this is just a determination.  They applied


the statutory factors.  EPA didn't like the way they did


it.  There seems to be lurking in this a -- a difference


on what the statute means to this extent. 


EPA seems to be taking a single source approach. 


That is, you want a new generator?  That generator has to


have BACT for that generator.  Never mind if you tell us


voluntarily you're going to put Low NOx on all of them and


the result would be lowering the emissions.  In other


words, EPA seems to be taking a no-bubble approach to

this.  You go at it machine by machine --


MR. FRANKLIN:  Right. 


QUESTION:  -- generator by generator, where


you're taking the position or Alaska is taking the


position that if you can reduce overall emissions by


putting the Low NOx on all six generators and in the end


have cleaner air, well, then do that and forget about the


SCR on one machine.  That seems to be a substantive


difference about whether BACT applies to the whole setup


or machine -- generator by generator.


MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes, it is, and we believe that


EPA is -- is wrong on that.  But they're wrong as a matter


of policy, Your Honor.  The BACT statute gives the States


the discretion to weigh, among other factors, 

environmental factors.  We think that is clearly broad


enough for the State to take into consideration the


overall environmental effect that this --


QUESTION:  But that's -- it's either that you go


at it machine -- source by source, new source by new


source, modification by modification, or you can have the


bubble concept.  In Chevron, EPA was -- was espousing the


bubble concept and the Court -- this Court said, EPA,


that's a reasonable construction of the statute.


Now EPA seems to be saying as to this program


there is no bubble.  You have to look at that machine,

that generator in isolation. 


MR. FRANKLIN:  Right.


QUESTION:  And that seems to be a basic


difference on what the statute means, not on -- mix it all


up and is it arbitrary and capricious.


MR. FRANKLIN:  We think that it's -- in fact,


there is a difference on -- on how it's to be implemented. 


Congress was very clear here.  They understood that States


would have different policies, that one State could choose


the approach that EPA might choose, which says we are not


going to consider the environmental -- overall


environmental impact here.  Another State might view it


differently, but that's what Congress wanted to have


happen.  When EPA issued its orders in this case --


QUESTION:  But on the facts here I thought --


now, tell me if I'm right about this.  When I started


reading it, I was quite sympathetic to your view that it


makes no sense to have more emissions coming out as a


result of trying to control this one generator.  Their job


is to get fewer emissions not more.  But then when I read


into the record a little bit, it seemed to me that the


facts are that by the time this generator 17 came up, it


was perfectly apparent that the company had to put the --


whatever, some low technology, NOx technology or something


on four of the other generators anyway.

 So that the bottom line is that this bubble has


nothing to do with this case because we're talking about


one generator coming in in circumstances where the other


generators have to be controlled regardless.  Am I right?


MR. FRANKLIN:  You're almost right, Your Honor,


but the -- the difference is that there -- there were four


other generators that were subject to the cap, but there


were six other generators total.


QUESTION:  I know, but then we -- I had my law


clerk go through and do the extra emissions from those


other two, and it didn't really make any difference. 


MR. FRANKLIN:  It did -- it does make a


difference, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  It does?


MR. FRANKLIN:  Because of the assumption that


Alaska made, and that is that if you used SCR on MG-17 --


and this has never been challenged -- that -- that MG-17


would be the backup generator.  It would not be used.


Therefore, any emissions savings that you can get off


those other two engines, 2 and 6, no matter how small they


might be -- and I think that they probably come in the


neighborhood of 100 tons or so.  Any emissions savings


that you can get off 2 and 6 add to the bottom line


because the assumption that the State has made, which is a


-- a reasonable and in my view correct assumption, is that

MG-17 is not going to be used if it's SCR because SCR has


enormous operating costs associated with it.


Again, these were the -- the policy


determinations --


QUESTION:  If I go --


QUESTION:  I still don't -- I don't -- I don't


see where Justice Breyer's question fits with -- with the


issue, does the statute dictate BACT on an individual


generator?  Never mind the rest.  In other words, does the


act say, no bubble, and that's how EPA seems to be reading


the act, that it's not a matter of discretion, that this


calls for a new source, modified source, and you just look


at that new source and you don't look at the old


generators at all.


MR. FRANKLIN:  You look at the new source, Your


Honor, but you're allowed to consider environmental impact


in looking at it.  And there EPA is wrong, if that's their


contention.  Their -- for example, they -- they do not


require States, nor could they, to use their top-down


methodology.  EPA understands -- and that is the nub of


this case -- that the BACT determination is not supposed


to be a uniform Federal standard.


QUESTION:  What -- what other method is there


besides the top-down?  I know both briefs have said it's


-- it's the way it was done here.  That's what EPA

recommends, but it isn't inevitable.  What else would they


use other than top-down?


MR. FRANKLIN:  It could -- it could be bottom-


up, Your Honor.  They could look at each technology and


eliminate the ones going up.  There's a number of


different ways that a State could do it.


The point that's being made here, when EPA


issued --


QUESTION:  Is that in fact the situation, that


there are other ways, or is it just in theory, but they


all use top-down?


MR. FRANKLIN:  Your Honor, I don't know what


every State uses, but I do know that Congress made clear


-- and the legislative history at page 31 of the Senate 

report is crystal clear on this point -- that each State


was to have the discretion to weigh the factors in its own


judgment.  And -- and Congress made clear that a State --


it would be permissible for a State to consider such


things as anticipated and desired economic development, as


well as the amount of the available increment that the


State wished a particular source to consume.  When --


QUESTION:  Mr. -- Mr. Franklin, the -- the


difficulty that I'm having with -- with your argument


about the meaning of the statute goes back to your answer


I think to Justice Kennedy's question awhile ago.  He

asked you, in effect, what's the role of the statute on


your theory, and -- and you said, well, if they -- if they


simply ignore one of the stated statutory factors, they


say we're not going to consider this, or if there's a


technical defect in the order, if the order is incomplete,


that would be a -- a circumstance in which EPA could


exercise this authority. 


But you also said -- and I -- I assume you said


correctly -- that later on that these kinds of obvious


violations are going to be rare.


MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And that leads me back to -- as I


said, I guess, to Justice Kennedy's question, and that is


this. 


It seems to me that on your view of the -- the two 

statutory sections, there really isn't very much role for


them to play, and I can't imagine why Congress would have


enacted separate order sections if all they were meant to


do is what you say.


So my question is, why -- why doesn't your


explanation trivialize these two statutes to a point that


is implausible?


MR. FRANKLIN:  They don't trivialize it, Your


Honor.  There are numerous Federal requirements that if a


State does not meet those express statutory requirements,


then EPA can step in.  There are ambient air quality

standards --


QUESTION:  And -- and EPA could do the same


thing by following the State review process, couldn't it?


MR. FRANKLIN:  It --


QUESTION:  It could go in and say, look, they


forgot X.  They refused to apply Y.


MR. FRANKLIN:  But if its contention is one that


the statute gives the discretion but it was simply not


exercised in the proper way that we would have exercised


it, that is not a contention that Congress wanted EPA to


be able to resolve by fiat.


QUESTION:  Well, but I mean, that's -- that's


the question.  I mean, the -- the difficulty I'm having is


that if -- if it is unlikely that Congress would have 

provided this entire separate track simply to deal with


the problems that you say the track is meant to deal with,


then it is not so implausible at all that Congress would


have intended the statute to be applied as it has been


applied here.


MR. FRANKLIN:  I think it is implausible because


Congress made clear that EPA's authority was circumscribed


to enforcing the -- the statutory requirements, and those


requirements were met in this case.


If I might reserve the balance of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Franklin.

 Mr. Hungar, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. HUNGAR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Petitioner's fundamental contention is that once


a State issues a determination of best available control


technology so labeled, no matter how arbitrary, factually


unsupported, or unreasoned it may be, the Federal


Government has no enforcement authority under the act to


take actions to stop the invalid permit from taking


effect.  Nothing in the text, structure, or history of the


act supports the implausible contention that Congress


intended to immunize arbitrary, unreasoned State decision 

making from Federal enforcement review.


QUESTION:  Well, I don't think he is -- I mean,


my impression of their argument was, yes, you can review


that.  What you have go is through the State procedure and


then after you go through the State procedures, in fact,


you can go into a Federal court and have them apply the


State review procedure if you want.


MR. HUNGAR:  Yes, but --


QUESTION:  I think that's what their argument


was, or at least one of their arguments.


MR. HUNGAR:  But, Your Honor, Congress enacted a

Federal regulatory scheme and a Federal enforcement


scheme.


QUESTION:  That's a different thing.  Maybe


yours is better, but you can't say they're leaving it


without review.  So I just wanted to --


MR. HUNGAR:  Review only under State law, Your


Honor, and -- and our point is that Congress has enacted a


comprehensive Federal regulatory scheme and authorized EPA


to serve as a backstop to ensure compliance with all of


the requirements of the act, or this -- this portion of


the act. 


QUESTION:  That's begging -- I mean, that --


that is exactly the point at issue, it seems to me.  Why


is -- why is it irrational to envision a scheme such as --

such as the petitioners here propose, which is, look it,


Congress set certain, absolute requirements?  Ambient air


quality, you know, shall be this.  But as long as those


requirements are met, below that we also want each State


-- each emission source in a State to be examined to see


whether it is using the best available technology.


But what constitutes the best available


technology under the circumstances is a very difficult


question.  It involves issues of -- of the State economy,


as well as scientific issues.  We are content so long as


each State meets the absolute standards that the statute

sets forth.  Below that standard, we're going to let each


State decide whether the best available technology under


all the circumstances is being used.  That seems to me a


perfectly sensible and rational system. 


MR. HUNGAR:  Your Honor, the definition of best


available control technology does not simply leave it to


the discretion of the decision maker, the unbridled


discretion, to -- to select whatever it wants --


QUESTION:  Well, let's see what it says.


MR. HUNGAR:  It imposes meaningful constraints,


Your Honor.  Maximum emissions reduction that is


achievable taking into account specified factors.  A


failure, for example --


QUESTION: 


But you're -- you're missing the --

the first part of it.  It doesn't say which is the best


available.  It says the best of means and emission


limitation, best on the maximum degree of production of


each pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter,


blah, blah, blah, blah, which the permitting authority on


a case-by-case basis, taking into account these various


methods, determines to be the BACT.  I mean, there it is. 


Which the permitting authority determines.


MR. HUNGAR:  Yes, Your Honor.  Two responses. 


Number one, the -- the United States Code is


filled with examples of instances in which Congress

defines that it's the initial decision maker for a


particular question, but that is not generally taken to


mean that delegation of absolute, unreviewable discretion. 


Number two -- particularly when, as here, the statute


imposes --


QUESTION:  But they're -- they're not saying --


MR. HUNGAR:  -- these constraints on the


decision maker.


QUESTION:  They're not saying that the


discretion is unreviewable.  They're just saying it's


reviewable in a different manner than you think it is.


MR. HUNGAR:  They're saying that it's not


reviewable as a matter of Federal law, Your Honor, and


that is what we're talking about here.


QUESTION:  Well, Federal -- are you aware of any


State in the United States that does not have in its law


the requirement that its own agencies have to act


rationally, that they can't act arbitrarily, abuse of


discretion? 


MR. HUNGAR:  I don't know, Your Honor, but --


QUESTION:  Well, I don't know of any either.


MR. HUNGAR:  But I know there are --


QUESTION:  And so that seems to be the same


standard that you argue that applies, and since there is


no State that doesn't have that standard and no Federal

Government that doesn't have it, we all have the same


standard.  And that's why I think the argument does boil


down to which courts will apply it:  the Federal court as


a matter of Federal law, or the Federal court as a matter


of State law.


MR. HUNGAR:  Well, number one, I believe various


States have standing requirements that may be more


restrictive than those applicable under -- under Federal


law.


Number two, the question is not merely which


court will apply it but whether the -- the comprehensive


administrative authority confirmed on EPA to issue orders


and not just the administrative orders at issue here, but


also the possibility of the -- of the administrative 

sanctions proceeding, which is separately provided by


Congress in subsection (d) of 7413.  Under petitioner's


interpretation, none of that would apply as long as


there's some element of discretion in the State's


decision.  And it's simply not correct to say that BACT is


the only area in which the States enjoy some range of


judgment or -- or in which there may be factual


disputes --


QUESTION:  It's some range of judgment.  This is


the only provision that reads this categorically.  I -- I


-- which the permitting authority on a case-by-case basis

determines.


MR. HUNGAR:  With respect, Your Honor, that's


not correct.  Under -- under 7475(a)(3), which is the


--the subparagraph prior to (a)(4) which imposes the BACT


requirement -- 7475(a)(3) is on -- I believe it's on 13a


of the appendix to the gray brief.  (a)(3) is -- is where


the -- is where the requirement that permittees meet other


provisions of the act such as the national ambient air


quality standards and the increments.


QUESTION:  Tell me again where -- where --


MR. HUNGAR:  7475(a)(3) on -- on 13a of the gray


brief appendix.


QUESTION:  On 13a.


MR. HUNGAR:  Yes.


QUESTION:  (4).  Right?


MR. HUNGAR:  (4) is the BACT requirement.  (3)


is the national ambient air quality standards, other


standards of performance, the increments, and so forth.


All of the other requirements that -- that petitioner


concedes EPA should be able to enforce.


But if you turn -- and that (a)(3), in turn,


references 7410 --


QUESTION:  (j).


MR. HUNGAR:  (j).  7410(j), which is on page 5a


of the appendix, says that the permittee must -- the

permit applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of


the permitting agency that all of these requirements have


been met.


So under petitioner's interpretation, EPA's


authority to enforce all of -- all of the requirements of


the prevention of significant deterioration program would


be eviscerated to the extent there is discretion in those


determinations and there is necessarily discretion.  All


of those other determinations require modeling, and to do


modeling, you have to determine what the inputs to the


model are and you have to determine what the boundaries of


the ambient air area are, and if EPA cannot review any of


those discretionary decisions, it has essentially no


authority to do anything under this act except to require 

that permitting authorities mouth the words of the


statutory definition.  And that's it.  And if that's


all --


QUESTION:  Well, could -- could we get specific


in this case?  Looking at the Clean Air Act provision,


169(3), which the permitting authority on a case-by-case


basis determines is achievable, after considering economic


impacts and other costs.  Now, EPA says what's wrong. 


Alaska did make a determination, did it not?


MR. HUNGAR:  Alaska made a determination, but it


did not determine best available control technology within

the maximum degree that is achievable, taking into account


these factors, because the only basis for their rejection


of the best technology selective control -- I mean,


selective catalytic reduction was their reliance on


economic impacts, and specifically what they said was the


foremost consideration -- the foremost consideration --


for their rejection of SCR, according to the State -- this


is at page 208 of the joint appendix -- was impact of the


cost of SCR on the competitiveness of the mine.  And


yet --


that?


QUESTION:  What's wrong -- what's wrong with


QUESTION:  And --


MR. HUNGAR:  What's wrong with that, Your Honor,


is that on the previous page, on page 207 of the joint


appendix, the State admits that because Cominco refused to


provide the financial information, they had no basis for


making a judgment.  That's a -- they quote judgment.


QUESTION:  Well, let me just ask you --


MR. HUNGAR:  They couldn't make a judgment about

that very issue. 


QUESTION:  -- a technical point.  Suppose at the


end of the day -- and I'm not sure this is what we would


do or that I would favor, but suppose at the end of the


day we agree EPA had authority to issue a stop order and


that it was proper.  Could Alaska then go back and say,


well, okay, we're going to run through this drill once


more and do consideration of costs, and they're now going


to allow Low NOx's instead based on that?  Now, can they


do that?  Is that all right?


MR. HUNGAR:  On -- on an appropriate record,


absolutely they could do that.  And -- and EPA made it


clear --


day.


QUESTION:  So this wouldn't be the end of the


MR. HUNGAR:  That's correct.  The State has the


-- has discretion, but that discretion is not unlimited,


and that is the point that --


QUESTION:  Can you tell me, Mr. Hungar --


QUESTION:  Speaking of it's appropriate --


QUESTION:  Can you tell me, Mr. Hungar, whether


or not as -- as a matter of past practice, the EPA has


intervened in any State administrative review proceedings


in State courts?


MR. HUNGAR:  In State court, no, I don't believe

so, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  All right.  Has -- has it gone to


Federal court under -- was it -- 1345, the United States


District? 


MR. HUNGAR:  I don't believe so.  It's an


unsettled question I think whether 1345 would authorize


EPA to --


QUESTION:  So the EPA has been consistent in


saying that it -- it is not in any case like this or with


parallels to this gone through an administrative review


process.  It's simply issued a stop order?


MR. HUNGAR:  That's correct.  The EPA has


consistently maintained and -- and has -- has announced


this interpretation in a variety of administrative 

documents, including through notice -- in the course of


notice and comment rulemakings and in the very orders in


this case.  EPA has consistently taken the position for 20


years, at least, that it has authority under these


statutes, 7477 and 7413(a)(5) to do exactly what it did in


this case --


QUESTION:  That doesn't surprise me.  You -- you


mention on an appropriate record.  That is one of the


things that makes me uneasy about the -- the resolution


that you propose.


When this thing comes to a Federal court of

appeals, which is not a fact-finding court, it comes on


the basis of nothing except EPA's order.  We -- we do not


know the record before the administrative agency on the


basis of which the EPA acted.  Now, if you had gone


through the State administrative procedure, that record


would have been examined.  That would -- the action in


question would have been the action of the State agency


and -- and you would examine the record before the State


agency.


But -- but the administrative action we're


reviewing here is not the State administrative action. 


It's your administrative action, and the only relevant


record is the record before the EPA.  And -- and as I said


before, the court of appeals ends up determining whether 

it was arbitrary and capricious for the EPA to determine


that the State agency was arbitrary or capricious.


You combine those two weird factors and -- and


I'm just dubious that this is the kind of review that


Congress intended.


MR. HUNGAR:  Taking the last part of your


question first, Your Honor, there's nothing particularly


strange about an appellate court reviewing a prior


determination of whether an agency decision was arbitrary


and capricious.  Courts do that all the time --


QUESTION:  Square.

 MR. HUNGAR:  -- under the APA when a district


court -- no.  If a -- a district court determines whether


a -- whether the -- an agency decision was arbitrary and


capricious, the court of appeals, to the extent there are


discretionary issues, they would review deferentially, but


really as a general matter, it's going to boil down to a


question of law, which is I think the case here, which is


was it -- was it or was it not arbitrary and capricious


for the State of Alaska to do what it did here. 


Fundamentally that is a question of law upon review of the


EPA's determination. 


QUESTION:  All right.  It's a question of


judgment and whose judgment gets some weight.


In respect to that, what I'd really suddenly 

stirred up again here -- suppose we reach the second


question.  Suppose we reach the question of whether Alaska


did, in fact, do something that was pretty unreasonable,


and suppose I accept your argument that this was totally


unreasonable to say that they didn't have to put in this


special technology because of cost when Alaska didn't even


know what the cost was.  That's about like the fan. 


That's close to the ceiling fan.  That's what you're


arguing.


But then they've made another argument, and the


other argument is bothering me a lot more.  And that is

that the EPA has taken the position that you have to put


this extra special converter or whatever on number 17,


even if the consequence of that, because of the


interaction of the regs and their desires with number 2


and number 6, is more pollution.  Now, that does bother me


because it seems to me a State agency that's trying to get


a result that is less polluting is not acting arbitrarily


and capriciously except in rather unusual circumstances. 


Now, what do I do with that argument?  Does that


mean if I accept everything you say -- but that worries me


-- I should send it back for another determination of


whether this really is arbitrary and capricious?  What


should I do with that argument? 


MR. HUNGAR: 


Your Honor, the State agency did 

not justify its final permit decision on that rationale. 


The State is now arguing in its brief in this Court --


QUESTION:  That's a -- that's one point.  I've


got that point.  That's a kind of technical point in my


mind.  In other words, Alaska might really be polluting


more, but because of this sort of which paper they wrote


which in, we should just accept it.  Now, I got that


argument.  But is there any other?


MR. HUNGAR:  But it's more than that, Your


Honor.  The State agency expressly rejected that analysis,


refused to conduct that analysis, refused to base its

permit decision on that approach because it agreed it was


contrary to the requirements of the act.  That's at page


199 of the joint appendix.  The State agency said we are


-- we agree that's not an appropriate way in which to


analyze the BACT question.  That's consistent with EPA's


regulations, in answer to Justice Ginsburg --


QUESTION:  Yes.  I asked that question before.


MR. HUNGAR:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And -- and it is a question of


interpretation of the text of this statute.  I thought


that EPA was taking an anti-bubble approach, that it said,


you want to have generator 17.  We look at generator 17


and that's what the statute means by new source.  I


thought you were taking that view, but maybe you're not. 

MR. HUNGAR:  Your Honor, and -- and Chevron


itself actually discusses this, as you -- as you


suggested, but Chevron recognizes that EPA has -- has


construed the -- has applied the bubble concept or not


differently.  It -- the bubble concept applies at the


initial stage in determining whether a modification has to


go through prevention of significant deterioration


analysis.


But once -- once that -- once it is determined


that the total emissions are going to increase so that the


-- the modification does have to go through that analysis,

it is then -- the bubble concept no longer applies and the


analysis is done on an individual basis.  That's set forth


in EPA regulations promulgated through a notice and


comment rulemaking --


QUESTION:  That's what I thought.  So it isn't a


question of just loose, arbitrary, and capricious.  EPA is


taking the position that you look at generator 17 because


you've already made the determination that adding a


generator, modifying another one, is going to add to the


pollution. 


MR. HUNGAR:  As a matter of law, what EPA has


determined in -- in exercising in -- its rulemaking


authority is that the statute requires that once it's


determined that the BACT analysis must be made, it must be 

made on an individual unit basis, which is exactly what


the State ultimately did here.  The State conceded that is


correct as EPA's regulations state.  Only in its recent --


in this Court is the State now trying to back away from


that.


QUESTION:  Mr. Hungar, can I ask you, going back


to Justice Scalia's question earlier, is there a


significant difference in the record before us in this


proceeding than what the record would contain if they had


followed the route of applying a review of the Alaska


order through the State system?

 MR. HUNGAR:  We don't believe so, Your Honor. 


The EPA gave the State ample authority and Cominco ample


-- I mean, ample opportunity to place in the record


whatever materials they wanted --


QUESTION: That was my impression, the record


really was the same no matter which way you went.


MR. HUNGAR:  The Ninth Circuit, when this case


was in -- in the court of appeals, issued an order


directing the preparation of a record and asking the


parties what -- to -- to address whether the record was


complete or not.  Cominco and the State said the record


was sufficiently complete.  The only things that -- that


the State identified --


QUESTION: 


Well, did they -- did they put in the 

whole State record --


MR. HUNGAR:  I don't know that the whole --


QUESTION:  -- before the State agency?


MR. HUNGAR:  The -- the administrative fills a


box.  It contains internal ADEC communications, memoranda,


analysis, the Cominco application.  It's quite detailed.


QUESTION:  But in any -- I take your answer is


they can put in the entire State record to go before the


court of appeals.  Is that the answer? 


MR. HUNGAR:  Absolutely.  And -- and again,


under Overton Park and under this case's precedents, if

the EPA record is incomplete for some reason, the Court


can remand it to the agency for -- for further -- to


complete the record.  But that doesn't -- that doesn't


suggest that EPA doesn't have the authority to act.  It


merely suggests that EPA needs to exercise that authority


in a procedurally correct manner. 


QUESTION:  It goes back to a question that has


now dropped out of the case entirely it seems.  In the


Ninth Circuit, I think EPA was arguing this is not a final


order.  You have to wait until we go into court and the


court that we would go into is a district court where a


full record could be developed.


I take it you have now abandoned that argument


and seen the error of your ways, and now you accept that 

this is final.  What led you to change?


MR. HUNGAR:  Upon further consideration of this


Court's more recent precedents in the -- in the area of


finality, the -- the Whitman case and Bennett against


Spear and given the particular circumstances of this case


where the agency -- where EPA was not simply issuing an


order to someone saying you're violating preexisting


requirements of the act, but was in fact changing the


status quo and stating that a -- a permit that had been


issued by the State that allowed construction could not


take effect, in those circumstances we -- we concluded

that this Court's precedents regarding final orders are


satisfied and that this is indeed a final order because it


imposes legal obligations, new legal obligations, on


Cominco.


QUESTION:  Mr. Hungar, you -- you've just told


us that the reviewing court can have the full State record


before it when it makes its determination.  What about EPA


when it makes its determination, when it issues its order? 


What -- what does it have in front of it?  It doesn't have


to have anything, does it?


MR. HUNGAR:  Well, it has to have evidence


sufficient to make a finding that the State is not


complying with the requirements of the act, Your Honor.


QUESTION: 


Well, but it doesn't -- it doesn't 

have to do that on the basis of the record presented to


the agency, does it?


MR. HUNGAR:  Well, it's difficult --


QUESTION:  Did it in this case?  Is that -- is


that what it did?  Did it review the agency record here?


MR. HUNGAR:  Well, in this case it's -- although


they had extensive record materials before them, the --


the flaw in the State's decision making is apparent on the


face of the State's own decision.  As I said before, pages


207 and 208 of the joint appendix revealed that the State


admits it doesn't have factual support for what it views

as the foremost consideration justifying its decision. 


But -- but if EPA issued -- issued an order


under this act without -- without the record materials in


front of it, and -- and had -- therefore, had no basis for


issuing an order, a court of appeals could set it aside.


QUESTION:  Can you tell me?  I want to be very


clear on what I didn't hear in answer to my question. 


What I was concerned about -- and I understand your legal


arguments, but I was concerned about their claim.  If you


win this case, what it means is more expensive technology


goes onto number 17.  They run number 17 less.  They run 2


and 6 more, and the net result in Alaska is more


pollution.  Now, you haven't said -- I haven't heard you


say, no, that's wrong. 


What you have said is we shouldn't 

reach it.  There -- there -- they didn't make the claim in


the right place with the right words.  And I want to give


you a chance to say, no, that's wrong, if it is wrong.


MR. HUNGAR:  I think it is wrong, Your Honor. 


It is -- it is theoretically possible that if they


installed this expensive generator and spent millions of


dollars on it and never once turned it on and they ran all


of their other -- other generators 100 percent of the time


without ever stopping them, it is theoretically possible


that there could be slightly more pollution.  However,


that is highly implausible, number one, and number two,

there is no finding by the State that that is in fact what


would happen.  This is merely argument in their appellate


briefs.


And what is clear on the record is that under --


if the State had adopted SCR as BACT, the total cap on


emissions allowable by this facility would be hundreds of


tons lower than the cap that was imposed by the State. 


That's undisputed and perfectly clear that SCR would


result in a total emissions cap far lower than the one


that the State wanted to impose.  And so the State's


argument, unsupported by any findings, is that -- is the


sheer speculation that Cominco would spend millions of


dollars to install a generator that it would never use. 


We submit that's highly improbable.


QUESTION:  So, do I -- I understand you to say


that they would be forced -- I take it you're --


implicitly you're saying they'd be forced to use this


generator because the use of this generator would be the


only way that they, in fact, could comply with the cap?


MR. HUNGAR:  No, Your Honor.  If -- if they


installed this generator and if -- if selective catalytic


reduction were deemed to be required, the total -- there's


a total emissions cap of 3,878 tons in the State's permit.


QUESTION:  For --


MR. HUNGAR:  For all seven generators.

 QUESTION:  -- for this -- all seven.  Okay.


MR. HUNGAR:  And if -- and that includes MG-17


under -- using the Low NOx.  Under Low NOx, MG-17 -- its


output is 531 tons if it's used throughout the year, 531


tons.  Under SCR it would output -- put out only a tenth


of that at full capacity.  So the total cap under BACT


would be hundreds of tons lower, slightly less than 3,500


tons. 


QUESTION:  The cap -- the cap wouldn't be lower.


The total emissions would be lower.  The cap would --


MR. HUNGAR:  The -- the total emissions cap


would be lower.  The -- the company is free to -- to


choose how to -- how to meet the cap, how to -- which


machines to operate at what times, as long as it doesn't 

exceed that cap.  But the cap is determined by adding to


the preexisting cap total for the other six generators the


additional amount that is deemed permissible to --


QUESTION:  So -- so the answer is it would


probably -- most probably use the new generator.


MR. HUNGAR:  Absolutely. 


QUESTION:  Theoretically it wouldn't have to.


MR. HUNGAR:  Correct.


Your Honor, we -- Your Honors, we submit that


Congress clearly intended EPA to exercise meaningful


enforcement authority in the prevention of significant

in that very context EPA to issue the types of orders at

court of appeals be affirmed.

Mr. Franklin, you have 3 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. FRANKLIN:  Thank you, Your Honor. 


Responding to Justice O'Connor's colloquy with


counsel as to whether EPA could simply remand the case and


then there might be a back and forth that could take --


QUESTION:  I didn't ask if it was -- could


remand it. 


I asked whether it would be open to the State 

to go through the drill that EPA said it didn't do before


and that the State said it didn't have the information to


enable it to do.


MR. FRANKLIN:  And -- and that is precisely the


problem in our view because EPA, if the Court upholds its


authority in this case, can act by fiat at any time it


wants on the basis of any information that it deems


relevant, even after a permit has gone through the entire


State process, even after it has become final under State


law, and even after the source may have invested millions


of dollars in the technology.  Then EPA could step in.

 What we are saying here -- and, Justice Breyer,


we don't care which court --


QUESTION:  Well, there are courts -- there are


courts with doctrines that would not allow such


inequitable conduct.  I mean, you brought up it could be


years and years later; anytime, 17 years later, EPA could


wake up.  The answer to that was that no court would give


an ear to EPA having just slept on --


MR. FRANKLIN:  With respect --


QUESTION:  -- on the situation.


MR. FRANKLIN:  With respect, Your Honor, EPA's


enforcement authority in this case is mandatory.  Under


section 167, they shall take appropriate measures to stop


construction. 


Therefore, if the Court upholds their 

authority in this case, they have to exercise it at any


point.


And, Justice Breyer, we don't care which court


conducts the review.  We care that a court does and not


EPA acting at any time by fiat according to any


information that it may have at -- at -- on the basis of


what it thinks may or may not be reasonable or


unreasonable.


The point of the matter is, is that the State


procedures are fully adequate to address any concerns that


EPA has raised here, and its injecting itself into the

process, disrupting the orderly process -- and, Justice


Stevens, the record would be different and it would be


different because Alaska law allows, when a party has


properly objected, for a de novo administrative hearing,


at which the agency is allowed to present additional


evidence, witnesses, and further refine and clarify its


decision.


If there was any legitimate concern as to


whether the State's decision wasn't clear, as it should


have been, that is the manner in which it should have been


resolved, through the administrative process.  And we are


confident that it would have been resolved there, Justice


O'Connor.  That's where the back and forth would have


occurred, not in the manner of here where we're now 4 

years later and we still don't have a decision as to what


technology this company can use. 


And finally, Your Honors, the -- the point of


the matter is there's no legitimate dispute here that the


result of Alaska's decision is cleaner air and that cannot


be unreasonable. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Franklin.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 10:56 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
