CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 02-575, Nike, Inc. versus Marc Kasky.


Mr. Tribe.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. TRIBE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


In the mid-1990s there was, of course, an


intense debate on the pros and cons of globalization, and


of the impact of companies like Nike on workers in the


Third World, where Nike contracted out much of its


production to some 900 factories in 51 countries with over


600,000 employees.


Now, the critics, many from pro-labor groups,


denounced Nike as the chief exemplar of the evils of


globalization, arguing that Nike was simply shifting


production to places where it could exploit the workforce


and act in ways that were illegal and immoral, and the


critics took much of their documentation from the media.


Of course, Nike disagreed, using the same media


venues as the critics had used to document what it thought


were the connections between its presence and activities


in countries like South Korea and Vietnam and the

development of technological expertise in those countries,


as well as the expansion of job opportunities there, and


also arguing that it had put in place significant


safeguards against abuse.


Products were mentioned only in response to


people who said, well, look, this product is made in


such-and-such country and it's exploitative, and Nike


would have a press release, or it -- sometimes it would be


an op ed saying no, you've got the wrong country, this


product is made in such-and-such other place.  These were


letters to the editor, pamphlets.  It was on the Internet,


correspondence.


As you might expect, the critics talked back. 


There was a lively political dialogue about the realities


of the Third World and Nike's role in it, a little hard to 

separate the two, when, as the dissenter below, one of the


dissenters below said Nike had become the poster child for


the evils, supposedly, of globalization, so not


surprisingly the debate was inconclusive.


The surprise came when the story took an unusual


turn, unusual at least in our system of Government.  One


of the Nike critics, Marc Kasky, asked the California


courts to endorse his view and to hold that the statements


that Nike was putting out were false or were misleading. 


He invoked California's unfair competition law and the

false advertising law that it included, which gives anyone


standing, so Mr. Kasky certainly qualified, to sue another


person or corporation, here Nike and its officers, for


making any statement in a newspaper or other publication


such, it goes on to say, or any advertising device,


including over the Internet, concerning any circumstance


or matter of fact connected with anything the speaker


intends to sell if the statement is untrue or misleading,


and the California Supreme Court has read that to cover


anything that might mislead the public.


The plaintiff, empowered to sue by the Business


and Professions Code 17204 on behalf of, quote, the


general public, unquote, did not, under California


decisional law, have to allege or prove falsity -- it


could be an omission that made something misleading -- he 

didn't have to allege or prove reliance by or injury to


anyone, or any particular level of fault.  An inadvertent


omission will suffice under the Day decision.


QUESTION:  Well, certainly some omissions, even


though not technically false, could be false in their --


in what they convey.


MR. TRIBE:  Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice, and,


in fact, one of the suggestions made by the California


Supreme Court for how a company could engage in this


debate without any problem is simply omit all the facts


5

that might connect it to the situation, and that kind of


omission, it would be certainly alleged, would be


misleading, so the only solution that Nike is given is,


talk in vague generalities.


I don't deny, Mr. Chief Justice, that there can


be cases and there can even be fraud cases, though it's


hard, given the pleading requirements of the fraud tort,


that do rest on omissions, but I'm just suggesting how --


how capacious -- how capacious this is.


The relief that is available and was requested


by Mr. Kasky includes, and I don't think we should forget


the importance of this, an adjudication that the defendant


is guilty of an unlawful business practice, and in Nike's


case that would be no small matter.  I mean, it would be


said you're guilty of exploiting women and children in the 

Third World, guilty as charged, and not being honest about


it, a scarlet letter more damning than the label of


National Labor Relations Act violator that this Court a


year ago in B&K versus NLRB treated as so grave a blot on


the reputation of a company that it mustn't be imposed for


activity within the First Amendment zone without giving


the defendant significant leeway.


Secondly, there is available a court-ordered


injunction both prohibitory and mandatory in one case


involving the Alta-Dena Dairy in California under this

statute.  The Consumers Union of the United States brought


the suit as a Private Attorney General against a dairy


that had been putting out its products of raw milk saying


they were just as nutritious and healthy as pasteurized


milk, and the remedy was a 10-year mandate of corrective


speech, as it were, corrective education.


QUESTION:  To -- to make them realize that raw


milk was not as good as pasteurized milk?


MR. TRIBE:  Well, I guess to make some people --


this -- that's what the statute says, that some people


might have been misled.  Needless to say, the kind of show


trial that would be involved in this case is a lot more


expensive than that one.


That case, by the way, took 54 days to try,


44 witnesses, there were 40,000 pages of exhibits, at the 

end a restitutionary order of $100,000 was given, and in


that case the Attorney General joined the suit, he


collected the restitution --


QUESTION:  Do -- do we have a case in which we


say that a -- a civil scheme -- I -- I suppose there are


some criminal remedies here, but let's just think about


this as a civil scheme, that a civil scheme of this type


is so burdensome, so extensive that it chills speech and


is therefore invalid?  I -- I --


MR. TRIBE:  Well, I suppose Bantam Books --

 QUESTION:  We -- we have plenty of cases that


the criminal laws are either vague or overly broad and


that they chill speech.  What about in the civil context?


MR. TRIBE:  I think Bantam Books comes to mind.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. TRIBE:  And there it was less than this, it


was simply you were on a list of books.  It seems to me


that the Court in the National Labor Relations Act context


itself took the position in B&K that chilling effect was


important, and what about defamation?


I mean, the central meaning of New York Times v.


Sullivan and Gertz and, you know, and Time v. Hill is that


even when you have someone who is harmed, reputational


harm, concrete harm, so that the regulation of speech is


simply ancillary to vindicating tangible interest, even 

there the chilling effect is so great that even though


there's no positive value in false statements you have to


put a burden -- it's a matter of public interest.


QUESTION:  You would have to say that this


complaint and the adjudicatory system it wished to invoke


chills speech, therefore the complaint must be dismissed. 


I mean, is that the remedy you're --


MR. TRIBE:  Well, essentially that's right,


that --


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Tribe, this --

 MR. TRIBE:  -- this trial itself is


illegitimate.


QUESTION:  -- this -- but this Court has said


that even though commercial speech concerns a public


issue, it's still commercial speech --


MR. TRIBE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- and we've applied a different test


to commercial speech.


MR. TRIBE:  Yes, Justice O'Connor.


QUESTION:  We said that in Central Hudson, we


said that in Bolger.


MR. TRIBE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  How do you distinguish those?


MR. TRIBE:  Well, let me say two things, Justice


O'Connor. 


First of all the Court has never said that the 

Constitution and its First Amendment are wholly invisible


to commercial speech, that is, if you're going after


commercial harms, then there's a lower standard for


commercial speech, the four-part Central Hudson test. 


Discovery Network made clear that if you're coming at it


from a different angle, commercial speech is just as good


as anything else.


R.A.V., I think, dispelled the notion that the


Constitution has these blind spots and, indeed, the whole


approach of the Court below and of Mr. Kasky was, we don't

even have to deal with your First Amendment arguments --


QUESTION:  Well, do you -- you take the view


that --


MR. TRIBE:  -- because it's misleading


commercial speech.


QUESTION:  -- none of the things alleged in the


complaint meet the commercial speech test set out in


Central Hudson?


MR. TRIBE:  Actually, we --


QUESTION:  Not one of them?


MR. TRIBE:  That's right, Justice O'Connor, we


don't think any of them do, but even if they did, this


scheme --


QUESTION:  What part do they take?


MR. TRIBE: 


Well, actually, they don't come 

close in general, and I think the best way to illustrate


that is to look not at the various verbal formulas that


have been used by this Court in terms of whether it's


advertising format, whether it's -- in one case I think


Justice Stevens talked about something being


transaction-driven, but look at the example that this


court gave in Central Hudson when it was addressing the


question, when we allow greater regulation of speech that


is closely connected with the Government's power to


regulate commercial transactions we're not in any way

limiting your ability directly to comment.


The example that was given was the pamphlet from


the Con Ed case.  That was an example of direct comment,


and you look at the pamphlet which was in the joint


appendix in -- in that case, and it turns out the pamphlet


is a detailed set of statements about why nuclear power is


safer, better, cheaper, better for our independence, and


you know what, Con Ed had a nuclear power plant, Indian


Point, they clearly had an economic interest in promoting


that view, and that's the closest any of these statements


by Nike come --


QUESTION:  No, no, but there's another -- think


in your mind of two documents.  Document 1 is the letter


that Nike sent to the -- the athletic managers.


MR. TRIBE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And then put that side by side with


the document in the Bolger case, and --


MR. TRIBE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- that's the -- the discussion of


venereal disease.


MR. TRIBE:  Right.


QUESTION:  Now, what -- now, I -- you have to


write an opinion, let's say --


MR. TRIBE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- that says the difference between

these is?


MR. TRIBE:  Is that the letter to the university


presidents and to the athletic departments of these


universities, which is Exhibit R at page 190 of the


lodging, is an extended argument about why the claims


against Nike are unfounded.  It is not in any of its -- it


doesn't have Air Jordans on it --


QUESTION:  And then the letter about the --


MR. TRIBE:  -- the way Trojan condoms were --


condoms were at the end of that --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. TRIBE:  -- submission, and in the Bolger


case again, I think if I were writing such an opinion I


would say, in Bolger we again reiterated the formula that


had been used in Central Hudson and gave as an example of 

something that was not commercial speech the promotional


pamphlet.  That -- that was sent to some -- you know who


it was sent to?  It was sent only to the customers of


Con Ed.  It was an insert in the bills, so there's no


doubt that that was speech that had as its audience only


those people who purchased from Con Ed, whereas in this


case, these guys are not direct purchasers, and moreover,


and I think decisively, that's the closest that anything


in this case comes to commercial speech.


QUESTION:  And as long as we're writing

distinctions --


MR. TRIBE:  Yes.  I think --


QUESTION:  -- how do I write this distinction?


MR. TRIBE:  Well --


QUESTION:  The FTC -- sorry, if you're not


finished.


MR. TRIBE:  I'm sorry.  I was only going to add


that Mr. Kasky, even though he has standing to do a great


deal --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. TRIBE:  -- does not have standing to sue on


behalf of the athletic directors, it turns out, because


the California courts in the Rosenbluth case in 2002 said


that this is a law where you're supposed to represent the


public, not sophisticated organizations, because they 

might have their own interests, so to the closest this


case comes --


QUESTION:  Is it supposed to be like the


Attorney General, Mr. Tribe --


QUESTION:  But Mr. Tribe, as I understand it --


MR. TRIBE:  I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  This sets up a Private Attorney


General so this -- Mr. Kasky is representing the public,


but you've been talking about the great breadth of this


statute, and I understand all that, but where -- at just

the threshold, the cases were thrown out in the lower


courts because they said there's no circumstances, there's


nothing you can narrow this complaint down to, not one


piece of literature.


MR. TRIBE:  Yes, it's --


QUESTION:  Nothing, not one, and the -- the


problem with this case is that it comes to us at such a


preliminary stage.  There's been nothing like a trial,


there's been no narrowing of anything, so am I right in


thinking that to prevail you would have to show that none


of these, that there's not one that would survive past a


motion to dismiss?


MR. TRIBE:  No, Justice Ginsburg, I think that's


not right, because what the court of appeals said in this


case -- and its opinion I think merits reading.  It's at


least as good as the dissents in the California Supreme


Court.


What it said was, not that we can't pick and


choose somewhere in this pile of scattered material, as it


described it, something that under a different scheme


might be permissible.  What we hold is impermissible is


making the courts pawns in a public debate and having what


amounts to -- they didn't use the phrase, show trial, but


essentially they were saying a trial in which you, in


effect, put on trial such a large and massive question and

hopeless mix of fact and opinion as the impact on the


Third World of this large company.


Now --


QUESTION:  What's -- what is your best reason


for saying this is a show trial?  In other words, you want


a new category, and I had thought your best reason was,


and -- and I want to know whether you agree with me or


whether there's something better --


MR. TRIBE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  I thought your best reason was that


there is no, no need for any allegation and in fact no


allegation that anyone among the plaintiffs or among


the -- the class on behalf of which they sue, the public,


was injured in any demonstrable way.  Is that the point?


MR. TRIBE:  That --


QUESTION:  Is that what the show trial thing --


MR. TRIBE:  That's probably the single strongest


point, and let me connect it with a broader theme, because


in Discovery Network, when this Court talked about the


fact that commercial speech is a category that's relevant


when you're going after commercial harm, in a sense to


protect consumers from fraud of one kind or another, in


the reputation area it is again not speech alone you're


going after.  You're trying to vindicate certain interests


in not being harmed.  You have to have someone whose

reputation is harmed.


QUESTION:  Suppose a California regulatory


agency signed its name as the plaintiff to this -- to this


complaint.


MR. TRIBE:  Well, I think simply adding a name


wouldn't necessarily solve the problem.  The Attorney


General of California put his arm around the Consumer's


Union in the Alta-Dena case, but in this case you need


a --


QUESTION:  No, no, but -- but we have -- we have


some cases, like the Egg Commission case and so forth --


MR. TRIBE:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- where the FTC or the FDA --


MR. TRIBE:  Right.


QUESTION: 


-- has I, think, a certain standing. 

It doesn't have to show injury to itself.


MR. TRIBE:  That's right, but it does have to


show, the statutes are written to require it to show that


there is an area of legitimate regulatory concern. 


Consumers might be fooled into believing, by the Egg


Nutrition Council, that cholesterol is good for your


heart, and they're trying to protect them.


QUESTION:  Well, you know what we're -- you know


what we're going to hear next, that the Californians are


very interested in this.

 MR. TRIBE:  Well, first of all, if they're very


interested they can do a number of things.  They can pass


something like -- Congress passed the Dolphin Protection


Act saying, if you really care about dolphins, then


whenever a can of tuna is sold, it can't use the phrase,


dolphin-friendly, unless certain things are met. 


California did this with ozone at one point and then it


repealed the ozone-friendly law.


But giving a company an idea of what it has to


disclose and what the issues are going to be is very


different from saying, well, here we are, we're sitting


here and waiting until somebody --


QUESTION:  And again -- and again, your best


case for this is Bantam Books, or --


MR. TRIBE: 


Well, I -- no, I think the 

defamation line of cases is even better, because at a


minimum they show that you have to have someone who's


harmed, and you have to have deliberate or reckless


falsehood.  Imagine a law --


QUESTION:  Why isn't -- why isn't it -- going


back to Justice Kennedy's question, why shouldn't it be


sufficient to say that when it is the State rather than


any citizen, self-selected, who brings this suit, we would


at least depend upon some State --


MR. TRIBE:  Yes.

don't think there's enough risk of improper chilling?


The distinction is, when anybody can walk in --


MR. TRIBE:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- there's no accountability.  Why


isn't that the line to draw?


MR. TRIBE:  Well, it seems to me, Justice


Souter, that's a line enough to reverse this decision, but


let me just imagine --


QUESTION:  Why, when it wasn't raised below? 


One of the problems is, if you were going to take out this


Private Attorney General, you would be saying this statute 

is unconstitutional, pro tonto.  That wasn't argued below. 


It didn't surface 'til this Court.


MR. TRIBE:  It was.  It was, Justice Ginsburg. 


On pages 12 to 14 of our reply brief we detailed the


sequence, and if you look back at the briefs in the


California Supreme Court the arguments, all of the First


Amendment arguments were made, but they didn't get to


first base in that court because it said, hey, misleading


commercial speech gets no protection.


QUESTION:  Where was the notice --

 MR. TRIBE:  I was going to give an example --


QUESTION:  Where was the notice to the


California Attorney General that the statute was being,


the constitutionality of that statute was being attacked


with regard to the Private Attorney General here?


MR. TRIBE:  It was only as applied, Justice


Ginsburg.  That is, it does not suggest -- these laws have


been on the books since the '30s, and we're not suggesting


that they have to be scrapped.  It's the innovative --


QUESTION:  I thought that -- that Justice


Souter's question to you was --


MR. TRIBE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- isn't what infects these laws,


that -- that you are allowing a champion --


MR. TRIBE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- who has no public accountability,


and it doesn't -- I don't see how that comes to be an


as-applied challenge.


MR. TRIBE:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's an


as-applied challenge, because these laws, if applied only


in cases where harm is alleged and where a court says, to


solve the problem we're going to require that it be


proved, that is, it would be the California courts that


would have to redesign the system to fix it, wouldn't be


unconstitutional.

 I wanted to get --


QUESTION:  I thought that the question that was


put to you is, isn't this statute infirm in every instance


where you have a Private Attorney General?


MR. TRIBE:  Who alleges no harm, and --


QUESTION:  Well, that's what the statute says.


MR. TRIBE:  Well, I think it has to be -- I -- I


think it probably is, but I think that the reason that


it's not cured, although I agree very much with the


position the Solicitor General takes that that's the


deepest disease, even if it's taken out, imagine a law


that said, if you utter a defamatory statement that is


knowingly false, we're going to impose a gag order.  Even


if the Attorney General administered it, you'd need to


have a possible victim.


I mean, if someone says bad things about William


Shakespeare, and the State of California decides that it


is going to have a general, floating power to correct


speech not connected with the regulatory responsibilities


of any agency like the FTC or the -- or the SEC, but a


free-floating power to correct speech, we think that would


be constitutionally infirm, but in this case, in any


event, it doesn't come close to commercial speech.


QUESTION:  Is your position that, as I


understand it, that even if this action were brought by

a -- a public agency it would still be impermissible?


MR. TRIBE:  In -- in this forum, where the


public agency didn't need to allege, was not administering


a regulatory program to protect people, I -- I think --


QUESTION:  Would you say the same thing if, that


it would be also impermissible for a public agency to


investigate to determine whether or not the statements


were true or false?


MR. TRIBE:  To have an investigation, no.  I


think that the freedom of speech includes the freedom to


have public as well as private debate.  That's what this


is about.


QUESTION:  So that you -- you would agree a


public agency could investigate the charges here to


determine whether they are true or false. 


Could a -- in a 

private action, could a private party engage in discovery


to find out whether they were true or false?


MR. TRIBE:  Well, of course, in this case


discovery is the name of the game, it would become a


massive thing.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. TRIBE:  I think that if we are right that


this action dies aborning, if it's like the statute in


Cox v. Cohn itself, where it was simply an impermissible


thing, and where no trial would cure the problem, then you

don't get to that difficulty, but if it's a legitimate


trial, if the law were redesigned, very broad discovery


might be permissible.


I'm a little worried about reserving some time,


but I -- I don't want to leave you in mid-air --


QUESTION:  You -- You'd better reserve now, or


you won't have any to reserve.

Justice. 	 Thank you.


QUESTION:  Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


GENERAL OLSON: 


Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:


California has transferred its governmental


authority to regulate marketplace communications to anyone


and everyone who possesses the price of the filing fee. 


Unelected, unaccountable private enforcers, uninhibited by


established notions of concrete harm or public duty, have


the power to advance their own agendas or personal


ideological battles by launching complex, burdensome, and


expensive litigation.  The in terrorem effect and


potential for abuse is difficult to overstate.

 This case can and should, we submit, be


evaluated according to the means used to regulate speech


in California, not the content of that speech.  The Court


and several of the Justices on this Court have explicitly


and repeatedly acknowledged that it is exceedingly


difficult, if not impossible, to draw bright lines that


segregate marketplace speech according to its content into


two separate, mutually exclusive hemispheres, commercial


and not commercial.  These issues arise in an infinite


array of contexts.  The speakers are imaginative and


creative, and rigid, permanent, constitutional


categorization is neither advisable nor necessary.


If the commercial-noncommercial dichotomy is


employed in this case, and in others, either alternative


has undesirable consequences. 


Valuable marketplace 

speech -- and this Court has repeatedly stressed that


speech in the marketplace of commerce is valuable.  It's


valuable to consumers, but either it becomes


noncommercial, making it difficult for Government to


regulate to protect the integrity of the marketplace, or


it then is characterized as commercial, which can open the


day -- open the way to regimes such as California's, where


anyone with a whim or a grievance and a filing fee can


become a Government-licensed censor.


QUESTION:  General Olson, do you think that

Congress would be able to authorize a scheme of Private


Attorney General, for instance, to enforce SEC


regulations?


GENERAL OLSON:  Yes, Justice O'Connor, with


respect to concrete harm in connection with specific


individuals.  First place, Article III would require that,


that there actually be concrete harm, an individual


participating in a transaction.  This Court has held with


respect to 10(b)(5) -- Rule 10(b)(5), for example, that


there must be a buyer or seller of security.


QUESTION:  What will happen is, they'll find in


5 minutes somebody who bought some Nike shoes who feels


the same way, you know, so you'll just have this exact


suit with a different plaintiff, possibly, or maybe


Mr. Kasky once bought some, for all I know, and -- and so 

that isn't really going to help, is it?


GENERAL OLSON:  Yes, it is, Justice Breyer.  It


will limit -- first of all it will limit the regulation of


marketplace speech to the traditional patterns and the


regimes that have existed --


QUESTION:  Okay, so in your view, if Mr. Kasky


has bought some shoes and is prepared to say, you know, if


I hadn't believed their ad and hadn't been deceived, I


never would have bought them --


GENERAL OLSON:  Yes.

 QUESTION:  -- we can go right ahead with this


suit?


GENERAL OLSON:  If -- well, if -- there are


other problems with the California statute in terms of its


breadth and its vagueness and things of that nature, but


the principal problem that we're talking about here, which


avoids the problem of saying that everything is either


commercial or noncommercial, is that traditionally, for


hundreds of years, the -- the private individual who has


suffered that injury has been able to bring an action.


QUESTION:  And I -- I accept that.  I'm -- you


pointed to evils of both the other positions, but the


problem that I'm having with the third set of evils, which


I think Justice O'Connor expressed --


QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- is, imagine an ad -- it's really


an ad, and it says, our refrigerators are ozone-friendly. 


The penguins love them, all right.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  And now it turns out they have the


worst chemical in there anybody's ever heard of.  It's


going to destroy the ozone layer.  They're lying through


their teeth, all right.


Now, that ad, I take it either the FTC or a


private person could proceed against.  I would think so.

 GENERAL OLSON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  If the answer's yes, then we have the


problem, which I was going to ask Mr. Tribe, and I -- I


need thinking on this, how do you draw a line?  How do you


draw a line between, this commercial is not a commercial,


it's a letter sent to the marketing directors -- I think


that's their best one -- and my penguin-friendly ozone


commercial?  How do we draw that line legally, and you're


doing it a third way, but how do we stop the private AG,


Congress having the right to give the private AG the power


to go after my penguins?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, in the first place,


there -- there is the Article III requirement of actual,


concrete harm suffered by an individual.  There are


hundreds of years of common law tradition with respect to 

allowing an individual who is the -- who has received in


some way a material misrepresentation of fact, which your


question presupposes, that -- that causes justifiable


reliance in the marketplace and actual harm as a result of


that conduct.


Now, with respect to whether that individual,


who can then recover the damage actually suffered, can go


on and then seek some sort of institutional injunctive or


equitable relief, the courts over the years, over hundreds


of years have developed circumstances under which the

remedy in the injunctive suit, or in the equitable action,


has to be tailored to the actual harm suffered by the


individual.


QUESTION:  General Olson, you're saying that


schemes other than the one California adopted would


probably make much more sense and be more valuable for


producing speech, but what -- what principle is it that


you rely on to say that California's scheme is bad, just


because there might be others that would be much more


favorable to the market of speech?


GENERAL OLSON:  Our principle, Chief Justice


Rehnquist, is that the governmental power to regulate


speech in the marketplace, which is constrained by the


First Amendment, has been transferred to private citizens


without the normal constraints that -- that --

QUESTION:  Well, what is your best authority so


far as a case from our Court for that proposition?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, one of the --


QUESTION:  Can you answer the question?


GENERAL OLSON:  The -- well, I think that I have


to start with the Gertz case, in which the -- the Supreme


Court said in the context of a libel suit there is a


governmental interest in protecting individuals from


actual injury suffered, but the Court went on in Gertz to


say, but that's the limit of the --

 QUESTION:  But when you can pair one share of


stock, go into court and say, I -- I want a class action,


I'm going to pursue this securities suit, it's -- it's --


it goes back to the question Justice Breyer asked.  I buy


one pair of Nike shoes, I come and say, okay, I'm a


customer and I want to sue on behalf of all customers


similarly situated.  It seems to me that your solution, if


it allows room for that, doesn't really get to the


problem.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, we believe it does,


Justice Ginsburg.  Those kind of suits, persons who bought


one share who were misled in the marketplace, or one pair


of shoes who had received misleading information, has been


actually suffered, eliminates the idea that governmental


power is being transferred to people in gross, that the 

license to be Government, to regulate speech, is just


turned loose to everyone.  These are traditional notions


of who gets into court and under what circumstances.


Act --


QUESTION:  General Olson, let -- let me just ask


you the procedural question, because I found that your


argument was very well laid out, but I did not see that


that position was taken, and my major concern was that the


California official who should speak to this question is


not before us, wasn't in this case as far as I know, the

Attorney General of California.


GENERAL OLSON:  Let me answer it this way.  This


Court has said in Yee versus Escondido that if the legal


argument is embraced within the question actually properly


raised, the litigants can make that argument.  It also


discussed that same issue in the Lebron case.  This --


QUESTION:  Aren't you notified if there's a --


if there's a question of the constitutionality of a


statute passed by Congress so that you will have the


opportunity to come in and tell the Court what your view


is?


GENERAL OLSON:  That is a requirement, and it's


addressed in the appendix in -- in the reply brief and in


the appendix to the reply brief filed on behalf of -- of


Nike, but it's also important to recognize that this 

specific point is raised in the -- in the cert petition


itself.  On pages 27 and 28 Nike said, made the point,


other features of the California liability scream --


scheme aggravate the chilling effect, and then goes on to


elaborate on that point by saying, it invests every single


California resident with the power of a Private Attorney


General, so --


QUESTION:  But that doesn't show that it was


raised and decided below.


GENERAL OLSON:  That's -- that's correct,

Justice Ginsburg, but -- and -- and Mr. Tribe says that it


was raised to a certain extent below.  I can't answer that


question.  I can say it was embraced within the question


presented, it was raised in the cert petition, it is a --


it is an antecedent question for deciding the First


Amendment issue in this case, and it is -- it is an issue


that California courts have been dealing with for many


years.


For many, many years the California courts have


talked about and considered whether this any person


provision is proper.  Let me -- I -- I've --


QUESTION:  Thank you, General Olson.


GENERAL OLSON:  Thank you.


QUESTION:  Mr. Hoeber, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. HOEBER 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. HOEBER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may


it please the Court:


I'm going to start with the jurisdictional


issues, and the first point, and Mr. Kasky never bought


any Nikes.  He never bought any.  I suppose now he never


will.  He didn't buy any Nikes, he had no standing under


Article III.  As the plaintiff in this case there was no


case or controversy.  If it had been brought in Federal


court it would have been dismissed.

 Now, in these circumstances this Court says --


it said in ASARCO the court can still take jurisdiction,


but in ASARCO, the State court judgment there established


liability and left only questions of what the type of


remedy might be.


Here, the State court decision by the California


Supreme Court effectively overruled Nike's demurrer and


remanded the case for litigation and trial.  That is not


close to ASARCO.  Nike would have to admit that the


statements were false to get anywhere near the judgment in


ASARCO, so the first point on ASARCO is, it doesn't even


apply.


The Court would have to extend ASARCO to even


consider the next question, which would be, if the Court


did that, whether Nike, which, of course has the burden of 

proof, has established that because of this decision it


will suffer or has suffered an Article III injury.


QUESTION:  ASARCO, where it's claimed is, it's


under the fourth exception listed in ASARCO.


MR. HOEBER:  No, that's -- excuse me, Justice


Breyer.  That's -- that's Cox.


QUESTION:  Oh, Cox.  It's under the fourth Cox,


I'm sorry.


MR. HOEBER:  Which I will get to in just --

 MR. HOEBER:  But Nike has the burden under


ASARCO to show that it -- if the Court gets to it, that it


has Article III standing, and I'll direct the Court's


attention to the reply brief, page 6, and the only -- only


factor that Nike points to to show that it has Article III


standing is, and I quote, the certain injury Nike


confronts from having to defend its speech in this


litigation, and I will say that I do not believe that the


process of litigation counts, or qualifies, or is


sufficient to establish Article III standing.  If it


were --


QUESTION:  You can't think of any civil scheme


which is, on its face, so burdensome that it chills


speech?  You can't think of anything?


MR. HOEBER: 


The -- the scheme -- the scheme 

would be, Your Honor, perhaps -- no doubt, but the process


of litigation.  What I'm thinking of is in ASARCO, if the


process of litigation itself were enough to establish


Article III standing, then the lessees would have had


standing from the moment they put it in the case --


QUESTION:  Well, but here the argument is, the


process of litigation is what causes the substantive


injury --


MR. HOEBER:  Well, I think that -- that --


QUESTION:  -- to a First Amendment right, which

MR. HOEBER:  The -- but -- but going through the


process of litigation, if it were a criminal case, the


arrest and the prosecution and the ultimate, possible


conviction, but simply going through the litigation does


not distinguish --


QUESTION:  Well, that's the question on the


merits.  They say it does.


MR. HOEBER:  The question on the merits being


the chilling effect of the California scheme --


QUESTION:  Imagine it was The New York Times --


MR. HOEBER:  -- not the -- not the litigation


its -- not the process of litigation itself.


QUESTION: 


Well, suppose it was, the defendant 

was the New York Times.  Suppose it was a newspaper, I


mean, you know, and somebody's trying to stop them from


printing an article, couldn't they get here under --


under similar circumstances?


MR. HOEBER:  Under ASARCO.


QUESTION:  Yes, I mean --


MR. HOEBER:  Under --


QUESTION:  I don't know if literally it's


ASARCO, but what we have is a -- is a plausible claim that


speech of an important political nature is being stopped.

Now, that's their claim.  Now, I -- I would have thought


there's a way to get the case here, and -- and why -- I


mean --


MR. HOEBER:  Well -- well, what I'm saying is,


that may -- that may well be true, and it may well be true


that -- that a scheme can -- can stifle speech and


establish harm, but the -- the simple process of


litigation, responding to discovery and going through the


litigation is not what is stifling the speech.  It's --


QUESTION:  Well, that's one of the issues in the


case.


MR. HOEBER:  Well, all right, then I'll move to


my second jurisdictional point, because I want to make


sure it comes out, and this is under Cox, and that is,


there is no final judgment because this is a -- in a 

traditional sense because this is the overruling of a


demurrer, but the fourth exception set forth in Cox


provides a way that this Court can hear a case in this


circumstance, but one of the conditions, necessary


conditions is that were this Court to hear the case and


reverse, that would put an end to the -- to the -- to the


litigation, at least to the relevant cause of action.


Here, because it's a -- it's a demurrer, and the


question is the sufficiency of the complaint against the


demurrer, Nike has to show that plaintiff could not amend

QUESTION:  Well --


QUESTION:  I don't see that --

of appeals said in California.  I would think that's

MR. HOEBER:  What the court of appeals said in


California was that we could not amend the complaint, or


the facts in the -- in the complaint could not be amended


to allege noncommercial speech, noncommercial speech, and


that's true.


We don't claim that we would allege


noncommercial speech. 


For one thing, the statute only 

covers commercial speech, and it's a red herring in that


sense, where under us -- that we would lose the course of


action and we couldn't proceed, so yes, the court of


appeal did finish by saying, we don't see any reasonable


possibility that the complaint can be amended to allege


noncommercial speech, so that --


QUESTION:  Okay, but let's -- let's assume it


could be amended in some way.  The demurrer is to the


complaint as it is, and if we accept their position, then


you cannot go forward with the complaint as it is.  You

would have to modify your lawsuit by amendment or bring a


new one, and why isn't that sufficient for -- for the


fourth Cox exception?


MR. HOEBER:  Well, it would -- the complaint as


it is would not be sufficient, but what Cox says is, for


the -- for the fourth exception, that the court's ruling


of reversal must be preclusive of further litigation on


the cause of action, so we gave the example --


QUESTION:  Well, the cause of action as pleaded. 


I mean, not a cause of action that you might have pleaded,


or a different one that you might bring.


MR. HOEBER:  Well, it would be the cause -- the


cause of action would remain as pleaded.  If the court --


if the court were to -- to say -- and we gave the example


of negligence -- the court were to say strict liability 

is -- is unconstitutional, you must have a -- something


more than strict liability, you must have negligence, the


cause of action would remain the same as --


QUESTION:  Well, I think we're --


MR. HOEBER:  -- as in libel cases --


QUESTION:  I think we're playing with words. 


You simply could not go forward on the cause of action as


you stated that cause of action in your pleadings.  You


would have to come forward with a cause of action which is


in some respect different in order --

 MR. HOEBER:  It would be more burdensome.


QUESTION:  -- in order to meet the


constitutional objection, and if that is the case, why


isn't it sufficient under Cox IV that you could not


proceed in the -- in the suit as you have pleaded it and


brought it?


MR. HOEBER:  Well, we're certainly not going to


argue about words, and what -- that is certainly correct,


that if -- as pleaded, and -- and we pleaded under the


statute it's a -- it's strict liability, and if the Court


were to say, you must have negligence, we would amend the


complaint to allege negligence, so it is certainly correct


that as pleaded we would not be proceeding on an


as-pleaded.  We would amend the complaint.


What I -- what I'm saying is that as I 

understand the Cox exception, the point of it is that the


Court is saying that we will only take a case under


Cox IV, when we know that if we reverse, the case is over


on that -- on that cause of action, not the technicality


of the pleading so much, but the reality of it, and if we


can amend the complain to allege the additional element,


it's really the same -- it is the same cause of action. 


It's just more burdensome.


QUESTION:  What you're saying is, is that Cox


category has real teeth in it, and that you just can't --

you have to show that it's really going to be over.


MR. HOEBER:  Yes.  My -- yes, I --


QUESTION:  But one aspect of it is that the


demurrer was granted without leave to repeat, as I


understand it, was dismissed with prejudice.


MR. HOEBER:  Yes.  In -- in San Francisco


Superior Court, the trial court, the judge granted the


demurrer without leave to amend.  Under California law --


and I should say, California law is not the Federal Rules


of Civil Procedure.


California law is the field code, the updated


field code, but it goes back to 1872, in fact to 1850, so


under California law, when the -- when the trial judge


granted the demurrer without leave to amend, we were


entitled to, and we did appeal without seeking leave to 

amend, and -- and under California law, and I -- I'll say


this in response to the statement on page 4 of the reply


brief that he makes no -- excuse me, that his abandonment


of the claimed right to amend, we did not abandon. 


Respondent did not abandon any claimed right to amend.


Under California law, we are entitled to amend. 


We didn't abandon it.  I'm not sure how -- how we could


abandon it.  We felt we were right on the law, and we


appealed from the -- from the superior court to the court


of appeal.  The court of appeal ruled against us and said,

as I noted earlier, we don't see a possibility of


amended -- amending it to noncommercial speech, which we


agree with.


We appealed to the California Supreme Court


because we felt we were right on the law, and the


California Supreme Court agreed with us.  If -- if the


California Supreme Court had said, you're wrong on the


law, you've got to prove negligence, maybe the California


Supreme Court would have done that.  We would have then


amended the complaint and proved negligence.


QUESTION:  You're not going to be able to amend


the complaint in respect to at least one argument, which I


think is a substantial argument, and that's the argument


that this particular statement, whether made to the


directors of the marketing, or whoever made it, is a 

statement that plays a role in a public debate about what


kind of society we wish to live in, and it's looking


towards action of a legislative sort, an administrative


sort, or possibly an interdependent individual sort, like


a boycott, and that being a statement that plays that kind


of role in a public debate, it is entitled to the highest


protection regardless of the forum it appeared in, so


California cannot proceed.


Now, in respect to that kind of an argument,


what's your reply?

 MR. HOEBER:  My -- my reply is, number 1, if --


if this Court were to say the case is barred, of course we


couldn't amend.  We could not amend, but -- so -- I'm


not -- I don't mean --


QUESTION:  I'm really trying to get you to the


merits.


MR. HOEBER:  Yes, I -- I'm going to -- I'm about


to move to the merits.  I'm -- so yes, there are


certain -- certainly circumstances we could not amend.


Now, on the merits, and in direct response to --


to your question, that's not this complaint.  That is not


this complaint.  Maybe there's a lot of statements in


Nike's briefs that suggest that's this case, and that's


this complaint, but the record before this Court is in


that complaint, and it's nowhere else.


QUESTION:  No, well, they say -- they're saying


don't look at -- look at the statement.  It's the


statement we're talking about, and look at all their


examples, and the statement that Nike gave is


characterized, according to them, as I characterized it,


so they say, we don't care what it says in the complaint. 


The complaint apparently would like us, something bad to


happen to us as a result of having made this statement. 


That's enough for us.  The First Amendment protects us


from that bad thing.

 MR. HOEBER:  Yes, and -- and --


QUESTION:  And why doesn't it?


MR. HOEBER:  And it doesn't because the


statements alleged in the complaint are specific, factual


representations that say, we make our products in


compliance with the laws of -- of the country of


manufacture with respect to wages and overtime, with


respect to health and safety, with respect to


environmental standards, we pay our workers twice the


minimum wage -- they are specific factual statements of


that kind.  They are not statements that go beyond that,


that talk about globalization --


QUESTION:  How is your client hurt by that?


MR. HOEBER:  My client is here as -- as a


Private Attorney General under the California provisions 

authorizing --


QUESTION:  So he's -- so he's not hurt by it --


MR. HOEBER:  So he is not hurt by it.  He has,


as I said, no Article III standing.  He -- he is not hurt


by it.  He is a Private Attorney General, and on the


Private Attorney General point, I will -- I will say this,


on -- we said in our brief that it was not raised.


QUESTION:  If he's not hurt by that, how is


anybody in California hurt by that?


MR. HOEBER:  Everybody in California will be

hurt by it, or is hurt by it in exactly the same way that,


under this complaint as it would be if it had been brought


by the California Attorney General or by the Federal Trade


Commission.


The California statute, apart from the Private


Attorney General provision, which is admittedly unusual,


maybe unique, but apart from the Private Attorney General


provision, the California statute is essentially the same


as the Federal Trade Commission Act.  Section 5 of the


Federal Trade Commission Act and the California statute


have the same standard of liability, which is likely to


mislead, or likely to deceive.


The Solicitor General's brief sets out the --


the standards on the Federal section 5.  They're


essentially the same, a claim that is likely to mislead 

people, that's material, and so under section 5 under the


California statute it is not required that -- that the


plaintiff come in and prove actual deception, actual


injury, actual harm, so it's -- it's precisely the same


under either scheme.


QUESTION:  May I -- may I interrupt to go back


to your article, your final judgment argument for just a


moment with respect to this?  Supposing that we should


hold that in a case like this, where you don't have


Article III standing, that the case may not go forward

unless the plaintiff can meet the New York Times standard,


prove actual malice and gross negligence and all the rest,


but it could theoretically go forward if those allegations


were made.


My question is, is it your understanding, as a


matter of California law and as a matter of the history of


this case, that you would have the right to -- to file an


amendment to your complaint making those allegations?


MR. HOEBER:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  Well, then, if that's true, is it


clear the case is not final, the judgment of law is not


final?


MR. HOEBER:  Well, on the -- on the same grounds


I said before, we -- if the court were to add an --


QUESTION: 


It would be only if we were to hold 

that no matter what you allege, New York Times or anything


else, these statements are constitutionally immune from


criticism in a proceeding of this kind.  Only in that case


would the case really be final, if we held that.


MR. HOEBER:  Well, the case would certainly be


final if the Court held that.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. HOEBER:  We would not be able to amend the


case.


QUESTION:  Yes.

 MR. HOEBER:  It would be over.


On the Private Attorney General, because it is


an unusual provision, I will only say this on -- on the


question whether it was raised below.  That's an easy --


we said in our brief it was not raised below.  That is an


easy matter to settle.  Nike filed the brief.  They filed


the brief in the California Supreme Court.  It's their --


QUESTION:  Well, what -- what if it weren't


raised below.  I mean, if a basic First Amendment


challenge to the statute is raised below, I mean, if you


lose in the Supreme Court of California you're certainly


not just going to repeat exactly the same arguments.


You're going to think up some new ones.


MR. HOEBER:  Well --


(Laughter.)


MR. HOEBER:  I will only say as a matter of fact


it was not raised below.  The California Supreme Court did


not address it.  It's not even in the cert petition.  You


can look at pages 8, 9, and 19 to 23, and they've got a


different argument.  It's not there.  That's the fact.


The upshot of not raising it below, I'm assuming


the Court doesn't address arguments that were not


raised below.


QUESTION:  Well, the Escondido case says there's


some latitude there.

 MR. HOEBER:  And I -- and I -- I'm aware there's


latitude, and there's -- there's latitude as to what's an


argument and what's a claim, but this is a very specific


argument that the Private Attorney General provision is


unconstitutional.


QUESTION:  Is it -- is it correct that in the


court below they did raise the point that, in fact, there


was no harm here, and one of the defects of the procedure


was that no one, either suing, or no one of the class on


behalf of whom suit was brought had or was alleged to have


had suffered any injury?  That was in their argument,


wasn't it?


MR. HOEBER:  Not that I recall.  I don't recall


that argument.  The --


QUESTION: 


If it was, would that be enough? 

MR. HOEBER:  Well, it -- it certainly would not


raise to my mind an attack on the Private Attorney General


provision, but I mean, the Private Attorney General


provision is a well-known and well -- and well-understood


provision that stands out, and to -- to attack it, I think


you have to mention it.


QUESTION:  Well, I mean, if -- the -- the


argument is not merely that there is something magically


wrong with a Private Attorney General.  The argument is


that what's wrong with a Private Attorney General is that

without public accountability, the Attorney General can


sue without, in effect, showing any harm, so whether you


use the term or not, that's the guts of the argument, and


if they raise the guts below, isn't that enough to -- to


get them into court?


MR. HOEBER:  If they raised the guts below, it


would be enough.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. HOEBER:  I -- I guess I would say they


didn't raise the guts below.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. HOEBER:  But if they did, yes, I --


QUESTION:  I would think out in California if a


litigant is challenging a statute as unconstitutional in


every instance, that you cannot have such an institution 

of a Private Attorney General, doesn't the Attorney


General weigh in on those cases?


MR. HOEBER:  Yes.  The Attorney -- the Attorney


General in California under this statute, and it's not


just for the Private Attorney General, but under the --


the false advertising and -- and unfair competition


statute, any time a -- a case gets on appeal the Attorney


General gets served with the briefs, so when we appealed


in the first instance we served the Attorney General with


our briefs, and we -- in the court of appeal and again in

the California Supreme Court, and the Attorney General


came in and filed an amicus brief in the California


Supreme Court on our behalf, which of course only related


to the merits, the commercial speech issue, which was the


issue we were litigating.


QUESTION:  Not on the issue of whether you could


have --


MR. HOEBER:  No.


QUESTION:  -- this kind of animal.


MR. HOEBER:  No.  No.  No.


I want to draw the Court's attention to -- to


footnote 3 in the reply brief.  I think this may clarify


some matters, and -- and in particular the phrase in -- in


footnote 3 that says, public agencies.


QUESTION:  What page is that on?


MR. HOEBER:  I'm sorry, it's page 3, footnote 3,


and the reference to public agencies.


The argument that -- that the Private Attorney


General provision is unconstitutional because we don't


have any injury, and allege no injury, and it's -- and


it's unconstitutional, the result of that argument is that


respondent is an improper plaintiff, is just -- doesn't --


doesn't meet constitutional requirements as an improper


plaintiff.


If the Court were to hold that, then there are

no further issues for this Court, and that is why I


direct -- I focus on footnote 3, because in footnote 3, as


I -- as I read it, Nike is saying that even if the Court


holds that the Private Attorney General provision is


unconstitutional because the plaintiff has no injury,


nevertheless the Court should go on because there will be


future lawsuits filed by public agencies, and the Court


should go on to impose a scienter requirement deliberate


or reckless falsehood.


And I want to say that those public agencies,


which is another word for law enforcement, which would be


California Attorney General, the district attorneys, and


not only California, other States and the FTC, they are


not before the Court.  Those parties are not before the


Court. 


I don't think we can represent those parties. 

If -- if respondent is an improper plaintiff, there aren't


any further issues, and we can't --


QUESTION:  Can I --


QUESTION:  Well, you try to have it both ways. 


You say, well I'm here because I'm a Private Attorney


General, but I -- I can't really try this case as well as


an Attorney General could.


MR. HOEBER:  Well, no -- no --


QUESTION:  That seems to me quite inconsistent.


MR. HOEBER:  Well, I don't want to say that,

Your Honor.  I want to say that -- that if we turn to the


merits of this case and -- and get away from the Private


Attorney General, if the Private Attorney General is


constitutional, then respondent is in the same shoes as


the Federal Trade Commission or the California Attorney


General, and that as far as the merits, go there is no


difference.


I said earlier that the California statute,


statutory scheme is the same as section 5.


QUESTION:  Well, I accept that.  I want to get


you just back once more if I can, and you may have nothing


to add, but I -- suppose we have to get to what I find in


this case personally the hardest question, I think that


the Federal Trade Commission certainly has the right to


regulate unfair, deceptive advertising, particularly on 

matters of -- of, that you're trying to sell the product,


including those having to do with, say, the environment.


I also think that the First Amendment is


designed to protect all participants in a public debate,


and public debates, contrary, in my mind, to what you said


before, are made up of factual statements, primarily, so


once you tie a party's hands behind his back in respect to


facts, you've silenced him.


Now, if all parties should participate equally


under the First Amendment, and also you should be able to

have regulation by the FTC of deceptive advertising, how


do I draw that line?


MR. HOEBER:  Well, in this case, the reason I


say -- and I'm not trying to carve out facts as different


from, necessarily different from anything else.  The facts


here were representations about the conditions under which


the product was made.


QUESTION:  I know, and I think --


MR. HOEBER:  All right.  Now, those --


QUESTION:  Now, but that's not going to help me.


MR. HOEBER:  I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  What I'm really looking for is help


in writing a hypothetical opinion.  I have to write a


standard, or a rule, or a statement, and I know that


30 briefs here, which are excellent, have tried to get at 

that, but I'm still in my mind uncertain about, say, your


view or the others on what that sentence should say,


trying to distinguish the ones from the others.


MR. HOEBER:  Well, this case, and I -- and I'll


start with a focus here, the -- the debate in this case


that's in the complaint, and the only debate that's in the


complaint, is the debate over what, in fact, was going on


in the shoe factories, what in fact, were the conditions. 


That was the debate.


Now, that debate is not the same as a public

debate about a larger public issue.  It is a debate about


this company's actual practices.


QUESTION:  But is -- is it different for First


Amendment purposes?


MR. HOEBER:  Well, I think -- I think it has to


be, Your Honor, because the -- the company is making


representations to consumers about its own practices for


the purpose of convincing those consumers that they should


buy the company's products, so it is commercial speech in


that sense.


QUESTION:  Whereas if it --


MR. HOEBER:  It is not -- it is not a --


QUESTION:  Whereas if it were about


globalization and what is happening in these countries it


would be different for First Amendment purposes? 

MR. HOEBER:  Yes.  It would not be about the


company's -- this -- these statements are about the


company's products, the conditions under which the


products are made.


QUESTION:  What difference would that make? 


I -- I really haven't been clear on what difference it


makes whether it's commercial or noncommercial.  So long


as it's false, and so long as it misleads somebody --


MR. HOEBER:  Well, the Court has said that if it

 QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. HOEBER:  -- that if it is commercial speech


and it's false or misleading, it's not protected by the


First Amendment.  I -- I --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. HOEBER:  It's also true that false factual


statements have no constitutional --


QUESTION:  No, but I mean, even if it's not


commercial speech, if somebody misleads me, to my


detriment, with a false statement, I wouldn't have a cause


of action?


MR. HOEBER:  Yes, you would have a cause of


action.  You would certainly have a cause of action,


and -- and if I sold you a watch and told you it was made


in the United States and you relied on that and bought it 

from me and I lied, or -- or even if I innocently told you


that, you could rescind the transaction.


QUESTION:  Is -- is the only way I can rely to


my detriment is if -- if it is commercial speech?  I mean,


it seems to me if I rely on a -- on a statement that --


that the person expects me to rely on, and I do so, and it


harms me, I have a cause of action.  I -- does it really


matter --


MR. HOEBER:  I -- I --


QUESTION:  -- whether it's commercial or

noncommercial speech?


MR. HOEBER:  I suspect it does not, for a -- for


a cause of action alleging reliance to my detriment and --


QUESTION:  Can you think of any case that this


Court has decided in which the outcome has depended on


whether or not the speech was commercial, other than the


case the California Supreme Court decided?


MR. HOEBER:  There -- there is a paucity of


authority from this Court that was --


QUESTION:  I wonder if there's any at all.


(Laughter.)


MR. HOEBER:  -- directly on point.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. HOEBER:  No.


The case that -- that was most important, and 

this maybe gets back to Justice Breyer's point, for our


purposes would be the Egg Commission case -- the Egg


Commission case, the National Commission on Egg Nutrition,


because there was a product and there were attacks on the


product saying it caused -- that the cholesterol was bad,


and this is 25 years ago, and it was new, and -- and the


Federal Trade -- and the egg industry fought back and said


no, eggs -- eggs are helpful in nutrition, and -- and they


don't harm, so that was a case where you had a dispute, or


a debate about the product.

 QUESTION:  Yes, but where I am really is, I -- I


think it's possible to look at the commercial speech cases


as creating a doctrine with an exception, and it's the


unfair advertising that falls outside the doctrine, so all


we know is, we're back to square 1 as far as the


commercial speech doctrine is concerned, so let's face it


as if there were no such doctrine and try to figure out


how under the First Amendment we get proper standards.


MR. HOEBER:  Well --


QUESTION:  And that -- and that's what I'm


trying to figure out.


MR. HOEBER:  Well, I -- yes.  If -- if the Court


wants to do that in this case, on this record --


QUESTION:  I mean, I don't know if we want to do


it or not do it. 


I'm trying to figure out what -- how to 

go about it if I ended up thinking we should go about it.


(Laughter.)


MR. HOEBER:  Then -- then my suggestion is that


this case alleges specific representations about a -- a


company's products, namely the conditions under which they


were made.  Consumers rely on those representations.  The


Solicitor General agrees with that.  They rely on those


representations, and they rely on them in making decisions


as to whether or not to buy the company's products.


When companies make representations about their

products with the purpose of consumers relying on those


representations, and consumers do rely on those


representations, it violates section 5 of the Federal


Trade Commission Act, it violates the California statute,


and it ought to be subject to regulation.


QUESTION:  Well, just becomes something


violates -- you're suggesting that if it -- if it's


contrary to section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act,


surely it must be constitutional, but I'm not sure -- I


don't know that we've ever said that everything in the


Federal Trade Commission Act is constitutional.


MR. HOEBER:  No, I'm sure the Court has not said


that, and I -- and I'm -- and I --


QUESTION:  Let's --


QUESTION:  Go on.


QUESTION:  Let's assume a -- a law that --


that -- I -- I guess that -- that there were, that -- that


requires advertising on radio or television to be


supported, that you -- you cannot make the claim unless


the claim is supported, all right, and the burden is on


you to have the support before you can even make it, and


it's a violation, even -- even if it happens to be true,


if -- if you have not done the studies that show that this


little pill does this thing or -- or another, you cannot


make the statement.

 Now, I suppose we would allow that in -- in


advertising, wouldn't we?  But would we allow such a --


such a precondition to -- to speech in -- in a


noncommercial area?


MR. HOEBER:  I'm sure -- I suspect not.


QUESTION:  So there is a difference between what


we're willing to do with commercial speech and


noncommercial speech, but why -- why wouldn't we limit it,


limit the term commercial speech in that context to


advertising, to really -- and -- and some of our cases


speak that way.  It has to be the context of the offering


of a -- of a transaction, the offering of a deal.


So that if you have some general, you know,


advertising on television, we're a -- we're a -- an


environmentally concerned company, it doesn't fall within 

commercial speech.  It's only if in connection -- you


know, on the -- on the label it says, buy this because, or


you know, it's a pitch to sell the product.


Isn't that a line that it's feasible to draw,


and why isn't that a sensible line?


MR. HOEBER:  Well, it may be feasible to draw. 


I -- I imagine it would be difficult to draw, and I think


that's why the Federal Trade Commission says advertising,


product labels, other promotions and marketing material,


because it in many instances is not easy to draw --

 QUESTION:  Well, the California Supreme Court


defined commercial speech as speech when a person is


engaged in commerce.  Just generally, is that their basis?


MR. HOEBER:  Oh, I think the California Supreme


Court was trying to spell out what it -- what it --


QUESTION:  Do you defend the California Supreme


Court's --


MR. HOEBER:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- definition?


MR. HOEBER:  We don't need to go as far as the


California Supreme Court may have gone, in particular with


its definition of product references, because I think the


California Supreme Court was concerned about so-called


image advertising and the possible ways companies promote


themselves apart from this particular product. 

QUESTION:  Well, if it -- if this case -- if we


reach the merits, and if we have to address it, we're


going to have to know what commercial speech is, I


suppose.


MR. HOEBER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And we're going to have to look at


California's definition.


MR. HOEBER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And I just wondered if you supported


that.

 MR. HOEBER:  Well, we support it, but we don't


have to go as far, because in this -- because we have


representations about the product, the -- the


circumstances under which the product was made.


We certainly agree that --


QUESTION:  None of this speech was advertising


in the true sense of that term, was it?


MR. HOEBER:  Well, if the true sense means


advertising format, no, these were not in advertising


format, but for example, the -- the -- one of the exhibits


is the -- is a primer, a 30-page primer, which looks for


all the world like the kind of promotional brochures and


marketing material that's handed out by lots of companies.


Now, it's not an advertisement on television,


and -- and that line may be feasible to draw, or it may --

may have fuzzy edges, but it's going to leave out a lot of


promotions and a lot of communications that consumers rely


on.


QUESTION:  Yes.  It's not a perfect world.


MR. HOEBER:  No.  No.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  But it's worse -- it's worse,


actually, because I think your case, the truth of the


matter is, I think it's both.  You know, it's both. 


They're both trying to sell their product and they're

trying to make a statement that's relevant to a public

MR. HOEBER:  Maybe the --


QUESTION:  And so what do we do if we're drawing


this standard, and there's a wide range of things that


quite honestly fall into both?


MR. HOEBER:  Well, my -- my position is that


it's -- consumer protection is --


QUESTION:  Trumps the First Amendment?


MR. HOEBER:  Not that it trumps the First


Amendment --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. HOEBER:  -- but -- but the hypothetical is,


it's both.


QUESTION:  Yes, that's right.


MR. HOEBER:  And -- and if it were just the --


if it was -- if it was -- companies -- the Court has said


that companies have the right, or speakers have the right


to comment directly on public issues, and -- and if you


comment directly on a public issue and discuss the public


issue, you are certainly protected.


QUESTION:  If it's very difficult to define


commercial speech, then isn't it true that under this


scheme companies are chilled in speaking?


MR. HOEBER:  Well, they -- they may be chilled

in speaking if -- because of the difficulty in defining


commercial speech, and that presumably will chill false


statements as well, since the -- the statute and the


regulation only applies to false or misleading speech,


and -- and I think that to the extent the -- the


definition is -- is unclear, it may -- I don't know that


for a fact, but it's -- it's plausible.


QUESTION:  Are -- are there cases where we've


upheld statutes that are chilling of speech?


MR. HOEBER:  Oh yes.  Yes, there are.


QUESTION:  What are they?


(Laughter.)


MR. HOEBER:  Well --


QUESTION:  We haven't said that they're chilling


of speech.


(Laughter.)


MR. HOEBER:  I think you caught me there, Your


Honor.


On -- back to -- to Justice Breyer's question. 


I don't think anybody would say defining commercial speech


is easy, but in this case, where we allege that -- where


the complaint alleges that the company made factual


representations about its -- the circumstances under which


its products are made, with the purpose of persuading


consumers to buy the product, and we know that consumers

QUESTION:  Are you saying that you can't


distinguish what you are targeting from, say, a label that


says, made by disabled veterans, when it wasn't?  You --


you put them in the same category?


MR. HOEBER:  I put that in the commercial speech


category.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. TRIBE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


Let me just deal with a couple of technical


things first.  The Attorney General of California was


notified below.  He filed a brief.  It's not required in


California that all of the arguments be rehearsed before


him, and most importantly the California Supreme Court


passed on the fundamental claim that this scheme, applied


to public debate, violates the First Amendment, and under


Yee v. Escondido in any event we can make a different


argument.

 But if you look at the brief below, the most


telling part of it, I think -- and it gets to the pivot of


this case -- this is at pages 30 to 31 of the California


Supreme Court brief.  It there recites that if the shoe,


as it were, were on the other foot, under California law


this case would go away in an instant.


The case decided unanimously by the Supreme


Court of California in 1984 is Epic v. Superior Court.  In


that case there was an ideological boycott of companies


that were doing business with the plaintiff.  The


plaintiff was not thought to be environmentally friendly


enough.  The plaintiff sued for trade libel, they wanted


damages, they wanted an injunction, they said it was


interference with contract.  The trial court was about to


hold the trial and the Supreme Court of California, citing 

Article 1, section 2 of its constitution, said, hey,


public debate, there are interests on both sides, but the


courts of California can't resolve it.


It seems to me that what we have here, and this


goes to the question of the Private Attorney General


action, is that if there is a debate between interests of


labor and interests of management, the California Supreme


Court has transmogrified this old statute, which was


pretty strange to begin with but had never been used to


stifle and silence the public debate, it's transformed it


62 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005 

into a conversation-stopper, and the power to do that is,


I think, extraordinary.


They say, maybe there will be a chill.  If you


look at the media brief, the media are now saying that


businesses around the world are already afraid to


communicate with us because California may get them, and


the European brief, filed by a consortium that controls


about $2 trillion of investment, says that the efforts of


the European Union to encourage transparency are being


frustrated by California saying that if you come out and


answer these charges, as they did in the letter to the


athletic directors, you can be trapped, because you're a


business, so you're trying to make money, so it's


commercial speech.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: 


Thank you, Mr. Tribe. 

The case is submitted.


MR. TRIBE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


(Whereupon, at 12:21 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
