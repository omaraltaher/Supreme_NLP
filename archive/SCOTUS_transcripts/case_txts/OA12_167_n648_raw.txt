13  automatically granting appellate relief for every

prejudiced the defendant, is flawed.  As this Court 
15
16  recognized in United States v. Vaughn, Rule 11(h) was

18  then-common practice of automatically reversing even for

 MR. FEIGIN:  Well, first of all, Your Honor, 

question about that?  It's plain error because the 
defendant didn't make an objection in the lower court. 
But the defendant doesn't know about Rule 11 and doesn't 
know about 11(c) that says a judge is not supposed to 
participate in plea bargaining, and his lawyer doesn't 
tell him the judge is doing something wrong because his 
lawyer wants him to plea.  So he lacks the information 
necessary to make a prompt objection.

20
21  would be a particularly inappropriate case in which to 
22  do it because not only was there not a contemporaneous 
23  objection, there wasn't an objection before the district 
24  judge in the months and proceedings that followed. 
They didn't raise any claim of error on

felt from those comments at all.

12  plain error because he doesn't tell -- as Justice 
13  Ginsburg says, what does the defendant know about Rule 
14  11(c)?  He doesn't know about it. 
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, if Respondent 
15
16  wants to make an ineffective assistance of counsel claim 
17  on collateral review, he can make that.  But I'm not 
18  aware of any court of appeals that has abandoned the 
19  plain error doctrine in this kind of case and I don't 
think there should be any sort of special exception that 
20
21  says when -- that we assume when counsel is advising his 
22  client to plead guilty, that we can't expect counsel to 
23  make objections to errors that occur based on the

questionable when it seems that the judge, the lawyer, 
they arranged against the -- the defendant, and the

Sotomayor.  That was exactly the next sentence that was

 MR. FEIGIN:  Well, first of all, Your Honor, 

I want to take issue with the notion that all Rule 
11(c)(1) errors are alike.  There's actually a variety 
of different kinds of Rule 11(c)(1) errors. 

Rule 11(c)(1) has been held to cover, for 
example, a judge pressuring the government outside the 
defendant's presence to offer a plea, a judge 
discouraging a plea, a judge commenting in a 
well-intentioned manner about the obvious difference in 
potential sentencing consequences between a potential

17  rebuttable presumption I think would also be

MR. FEIGIN: -- I think that's already built 

into Rule 52 in a couple of different ways. 

 MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- whether rebuttable or 

 First of all, Rule 52 places a presumption 
based on whether or not the defendant objected.  If the 
defendant objected, the burden's on the government.  If 
the defendant didn't object, the burden is on the

11  defendant. 
 But also, I don't -- I want to be clear on 
12
13  this, the type of error -- if there is a very serious 
14  error, the nature of the error and the error's 
15
16  important factor, in the prejudice analysis. 
17
18  case, there may be other circumstances that indicate 
19  the error did not, in this case, have a reasonable 
probability of affecting the decision of the plea. 
20
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But that's the problem.  Is 
21
22  there a way of doing this, which I -- I don't see at the 
23  moment?  But the judge intervenes in a serious way and 
24  says, you go listen to your lawyer and this is a very 
harsh penalty and, boy, you are in da da da -- okay? 
25

seriousness would of course be a factor, and a very 

 But, as Your Honor has recognized with this

 And now to track down whether that affected 

substantial rights, you have to try to track down the 
state of mind of the defendant and would he have pled 
guilty anyway.  And that's sometimes quite difficult to 
do, very hard. 

 But if you don't insist on doing it, and you 
have an absolute rule of structural error or something, 
then you suddenly discover these minor things.  The 
judge says, go to lunch, or -- or, you know, some really

terms of how serious the intervention was, but I don't 
15
16  see any way to do that.  Have -- have you thought about 
17  that at all?  Do we have to go all the one way or all 
18  the other way? 
19
little bit, Your Honor, and I'd say that trying to break 
20

22  rules based on different kinds of error would be

or another, and under the approach you're suggesting, 
which I think is the approach Respondent is 
advocating -- I don't think Respondent is actually

15
16  that you recognize would be prejudicial, and if there is 
17  can you describe what that would be? 
18

cases even in circuits that have prejudice analysis.  In 
20
21  fact, one example the Court might want to look to, there 
22  was a certiorari petition I think filed at the end of

24  case of Rule 11(c)(1) error.  The government conceded

14  obviously is going to be prejudicial. 
15
16  it allows you to separate that kind of case from kinds 
17  of cases when there are less serious errors, or even a 
18  case where there is a fairly serious error -- and this

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  On that point, do we

it's just worth noting that -- a couple of the factors. 
One is that -- there was a 3-month break between the 
magistrate judge's comments and the entry of the plea, 
and a month into that a speedy trial motion was filed,

 MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, my understanding is

23  the government was not aware of this because it occurred 
24  in an ex parte hearing in which the government wasn't in 
attendance.  The government wasn't aware of it until the

 MR. FEIGIN:  Yes, Your Honor.  He has a 


right to go to trial if he wants to go to trial, even if

and asked for further briefing on the issue. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose there's a case where 
the -- the defendant would not have pled guilty without 
this court saying something inappropriate about it's a 

case where the defendant would be crazy to go to trial

 I think that could be done very carefully by 

asking very general questions, but I think it's very 
easy to see how a judge might slip up and say, oh, 
that's an interesting offer.  Did you discuss that with 

claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is to conduct 
a colloquy with the defendant -- not a colloquy, but a 
discussion with the defendant -- during the initial 
proceedings to try to establish that he understands the 
consequences of his plea and that he's receiving

 And I think what the automatic reversal rule

himself moved pro se to withdraw his plea in the 

district court, and his reasons for withdrawing his 

plea, which start on page 58 of the Joint Appendix, 

never mention the magistrate's comments.  Instead, in 

his own words, what he says is, "Your Honor, my decision 

to enter the plea was a strategic decision. 


 The reason being is that I knew that the 

prosecutor had a duty with the courts to disclose the 

information relevant for this court's determination of 

the acceptance or rejection of the plea." 

 And what he means by that is that he took 

issue with some aspects of the allegations in the 
indictment, although he's quite clear, both in that 
proceeding and at his guilty plea proceeding, that he 
did commit the conspiracy offense, and he just believed 
that those allegations in the record would be cleaned up 
or have to be withdrawn by the prosecutor if he pleaded 
guilty. 

 Now, he was wrong about that.  But what we 
have in this case is a clear unvarnished explanation by 
the defendant, in his own words, about why he pleaded

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. YABLON 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 MR. YABLON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 By imploring Anthony Davila to forego his 
trial rights, confess his alleged crimes, and accept a 
plea deal, the magistrate judge abandoned his role as

21  Judges, when an error of this kind occurs --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're creating a sui 
22
23  generis structural error analysis.  You're basically --
24  because even with respect to constitutional violations 
that we have found structural error in, we've created 
25

 MR. YABLON:  By foregoing --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  By foregoing. 
 MR. YABLON:  -- his trial rights. 
 This -- the right at issue in this case is 
not one that should be subject to post hoc speculation. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I don't want to 

hear your first -- "by foregoing"? 

19
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

the plain error rule that still requires a proof of --

of prejudice.  So you're asking us to create something 

that's really sui generis in saying it's always a 

structural error. 


MR. YABLON:  That's -- that's not correct, 
Your Honor.  First, let's put to one side the fact that 
we do argue that we should not be in a plain error 
framework at all in this case because of the 
circumstances in which the judge's improper intervention 
occurred.

11
12  argument. 
13
14
15
 MR. YABLON:  And this Court has, at the very 
16
17  least, strongly suggested that substantial rights, when 
18  you're dealing with a structural error, are affected, 
19  per se, where they've left the door open to some 
20
21  error standard where the Court is called upon to 
22  consider whether the error affects the fairness, 
23  integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. 
24
25

 And the government has never, in this case, 
invoked that fourth prong.  They've never claimed that 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Assume I accept that 

 MR. YABLON:  So this Court has --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're -- you're saying 

this is a structural error always. 

additional analysis is the fourth prong of the plain 

20
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

the error here is one that -- that does not affect the 
fairness, integrity, or public reputation. 

 So when you're only dealing with the third 

prong of the plain error standard, does the error affect 
substantial rights?  That language is the same in Rule 
52(b), the plain error standard, as it is in Rule 52(a), 
affects substantial rights.  And if it means in Rule 
52(a) that this is the sort of error for which an 
individualized prejudice inquiry is not appropriate, 
then the same analysis necessarily carries over to Rule 

1

3

6

8 
9 
10
11  52(b). 
12
13  kind of sui generis example that -- that you're 
14  indicating. 
15
16  that this error is quite similar, both to constitutional 
17  and nonconstitutional violations in with -- which this 
18  Court has said that an error should be said to affect 
19  substantial rights without the sort of specific showing 
20
21
22  is stepping out of his proper role, is acting contrary 
23  to his duties to guard against ill-considered and 
24  involuntary waivers of the defendant's basic trial 
25

rights, is actually ratcheting up the already tremendous 

of prejudice that the government is demanding. 

 When you have a judge that, as in this case, 

 So I would not say that this is at all the

pressure on the defendant to plead guilty, that is a 
systematic distortion of the process.  That is not 
unlike the kind of error that occurs when a defendant is 
denied an impartial adjudicator, is not unlike the 
kind of error that occurs when a defendant is denied 
counsel or is forced to --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- what if you 
7
have the situation where the judge is conveying purely 
8 
factual information?  There's a -- a plea bargain on the 
9 
table for one year and the judge says, you should know 
10
11  that I -- I have these cases a lot.  The last ten cases 
12  that went to trial where the defendant was found guilty, 
13  I sentenced them to a minimum of 12 years.  Pure facts. 
 The facts might have the effect of pushing 
14
the defendant one way or another, but it's also factual 
15
16  information of which he ought to be aware. 
17
18  this raises a question about what the scope of the 
19  participation prohibition actually is. 
And we're in a strange posture in this case 
20
21  because the government has conceded that we're dealing 
22  with a conceded plain violation of the rule, and yet 
23  their analysis, instead of proceeding from that 
24  violation, it goes out to the periphery and tries to

structural argument is going to reach before we 

 Now -- and they cite some appellate cases 
that arguably have applied too broad a construction of 
the rule and have reversed where maybe there was just a 
one-off comment or a purely informational comment, but 
it's not clear that that is actually what the text of 
Rule 11 forbids, particularly when you consider the 
context of the rule and its underlying purposes.  So --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, we do need to

 MR. YABLON:  That's right, Your Honor, and 
12
13  there are -- there are two ways to break it down.  One 
14  is we do argue that the remedy that we seek should apply 
15
16  question then is:  Are judicial participation violations 
17  as expansive a category as the government suggests that 
18  they are? 
19
20
21  most minor thing that the government could do that would 
22  still count as a Rule 11(c)(1) violation?

25

 Our second argument is that --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, on that, what's the 

for all cases of judicial participation.  And the

 MR. YABLON:  Well, the most minor -- we 


CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- what about 

think that Rule 11 is concerned with judicial pressure 

to plead guilty.  And so the most -- I mean, a judge 

might make a comment that, viewed from the transcript,

overwhelming or that the defendant is likely to get a 
much lower sentence if he pleads guilty than if he goes 
to trial.  Those we think are --

13  we were talking about a purely informational statement 
14  like that, then, actually, we don't think that that is

line.  And what the judge --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if he -- if it's

whether a bargain for one year is a good deal.

12
13  will be close cases.  I would say that if you look to 
14  the majority of cases that are actually out there, most 
judges, of course, are very scrupulous about following 
15
16  the rule.  And when a judge is not, the judge is not 
17  usually being circumspect about it, the judge is trying 
18  to get a message across to the defendant.

22  approach that the government's asking for.

 So it is a different case, isn't it, when we 

have a plea hearing with a judge who is exerting no 
pressure at all, has nothing to do with encouraging the 
defendant to plead, but there was an earlier episode 

the plea hearing, but here we have two factors that are 
special in this case.  One is it's a different judge, 
and two is we have the interval of some three months in 
between.  And then we have a plea hearing that looks to 
me like it's exemplary.  The district judge did go 
through everything that Rule 11 calls for.

14  acknowledging or disavowing the magistrate judge's 
comments, which, we submit, there is at least a very

17  defendant's thinking and the reason that the defendant 
18  is at the Rule 11 hearing in the first place.

22  the defendant answered yes.  And the -- the judge asked, 
23  has anyone pressured you to plead guilty?  And he

judge did ask, do you recognize that your -- your

situation, the defendant is likely not thinking about 

pressure that may come from the judiciary itself.  And 

also, not to nitpick, but when he's asking that pressure 

question he's asking whether anyone pressured him to 

plead guilty today, which may not cause the defendant to 
think back on why he actually started down the negotiation 
road.

 I think an important --
8
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Yablon, I agree with 
9
you totally.  I'm not as much convinced by the delay in 
10
11  pleading because defendants often think about it and I 
12  can imagine a hypothetical where the lawyer comes in and 
13  says, I told him to plead guilty and he said to me, I 
14  don't want to, but the judge told me to. 
So I don't think the time limit -- we don't 
15
16  know if that happened.  But what did happen is that the 
17  defendant made a motion to withdraw his plea and he 
18  directly said, "I entered the plea because I 
19  strategically decided that the government would 
20
21  against me."  He said it himself with no pressure by a 
22  lawyer because he was making the motion.  How do you get 
23  past that statement? 
24
25

eventually have to come forth and vacate the charges 

 MR. YABLON:  That statement reveals just how 

little confidence we actually should have in the plea 

27
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Even at the plea hearing, he is attempting 
to tell the judge, look, I don't think that my conduct 

decision that he made.  Here is a defendant who for the 
better part of a year was adamant about his desire to go 
to trial and exercise his rights.  It's the reason that 
the in camera hearing happened in the first place 
because he was unhappy that his lawyer just wanted him 
to plead guilty.  After that hearing, suddenly there are 
plea negotiations and a plea deal, which it's clear that 
he is never happy about from the start.

11  actually is consistent with the conspiracy charge as

25

led to his decision. 

 MR. YABLON:  And we don't need to prove 

instructing him that it was the right thing to do.  And 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that is the whole 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's only if we don't 

MR. YABLON:  Either way, if you were looking 

28
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And so you have a defense lawyer who may 

at whether this conduct should be viewed as inherently 
prejudicial the reason that you might do that is because 
you might think that at least in all of these cases 
there might at least be a reasonable probability that it 
would affect where the defendant is.  And here you have 
a defendant who has been adamant that he's not going to 
plead, and when you have the judge making these comments 
in front of the defendant, having him lose confidence in 
his right to go to trial, then it's likely that that is 
shifting the defendant's mind set in a way that gets him 

1

11  to the negotiating table.  And it also reaffirms the

14  then go back to the prosecutor and say, we're just going 
15
16  the defendant would otherwise have reached. 
17
18  not apply the 11(h) with the harmless error business, and 
19  you basically want to prevent bizarre results by making 
a tough definition of the word "participate."  That's 
20
21  how I understand you.  And maybe you are right, but it 
22  sounds to me as you say it in reading the briefs that 
23  this is really a job for the rules committee. 
24
25

to get this deal done, and it may not be the deal that 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You want us to basically 

 This is a rule.  We don't normally have 

structural errors in respect to rules.  We have rules 

29
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

committees there to listen to this kind of complaint, to
 
weigh it in the system as a whole and to come up with 

better rules. 


 MR. YABLON:  Let me address that in two ways 

because we have two separate arguments and I want to try 

to keep them distinct.  One is that if you look at the 

text and history of Rule 11, there is strong evidence 

that Congress actually made an affirmative judgment not 

to sweep in Rule 11 violations within the scope of Rule 

11(h).

12  applies to all Rule 11 errors, that all Rule 11(h) does 
13  is apply the same substantial rights language that you 
14  see in Rule 52(a) and (b).  And this Court has 
15
16  is often synonymous with a case of specific prejudice 
17  inquiry, that's not always true.  And there are a number 
18  of examples.  The Court is familiar with the 
19  constitutional cases in which the Court has said that an 
error is structural without trying to determine -- make 
20
21  a case-specific determination of prejudice. 
22
23  cases as well in which the Court has said that an 
24  individualized prejudice inquiry is simply 
25

inappropriate, that the error affects substantial rights 

 Our second argument is that even if Rule 11(h) 

recognized that, while that substantial rights language

 And the Court said, we are not going to go there. 
This is -- this is in effect a structural defect in the 

by its nature.  So one example that I think is fairly 
close to the one we have here is -- is Gomez v. United 
States, where you have the Court addressing a statutory 
provision that prevents magistrate judges from 
conducting the jury voir dire.  And that provision is 
violated and the Court is asked to conduct a prejudice 
analysis, did it matter that the magistrate judge

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  You worked for her, too, I 

 MR. YABLON:  Makes it that much more 

This Court has said that Federal rules and 

31
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 So the case in which the Court did so is the 

McCarthy case, which is discussed extensively in the 

statutes stand on equal footing, so whether we are 
talking about applying this with respect to a rule or a 
statute, it shouldn't make a difference; the analysis 
should be the same.  And in fact there is at least one 
case where the Court did apply, in effect, a 
structural analysis to -- to a rule violation and a 
second case in which the Court at least left open the 
possibility.

12  Rule 11 and said that prejudice adheres in a violation 
13  of that rule and that it was not going to conduct an 
14  individualized prejudice analysis.  It was simply going 
to grant relief where there had not been full compliance 
15
16  with that provision. 
 Of course, the rule has been amended since 
17
18  then, but that provides evidence that the Court is not 
19  unwilling to adopt this kind of rule in the context of 
20
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I would think, Mr. Yablon, 
21
22  that one of the effects of doing what you are asking us 
23  to do is that the rule will just get narrower and 
24  narrower.  In other words, if automatic reversal is 
25

always the effect of finding a violation -- and I think 

the Federal Rules. 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. YABLON:  So we think that our approach 

is consistent with how the rule is, in fact, meant to be 
interpreted.  The rule really is about this problem of 
placing judicial pressure on defendants to plead guilty, 

you acknowledge this in a way -- that people will just 
find fewer and fewer violations.  And I'm wondering why 
we should do something like that rather than interpret 
the rule as it was meant to be interpreted, but then 
say, you know, somebody can look and say it really just 
didn't matter that it was violated in this case.

2 
3

11  and those are the cases that ought to be reversed. 
 But the Court has a line-drawing decision to 
12
13  make either way.  Either the line that the Court should 
14  focus on is the line that separates participation from 
15
16  participation.  And I want to get to this point that --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  But you are arguing for a 
17
18  narrower interpretation of Rule 11(c)(1) than a number 
19  of courts of appeals have adopted, isn't that correct? 
MR. YABLON:  There -- I believe there are 
20
21  some decisions out there that have adopted probably a 
22  broader construction than we think is necessary and 
23  appropriate.  But what is easier for reviewing courts 
24  to monitor?  Is it easier for them to monitor the 
25

nonparticipation or, again, a narrower class of 

narrowing -- the improper narrowing of the rule over time, 

33
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And it would be much easier for appellate 


or is it easier for them to monitor improper applications 
of the harmless error rule, especially applications of it 
that are happening in this kind of setting, where it's 
going to be almost inherently a very speculative analysis, 
an attempt to read the defendant's mind and ascertain 

whether the defendant was influenced by what the judge 

was saying.

courts to focus on the line-drawing exercise that 

9 
determines whether or not a violation had occurred or, 
10
11  if you think that the rule is broader, whether the kind 
12  of violation that occurred in this case occurred, than 
13  it would be to try to make these case-by-case scouring 
14  the record, individualized prejudice determinations. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  Could you say something 
15
16  about Mr. Feigin's comments regarding what a judge can 
17  and cannot do if the judge thinks that he or she sees a 
18  violation of Lafler and Frye taking place? 
19
20
21  for example, that the judge becomes aware that the 
22  defense attorney has given the -- his client false 
23  information about the elements of the charge.  It would 
24  not violate Rule 11(c)(1) for the judge to say, I 
25

understand that you were told that the elements of the 

 MR. YABLON:  So there ought to be things 

that a judge is able to do in that situation.  Suppose, 

34
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

charge are A, B, and C, but in fact they are X, Y, and 
Z. 

1 
2 
 So there are -- there are certainly steps 
3
that a judge can take to help root out the violation. 
4 
And I would say that the fact is that generally when it 
5
comes to ineffective assistance of counsel claims, there 
6 
is only so much that the trial court can do.  So 
7 
the fact that the trial court may not be able to solve 
8 
or prevent every ineffective assistance claim in this 
9 
context is not necessarily an argument against the rule 
10
11  because the judge often is not aware of the privileged 
12  communications.  Now --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  What if the judge knows as a 
13
14  result of pretrial motions that the evidence in the case 
15
16
17  to suppress extremely incriminating evidence and the 
18  motion has been denied, so the judge knows this is going 
19  to come in.  And the judge thinks if this comes in, 
there's virtually very little chance that the defendant 
20
21  is going to be acquitted, and yet the defendant -- and 
22  the judge knows that a plea bargain -- a plea offer was 
23  made and the defendant initially was going to take it, 
24  and then before it was accepted, it's rejected.

Is there anything a judge can do in that

 Let's say there's a -- there's been a motion

case to be -- to be reversed? 

 MR. YABLON:  Well, the judge's role in that 
situation is -- is not to step in as defense counsel or, 
in effect, as second prosecutor.  The judge -- I think 
that there may be ways in that case for the judge to try 
to alleviate the error without -- without crossing the 
line.  But when -- but when you start to make exceptions 
in that -- in that situation, you -- you go down the 
road of -- of the judge being the one who is evaluating

15

17  that on that wiretap, you conceded that the loss in this 
18  case is $20 million, and do you know that under the 
19  sentencing guidelines, the sentence where the loss is

 MR. YABLON:  So -- so taking -- so in that

13  different from situations that arise in completely 
14  different contexts, where the attorney is doing 
15
16  just doesn't know about it.  And -- and whether or not 
17  that can be cured in this -- in this setting of the --
18  of plea discussions, it's just a little bit tangential, 
19  I think, to the key issue. 
20
21  you've answered a lot of these questions by saying, you 
22  know, it's hard to draw the line and, you know, maybe in 
23  that case, maybe in this case.

 Most -- our precedents where we recognize 
structural error and -- and plain error are ones that 

something that's ineffective, for example, and the judge

 It -- it seems to me in the typical plain 

error cases, we're very -- the categories are very 
sharply defined. 

 MR. YABLON:  That's actually not --

are pretty easily categorized.  Did a magistrate conduct 
voir dire or did he not?  You know right away one way or 
the other.  Here did he participate enough?  You know, 
well, if he told them how many times he sentenced people 
this way, it's not, but if he said you ought to -- you 
ought to pay attention to what I'm telling you when 
you'd consider whether to plea or not, well, then it is.

right to self-representation has been clearly denied. 
15
16  But there are going to be line-drawing problems when 
17  you're trying to figure out did standby counsel 
18  intervene so much that he denied that right. 
19
obviously, a court can be totally closed, but then there 
20

If you look at the cases that actually 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, but if you were 

were, is really quite narrow than here, where almost 
every time you've been asked a question about a 
difficult hypothetical, you say, well, maybe, maybe not. 
And I think that's quite different than saying is the 
court closed or not or was the person -- you know, did 
he represent himself in fact or not.  And those just 
strike me as much easier cases.

18  there certainly are instances in which the structural --
19  in which the Court has found structural error, even when 
there will be difficult line-drawing problems.  And --
20
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Yablon, one problem 
21
22  with calling this structural error is that it's not so

24  States, even today, allow a judge to participate in plea

 It's, this was -- this was something that 

still some jurisdictions think it's okay. 

 MR. YABLON:  Your Honor, no jurisdiction 

endorses judicial exhortations to plead guilty.  And --
and so this Court can resolve the case just on that 

committee -- said, when it -- when it framed this rule, 
that some commentators had said it was quite -- quite a 
frequent thing that happened, that judges participated. 
So it isn't like not having a public trial or not giving 
a person counsel of choice.

11  narrower basis, that there is a category of cases that 
12  clearly do involve direct judicial pressure.  And no 
13  State allow -- allows it, and those are clear violations 
14  of the rules.  So without needing to draw these other 
15
16  can do that. 
17
18  note that -- that the Federal system has made a 
19  different structural choice.  So whether or not it may 
violate the Constitution for States to have carefully 
20
21  tailored procedures that allow some type of judicial 
22  involvement, that's not the structure that the Federal 
23  system has chosen.  And when you're dealing with the 
24  structural choice that was made in Rule 11, that judges 
25

lines about how broad participation may reach, the Court 

shall not, must not participate in plea discussions, 

 But even in those States, it's important to 

40
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 Now, I do want to get back to this 

line-drawing issue because I think that this is not 
something that should trouble the Court too much, for a 
couple of reasons. 

that that is as elemental to the Federal system of plea 
bargaining that we have as many of the familiar elements 
of -- of the trial are.  And so the fact that States 
have made -- made different structural choices does not 
mean that it's not a structural error here.

First, in most cases, the line will not be 
10
11  that hard to draw when you consider the purpose of Rule 
12  11(c)(1), which is reducing judicial pressure, and 
13  instances in which judges are stepping out of their role 
14  as impartial adjudicators, and when reviewing courts 
take that as the touchstone, there may be difficult 
15
16  cases, but they're going to be able to resolve most of 
17  them. 
18
19  difficult to do line drawing, and it is uncomfortable 
20
21  far, it is entirely appropriate for the Court to -- to 
22  take out a subcategory of Rule 11(c)(1) violations. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that seems a bit odd, 
23
24  don't you think, Mr. Yablon?  You know, you're saying, 
well, there are core violations as opposed to noncore 
25

extending the rule -- the remedy that we're seeking that 

 Now, if the Court feels like it may be

violations.  I mean, presumably, that's part of what the 
Court would think about when it was doing prejudice 
analysis. 

 MR. YABLON:  It would factor into the 

prejudice analysis that the Court undertakes, but it 
also is a reason just to -- to draw the line.  I mean, 
this Court in -- in various instances has 
indicated that -- I mean, there are some -- some broad 
rules out there, the right to the assistance of counsel. 
It comes in different shapes.  And the prejudice 

1

11  analysis that applies for a total denial of the right to 
12  counsel is different from the one that applies when 
13  you're dealing with mere deficiency in counsel's 
14  performance. 
And there is -- and again, this is -- this 
15
16  is a comparative line-drawing problem.  Either you draw 
17  the line looking at what a violation is or looking at 
18  what a judicial exhortation is from the statement that 
19  is made, or you engage in this freewheeling speculation 
20
21  trying to read the defendant's mind.  And that is simply 
22  not how harmless error analysis normally proceeds, where 
23  you have a closed universe of a record, you have 
24  specific criteria that are being applied, and you can

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Yablon, do you know of

these exhortation cases, where the Court did not find 
prejudice?

 And we would go further and say that if the

Court were to go down this road, it would be useful for

the Court to provide the additional guidance of holding

So in the defendant's mind, the magistrate judge and the 
district court are effectively one and the same, and you 
would not want a system where district courts are 
encouraged to send these issues to magistrate judges, so 
magistrate judges can engage in these kind of comments, 
but then the district court judge can basically just 
cleanse it.  It is going to affect the way that the 
process plays out.

 This is the exact same prejudice analysis 
from Dominguez Benitez, that looks whether there is a

 Unless the Court has any further questions,

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Feigin, can I ask you 
the same question that I asked Mr. Yablon, do you know

plea it -- does the Court ever find that

extenuating circumstances to be prejudicial; we don't 

have a problem with that.
