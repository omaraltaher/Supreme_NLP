CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 01-301, Tom L. Carey v. Tony Eugene Saffold.


Mr. Cross.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY A. CROSS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. CROSS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


AEDPA's language, purpose, and legislative


history supports the conclusion that the circuit conflict


over the meaning of pending in 28 U.S.C., section


2244(d)(2) can be resolved by reversing the Ninth Circuit


for one or more of the following three reasons. 


First, the Ninth Circuit improperly permits


tolling for substantial delay if the State Supreme Court


addresses the merits when denying an application for


collateral review. 


Second, under California's system of successive


original petitions, nothing is pending under State or


Federal law following the denial of an application for


collateral review and prior to the proper filing of a new


application for review. 


And third, the gap theory relied upon by the


district court more accurately reflects congressional

intent and the policy judgments underlying AEDPA's 1-year


statute of limitations than does the Ninth Circuit's


interpretation of pending --


QUESTION:  Mr. Cross, would you explain to us


what it is in California -- what is the system and the


time within which post-conviction relief can be applied


for in California courts?  Is there any time limit for


filing it with the trial court level?


MR. CROSS:  It's within a reasonable time, Your


Honor, the general rule of timeliness.  However, within a


reasonable time has parameters which I can give you the


case of In re Harris, a California Supreme Court case,


which addresses that.  Specifically, it says the following


in footnote 7.  That's -- the cite is 5 Cal.4th at 828-


829.  Footnote 7 says the following.  The general rule


regarding timeliness is the habeas corpus petition must be


filed within a reasonable time after the petitioner


counsel knew or with due diligence should have known the


facts underlying the claim, as well as the legal basis of


the claim. 


They then follow that up with two significant


points.  The first is, is that ineffective assistance of


counsel claims, which is the claim in this particular


litigation, should be filed as a verified -- excuse me --


a verified petition jointly with the direct appeal.  In

other words, if you know about the claim, you should file


it at that time. 


Now, as far as how long you should be able to


wait, the rules specifically state with regard to capital


cases, which are considered to be much more complex than


the average non-capital case, they give them a 90-day


period in which there is a presumption of timeliness so


that there is no substantial delay.  You have a


presumption that you have not exceeded substantial delay


if you do it within 90 days. 


QUESTION:  All right.  Now, here there was a


prompt filing in the -- at the trial court level.


MR. CROSS:  Pardon? 


QUESTION:  Here there was a prompt filing at the


trial court level for habeas, State habeas. 


MR. CROSS:  I would -- Your Honor, I would


respectfully disagree that it was prompt since he waited 5


years --


QUESTION:  Well, all right.  It was -- it was


within the statutory period that we have imposed for these


situations where it had -- AEDPA became effective. 


MR. CROSS:  He filed his claim with 7 days


remaining --


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. CROSS:  -- in the grace period of the

statute of limitations. 


QUESTION:  Now, after the trial court resolved


it and denied relief, then there's no review mechanism


other than filing an original writ with the court of


appeals?


MR. CROSS:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  Is that how it's done?


MR. CROSS:  Correct, in California. 


QUESTION:  And is that again a reasonable time


period within which to seek review by that mechanism in


the court of appeals?  Or is there a time limit?


MR. CROSS:  As far as the -- the time between


each original petition, there is no time limit.  You would


be looking at the overall time period because you're


dealing with -- Your Honor, with original petitions here. 


So he has every right in California to go directly to the


California Supreme Court or the Third District Court of


Appeal.


QUESTION:  Well, that's the traditional rule in


habeas corpus, at least in -- in England.


MR. CROSS:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  Wasn't it?  That you could go from


one court to another and have -- have a different judge


look at it in a different proceeding and get a different


result.

MR. CROSS:  Absolutely, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  But if he goes -- if he's -- I take


it, under the California system, if he starts in the


Supreme Court of California, and there's a fact issue,


they're going to say, go back to the trial court and start


there.  They're not going to have a factual trial, are


they?


MR. CROSS:  In fact, Your Honor, I'd like to


correct a misunderstanding that's promoted by the


respondent's brief.  If you look at the red brief at page


31, it gives the impression that you are indicating that


if you were to go directly to the California Supreme


Court --


QUESTION:  Whereabouts on page 31?


MR. CROSS:  On page 31 at the top paragraph,


there's a reference in the third line to In re Hillery. 


Then there's a reference, the Ninth Circuit case, Harris


v. Superior Court, indicating that California appellate


courts may refuse to entertain habeas and that it be sent


back to the trial court.  That's an incorrect statement of


law, and I'll refer you to the actual footnote on that


page, footnote 19, referring to California Rule of Court


56(a)(1).


The problem with respondent's position is that


he gives a literal quote of 56(a)(1) and it sounds like

that's the proposition that you're referring to, but he


ignores to cite to the subsection (h), which is, as of


January 1st of this year, is now labeled subsection (i),


which specifically states, quote -- and the title of the


subsection is proceedings not covered by this rule. 


Quote:  the provisions of this rule shall not apply to


applications for a writ of habeas corpus or to petitions


for review pursuant to rules 57, 58, and 59.


QUESTION:  Well, what happens --


QUESTION:  So, you -- you can begin in a higher


court.


MR. CROSS:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  You don't have to begin --


MR. CROSS:  Right, correct. 


QUESTION:  What happens if you do begin in a


higher court and -- and there are disputed factual issues? 


How do they resolve the factual issues?


MR. CROSS:  The -- that is explained, Your


Honor, in Harris v. Superior Court, the Ninth Circuit


opinion --


QUESTION:  Well, I haven't read --


QUESTION:  Why don't you tell us?


MR. CROSS:  I will tell you, Your Honor.  The --


the way it is handled is the California Supreme Court


around 1969 set up a procedure in which for original

petitions in the appellate court that are filed there,


either in the -- the district court of appeal or the


California Supreme Court, they can have a special master,


or they can send it back to the trial court, so that


there's no prevention from them taking the court and


deciding it with or without the hearing.  But a prima


facie case must be made to them in order for those --


QUESTION:  Did -- in the proceedings involved in


this particular case, did either of the appellate courts


go the -- do that?


MR. CROSS:  No.  There was -- the -- the


district court of appeal is a one-line denial, simply


stating denied.  And in the California Supreme Court, the


petition was denied on the merits and for lack of


diligence.


QUESTION:  But in this --


QUESTION:  What happens just as a practical


matter?  You go to the superior court on a collateral


attack with a -- with a petition for a writ, and the court


makes lots of findings and rulings of law.  Some of those


rulings of law are absolutely wrong, but still, the


ultimate outcome may be in doubt.  And so then the


petitioner, the original petitioner, wants to go to the


court of appeals.  Does -- does he annex what happens in


-- in the superior court just for the enlightenment of the

court of appeals as to what the issues are or what the


wrong rulings were, what the right rulings were, what the


findings were? 


MR. CROSS:  The forms, Your Honor, are in the


joint appendix where you are expected to indicate -- it's


-- all three petitions use the same judicial counsel form. 


California Supreme Court petition -- if you want to look,


it starts at page 31.  And there -- I believe there is a


question which asks the defendant if they've sought review


in another court and to explain what the finding was of


that court and what claims were requested.  That would be,


for example, question 9, did you seek review in the --


excuse me. 


QUESTION:  Well, it's just background.  I -- I


see where to find it now. 


MR. CROSS:  The -- that's the extent of it.  And


so, the purpose of that question is to determine whether


or not it's a -- it's a successive petition so they cannot


-- if they had gone to the lower court, it can't be


remanded back because the -- if the petition has been


denied in the lower court, they don't want to send it back


for an evidentiary hearing to the same judge or court who


has gone through the proceeding before and denied it.


QUESTION:  Well, getting to the issue in the


case, the respondent's brief points out that under the

theory you propose, what would happen if it's the -- the


State that's appealing or filing a new -- not appealing,


but filing a new action?  The -- the prisoner wins in --


in the lower court, and then the State files an action. 


How -- how would you count that or not count that so far


as the limitations period is concerned?


MR. CROSS:  That is the most difficult question


that is posed, without question, Your Honor.  The response


I would have is it appears to me that Congress perhaps did


not think of that particular scenario other than perhaps


that under 2244(d)(1)(B), the State-created impediment


issue would take care of the extreme case where the --


where the State was trying to prevent the person's time


from --


QUESTION:  This is the case where the petitioner


prevails --


MR. CROSS:  Right. 


QUESTION:  -- in superior court, and by statute,


now California allows the State to appeal that.


MR. CROSS:  Correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Well, certainly that would be -- that


would be pending all that time, would it not? 


MR. CROSS:  If you --


QUESTION:  Or would it not?

not an appellate system in a State like California, I


don't think it would be.


QUESTION:  Well, but you know, it can -- it


could be not an appellate system from the point of view of


the petitioner who has to have an original petition each


-- each time he goes again to a new court.  But the


legislature said, with respect to the State, if the -- if


the State loses, it can appeal, then that would be an


appellate proceeding, wouldn't it?


MR. CROSS:  For California -- under California


law, Your Honor, absolutely.  But as far as this statute


is concerned, I think we're interested in what the Federal


law is and how the Congress would have viewed it.


QUESTION:  So, looking at how Federal law --


QUESTION:  But I -- but -- if -- if I may, just


one moment, Justice Breyer. 


What the Chief Justice suggests is that I -- I


did not pose a problem because what happens is is that the


State simply appeals the -- what it thinks to be the


erroneous ruling, and that means the action is still


pending.  But I -- I thought from our earlier interchange


that you thought there was a bigger problem than that.


MR. CROSS:  I think there is a bigger problem


because if there is -- it depends on when finality occurs,


and if -- if you have an original proceeding and the

decision is final upon that decision, the clock would, I


would assume, start at least under California law.  The


case laws that's referred to in the yellow brief under


subsection (c) --


QUESTION:  Well, but the Chief Justice suggests


it's not rocket science for us to say it's still pending


if there's an appeal.


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I thought your --


QUESTION:  Or am I missing something? 


QUESTION:  I am confused now.  I thought your


position was that the case may well be pending, as Justice


Kennedy says, but there's no application pending --


MR. CROSS:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  -- on the appeal.  The application


has been disposed of in the first court.  There's an


appeal, but there's no longer an application pending.  And


that's how the statute reads, not the case is pending.


MR. CROSS:  Right. 


QUESTION:  There is an appeal?  I thought that


what happened -- I guess I'm mixed up.  Maybe go back to


Justice O'Connor.  But I thought I understood this.  I


thought that they -- but that there is -- first of all,


you file in the district court normally.  You don't have


to in California.

QUESTION:  But almost always they'll go to the


superior court and file a petition.  And then in every


other State, the losing party would appeal, but in


California, they use different words.  The words are not


you appeal; the words are you file a new petition in the


court of appeals.  And indeed, if you lose there, the


words are not you have 10 days to seek review in the


Supreme Court; the words are you have whatever time you


want.  You have to file a new petition in the Supreme


Court, but if you're too late, they're going to tell you


you're too late. 


So, it functions exactly as if the words were


the following.  You must appeal within -- now, normally it


will say 60 days, but in California it says within a


reasonable time. 


Now, those aren't the words of the statute, but


that's how it functions.  And if we don't read it that way


for purposes of Federal law, I guess we'd have to say that


in 10,000 case a year in the California superior courts


involving State habeas petitions -- as soon as those are


decided, they have to come here because they're all final


decisions of the State Supreme Court.  And 5,000 cases in


the courts of appeals in California.  Once they said


final, they have to come here.  So, we better have 20,000


new petitions each year from the State of California

because California happens to use the word final and new


petition instead of using the word appeal.


Now, what's wrong with what I said? 


MR. CROSS:  What's wrong with what you said,


Your Honor, first of all, is that although California may


say that it's final at that level, it does not prevent the


individual from going to either of the other two next


levels or skipping one and going to the other because they


are in fact original and in fact not -- it's more than


just mere semantics because they can go to California with


different claims.  It doesn't have to be the same petition


at all. 


QUESTION:  Justice Breyer suggests that when you


go, say, from the superior court to the district court of


appeal, it's -- it's like an appeal.  Well, now, is there


a transcript of the record made in the superior court that


you have to file with the district court of appeal like


you would in other appeals?


MR. CROSS:  Typically not.  There could be some


circumstances, under rare circumstances, where the


superior court would have some sort of evidentiary


hearing.  There would be a transcript. 


QUESTION:  Do you have to file a notice of


appeal in the superior court to go to the district court


of appeal?

MR. CROSS:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  In other words, in the -- I've never


heard of this, and I know a lot of California lawyers.  I


thought when you go to the superior court in California --


a prisoner and he says, I raise issues 1, 2, and 3, and


they have a record and they decide it.  And now you go to


the California court of appeals.  I thought in the normal


case they'll say, and the superior court judge made an


error, and the reason he made an error is because of --


and then they'll cite witnesses just like an appeal. 


Now, I grant you they can do some extra things.


They can raise extra issues if they want, and they don't


have to raise everything below like any other appeal.  But


aside from that, I don't know the differences.  I've been


around for a while.  I've seen a few cases.  I've never


noticed some big difference.  Now, you'll tell me I'm all


wrong about California, and I'm open to hearing that.


MR. CROSS:  The California case law, in fact,


indicates that --


QUESTION:  I'm not interested in California case


law.  I want to know what the practice is in California. 


MR. CROSS:  The practice is quite different from


the description that you gave. 


QUESTION:  Fine.  That's what I want to know.

the exact statistics, but in my 15 years of experience in


practicing, I have seen probably around 40 to 50 percent


of the cases not go to the trial court, that in fact, very


commonly they go directly to the California Supreme Court,


and they are denied.  That's a very common experience in


California --


QUESTION:  Then can they go -- start over again


and go down to the trial court and the court of appeals?


MR. CROSS:  Not -- Your Honor, not on those same


claims, they certainly can't.  California and other States


would perhaps bar successive petitions if it's the same


claims.  It doesn't necessarily prevent them from coming


back with something else that they've discovered at a


later time --


QUESTION:  There's no bar in California to going


back as many times as you want if you have a new claim


each time? 


MR. CROSS:  There are escape clauses in


California, as well as other States, that -- that allow


you, if you discover, just like the Federal statute, new


claims. 


QUESTION:  All right.  What -- what is the


general rule in other States that are unlike California


that say you go for post-conviction relief first to the


trial court?  Let them decide it.  Then you have 30 days

or whatever it is to go to the court of appeals.  If


that's denied, you have X number of days to go to the


State Supreme Court. 


Now, in a State like that, is it the case that


in applying AEDPA in this statute of limitations, that we


exclude all of the time for decision making as well as


that statutory time within which to file the appeal?


MR. CROSS:  AEDPA grants --


QUESTION:  Is that what a majority of courts are


holding? 


MR. CROSS:  The majority of courts are holding


that -- and the statute specifically provides for tolling


for all the time in which the decision -- excuse me -- in


which the petition is before a court.  That's, you know,


specifically provided. 


QUESTION:  Well, yes, but is it -- is it the


case that most courts are holding, under the scheme I


described, that not only while the court is deciding it,


but the time allowed to enable them to go to the next


higher court is excluded as well? 


MR. CROSS:  The majority of courts are holding


that you will get time for the appeal time that's


specified by the State, for example, 60 days or 90 days.


QUESTION:  Yes, all right.  So, the problem with


California is we have no time specified.  We have a

reasonable time.  How are we supposed to decide what's


reasonable in California?  Should we certify a question


back to the California Supreme Court and say, was this a


19


reasonable time?  How do we know? 


MR. CROSS:  One --


QUESTION:  What do we do?


MR. CROSS:  One suggestion that was made in the


amicus briefs by the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation is


to adopt the nearest analogous State rule, which in


California under rule 2 or 30 through 31 would be 60 days. 


That's one thing that could be done by the court which


would stretch the statutory language to -- to bring


California into an appellate system which --


QUESTION:  Wouldn't that be up to California to


do?  What we have is a system that allows a reasonable


time.  I'm asking you how we determine what is a


reasonable time. 


MR. CROSS:  I think, Your Honor, the way to


determine a reasonable time would be to look at the


California rules for their original habeas petitions and


determine that under California law, we know that -- that


you are expected to file no longer than 90 days in a


capital case without having a presumption of timeliness --

outside limit for a determination of what would be


reasonable. 


QUESTION:  But may I just ask this question?  If


in this case the California court did decide on the merits


-- apparently -- it's a little ambiguous, but it seems to


-- wouldn't that definitely disclose a decision that it


was reasonable?  They took jurisdiction.


MR. CROSS:  No, Your Honor.  I -- I believe that


the -- the interpretation would be that even though a -- a


State Supreme Court decided, at least alternatively on the


merits -- simply indicates that for one reason or another,


they decided to perhaps excuse untimeliness if they didn't


have a -- an untimeliness finding --


QUESTION:  To excuse untimeliness, they're


saying in this particular case we think it must have been


reasonable.  Aren't -- isn't that -- doesn't that


necessarily follow? 


MR. CROSS:  In this particular case, they said


he acted with a lack of diligence. 


QUESTION:  But that might have been --


QUESTION:  No, but it didn't excuse


untimeliness.  Untimeliness was one of the two bases for


their decision, wasn't it? 


MR. CROSS:  In this case, absolutely. 


QUESTION:  We don't know whether that

untimeliness was the 5 years that he took to even get


started. 


There's one fact question here that may make the


rest of this rather abstract.  This petitioner says that


he never got notice of the -- of the intermediate


appellate court's decision and he -- when he did -- I


mean, the only gap here that's relevant for AEDPA -- the 5


years is gone.  He gets that free.  But the only gap we're


talking about, as I understand it, is the 4-and-a-half


months.  And he says, as to that, I never knew.  I wrote a


letter and finally they told me, and within 3 days after I


got notice, I filed in the next court.  So, I was diligent


from the time I knew of that decision. 


There is no -- there's been no determination by


anybody whether that 4-and-a-half-month interval was


beyond his control.  I mean, you recognize that there


would be an exception for situations beyond his control. 


So, how do we determine whether there was any lack of


diligence with respect to that 4-and-a-half months?  This


record is totally blank on it. 


MR. CROSS:  Your Honor, this situation is even


more perplexing than what you set forth because there are


three possibilities.  One is that it's the 5-year period


the California is returning to -- referring to.  Another


possibility it's just the 4-and-a-half-month.  And the

third possibility is the combination of all of those


periods.


The question simply is what is meant by timely


and what is meant by properly pursuing.


QUESTION:  Well, and also I think what is meant


by pending because if -- if we were -- if it were


determined that these separate matters, as you say, before


three different courts were pending only during the time


those particular courts had them for consideration, it


might be quite a different result than if you say look at


the reasonableness of the whole series of proceedings


together.


MR. CROSS:  Your Honor, absolutely that is


correct.  If we look at the language --


QUESTION:  Mr. Cross, as -- as I understand your


submission, it doesn't matter.  That was not the ground on


which the Ninth Circuit decided the case, you contend. 


They decided it simply on the ground that the Supreme


Court of California addressed the merits.  End of case.


MR. CROSS:  Right. 


QUESTION:  Right? 


MR. CROSS:  The California Supreme Court holding


and the -- the problem it presents for the statute is --


is that it eviscerates the statute by holding that as long


as -- as the State Supreme Court addresses the merits,

that regardless of the length of the delay, which could be


not just 4-and-a-half months in this case, but 4-and-a-


half years or 4-and-a-half decades, they will excuse the


delay. 


QUESTION:  But isn't the -- the answer that --


your -- your friends on the other side give a -- a good


answer.  They say, look, the -- the point of requiring


speed here is to preserve the State interest and make sure


States don't have to retry cases years and years later and


there's relative finality and so on. 


If the State wants to allow this kind of, in


effect, dilatory proceeding, the State has no claim to be


offended by it.  It's in the State's power.  So, if the


State wants to give you 10 years for habeas, the State


hasn't got any complaint.  It gave the 10 years and it can


change its rule if it wants to.  What's the answer to


that? 


MR. CROSS:  Your Honor, the answer to that is


that this is a Federal statute not a State statute.  We're


not changing the --


QUESTION:  It is a Federal statute that is keyed


to a State statute, and the point of doing this is to


preserve the State's interest in -- in finality in their


own proceedings and to -- to protect the State from being


forced, in effect, to retry cases years and years in the

future after the -- the evidence has grown stale. 

MR. CROSS:  That's --


QUESTION:  And if that -- if those are the


objectives of the statute -- and I thought they were --


then California, in effect, or any State can control the


proceedings simply by its own time schedule. 


MR. CROSS:  Your Honor, that is certainly one of


the objectives of the statute, but there are a number of


policy interests related to the statute of limitations


itself which is part of AEDPA.  You're absolutely correct


in that finality is one of the three main concerns of


AEDPA itself, but there are other concerns and policy


concerns related to the statute itself. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Cross, a State Supreme Court that


had that attitude, that didn't care that you were late,


would not -- would not have dismissed this case on two


grounds, one of which is it's untimely.  That's not what


we have here.  We don't have a situation in which the


California Supreme Court said, we don't care how late it


is; we're going to decide it on the merits.  It decided on


two grounds, one of which is you -- you are too late under


our -- under our rules.  And -- and the Ninth Circuit just


ignored that.  Isn't that right? 


MR. CROSS:  That's absolutely right, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Isn't the counter argument equally

possible?  A State that was really concerned about


timeliness would not have decided the case also on the


merits as an alternative ground.  Therefore, if it does


decide that it's significant enough to get into the


merits, we ought to take the -- the State Supreme Court at


its word and say, if there was a merits determination, it


obviously was not untimely in -- in any dispositive sense. 


Why isn't that an equally good interpretation? 


MR. CROSS:  I think, Your Honor, this Court has


stated before in Coleman v. Thompson that we -- that you


don't want to direct the State courts how to issue their


rulings for whatever State reasons they have for doing it.


QUESTION:  No, but when the State says two


things and they seem to be in contradiction -- if it's


untimely, then you don't get to the merits.  It's -- it's


unreasonable in time.  If you do get to the merits, it


suggests that there is something timely about it.


And all, I think, the Ninth Circuit was saying


and all I'm suggesting is we're not mind readers.  We


can't say, well, we guess they really meant the first part


of -- the first reason they gave or they really meant the


second reason.  We're simply going to come up with a --


with a rule that everyone will understand and that the


State courts can understand. 


And if they get to the merits, we're going to

deem it timely because we -- we assume these people are


not going to be reaching merits decisions on -- on matters


that are totally untimely under their law.  Why -- why


doesn't that respect the State courts, give a rule that


everybody pretty much can follow and know where he stands?


MR. CROSS:  Your Honor, because it would, in


effect, eviscerate the statute of limitations under


Federal law.  If you have unlimited tolling for 20 or 30


years, there is not much left of the 1-year Federal


statute of limitations.  And under Harris v. Reed,


alternative --


QUESTION:  What's left is a 1-year Federal


statute of limitations after the conclusion of the State


proceedings, and if the State proceedings were begun in a


timely fashion, I don't know what else the statute is


supposed to accomplish. 


MR. CROSS:  Well, Your Honor, the statute --


statutory schemes across the country -- there's a wide


variety, of which there are over 20 States that have no


statute of limitations.


QUESTION:  Do you know how the California


Supreme Court operates generally with respect to petitions


of this kind, post-conviction petitions?  Is it common for


them to say on the merits, but anyway it's untimely, or do


they often say it's untimely, that's the end of it without

going on to the merits? 


MR. CROSS:  It's usually a combination, Your


Honor.  There's in fact, a dispute between the members of


the California Supreme Court as to whether to even pose


procedural bars.  Justice Brown has argued that it only


should be addressed on the merits.  So, there's a


combination usually or sometimes just a denial on the


merits. 


If you don't mind, Your Honor, I'd like to


reserve the remainder of my time. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Cross. 


Mr. Ogden, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. OGDEN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. OGDEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


I would like to go directly to the two most


difficult questions that I need to answer this morning and


which have been addressed extensively thus far.


First, that the rule adopted by the -- by the


unanimous courts of appeals that any gaps between stages


of the State habeas process should be tolled so long as


the next stage is initiated in a timely fashion should


apply to California. 


And second --

Alderson Reporting Company 

28


QUESTION:  What happens if it -- go on.  Give us


your second --


MR. OGDEN:  And -- and the second point that I'd


like to address is that under that rule on the record in


this case, there is an insufficient basis to conclude that


the filing in the State Supreme Court was late and


therefore that the judgment below should be affirmed.


QUESTION:  Are you going to cover the question


of whether these various actions were pending and for how


long? 


MR. OGDEN:  Yes, Your Honor.  That's the first


-- that's -- that's the first subject that I'd like to


cover because I know that one of the concerns and one of


the difficulties of this case is applying the concepts of


the statute to California's unique system. 


Now, California's system of original writ should


be subject to the rule that tolls the entire period of


time for two reasons.  First, that is the best


understanding of the text of the statute because


California's system --


QUESTION:  The text of AEDPA or the text of


California's statute?


MR. OGDEN:  Of AEDPA, Your Honor, of -- of


section 2244(d)(2).


Because California's system functions as an

integrated appellate style process for prisoners seeking


to exhaust State remedies. 


And second, because just as in other States, the


so-called gap theory espoused by the State would


discourage prisoners from making full use of California's


process and encourage premature Federal filings. 


Now, turning to the text of the statute -- and


Justice Scalia asked about the -- about the word


application in particular -- Congress wrote a statute in


general terms intended to apply nationwide.  It does not


turn on the particular form of pleading or the nature of


the action.  To the contrary, an application within the


meaning of the statute is simply a request for relief so


long as it is submitted in the context of, as the statute


phrases it, State post-conviction or other collateral


review. 


Now, that request for relief is distinct from


the claims that support it, and it is pending so long as


it -- as it is unresolved in the State system. 


QUESTION:  You -- you say the -- the application


is distinct from the claim.  Granted, both words -- how


does that work out? 


MR. OGDEN:  The claims are the arguments that


support the request for relief in -- in a habeas or post-


conviction context.  Typically the request is to be

released from an unconstitutional confinement.  That


request is supported by -- by a set of claims.  And -- and


it's the request that constitutes the application. 


QUESTION:  But, you know, we were confronted


with precisely the same argument in Artuz which dealt with


what constitutes a properly filed application.  And the


argument was if the claim is not a proper claim, if it


does not lie under the State law, it is not a properly


filed application.  And we held, no, that's not so.  An


application is an application and a claim is -- is a


claim.  And the -- the application is properly filed so


long as it's given to the -- you know, to the proper clerk


in the proper court and -- and so forth.  Now, dealing


with the very same -- very same provision of law. 


MR. OGDEN:  Yes, Your Honor.  I believe my


argument is entirely consistent with Artuz.  Indeed, it's


-- it's really based on the reasoning there. 


Artuz makes a distinction between bars that go


to claims and bars that go to the form of the -- of the


application itself.  My submission is that the application


is the request for relief, that is, regardless of what


form it takes and what kind of proceeding, it is a request


that contains claims in the same way that an application


contains claims.  A request is an application.  And that


request, the request for relief, continues to be pending

within the meaning of the statute until the -- until it is


resolved within the State system. 


Now, in the California system, that request for


relief, that request to be released from confinement,


continues to be unresolved so long as there is another


court to which one can bring a -- a petition to review a


decision. 


QUESTION:  Or presumably you could go back and


forth to a number of California courts, if you come up


with, you know, a different argument and that sort of


thing.


MR. OGDEN:  Yes, Your Honor, you could present


different claims.  But the way the California system


functions is that the -- the design of it where factual


development is required, quite naturally, is that that


claim should be brought in the superior court. 


As we say in our brief, if you attempt to file


an original petition initially in a higher court and


factual development is required, typically if it's a non-


capital case, what that court will do is to issue an order


to show cause, returnable in the superior court.  And once


you are there as a -- as a petitioner, if you lose, your


only recourse for further review is to file an original


petition yet again above. 


Now, critically from the standpoint of

understanding whether this is an appellate system or a


system of completely independent free-standing


applications, it's important to understand that when one


goes from the superior court where one develops a record,


Your Honor, to -- to the court of appeal, that -- that


next filing is not considered a successive petition under


California law.  It's not considered a second --


QUESTION:  What do you mean -- what do you mean


by a -- do you mean the same thing as an original


petition?


MR. OGDEN:  It's called an original writ.


QUESTION:  Yes.  So, what -- what do you mean by


the term successive? 


MR. OGDEN:  Successive petition is a procedural


bar under California law, which if you bring a second


petition that contains claims that could have been, but


were not, contained in your first petition or that


contains the same claims as were contained in your first


petition, it's dismissed as a matter of procedural law in


California as a successive petition.  That successive


petition bar does not apply --


QUESTION:  What does it look like in practice? 


I mean, I had thought, as you were saying, that whatever


they call it, they call the trial court original, they


call the court of appeals original, they call the supreme

court original.  But despite that, to an outside observer


who wasn't looking at the names, it would look pretty much


like any other State where you get an initial hearing and


then you get some appeals. 


Now, there's obviously the difference, you could


file new claims at the second level, but leaving that


aside, it would look -- now, the attorney general said I'm


wrong on that, absolutely wrong, that that isn't what it


looks like, that sometimes at least it's random, sometimes


they -- they -- just as many might likely file, I guess,


in the court of appeals as the district court.  They might


file in the supreme court.  Maybe they look for appeal in


the -- in the trial court.  I don't know.  But it's a


random and -- and, indeed, if you go to the court of


appeals, you'll see they don't even look at the record in


the trial court.


All right.  Now, he says that's how it's worked. 


He's been around a long time.  And at that point, I'm not


sure what to do frankly. 


MR. OGDEN:  Well -- well, it's -- it is


difficult because so much of this turns on California law. 


But --


QUESTION:  I mean, what does it look like?  I


don't know how you get to that question.

MR. OGDEN:  19 P.2d, Pacific Second, 1171.


QUESTION:  What's the date of that case?


MR. OGDEN:  It's 2001, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Pacific Second? 


MR. OGDEN:  Pacific Third, 1171 at 1184.


That -- that case makes clear in discussing the


situation in which a subsequent original writ is filed --


originally filed in the superior court and you have


findings of fact made by the superior court.  It is then


filed subsequently in the court of appeal and then --


QUESTION:  When you say it is then filed, what


do you mean by it? 


MR. OGDEN:  A petition encompassing the same


claims is filed in the court of appeal and then again in


the supreme court. 


First of all, the record is -- the record


generally forms the basis for that review.  And in Gardner


against California in 1969, looking at this very system


for -- for handling habeas petitions on original writ,


this Court decided that the system was sufficiently


similar to an appellate process that a habeas petitioner


filing an original writ in the court of appeal was

entitled at State expense to a transcript of the


proceeding in the -- in the superior court because the


procedure in the court of appeal is essentially record


review. 


QUESTION:  Mr. -- Mr. Cross said -- and it would


be extraordinary if it's record review, but you don't have


to file the record.  When -- when you go into the court of


appeals, do you have to file the record of -- of the


decision below? 


MR. OGDEN:  You certainly can file the record


and the clerk can request it. 


QUESTION:  Do you have to?


QUESTION:  Do you have to?


MR. OGDEN:  I don't know the answer to that,


Your Honor, as to whether it's required. 


QUESTION:  Is it ordinarily done?


MR. OGDEN:  I -- I think ordinarily there -- the


record consists of the petition and the decision below.


But if there is a hearing where witnesses are presented, I


believe it is ordinarily done, and that's why --


QUESTION:  That's not what the -- that's not


what Mr. Cross said. 


MR. OGDEN:  That's --


QUESTION:  What is your -- I mean, Mr. Cross


apparently has been practicing in California for 15 years.

I think if you're going to make -- you don't claim to be


personally familiar with California law, do you?


MR. OGDEN:  No, I don't, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  Then I think perhaps you


should cite some authority. 


MR. OGDEN:  Well, I -- I cite for the


proposition that -- that the record is part of the -- the


process in the court of appeal, both the Resendez case --


QUESTION:  But you say the record is part of the


process in the court of appeal.  That's a very, very vague


statement. 


MR. OGDEN:  Well --


QUESTION:  What we want to know is typically in


an appeal, you'd have a record from the superior court. 


You're appealing from the superior court or the district


court of appeal, you have to -- you must file the record. 


It's a part of the -- before the court of appeals will


hear your claim. 


MR. OGDEN:  The best I can do, Your Honor, is to


refer to these three cases -- the Resendez case, the


California Supreme Court decision at -- which I've given


the cite for; In re Wright, which is 78 Cal. App. 3d at


801 to 802; People against Singer, which is 226 Cal. App.


3d at 32 -- which make clear that the process of reviewing


these matters coming from the superior court where there's

been a prior petition there and the same claims are


brought in the next court is a process of reviewing the


record, and where what is presented are findings of fact


by the superior court that are based on credibility


determinations, great weight is given to those credibility


determinations by the reviewing court.  And -- and that is


the -- the fundamental functionality, the way the system


works. 


It can be used in other ways without question. 


A petitioner can attempt to file, you know, claims at a


higher level. 


QUESTION:  You've practiced here a lot.  I mean,


if the -- if the superior court decision in a State habeas


matter is a final decision and there's no more review of


it in the State, I guess then we have jurisdiction to


review that.  But I have never seen someone come here


directly from the decision of the superior court of


California in a State habeas matter.  Maybe they just


haven't thought of it. 


MR. OGDEN:  Well, no, Your Honor, they're not


permitted to, and I think that's a very important --


QUESTION:  We wouldn't issue habeas when -- when


you have failed to exhaust all of your State remedies


whether it's by appeal or not by appeal.  If you still


have State remedies available, we wouldn't issue Federal

habeas.  It -- it would be useless to come here.


MR. OGDEN:  This -- this Court's decision in the


O'Sullivan case has been applied by the Ninth Circuit in


-- in the case called James against Giles, which states


that it is a requirement, in order to fully exhaust one's


State remedies, that one file and submit one's claims to


the California Supreme Court. 


QUESTION:  Of course, and that applies whether


it's an appeal or whether it's an independent action.  I


mean, it -- it sheds no light upon -- upon the central


issue here. 


MR. OGDEN:  Well, I --


QUESTION:  Whichever one it is, you have to


exhaust those remedies before you apply for Federal


habeas.


MR. OGDEN:  I think it sheds substantial light


on it, Your Honor, because as was made clear in Duncan


against Walker by this Court, the very purpose of this


tolling provision is to facilitate and to, indeed, promote


the full and complete exhaustion of State remedies. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  Well, let me ask you this. 


Suppose that a -- a prisoner has filed in California for


State post-conviction review in the superior court and


then in the court of appeals and then makes no filing in


the State supreme court, could but years go by.  Then

there's a petition filed for habeas in the Federal court. 


Now, the Federal court under your view presumably would


have to say, no, it's still pending in the State court.


MR. OGDEN:  I believe the appropriate course for


the Federal court in that situation --


QUESTION:  What would you do? 


MR. OGDEN:  -- would be to apply this Court's


decision in O'Sullivan against Boerckel and deem the


petition to be unexhausted.  At that point, the petitioner


could apply to the California Supreme Court.


QUESTION:  And say it is unexhausted and -- and


the -- a Federal statute of limitations hasn't run. 


MR. OGDEN:  Because simply it's unknowable.  You


asked the question earlier whether -- who decides whether


it's a reasonable time or not, and I think it's very clear


the design of the statute of -- of 2244(d)(2) is that the


State of California decides.  Whether something continues


to be pending in exhaustion law is a question of whether


it is possible whether there is a -- an available


procedure under State law to raise the claim to a higher


level. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  Let's -- let's continue that


hypothetical that Justice O'Connor gives.  There's a long


wait, years of wait.  They go to the -- the prisoner goes


to the California Supreme Court.  The California Supreme

Court said, you are late.  You have lacked diligence.  We


will not rule on the merits.  Dismissed.  When does the


Federal statute -- how does the Federal statute apply


there?


MR. OGDEN:  That implicates a -- a circuit split


that's not presented in this case, Your Honor.  There is a


difference of opinion among the circuits about how to


apply the -- the endpoint of -- of the tolling process. 


In the majority of circuits, tolling terminates at the


point it is no longer possible to file a --


QUESTION:  What is the position that you urge


upon us here in that instance? 


MR. OGDEN:  Your Honor, I don't believe it's --


it is important for my client what the answer to that


question is because the second point I want to make this


morning is that the submission to the California Supreme


Court was not late under California law. 


QUESTION:  I'm trying to -- I'm trying to


interpret the statute, and so I imagined this case and I


want to know how it would come out --


MR. OGDEN:  I think the most --


QUESTION:  -- under your view.


MR. OGDEN:  I'm sorry.  I think the most natural


interpretation of the statute is the majority of the


court's view which is that it continues to be pending

until it is too late to file a submission, and then the


opportunity to file -- if you file for leave to file out


of time, that would then resume the tolling if that motion


were granted.  In California, that --


QUESTION:  Retroactively.  I mean, there's a


split.  There are real problems and -- and those problems,


as well as the problems with the California system, seem


to me good reason to read the statute the way it's written


so that there has to be an application pending, not -- not


a case pending, but an application.  On appeal, it could


be the application of either the petitioner or the


government if it lost, but the only time counted is the --


is the time during the pending application.  Then you


would not have to worry about these problems.  What


happens if they accept a -- you know, a late petition? 


Does it automatically toll retroactively for the -- for


the period after the due date and so forth? 


MR. OGDEN:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  None of those problems exist if you


-- if you say it's pending when it's pending. 


MR. OGDEN:  I think those problems are more


complicated in a system like California's or North


Carolina's which is an appellate system that involves an


unreasonable delay standard than they are in a -- in a


system that has clear time lines.  And California and

North Carolina, if they don't like the way it's playing


out under their provisions, can simply create time


lines --


QUESTION:  Mr. Ogden --


QUESTION:  Just so -- just so I understand your


answer.  In the case that I put that I didn't quite get


the whole -- the California court says, you've waited 4


years.  That's too late.  How do I apply the statute of


limitations to that context or the pending rule that we're


discussing? 


MR. OGDEN:  I -- I believe there are about three


different ways that you can --


QUESTION:  And what is -- what is your


submission as to how we ought to interpret the rule in


that instance? 


MR. OGDEN:  My submission would be that until


the California Supreme Court indicates how long the time


period is that -- that he would have had to file, the best


thing to do is to look to evidence of other cases that


have been decided by California to determine what is an


acceptable gap in the process. 


And that's why in this case the evidence is


absolutely overwhelming that the 4-and-a-half-month period


that the State relies on simply wasn't the basis for the


California Supreme Court's decision.

QUESTION:  How is that?  It seems to me the


record is a blank on that, and with all this talk, if you


don't count those 4-and-a-half months, he's timely no --


no matter whether it's discrete applications.  So, what do


we do?  He says, I never got that notice.  And it's not


established in the record whether he did or he didn't. 


MR. OGDEN:  Well, the only evidence in the


record is that he did not.  He submitted a sworn statement


to that effect in the California Supreme Court in his


petition. 


But as the Ninth Circuit said, there are two


possible bases for the lack of diligence finding in the


record.  One is 5 years before he filed his initial claim. 


The other is this 4-and-a-half-month period in which he


says and swears that he did not receive notice. 


The -- when you look at the record of the minute


orders that have been entered by California on the very


day and in the very weeks -- the California Supreme Court


-- around when Mr. Saffold's case was dismissed, you see


that cases -- for example, the Davis case.  There was an


18-month gap between the decision in the court of appeal


and the petition in the California Supreme Court, and the


California Supreme Court simply denied it, which under the


Ylst standard, looking through, goes back to the merits


determination before.  No lack of diligence, no

untimeliness. 


In the Sampson case, over 9 months had elapsed


between the court of appeal decision and the supreme court


decision.  Again, absolutely no indication of a lack of


diligence or untimeliness. 


In the Viegas case, over 7 months elapsed


between the court of appeal and the decision -- and the


petition.  No explanation from Mr. Viegas, as there wasn't


from Davis and nothing meaningful from Sampson for the


delay again.  And the Saenz case is another. 


So, there are those four --


QUESTION:  Is -- is there any -- some


possibility that those perhaps inconsistent rulings coming


from the Supreme Court of California might be based on


what Mr. Cross referred to as the division of opinion


within that court as to whether they should give any sort


of an explanation? 


MR. OGDEN:  Your Honor, I think anything is


possible because, as -- as somebody said, we're in a mind-


reading mode here, and so certainly that's possible.  And


I can't stand here and tell you it is impossible that they


simply acted in an -- in an irrational and inconsistent


fashion. 


The fact is while Mr. Saffold submitted a -- an


explanation which, at least on the surface, has some

appeal to it, none of these others did, and yet much


longer periods of time --


QUESTION:  That's not the basis on which the


Ninth Circuit decided the case.  It did not resolve


whether, you know, the 4-and-a-half or the other one.  It


-- it did not do it.  It just simply said, since the


Supreme Court of California alternatively addressed the


merits, that's the end of it.  And so you're -- you're not


defending their basis for -- for deciding the case?


MR. OGDEN:  I think it's somewhat unclear what


the Ninth Circuit's basis was, Your Honor.  I concede


that.  To the extent that the Ninth Circuit held that a --


a ruling on the merits would trump a clear finding by the


-- by the California Supreme Court that the petition to it


was untimely, I think that would be an -- an incorrect


interpretation of the statute.  That's my view. 


QUESTION:  What would you say to the possibility


that we might certify the question to the California


Supreme Court whether this case was dismissed because it


was untimely? 


MR. OGDEN:  The critical question would be


whether the case was dismissed based on the gap between


the court of appeal and the supreme court as opposed to


the -- the portion that preceded the original filing in


the -- in the trial court which obviously could not make

the case stop pending once it began to pend. 


But I believe that certification would not fit


the profile in California for certified questions.  They


-- they certify questions of law, and this is -- this is


an --


QUESTION:  Have -- have any courts considering


this AEDPA statute applied it in the way Justice Scalia


suggests that we look at pending and place all the


emphasis there and exclude all time after a decision by a


State court until the next filing? 


MR. OGDEN:  11 courts of appeals have considered


that issue to this point, Your Honor, and all 11 have


adopted the view that the entire period of time should be


tolled. 


QUESTION:  Were any of them dealing with a


system like California's? 


MR. OGDEN:  The Ninth Circuit in this case and


in the Nino case previously, but no other -- no other --


none of the other cases really deal with that --


QUESTION:  Can we use Justice Scalia -- he just


suggested an idea that -- that -- if this is right


factually as to how it works.  Suppose you go into the


district court -- the superior court, trial court.  All


right.  Now I get a decision there.  Now, I take it, under


California law, I cannot file a complaint about how the

judge decided it, i.e., an appeal, quotes, in any other


superior court, but I can do it in a higher court.  Am I


right?  Because they'll treat it as successive if I go to


the parallel level, but if I go to the next level, they


won't treat it as successive. 


MR. OGDEN:  That's my understanding. 


QUESTION:  But then if in fact I wait too long,


I'm beyond a reasonable time. 


MR. OGDEN:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  And so, to put in terms of exhausted,


unexhausted as if he did -- as he did, you'd say the only


unexhausted remedy you have left to you, once you're in


the superior court, is to go up, as long as you do it


within a reasonable time.  But once you exceed the


reasonable time, you're out.


MR. OGDEN:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  All right.  So, what we would have to


say is that that system, looking to the exhausted instead


of the technical word appeal, we'd get to approximately


the same place, and then our issue would be, well, was


this beyond a reasonable time or not.  And then I'd have


to say maybe we don't know.  We'd have to find out in some


way or other.  That -- that --


MR. OGDEN:  Well, I think the general


description is fine and I think it's true that we don't

know whether it was considered unreasonable by the


California Supreme Court. 


QUESTION:  I mean, I can't see how we can accept


the Ninth Circuit's reasoning frankly because they said


the very fact that they say both, the very fact that they


say we'll consider it on the merits but it's untimely,


that that means that it wasn't untimely.  Of course, they


didn't use the word untimely.  They used a different word


which is harder to understand. 


MR. OGDEN:  Your Honor, I think that we -- it's


-- while we don't know, I think that a fair reading of


this record would lead one to the conclusion that it was


not the 4-and-a-half months.  When we have four other


cases, two of them decided the same day, one of them


decided --


QUESTION:  But it's way beyond what any other


State would have, isn't it?  4-and-a-half months?  Unless


there's some excuse here that he didn't get the record or


he didn't know about it. 


MR. OGDEN:  Well, North Carolina has an undue


delay standard.  Massachusetts, until just very recently,


as the First Circuit explained in the Curry case just last


week, previously had no time limit, has now imposed a 30-


day time limit presumably to deal with some of these


problems.  The times in other States vary.  4-and-a-half

months is -- is somewhat longer than the certiorari time


in this Court, but it's not by an entire order of


magnitude.  And the point is that the California Supreme


Court routinely seems to reach the merits despite this


period. 


And in this case we have a 5-year delay staring


us in the face in which the only justification offered by


Mr. Saffold was that he needed to hire a private


investigator to -- essentially to interview the jurors. 


The magistrate judge in this case, applying the due


diligence standard of Federal law, which is in 2244 --


QUESTION:  This was a Federal magistrate?


MR. OGDEN:  The Federal magistrate, yes, Your


Honor, in -- in this case applying the Federal due


diligence standard.  Mr. Saffold suggested that the time


should be tolled for -- for the running of the entire


period because he had not discovered these claims.  And


the Federal magistrate, looking at it, said, well, you


should have discovered these claims long before.  you


didn't exercise due diligence. 


I think looking at the face -- at the -- at the


joint appendix at 38, looking at the face of the


application Mr. Saffold submitted to the California


Supreme Court where he attempts to justify the 5 years on


that basis and notes, with respect to the 4-and-a-half

months, that he only received notice the very day he


filed, the only reasonable interpretation is that they


relied on the 5 years, a period of time irrelevant to the


question of whether review in the supreme court was


unavailable.  And therefore, it is -- it is -- it would be


unreasonable for this Court to suppose that -- that the


period was the 4-and-a-half months.


This is somewhat similar to the approach to


questions of -- of -- related to procedural bars that this


Court adopted and modified in the Coleman against Thompson


case where -- where an underlying State decision leaves


reason to question whether the Federal bar is applicable,


this Court has gone ahead and decided the -- the merits of


the Federal claim because it's entirely within the power


of the State, the State of California or in the Coleman v.


Thompson circumstance, to be clear about the fact that


what was the period and when did it expire, or


alternatively, simply like most States, to have a clear,


definable period of time in which --


QUESTION:  Didn't the -- didn't the superior


court here, or at least the magistrate did, made a


specific finding to the effect that the 4-month delay was


not excusable, that it was an excessive delay?  Wasn't


there that finding below? 


MR. OGDEN:  The magistrate did not find that he

received notice earlier than he says.  What the magistrate


said was that he should have been more diligent in calling


the court and contacting them and so forth. 


QUESTION:  But it was a finding that the 4-


month period was the -- was a period of inexcusable delay.


MR. OGDEN:  He indicated -- suggested that he


would not --


QUESTION:  So, to say that that couldn't have


been what the supreme court was thinking of strikes me as


implausible. 


MR. OGDEN:  Your Honor, I'm not saying that it


couldn't be.  I'm saying it's far less likely that it was.


QUESTION:  But that wasn't reviewed by the Ninth


Circuit. 


MR. OGDEN:  No.  Indeed, the Ninth Circuit left


open the question of equitable tolling which depends on


that -- on that fact.  And furthermore, again, it doesn't


go to whether he received notice.  It's simply the opinion


of the magistrate that he should have called the court or


sent a letter to the court or done something within that


4-and-a-half-month period. 


QUESTION:  I do -- I do want, if I can, very


quickly to get to the question that Mr. Cross said was


very difficult and you raise it at pages 24 and 25 of your

brief.  You say what -- what happens if the -- under the


theory that the petitioner proposes, if the State files an


appeal when the State has lost.  And the Chief Justice


said, well, that shouldn't be a problem because we can


then easily say that the application is still pending. 


How long does the State have to appeal generally? 


MR. OGDEN:  I believe it's 30 days in


California. 


QUESTION:  So, then -- so, then it seems to me


that isn't a problem.  A, it's just 30 days, and B, you


can say that it's still pending.  So, that's not a big


problem. 


Mr. Cross, whose right of rebuttal we've


demolished, so I can't ask him, has said that that's a


very hard question. 


MR. OGDEN:  Well, I think it's a very hard


question for him because his -- his gap theory taken to


its literal extreme, taken to -- to the application that


it would -- that -- that gaps are not tolled, even in a --


an appeals situation, would cause that entire period of


time on the State's clock to run. 


QUESTION:  But why can't we easily say the


application is pending so long as the State has an


appeal --


MR. OGDEN:  Well, that --

QUESTION:  -- prevail? 


MR. OGDEN:  That would -- that would undermine


the so-called gap theory in every State but -- but


California where typically you do have appeals on both


sides.  In California, you have a State appeal and a


functional appeal on the petitioner's side.  And so, the


argument could be made -- I think it's a hyper-technical


argument.  I think it's an argument that's inconsistent


with the purpose of this statute, but you could make the


hyper-technical argument that because California gives


unequal rights to the two sides, an appeal on the one hand


and a functional appeal on the other, we're going to treat


the functional appeal in a different way for Federal


purposes. 


I would submit there is no way that Congress


intended to take a functional appeal that has the purpose


of -- of presenting claims that are required for


exhaustion and said, we want to treat that differently


because it's merely a functional appeal, not a real


appeal.  That makes no sense. 


All of the reasons why tolling should apply in


the gaps prescribed by the State, the period the State


believes is appropriate for the presentation of these


claims, the period the State believes prisoners should


have in order to prepare and present their claims, that

we're not going to toll that, the consequence of that will


be that petitioners will not wait for the transcript. 


They will file their -- their motions in the -- in the


court of appeal without transcripts.  They will not


develop their arguments well, and then those arguments


will finally be made for the first time effectively in the


Federal court.  That is not what was intended by the


statute.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Ogden. 


Mr. Cross, you have 1 minute remaining. 


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY A. CROSS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. CROSS:  I think the answer to Mr. Ogden,


Your Honor, is that the reason would be that Congress was


concerned about undue delay.  In the last 10 years before


AEDPA was passed, over 80 bills were attempted to -- to


deal with this problem.  And lack of diligence by


petitioners was the main concern of Congress, and they


dealt with that by writing into the statute the following


phrase.  2244(d)(2) at page 3 of the blue brief.  Quote,


the time during which a properly filed application for


State post-conviction or other collateral review with


respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending


shall not be counted toward any limitation under this


subsection.  They did not choose to use the -- the

language petition in 2263(b)(2), nor did they choose to


use the language in 2244(d)(1)(A) of the time for seeking


such review.  They chose application for the reason that


Justice Scalia was talking about.  They were concerned


that there would be undue delay in between applications.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Cross.


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 12:09 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
