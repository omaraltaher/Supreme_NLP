FLEMING                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 MR. FLEMING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:               The Iowa statute under which Mr. Mathis was        convicted defines one crime, and Iowa does not need to          prove generic burglary to convict under it. The Eighth          Circuit below and the government here, nonetheless, want        to use the modified categorical approach. Not for its          usual purpose, which is to identify the kind of         conviction, we know what that is, but rather to identify          the means of commission. That is contrary to ACCA's          categorical approach, and it's irreconcilable with both       the result and the reasoning of this Court's decision in          Descamps.                         One of ­­  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is that so? I mean,           here we have the crime, burglary, and there are two ways           of committing it. One involves a structure; one          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review involves a vehicle. And those can be easily divided.           We look at the charge. The charge is for a structure,             not for a vehicle. Why ­­ why is it not divisible?                         MR. FLEMING: For the exact same reason,        Justice Ginsburg, that the California statute at issue        in Descamps was not divisible. In that case as well,           the indictment charged that Mr. Descamps had unlawfully        and feloniously entered the grocery store. The        prosecutor stated as much, that Mr. Descamps had broken         and entered into a grocery store, and Mr. Descamps did           not object to that.                Nonetheless, this Court, quite properly,     held that it was not divisible because California was         not required to prove unlawful entry in order to get a           conviction.             The same is true of Mr. Mathis. Iowa did          not have to prove the type of occupied structure that he           supposedly burglarized.              JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he did one or the         other. In Descamps, there was an element that didn't          have to be proved under the State statute. You didn't           have to prove unlawful.                MR. FLEMING: The ­­ the ­­ California would         have had to prove entry, just as Iowa would have to           prove an occupied structure. But California did not         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review have to prove whether the entry was unlawful as would          have been required to make the offense a generic          burglary offense.              Similarly here, Iowa did not need to prove        burglary of a building as opposed to burglary of a land,             air, or water vehicle or similar place. Those are          issues that there's no dispute a jury could have divided           on or Mr. Mathis would not have had to admit          specifically in order to permit a conviction under the          Iowa statute.              JUSTICE BREYER: But they have to prove        one ­­ they define, somewhere, structure, right, in the         statute?             MR. FLEMING: They do, Justice Breyer.                   JUSTICE BREYER: And don't you have to prove         that definition applies? I mean, you know, suppose it           was a structure for ­­ for an animal at a zoo or              something. I mean, that wouldn't count, would it?                      MR. FLEMING: It might not. But ­­                    JUSTICE BREYER: Right. Well, if it does         not, don't you have to at least prove that it falls           within the definition?               MR. FLEMING: The definition of occupied       structure.             JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.    Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honor.      JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.    MR. FLEMING: And we don't ­­      JUSTICE BREYER: And, similarly, in Taylor,                                                       you have to prove that it falls within the statute's          definition of boat or car or house. Right? You have to             prove one of the three.                             MR. FLEMING: That is the difference.       JUSTICE BREYER: But you don't have to        prove ­­ you have to prove in Massachusetts if you have           an indictment which says it was like a houseboat, so           they're not certain what it counts as. So they say,           don't you have to prove our prosecutor says it's a boat            or a house? Now, would that get a conviction in             Massachusetts? They proved that. It's either a boat or            a house. Do they get a conviction or not?                       that ­­             MR. FLEMING: This Court in Shepard assumed        JUSTICE BREYER: Now, we don't know       Massachusetts law. I'm saying under ­­                              MR. FLEMING: Yeah.    JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ Massachusetts law, would       you be able to convict the person?                   MR. FLEMING: I ­­ this Court assumed         because it wasn't disputed in Shepard that the answer is          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review no and that ­­               JUSTICE BREYER: The answer is no? You         cannot convict a person, say, on a houseboat in           Massachusetts where the prosecutor says it's either a        house or a boat? They have to go into what the             difference is?              MR. FLEMING: As this Court interpreted it        in ­­ in Shepard, house or a boat are elements of the             crime.             JUSTICE BREYER: So, in other words, if six         people think a houseboat is a boat and six people think             a houseboat is a house, the guy gets off ­­                                  MR. FLEMING: If ­­ if ­­      JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ in Massachusetts? Do        you have any case on that? I would be rather surprised.                         MR. FLEMING: Not in Massachusetts,      Your Honor, but this is an Iowa case.                    JUSTICE BREYER: I know. But what I'm          driving at, it's the same thing, the same thing. But           you've made up a very ingenious difference. But why           isn't it just the same thing here as was in          Massachusetts?             MR. FLEMING: Because Massachusetts and Iowa       have chosen to define different crimes, and they have         the prerogative to do that. If Iowa says, we don't           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review care, as it has said, ultimately what the means is ­­          the location of the burglary is a means ­­ the jury can             divide on that and still convict as long as they find an            occupied structure. State v. Duncan holds that.        There's no dispute.               In that circumstance, one cannot be sure       whether it's a jury trial, which this ­­ and this was            not except for the case of one, as revealed by the           record, or a plea, if Mr. Mathis had been told you are             being charged with burglarizing a garage and he said, oh           no, I didn't break into a garage. I broke into a car                 parked outside the garage; that would have made no         difference under Iowa law and he would have had no basis           to contest the means of commission. A judge might not            even have allowed him to do it, and certainly his          defense attorney would have said, let's not burden the         prosecutor.             JUSTICE BREYER: That's why I asked you         about Massachusetts.              MR. FLEMING: Massachusetts will be      different.             JUSTICE BREYER: You violated Section blah,       blah, blah. Prosecutor: You broke into a house.                       Defendant: No, I broke into a boat.                      Admitted? Yes. Guilty or not guilty?        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             MR. FLEMING: It ­­ in Massachusetts, the ­­        the statute itself is not clear on the point. We give            the example of Vermont where it does make a difference.           And the reason it makes a difference is because Vermont           punishes burglary of a dwelling more severely than         burglary of a boat. And so a Vermont prosecutor does             need to show which it is because it makes a difference            to the sentence. And in that circumstance, the statute          is divisible, and it would be proper to go to the           modified categorical approach.               JUSTICE ALITO: Well, there are a lot of          reasons why Iowa might want to take the approach that          it ­­ that it does. Suppose the person is convicted ­­           suppose the evidence involves the burglary of a trailer.          So you'd have the rather ridiculous situation of a         jury ­­ if that was ­­ if those are separate elements,           then if six of the jurors thought, well, this trailer is           not very movable, so I think it's a house, and the other              others say, well, you know, it's possible you could hook          it up to a truck and move it, so it's a vehicle. So                there couldn't be an agreement, and the defendant would         be acquitted. That's a rather strange result that the           Iowa legislature might want to avoid.                  But you want to attribute the same ­­ you         want to ­­ you want to say the Massachusetts legislature          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review in the case of a houseboat would permit the same thing?            You have no Massachusetts case that says that.                    MR. FLEMING: The ­­ I do not, Your Honor.           But this is not a Massachusetts case. And Vermont           clearly does. The Vermont legislature has made that         choice.             JUSTICE ALITO: Well, maybe they have more        houseboats in Massachusetts than they do in Vermont.                    (Laughter.)             MR. FLEMING: But the ­­ the point,        Justice Alito, is that the State is free to define its           crime as it wishes. You are absolutely right that Iowa           may decide it prefers to make it easier for its State           prosecutors to get convictions so that they don't have         to get jury unanimity on the specific location, and then          they care less about whether their convictions are going         to be used as ­­                JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the point is, what is         the Federal ­­ under your approach, what is the Federal          sentencing court supposed to do in the situation like         the Massachusetts situation where there is no case,        there is no Massachusetts case? So what is the court           supposed to do?               Now, in ­­ this Court has said it's ­­ it's          as simple as pie to determine whether something is ­­ is           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review an element or a means. That's your view, too. But just              tell me what the ­­ what the Federal sentencing court          would do in that situation.                 MR. FLEMING: If there truly were a        situation where all else had failed, all the standard         tools of statutory interpretation ­­                case.             JUSTICE ALITO: Which will often be the        MR. FLEMING: Will sometimes be the case.        There are a number of them that we cite where State law             is plain on the point, and the State courts have had to            resolve this, whether in the context of the double         jeopardy challenge or a challenge to the indictment or          request for unanimous jury instructions.                 JUSTICE ALITO: So what ­­ what happens if         there is that State case that says whether this is          definitively an element or a means?                   MR. FLEMING: In the situation where that        arises, obviously, the sentencing court will apply the        ordinary tools of statutory interpretation, looking at       the text to say ­­ for instance, in the case of           Vermont ­­ are they punishing one of the particular         locations more severely than another? In that        circumstance, we know they have to be elements, not ­­                     JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose they ­­      Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review suppose they don't. So if it looks at a case like             Massachusetts, what's the Federal sentencing court      supposed to do?               MR. FLEMING: Obviously, one would look to        authoritative sources like ­­ like jury instructions.       One could look at commentaries. One would look at          legislative history. One would look at how the         Massachusetts courts had interpreted comparable statutes      to see if there are any general principles that the          Massachusetts courts ­­              JUSTICE KAGAN: Isn't there also something       that Descamps says that ­­ that can be done, which is,           you know, maybe you have a case and it just gives you             the answer. Maybe you have jury instructions and it          gives you the answer. If they don't, Descamps indicates          in footnote that you can look to the charging           documents for the limited purpose of seeing whether        the ­­ the prosecutor is treating the house or a boat as             a means or as an element. And sometimes that will be            clear.               I mean, you might have one set of charging        documents, and it will say the person burgled either a          house or a boat. And then it will be clear that the ­­              that the thing is a means, and it's not an element. Or              another charging document can say, as to a houseboat,          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review the person burgled a house, and then that indicates that           Massachusetts law does treat this as an element and that          you have to prove one or the other and that the           prosecutor has made his choice. Isn't that right?                     MR. FLEMING: It's certainly right as to the         first point, and I ­­ I think certainly looking at            Shepard documents to determine, for instance, if house        and boat are charged in the same count, then to avoid           duplicity ­­             JUSTICE KAGAN: These documents are a clue         to whether something is an element or instead a means.                                   MR. FLEMING: I ­­     JUSTICE KAGAN: Sometimes they're a very        good clue. Sometimes they won't get you all the way           there, but they're certainly a clue as to whether          something is an element or a means. And so you can look              to the Shepard documents to try to figure out that          question.             MR. FLEMING: I think as Your Honor has          phrased it, we have no quarrel with that, as long as the            Court is being cautious about ­­                 JUSTICE ALITO: Why is that correct,       Mr. Fleming? That depends on State pleading law. Are           you ­­ are you telling us that in every State, if           something is a ­­ if you have a category of means, it is               Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review impermissible for the charging indictment, whether it's       an indictment or an information, to specify the thing         that was done, it has to be done in terms of the            elements of the statute? You're going to tell us that           that is State pleading law in every jurisdiction?                    position.             MR. FLEMING: No, Your Honor, that's not our         JUSTICE ALITO: Well, then how can you tell         from the ­­ from the charging document that something is          an element or a means?                  MR. FLEMING: I think if, in the limited          situation that Justice Kagan's question posited, which       is when you have a situation where a prosecutor charges            house and boat together in one count, that would be a           duplicitous indictment if they were different elements.       So that is a clue that at least the prosecutor viewed            them as different means of commission of a single          offense.                                     JUSTICE ALITO: What if the charge is one?         MR. FLEMING: If ­­    JUSTICE ALITO: What if ­­ in this case,         what if the charge ­­ what if the charging document just           charged one? Does that make it an element?                     MR. FLEMING: I think in that situation, the          Shepard document would be inconclusive, and it would not         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review be ­­ it would not be indicative of which it was. And             so in that circumstance ­­                            Sotomayor.             case?             Honor.             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So Mr. Fleming ­­      MR. FLEMING: I apologize, Justice       JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why don't we use this        MR. FLEMING: I would welcome that, Your         JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right ­­ at the        Joint Appendix it says ­­ one of the charging elements          says that Richard Allen Mathis, on such­and­such a date          in Iowa, unlawfully and willfully break ­­ I'm sorry         about the tenses ­­ broke and entered a storage shed           belonging to ­­ to the victim with the intention to          commit a theft. If I read that, do I know what's an                element or a means?                 MR. FLEMING: No, your Honor.                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It is very clear that        the only thing being charged is breaking into a shed.                       MR. FLEMING: Absolutely. A prosecutor will         often add detail that is not an element.                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I mean, this        doesn't say willfully ­­ willfully ­­ unlawfully and        willfully. Do I have to go further, and why, meaning,            Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review isn't the issue here what we left off ­­ open in           Descamps? Iowa calls this a means, but if I read the              instrument, it seems like an element.                  So what does a judge do? Give me the steps            of interpretive principles that a judge would do with a           case like this.                           MR. FLEMING: Of course, Your Honor.       JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The State law      dispositive, that's number ­­ first, let's start there.                    MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honor. State law is          dispositive, because States define the elements of their        crimes. This Court made that very clear in ­­ in the            plurality opinion in Schad. It's true in Richardson.         The State is defining the crime, and as usual in matters           of State law, Federal courts defer to the State         interpretation of their own laws.                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that's your entire       case, correct?              MR. FLEMING: Well, in this case ­­                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume Iowa was       silent. That was the question that Justice Breyer ­­                     MR. FLEMING: If ­­                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ was coming to. If I          look at this, it seems ­­ it doesn't say, enter a           storage area or a structure as a ­­ a structure or a               Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review boat. It says just enter a storage shed.                      MR. FLEMING: The same ­­ the same problem         would have occurred and did occur in Descamps.        Mr. Descamps's criminal information said, feloniously      entered a building ­­ a grocery store, I believe it             was ­­             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes, the problem ­­                  MR. FLEMING: ­­ and ­­                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ with Descamps there       is that "feloniously entered" had two potential       meanings: You broke and you entered, or you remained          unlawfully and committed a crime. And what we said in            Descamps was, reading felonious entry, you don't know        which of the two it is because it ­­ it's not an            element. You just have to do one or ­­ it's not an             element. It's a means. We didn't know which one, but             this is sort of different. This is the indictment          saying the structure you broke into is this particular         one.             MR. FLEMING: If I may, Justice Sotomayor,         I ­­ I ­­ if you ­­ if Your Honor had thought that              the ­­ either the indictment or the plea colloquy were          dispositive of figuring out whether the generic offense        was involved for purposes of ACCA, Mr. Descamps would         have lost, because his indictment said, "willfully,       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review unlawfully, and feloniously entered a building." And at          the plea hearing, the prosecutor said, without objection        from Mr. Descamps, that the crime involved the breaking         and entering of a grocery store.                   So there was no question, if you were to ­­         looking at the Shepard documents in Descamps, that they         set forth generic burglary.                Nonetheless, that wasn't enough, because ­­     and these are the Court's words ­­ California, to get a           conviction, need not prove that Descamps broke and        entered. And it does not matter whether he did. It            doesn't matter whether the prosecutor said he did. It          doesn't matter whether he admitted that he did. The          statute ­­ the elements of the statute ­­                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you see a difference         between ­­ he had to do one or the other here. He had              to break into a house or break into a vehicle. But in               Descamps, he could have done one of two things. He           could have broken and entered, or he could have stayed          unlawfully.             MR. FLEMING: And the point is that        California did not need to ­­ to show beyond a          reasonable doubt ­­              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.                MR. FLEMING: ­­ whether ­­     Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He wasn't pleading      guilty to one or the other. He way saying, I did             unlawfully what the indictment said, feloniously      entered. But I ­­ he did not have to and did not admit               exactly which of the two ways he did it.                     MR. FLEMING: But the ­­ the nongeneric        aspect of the California offense was that you could         enter lawfully and then shop with the intent to         shoplift, and that could still be punishable under this         statute. And that was the point on which the ­­ the            statute swept ­­              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Go back to my ultimate        question. Tell me the steps.                  MR. FLEMING: The steps for how the        sentence ­­             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You say State law is        dispositive.             MR. FLEMING: Yes, it is.                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assume State law is       unclear.             MR. FLEMING: So there's a general answer to          the question and a specific answer to the question. The            general answer is that the Court determines the elements         of the State crime in the same way as it applies State            law in its civil diversity cases or how it would          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review determine the elements of a State crime in a double            jeopardy challenge or, for that matter, under the        categorical approach. This Court did it itself in         Duenas­Alvarez, in James, in Johnson. Federal courts        ascertaining the State ­­ State law components of a         particular statute in front of them is nothing new, nor          is it particularly difficult.                The specific answer: You ­­ if there is no          State case law available, you look at the text of the           statute as always to begin with. It may be that the            text of the statute tells you that a particular          alternative is punished more harshly than others.       That's the case in Vermont. Then you know that they are            elements.             You would look at the case law backdrop of         the enactment. It's possible the State legislature was         reacting to a particular prior decision. The Maryland          Court of Appeals did that in the Rice case, which is           cited in the American Immigration Lawyers brief case.                    They looked at the backdrop of the enactment        of the statute and determined that the new theft statute          in Maryland had amalgamated larceny, receiving stolen       property, embezzlement as different means of committing       one theft offense. You would ­­                  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Must everything be either       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review a means or an element? Suppose I just looked at this             statute and I said, here's a statute, punishing          burglary, and it tells us two ways in which this offense           can be committed, one way or the other way. Why do I             have to type it an element or a means rather than saying             what it is? It is a way of committing the offense.                         MR. FLEMING: I ­­ I view, Justice Ginsburg,           a way of committing the offense as a synonym for the            means. The definition of an element, which this Court          used in Richardson ­­ and I don't think it's disputed.           I think the government uses it in its own brief ­­ is a             fact that the prosecution must prove to the jury beyond          a reasonable doubt in order to get a conviction of the            crime. And that goes back to the Court's opinion in           Taylor, which is why ACCA is a categorical approach, is           because it turns on the elements of the statute of          conviction.             Congress never intended that convictions     were ­­             JUSTICE GINSBURG: This ­­ this defendant       pled guilty to an information that charged unlawfully        entering a garage, a house. That's what he pled guilty             to, right?              MR. FLEMING: The ­­ the information states        that. There is no ­­ nothing in the record about ­­           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             JUSTICE GINSBURG: He doesn't think that ­­       there wasn't any possibility of a boat or a car being in              this picture.              MR. FLEMING: The ­­ the record does not         exclude that, Your Honor. If my client had said, upon           appearing for the plea to his lawyer, you know, I know            the information says a garage, but I actually only went            into the car that was parked outside the garage, his          lawyer would in all likelihood have said that doesn't         matter. If you say that you're just admitting your          guilt in the same way because that is not an element of            the offense. Under Iowa law, it won't affect your          guilt; it won't affect your sentence.                  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I was curious to know, you          said Congress never intended, and then we didn't get the          never.                         MR. FLEMING: Never ­­    JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm sure Congress never       intended that we have the dialogue that we're having         here today.              (Laughter.)             JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is such an art ­­ you          were going to say, what did Congress intend? You          couldn't finish that.               MR. FLEMING: I'd be happy to, Justice        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Kennedy.             Congress intended that a ­­ that a        conviction for a particular crime would be an ACCA          predicate offense in all cases or in none. That is what            this Court said in Taylor, reaffirmed it in Descamps; it          is an on/off switch. And a conviction for Iowa burglary            under Section . of the Iowa Code either is an ACCA           predicate or it is not in all cases.                    It does not matter what was particularly       charged in a particular case. It does not matter what            the plea agreement said. It doesn't matter what the          jury instructions said because the crime itself is        unitary. This is not a statute that sets up multiple            different crimes with multiple different elements where       the modified categorical approach is necessary to figure        out what crime he was convicted of. We know what crime            he was convicted of, and it is not a generic offense.                        And to ­­ to the extent there's any doubt         about that, I think it's important to go back to the ­­            the reasons why Mr. Descamps won, and why this Court          rejected the Ninth Circuit's approach in Aguila­Montes       De Oca, which is essentially what the government is now          arguing, which is that you can go to the Shepard          documents to try to find out, not the offense of          conviction, but what this defendant specifically did.       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review And this Court rejected that soundly. And there were          three reasons.              The first was the statutory intent behind       what Congress enacted, which is to make sure that each          conviction of a particular crime is an on/off switch and           produces the same results all the time.                               The second ­­  JUSTICE ALITO: What is ­­ what is the         evidence in ­­ in the ­­ you said the statutory text.           What is the evidence in the statutory text of ACCA that           this is what Congress intended?                             MR. FLEMING: It's the ­­ it's the ­­        JUSTICE ALITO: Prior to Apprendi and all        this other stuff. What is the statutory evidence?                     MR. FLEMING: This ­­ this Court in Taylor         relied on the fact that Congress used the word         "convictions" as opposed to someone who had committed an         offense, and also looked at the legislative history,        which specifically indicated that Congress did not mean        a conviction for a particular crime to sometimes be an           act of predicate and sometimes not.                  JUSTICE ALITO: So if someone were       explaining what ­­ what your client pled guilty to, they          wouldn't say he was convicted for ­­ for breaking into a           garage? They wouldn't say that?      Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             MR. FLEMING: It may ­­ I mean an ­­ an            ordinary person may well use that description. He ­­         they may also say he was convicted of breaking into the           garage at Main Street, but that's not an element          either.             JUSTICE KENNEDY: Wasn't Congress interested      in what the person did rather than what the statute          said?             MR. FLEMING: On the contrary, Your Honor.        That's exactly what Taylor and its progeny say is not          the case. And Descamps says that too. They're not           interested in what the ­­                JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's ­­ it's not the case         that that's what Congress wanted?                 MR. FLEMING: Congress was not ­­ by ­­ by          passing ACCA, Congress was interested in what the person         was convicted of, which is why they use the word          "convictions." They did not use the language, for         instance, of the statute in Nijhawan, which is different         and does not trigger a categorical approach because it          looks to conduct. Congress could have passed that         statute.             After this Court decided Taylor, Congress      could have amended ACCA in order to make it conduct          based. It hasn't done so.      Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're ­­ you're       entitled, probably required, to argue the cases as ­­ as          we've written them, and you're ­­ and you're doing that.                                  MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honor.      JUSTICE KENNEDY: It does seem to me that         this ­­ we're living in a very artificial world.                      Does ­­ does Judge Kozinski's approach, as       set forth in the Ninth Circuit in his separate opinion,          what would be the result in your case if we used his            approach?             MR. FLEMING: We would prevail, Your Honor.        Judge Kozinski's approach is exactly the same as one of          the questions Justice Kagan asked earlier ­­                              JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.    MR. FLEMING: ­­ which is you can look at          the Shepard documents for the very limited purpose of         figuring out what the elements of the State crime are          to the extent there isn't dispositive State case law or          other interpretive aids that the Court can use. In this           case we have dispositive State case law, so Judge         Kozinski's approach would ­­ would work exactly the way         we think it should.                He was very clear that the modified       categorical approach only works in the circumstance we        say it works in; namely, when the State defines more          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review than one crime in a single statute. He did not say that              you could look for means of commission. That was the           position of the ­­ the other judge, Graber's, dissental         in the Rendon case, and it's the one that the Ninth           Circuit rejected en banc in the Almanza­Arenas case.                                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This case ­­      JUSTICE BREYER: I'd like to try with one ­­         one ­­ what I'm trying to do is get the essence of your             argument.                         MR. FLEMING: Trying to get it ­­       JUSTICE BREYER: And so you can just say I          don't have it or I do have it. If I don't have it, I'll                 go back and read it, I promise, and I'll get it before I              decide this.                I think you're looking at Descamps. And you        say, look, the word in the statute, "Federal," is crime.          It doesn't mean what a person does on a particular            occasion; it means the kind of thing in a statute.                       So imagine we have the word "burglary," and        that's all the statute said. And then a court said you             can commit this in any one of five ways: A boat, a              house, a car, et cetera. Now, even if the charging            document there said "house," that wouldn't be good        enough because the crime is what the statute says. So           you start there.   Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             And you say, now, what difference could it        possibly make? If in a different section of the statute            there are some statutory words but they say just what          the Court just said in the other case, now, okay, I'll           go back and read it. I mean ­­                     your ­­             MR. FLEMING: No, no. I'm waiting for         JUSTICE BREYER: And that's what you're       saying. You're saying that in both cases the key point           is that the ­­ the court was telling you in the first            case that the burglary can be comitted in different         ways, which means you don't have to charge it, and the           jury doesn't have to be unanimous in respect to it.                      Now, if you take those same words out of         what the court said and put it in the statute, which you            think happened here, then those words don't require the         jury ­­ they either charge it or the ­­ the ­­ the jury             to find it unanimously, so it's not an element. And if            it was good enough to get my client out of the statute            in the first case, it should be good enough when the           same thing appears in a statute.                               argument?             MR. FLEMING: And the reason ­­      JUSTICE BREYER: Is that your basic       MR. FLEMING: It is.     Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review JUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.     MR. FLEMING: And the reason for that,                                Justice Breyer, is that it does not matter from ­­                     the crime.                          was crimes.                                      JUSTICE BREYER: Because it's not part of        MR. FLEMING: It's not the crime.       JUSTICE BREYER: And what Congress wanted       MR. FLEMING: Was the crime.      JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Got it.       MR. FLEMING: And the difficulty of the        government's position ­­                          JUSTICE BREYER: No. Just trying to get it.          MR. FLEMING: No, I appreciate it, Justice         Breyer. And I'd like ­­ I'd like, if I may, to ­­ I               think the question tees up the difficulty in the         government's position, which is the government says it        makes all the difference in the world whether this         statute uses the word "or."                 And if the California statute in Descamps       had been phrased    instead of saying every person who      enters, had said    every person who enters lawfully or      unlawfully, then   the outcome would have been completely      different in the    government's mind, even though it would      not have changed    what a California prosecutor had to       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review prove. It would not change what someone had to admit in            a plea, and it would have created significant Sixth         Amendment difficulties to enhance someone's sentence      based on something like that where the intention and the          State proceeding is in no way focused on that.                     With the Court's permission, I'd reserve the       balance of my time.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   Ms. Saharsky.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                 MS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:               From Taylor forward, this Court has never       adopted a means­elements distinction that turns on        parsing State law. In fact, it's done and said the           opposite. And adopting such an inquiry now would be          highly disruptive and detrimental to the uniform       administration of Federal law.                  I want to start where Petitioner's counsel      ended, which was saying that what we're doing in this          case is the same as Descamps, et cetera. I think that             Justice Sotomayor correctly identified the difference      between this case and Descamps. In Descamps, there was          a component of generic burglary that was just not         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review present in the State statute. You didn't have statutory          alternatives. And as a result of that, you couldn't do            the matching that happens under the modified categorical        approach. The approach is all about trying to match,          was the defendant's conviction under this State statute        or ­­                         or not.              JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I'm not ­­      MS. SAHARSKY: ­­ was it a federal offense          JUSTICE KAGAN: ­­ sure that that's true,        Ms. Saharsky. I mean, you could take that Descamps law,            and as Mr. Fleming did or some other way, essentially do           the exact same thing with an explicit disjunctive. The          way Mr. Fleming did it, he said lawfully or unlawfully,          you could say breaking and entering or not breaking and          entering. I mean, there would be a zillion ways of             phrasing the exact same thing disjunctively on the face         of a statute. And I think Mr. Fleming is right that              that would not have made a difference to our analysis.                       MS. SAHARSKY: Well, I think that it did          make a difference to the Court's analysis, and what I           would give you is an example. And this was in the            Court's opinion in Descamps, was the way that this Court          showed that the Ninth Circuit was wrong was it gave two           examples of an assault­with­a­weapon statute. It said        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review imagine an assault­with­a­weapon statute that just says       "a weapon" and doesn't specify any weapons. And then          imagine a second statute that says "assault with a          weapon" and specifies eight individual weapons. Is        there a difference between those two cases?                    And the Court's opinion says yes. The first         case does not have a component of generic burglary, and           so you cannot match it with the Federal offense. It           doesn't have the entry component. But in the second          case, you do have ­­ I mean, I'm sorry, that was an             assault ­­ but you do have a component that you can            match with the Federal offense. And so ­­                    JUSTICE KAGAN: Assuming that the component       is an element. So that gets you back to your first            statement, which is that it didn't matter whether it was          an element or something else. A means was just as good             as long as it's phrased in the disjunctive.                    And, you know, all of our cases ­­ it's not          just Descamps ­­ it goes back to Taylor and Shepard and           Johnson. They all use the language of elements.         Descamps in the introduction uses the word "elements"        ten times. So if we really meant elements or means or            whatever, it's a funny thing ­­ it's a funny way to             write all of our opinions.                 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, two ­­ I think this is           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review a critical question, and there are really two responses         to it. The first is when describing divisibility, which          is this question of, can you divide up the statute for           matching purposes, the Court said "element," and it also         equated that with the statutory alternatives. It did         that throughout the opinion.                The second point is that there's a reason         that when the Court ­­ the Court could say "element" and           "statutory alternatives" interchangeably, because a     distinction between means and elements doesn't matter to        divisibility. I think really the heart of the modified           categorical approach is ­­ if I can just explain as the            Court has explained, is you need to make sure that the           defendant was convicted of the generic offense, that        the ­­ the jury or the fact­finder necessarily found the          generic offense and not something else. And you can          tell that from the ordinary application in the modified         categorical approach using the Shepard documents.                  JUSTICE KAGAN: But you see, Descamps makes        it quite clear that there's two different kinds of         looking ­­ what Descamps says is you have to be able to            say that a person was necessarily convicted of         something.             MS. SAHARSKY: Okay.                JUSTICE KAGAN: Meaning that the statute       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review requires him to be convicted of something. It is not           good enough to look at the course of proceedings and to           infer that a jury or a judge actually did find            something. Descamps says this in no uncertain terms,         that ­­ you know, I mean, sometimes those inferences can           be very powerful. And Descamps says it's not enough.          That what you have to find is a necessary finding in the             sense that a statute makes something necessary in order          for a conviction to occur. And that's the distinction           between elements and means.                And I'll just say one last thing. And I          know I've been talking for a while, so I'll let you            talk. But the entire discussion between the dissent and          the majority was about this.                 MS. SAHARSKY: Right.                JUSTICE KAGAN: The ­­ the dissent said,        it's really terrible what the Court just did. It just           created this distinction between elements and means.       And the majority said, yes, that's exactly the        distinction we're using, and we think it's the right         decision ­­ distinction.               So nine members of this Court thought that        the distinction that we were using was a distinction          between elements and means.                MS. SAHARSKY: Okay. Well, a few responses          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review to that. I think you're ­­ you're pointing to the            Court's footnote . And when the Court was talking          about means as a general matter in Descamps, it was           talking about things not specified in the statute.        Because, of course, the statutory term was overbroad in         Descamps.             But if we look to what the Court meant in          footnote , you're right. It talks about a distinction           between means and elements, but the Court's ultimate        conclusion ­­             JUSTICE KAGAN: It's not just footnote , if         I could just interrupt. I mean, the footnote comes as              a substance to the dissent, and the dissent says, this          is the problem with the entire opinion, is that it keeps           on talking about elements, but it's hard to distinguish         between elements and means. And we shouldn't be         distinguishing between those two things.                 So the whole opinion is this elements focus,        which then the dissent attacks.                 MS. SAHARSKY: Right. I understand the         question, and I will talk about both footnote and the             rest of the Court's opinion.                 So if we look at this discussion in footnote         , I think the Court's ultimate conclusion is very          telling and important to us, because the Court says         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review there's no real­world reason to worry about the kind of          discussion with State law that we're having today. The          Court says whatever a statute lists, whether elements or          means, the Court need not parse State law when State law           is drafted. In the alternative, you resort to the          Shepard documents. And I think your ­­ one of your            earlier questions suggested, can't we look to the        Shepard documents to see whether something is an        element? And we think that ­­                  JUSTICE KAGAN: If you need to.                   MS. SAHARSKY: Okay. Well, we think that         that general approach is correct, which, to us, we ­­         you know, we understood this to say, just look to the           statute of conviction in the Shepard documents.                   Now, when ­­ when only one thing is at         issue, like in this case, which is burglary of a house,            then I don't think you necessarily know whether it would           be a means in a different case where two things are             charged. But I think you confidently know that the           person was convicted of burglary of a house in this           case. The statute ­­                JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, here, you have a        particular statute, a particular State ­­ excuse me ­­ a           particular State court decision that says exactly what        is an element and what is a means and that this is ­­             Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review this is not an element.                             MS. SAHARSKY: Right, but I don't think ­­         JUSTICE KAGAN: So you don't need to look         any further than a dispositive State court decision on          the subject.              MS. SAHARSKY: A couple of ­­ a couple of            responses. The first is, is that these decisions, I          don't think ­­ these questions don't arise under the         State courts very often. I think between all of the            resources and the parties in this case, we've only found          two State court decisions that address a place being          burgled. And I think that's problematic in light of the            fact that this burglary of a building or a boat, this             Massachusetts, is really a paradigmatic example that        this Court has always offered of a divisible statute.          So to not know now under State law whether that's          divisible is particular problematic under Petitioner's      approach.             But just to get back to what I think was           your ­­ your central question, because I think this is           really important about Descamps and why we're reading        the opinion our way: Aside from this conclusion at the           end of footnote , which we think essentially says that          for ACCA purposes, when you have something in the         Shepard documents, it is ­­ it functions as an element          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review in that case.               But aside from that, I think there are two          other very telling parts of the Court's opinion in         Descamps. One is that the Court starts its opinion, and           throughout its opinion says, that settled law, the        Court's years of precedent up to that point, pretty          much resolved that question, all but settles this        question. The Court was not purporting to change         settled law. It wasn't purporting to do something         extraordinary like require a State law inquiry.                    In fact, the whole Petitioner's argument in       Descamps, why you couldn't do the thing the Ninth         Circuit wanted to do was because this whole thing is          settled. You just look at the text of the statute, and            the Ninth Circuit is really doing this kind of outlier          approach and you shouldn't do that.                  So we read the opinion in Descamps as a         whole to say we're just applying settled law. And          that's our position in this case, is we just want to           apply the settled law in divisibility.                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Applying your approach      now, how does Descamps come out? How does Descamps come           out?             MS. SAHARSKY: Same result. Same result,        because I think, as your question suggested, there is a           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review critical difference between Descamps and this case.       Because there, there was an overbroad statutory term,        and there just was nothing in the statute that         corresponded to generic burglary. So you can't do what          the Court said is what you have to do. Which version of             the offense was the person committed ­­ convicted of,         and does it correspond to generic burglary? You         couldn't make that inquiry ­­                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That ­­ that's      stretching things. I think percent of the courts           across the country would have looked at the plea         agreement and said, the prosecutor said he broke and         entered a garage. We're going to find he broke and            entered a garage.                MS. SAHARSKY: Well ­­                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And he didn't stay a ­­         I'm sorry, a grocery store ­­ and he didn't stay           unlawfully. So how do we get courts, assuming we accept           your argument, not to do the kind of inferential         retrying of the case ­­                MS. SAHARSKY: Right.                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ that often happens       when you're relying on Shepard documents?                  MS. SAHARSKY: Right. And I think this ­­          this really goes to the heart of why the Court decided           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Descamps the way that it did, was the difference between          a statute like one that just prohibits assault with a          weapon and one that prohibits assault with one of eight          specified weapons. When it just says "assault with a          weapon," the Court's opinion in Descamps says you could         infinitely divide up the terms of the statute to imagine          any number of subcrimes and then try to match them to           the Federal offense.               When you don't have a statutory alternative,        the Court's opinion in Descamps says what you're really         doing is just matching the facts of the defendant's         conviction, if you can find them in the Shepard         documents, with the generic Federal offense? So it is          in the case where there is no statutory alternative,         like you said, you're just kind of combing through the          documents, and the court in Descamps said, don't do         that. But we're not doing that here. We don't need to             try to comb through the facts. All we're saying is that            this statute, like many burglary statutes, including the        example the Court has given, covers burglary of multiple         places, right? It covers burglary of buildings and         boats and whatever else. And you just need to see which            version of the offense was this person convicted of.         Was it the burglary of a house, or was it the burglary             of a boat?    Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             And so you look at the conviction documents        to do it, and you're just matching the offense as          defined by the legislature in that case with the Federal          generic offense. You're not trying to just match         facts ­­             JUSTICE KAGAN: Here's what the statute       doesn't do. The statute doesn't make it necessary for          anybody to convict you of any single one of those          things. And one of the points, since percent of           cases end in pleas, the statute doesn't make it         necessary for you to plead to any one of those things.                       So whatever information is floating around      in these opinions, nobody has had to find ­­ and the           defendant has not had to plead to a particular offense           with one of those alternative means.                  MS. SAHARSKY: Well ­­                JUSTICE KAGAN: And that's the critical       thing under, not just Descamps, under all of these         elements­based decisions, is that it doesn't matter what        you did. It doesn't even matter that you say you did            something. What we have to be able to say is that under             the law, you absolutely ­­ the law required a particular           finding that matches the generic crime. And in this          case, that finding is not there.                  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, I think that there are          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review two different ­­ I think it's important to divide          between the two different parts of the inquiry. There          is two questions, right?                The first is, is this statute divisible,       meaning is there an alternative in it that corresponds         to generic burglary. And then the second is, was the           person actually convicted of generic burglary.                  And I think your question gets to the heart          of we need to make sure this person actually was          convicted of generic burglary, and I don't think you          need to do a separate State law inquiry to answer that            question because that's really what the modified       categorical approach was designed to do, that you look         at the Shepard documents and see.                  Can we tell that the person was convicted of         this form of burglary or not? And you do ­­ you look at              the modified that ­­ the Shepard documents in        combination with the statute that sets out those        alternatives.             Just to give you ­­ just to give one         example, right? In a case where we have a defendant who              is convicted of burglaring ­­ burglaring a building,         whether by guilty plea or by a jury trial, the only            thing that's ever at issue is a ­­ is a building. And               no one, I think, ever asks the question, well, in a            Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review separate different hypothetical case, could a defendant        who was charged with a building and a boat be convicted             if they didn't find if it was the building or find if ­­            no one thinks about it, because in this case where only           the building is at issue, you have to find the building           to convict it.                 I mean, it's functioning as an element in       that case. Either you find building and the person is           convicted, or you don't find building and the        individual, as a matter of law, can't be convicted.                      So we think that the modified categorical       approach resolves and answers this concern that you have         suggested about the Court ensuring that the person        actually was convicted of generic burglary. And what         Petitioner's approach would do, even though in a        modified categorical approach already answered that      question, would try to ingraft this State law inquiry         onto divisibility. And it's one that, you know, the          Court's opinions, regardless of what the Court said in         Descamps, the Court's opinions definitely have not done        before.             And I think this goes back to Descamps and          why we think it goes our way is that the Court provided            these examples in Descamps, and it's provided them in         other cases too. And those examples just didn't depend          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review on parsing State law. Those examples for ­­ I think            the ­­ the most paradigmatic was the one Justice Breyer          suggested, which was a burglary statute that covers         buildings and houses, that covers houses and boats,        et cetera.              And the Court has said on at least five         occasions, I mean, Descamps says this twice, that that          statute is divisible, and it ­­ it just would be odd for            the Court to have said so many times that the statute is            divisible if, in fact, it's divisible in some cases, if          you can find a case under State law, but it's not            divisible in other cases, if you can't find the case          law ­­                                     JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was ­­     JUSTICE KAGAN: I think ­­      JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the purpose for        which the State may classify this as a means rather than            an element? What was the context in which the State           made that determination?               MS. SAHARSKY: This question only arises       when a person has been charged with more than one thing,            so a burglary of a building and a boat, for example.              And then the question is, if this goes to trial and the            jury ­­ and it goes to the jury, does the jury           unanimously have to find which he did, the house or the           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review boat, or can the ­­ can six members find house and six            members find boat?               And so this ­­ this question actually just        doesn't arise very much under State law. I mean,           frankly, I was kind of surprised when we started looking           at this case. I thought I'd be able to look at all               States and find one, and we just couldn't. Between the           parties in this case, I think we found cases in two            States.             And I think another example that ­­ that         illustrates how this doesn't come up very often is the          drug statutes. I think this Court knows from other           prior cases that some State drug schedules list a lot of            drugs that aren't on the Federal schedule. So in          Mellouli, the Court, you know, had to figure out, is          this like the Federal offense or is this not like the           Federal offense? And the Ninth Circuit justices who         looked at this or judges who looked at this said, you           know, it's amazing because there are so many California         drug convictions, and there is just no law in whether          the drug is ­­ has to be ­­ the type of drug has to be               proven unanimously in the case where more than one is at           issue.             And when you talk about, you know, things        like that where the Court in itself has assumed that the           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review drug statutes would be divisible, and we don't know that          answer for a case like California, I think it ­­ it             would really be a remarkable change to what the Court           has done so far with the modified categorical approach.         It's really not something that the Court's opinions have         done in any meaningful way, and I think it would be            unfortunate when the Court has provided examples like        the burglary of a building or a boat and the Court's             relied on those examples. Like the district court in          this case and the Court of Appeals both relied on those           examples and said, this is the exact ­­                   JUSTICE BREYER: Is this right? Is this         like ­­ like even with the Massachusetts statute, the         question has never come up. So we don't really know           what the jury has to find in the case of a houseboat.                         But where there's a word in the statute,         like Descamps, and that alternative thing like       houseboat, da da, da, is not in the statute, but rather           it's a judge­made interpretation of the statute, and the          courts say there is several different categories, it        would be virtually impossible for a court under those          circumstances to say that the A, B and C, which it            divided the statute into, that they're elements. You         would have to say they're means. Do you think?                        I don't think a State court would have the         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review power to, in the face of a statute that doesn't itself            divide things, to say that, A is an element of the crime             that has to be defined, and then B is a different             element of a different crime.                              MS. SAHARSKY: Well ­­    JUSTICE BREYER: Is that ­­ is that ­­ I          have no idea of the answer to that question. I'm           looking for ways of simplifying this case. And if you           knew the answer to that question, it would help me.                      MS. SAHARSKY: Well, I think there are two          answers to that question. The first is, we do think ­­           and this is ­­ the Court left this question open in           Descamps about the extent to which you could use         judicial decisions. But we do think that in some          circumstances a judge could or a court could define a            crime. I mean, they're common law crimes that are just            defined by the courts and that those could be divisible,          but that's not ­­ that was ­­ that was reserved in           Descamps. That's not something the Court had to answer.                      But I think the second answer, which        hopefully gets to your question, is, you know, can we ­­          either rules of thumb or something with the State courts          that we can try to figure out whether something is a           means or is an element based on how the statute's          written? And I think the real trouble is that we can't.             Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review               I mean, we've looked to try to find a source          of law in Massachusetts, and we've also looked to what          the ­­ what the State courts have told us their          approaches are, and this is in our brief. But, for           example, they say, you know, we don't have bright­line         rules. We have to use a multi­factor test. We set out              rules, but they're mind bending in their application.        That's what one of the State courts said. You know,           this is not a predictable area. And I think actually             the Court recommends the same thing. And this was a key             component of the Court's reasoning in Schad.                   Schad was the plurality opinion that was       asking if ­­ are there constitutional limitations on how         a court ­­ how a State legislature can define "means"           versus "elements." That was a case in which the State            legislature had said, the jury doesn't unanimously have        to agree on whether murder is premeditated murder or         felony murder. And the defendant came in and said, wow,           can you really say that the jury doesn't have to agree           on that? There should be some constitutional limit.                     And one critical part of the Court's opinion        was that there aren't any bright­line rules about what         constitutes a means or what constitutes an element.         It's a matter of State law, and there is wide variation            of that.  Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             So as much as we have looked, we don't think          that there is an easy answer to the State law questions,           and we think, you know, it's really asking a lot to            think that Federal courts are going to be doing those in           the first instance. I mean, these are questions about           the State legislature's intent, and you're talking       about, you know, either taking those questions kind of         away from the State courts and having Federal courts         start to do them on a routine basis or ­­ we're talking             about what one judge in the Ninth Circuit suggested,         which is we're never going to find out these answers          unless we certify these questions to the State courts.         And if you're talking about sentencing judges who        sentence every day and have to use the modified         categorical approach, you know, certifying to the State        courts, I think that really would be, you know,          an extraordinary intrusion.               So, you know, at the end of the day, I think            we think that the Court really has a choice in this case             between the approach that it's used for years and the           examples that it's given and Petitioner's approach, and        we think that Petitioner's approach really would up end         the modified categorical approach. It would require the         State law question to be answered in lots of cases. In            the first instance by Federal judges, we think that it          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review would create a lot of uncertainty. The ACCA, as the            Court has said in Descamps, is supposed to function as          an on/off switch, and it certainly wouldn't ­­                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Tell me what         your approach is that you think is our approach?                     MS. SAHARSKY: Sure. Yeah. I'm glad to.                      That a statute is divisible when it sets out          statutory alternatives, one of which corresponds to the        Federal generic offense, that you don't need to        undertake a State law inquiry into whether something is          a means or element.                JUSTICE KAGAN: Which is to say that        elements don't matter, and that's the thing that is         contrary to years of this Court's precedents, because         if this Court's precedents say anything, they say that         this is an elements­based inquiry, which means that we         have to decide whether something is an element.                    MS. SAHARSKY: I ­­ and that's ­­ that's          really, I think, the next thing I was ­­ I was hoping to                say, which is that the reason that the Court has talked           about elements as well as the statutory alternatives is         because it wants to have an assurance that the person          actually was convicted of generic burglary. And the way          you get the assurance is not through this State law          inquiry into whether something is a means in a          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review hypothetical case. You get the assurance through the         review of the Shepard documents.                 And we think that the courts ­­ the aim of          the courts ­­              JUSTICE KAGAN: But that sounds ­­ that        sounds very fact­based. You look at the Shepard         documents and you see what they actually did. But this           Court has said in no uncertain terms that that's not          what we do.               Much as ­­ much as some people think that         that's an intuitive way to decide these questions, much         as some people think that maybe we should have done that            years ago, but we don't do that. We don't look at,             let's look at the documents and see what the guy did.           We say, let's look at the documents and see if he was            necessarily convicted of something, meaning that the law        required him ­­ the law required that a particular          finding be made in order for this conviction to occur.                      And that's where your approach is something       very different from what we've ever done, because you're         saying that, notwithstanding that the law did not        require that a particular finding be made, we'll take a           look at the documents and decide that that finding was          made.             MS. SAHARSKY: Well, maybe I should clarify         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review a little bit and say that we think that we look to see             whether the law required that this finding be made in          reality in this case, not hypothetically in some        different case. And what I mean by that is, we are             using the Shepard documents in conjunction with the fact         that the statute lists alternatives.                 And what we are doing ­­ the reason that         we're not looking at facts is because the alternatives         show that the legislature has defined this thing, entry         into a building, as part of the offense, as a way to              commit the offense.               And then the question, the whole point of        the modified categorical approach, is: Can we know if          the person was convicted of that thing or something else          with certainty using the Shepard documents?                  JUSTICE KAGAN: But the point of the        modified categorical approach is to take a truly         divisible statute ­­ in other words, a statute with          three separate elements in it, of which you only need to           be convicted of one ­­ and to figure out whether the one            that you were convicted of, the one particular element,         matches up with the generic offense.                  It's not to do anything more than that.        Descamps is quite clear on this ­­ on this matter, that           it takes ­­ it's ­­ it's three separate elements. Do           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review you ­­ does what you were convicted of, is that the           right element to match the generic offense?                   MS. SAHARSKY: I think that we're in         agreement to the extent that we're talking about        matching the statutory alternatives with the generic       Federal offense.              JUSTICE KAGAN: Except that you say       "statutory alternatives," and I say "elements," because        for years we've been saying "elements," and that we          can't do this inquiry if we're in the world of          nonelemental facts.              MS. SAHARSKY: Well, frankly, I think the         Court has said both things. You know, in the opinion in            Descamps, there's actually a part of the Court's opinion          that equates the two. It says, "Sentencing courts may          look only at the statutory definitions"; i.e. ­­                   JUSTICE KAGAN: Elements are what defines       the crime.              MS. SAHARSKY: Right. But I think that the           ­­ the court used "elements" to mean the statutory         definition, because the alternatives set out in the        statute do define the crime.                 And I ­­ I take your point, that the           ultimate concern of the modified categorical approach is        ensuring that the individual actually was convicted of        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review generic burglary. But I don't think that we need to            look to the separate State law question about what         happens in a different defendant's case. I mean, that's            what the means analysis that ­­ that was Justice         Ginsburg's question, right, goes to, which is: What         happens in a different case when more than one thing is            at issue?              When ­­ when we have a statute that sets          out, this is a form of burglary, and the Court has            talked about different version of the offense, a version          of the offense is burglary of a building, and so the            legislature has defined that as an offense. And the          question is: Did the defendant ­­ was he convicted of           that offense?                I think ­­ and this, I think, goes to the          other part of your question, which is, you're asking         about how is that any different from fact­finding,        right? That's just fact­finding. And I think the Court            answered that question in Descamps when it gave the         example of a statute that doesn't have the alternatives,          like the weapons one, as opposed to a statute that does            have the alternatives. Because when the statute doesn't         have the alternatives, you don't have an option that was          identified by the legislature as part of the definition         of the crime that you're trying to match to the Federal           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review offense.             You're not just ­­ you're not looking at        something that the legislature has defined and saying,        well, did the Shepard documents show that or do they not           show that? What you're doing is, there's ­­ there's a           hole in the statute, right? It doesn't tell you, for           example, in Descamps, the different types of entries.        And you're just filling in that hole with facts. You're           just looking at, what are the facts of what the          defendant did? Can I clean them from the Shepard           documents? And then you're trying to match them up with           the Federal generic offense.                And at that point, you know, the opinion in         Descamps says, you know, it's not a categorical approach          anymore. The Ninth Circuit ­­ one judge in the Ninth           Circuit, and the court called it a modified factual          approach at that point, right, because you're just        trying to match the facts of what the defendant did.          There's no statutory basis for calling this building ­­        this type of burglary, you know, burglary.                   But here we have that statutory basis. We         have those statutory alternatives. And the Court has         said on so many different occasions, and the lower         courts have relied on it, that it's the presence of          statutory or alternatives that are critical because when        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review you have that ­­ those in combination with the Shepard          documents, you can make the decision of whether that         statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction,        whether the person was convicted of that version of         burglary or not.               But when you don't have that statutory       phrase there ­­ the Court said this on page of its            opinion in Descamps ­­ you're just asking what the         defendant actually did. And then once you're doing         that, when you're not looking at the way the legislature          has defined the crime, there's really no stopping point,         right? And I think that was the ­­ the ­­ one of the               concern of the Court's opinion in Descamps, is that he          could have been convicted of something that has nothing         to do with burglary, and we'll just try to look through           all the facts in the Shepard documents and see if          they're really burglary. The Court said don't do that.                      But here, the legislature has defined this       offense so that it ­­ the ­­ all components of generic           burglary are in the offense. And I understand the           Court's instinct, to think, well, we said "elements,"        and elements means we have to make sure that the          person ­­ that this actually was proven. But we think           that the modified categorical approach itself, by taking        the statute and then looking at the Shepard documents,         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review does that, that it really satisfies the concern.                    And frankly, that's ­­ that ­­ that was the         message that we got. And of course, the Court knows           best what its opinion in Descamps meant, but that was          the message we got from the end of footnote of            Descamps, which says, you know, whether something is a         means or elements, you shouldn't parse State law. You          should just look to the Shepard documents. And that's          what we're saying, is just to look to the Shepard          documents, and if something is ­­                 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, the end of footnote         said in some cases you won't need to parse State law           because you can figure it out from the Shepard         documents, because Shepard documents are a clue to         whether something is a means or an element.                     And so in the situation in which State law         is not, as it is in this case, utterly clear on the            subject, you won't have to go , layers down, because          the Descamps ­­ the ­­ the Shepard documents will tell          you, because of the way the prosecutor has charged         something, looks like this is just a means, or looks           like this is really an element.                  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, I mean, we don't think          you need to do the State law inquiry in the first place,            because the Shepard documents will tell you that the         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review person actually was convicted of that. And I just think            this question about whether it was ­­                  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, why wouldn't you look        to State law? You have a State law that says exactly             that this is not an element. Why wouldn't you just take            that?             MS. SAHARSKY: Because ­­ because it doesn't        matter that that case is about what would happen to a           different defendant in a case where more than one thing           is charged. And it doesn't matter for our purposes what           happens in that hypothetical case because this       individual, and the individuals where we're trying to        use the Shepard documents to actually enhance, have just         one thing charged, right? Like, it's burglary of a          building, and burglary of a building is generic         burglary, and there's no dispute that the ­­ the statute          says burglary of a building, and this is burglary of a            building, and it would be odd to give that defendant a           pass because ­­                          JUSTICE KAGAN: The only ­­     JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it      conviction­based not ­­ rather than conduct­based? It's        conviction­based, it's okay; conduct­based isn't.     Conduct charge is burgling a house.                   MS. SAHARSKY: Right. It's ­­ it's        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review conviction­based, the Court said in Taylor, because you        want to have uniformity, right? Congress said burglary,         and you want to make sure that everyone who's been          convicted of the same type of offense actually is         treated the same.               And I think that the problem with        Petitioner's approach is that you could have defendants        convicted in two states that have the exact same State          statute, their Shepard documents could look exactly the        same, and then this answer might turn on whether you          could find some sort of State law that would say what           would happen in a different case where defendant is          charged with more than one thing.                  So we think that the Court's approach is        really ­­ come from this concern about uniformity.                                                        JUSTICE KAGAN: It ­­    MS. SAHARSKY: And I ­­      JUSTICE KAGAN: Please.    MS. SAHARSKY: Just ­­ just one other point,         which is: I think it's really telling that the reason            that the Court adopted ­­ and let's go back to where           this started, right? It's: What does burglary mean          under the ACCA? And the Court adopted the burglary          definition it did, which is generic burglary, because it         encompassed the definitions in most States. The Court         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review wanted to reach the common denominator in most States.                     And the effect of Petitioner's position, I       think we all agree, is that it would not ­­ the modified            categorical approach would not reach burglary in ­­ in         most States; that the ACCA would have a very limited           application at best under Petitioner's approach.                  And of course, you know the modified       categorical approach is used in so many different areas,         and so these problems with parsing State law, et cetera,          would just be multiplied through all of the other         different statutes in which the Court has used the         modified categorical approach.               So we really think that Petitioner is ­­ is         doing what, you know, was the outlier approach in ­­ in           Descamps, which is trying to change, you know, ­plus         years of settled law and start having this new         additional inquiry. We just think you shouldn't do it.                      JUSTICE KAGAN: Here you have a State         statute that specifically tells you that this is not an          element of the offense. And you were saying why it was            that you thought that you could ignore that ­­ excuse          me, not a State statute, but a State judicial opinion ­­            why it was that you could ignore that.                    The only reason you could ignore that State        judicial opinion is because if you don't care it's an          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review element. And that's very much against what we've been          saying since Taylor.               MS. SAHARSKY: Could I respond?                     I ­­ I don't think that's true. The reason          that you don't care is because you can tell from the           Shepard documents that the individual in this case, and         in some similar cases, actually was convicted of generic         burglary.             And that defendant doesn't care whether it's       a means or an element, because it had to be proven in            his case for him to get convicted.                   We think the judgment should be affirmed.                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   Three minutes, Mr. Fleming.             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.                    What has been on the books for years is          this Court's statement in Taylor that the categorical        approach turns on "the elements of the statute of         conviction." Or as the Court put it in Moncrieffe,          "what facts are necessarily established by a conviction         for the State offense."                It's been very clear from my colleague's       argument that the government is interested in what        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Mr. Mathis did, and that is not what ACCA looks to. It             is not the categorical approach. The government has         offered no reason of principle to distinguish this case         from Mr. Descamps' case. The only distinction between         the two cases is that Iowa statute uses the word "or"           with a disjunctive list, and California does it by          silence by simply using the word "enters" without adding         "lawfully" or "unlawfully."               There is no reason to treat those situations        differently, given that both California, through      silence, and Iowa, through an express list, are setting         out only the means of commission. And they have nothing           to do with what Taylor calls the focus of the ­­ of the             modified and the traditional categorical approach, which       is the elements of the statute of conviction.                    The drug statutes in California are an       example of the workability of the position that we and          the Ninth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit have set out.          They have ­­ there have been many decisions. We cite           them in our reply brief, finding that the drug statutes          are indeed divisible by drug type, and so the modified          categorical approach does apply.                There are numerous other decisions where the       modified categorical approach will continue to apply.       States obviously can also, if they want their        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review convictions to qualify as ACCA predicates, can make sure         they have a generic offense where the conviction clearly          requires proof of generic burglary. The government's        position will ­­ will cause a significant        Sixth Amendment problem because sentence enhancements      are going to be based on something beyond the mere fact           of a conviction. It would require this Court to           consider whether to expand the Almendarez­Torres      exception.             JUSTICE ALITO: You're seriously arguing      that ­­ you're seriously arguing that all of the States          will or should go back and reformulate their burglary         statutes so as ­­               MR. FLEMING: No, Your Honor.                  JUSTICE ALITO: ­­ to make the conviction?                    Well, that's what you just said. So if they          want them to count as ACCA predicates, no problem. They           can just go back and change their burglary statutes.                     MR. FLEMING: As ­­ as some States have         generic burglary statutes that do require proof of all         the elements of generic burglary, if Congress is        dissatisfied with the reach of ACCA, it can amend ACCA.          ACCA used to have a definition of burglary in it in            . It said burglary involves a building. Congress           could very easily say, you know what? That was too           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review narrow. We're going to overrule that aspect of Taylor,          and we'll say burglary, for purposes of ACCA, will         include boats and houses.                Nothing prevents themselves from doing that.      They could amend ACCA so it focuses on conduct instead          of convictions. There have been many calls for Congress          to do that. But for years ­­ and stare decisis is             particularly important ­­ in this statutory area,       Congress has let this Court ­­                 JUSTICE ALITO: What do you make of the fact          that until this case, the Court has never analyzed         whether something was an element or a means?                     MR. FLEMING: The ­­ the same point could         have been made in Descamps. And Descamps        specifically ­­             JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you said this has been         established for years and the Court has used the term           element, element, element, but has it ever before gone         into the question of whether what it was talking about          in that particular case was in the technical sense,         either an element or a means?                   MR. FLEMING: May I respond, Mr. Chief         Justice?             The issue did not come up before Descamps.        So as the previous cases came to the Court, the issue           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review either did not matter or it was not disputed. And it is             not uncommon for this Court to take as assumed issues          that the parties are not disputing. In Descamps, it was           disputed; in this case, it is disputed. And for it to            be resolved consistently with what the Court has said         for ­­ for years, it's important that the Court          maintain the focus on the elements and not on the means.           Otherwise, Descamps would have come out the wrong way.                     We submit it came out the right way, and         this case should come out the same way. We would           respectfully submit the judgment should be reversed and        the case remanded so Mr. Mathis can be resentenced         without regard to ACCA.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   The case is submitted.                (Whereupon, at : a.m., the case in the        above­entitled matter was submitted.)    Alderson Reporting Company
