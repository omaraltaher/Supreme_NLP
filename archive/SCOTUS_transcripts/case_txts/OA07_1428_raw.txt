 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument today in Case 07-1428, Ricci v. DeStefano, and 
the consolidated case.

 Mr. Coleman.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. COLEMAN:  Good morning, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 Racial classifications are inherently 

pernicious and, if not checked, lead as they did in New 
Haven to regrettable and socially destructive racial 
politics.

 Neither equal protection nor Title VII 
justified New Haven's race-based scuttling of the 
promotions Petitioners earned through the civil service 
process mandated by Connecticut law.  The lower court 
required no strong evidentiary basis that the City was 
acting to remedy or avoid any actual discrimination, but 
strong safeguards are needed to smoke out illegitimate 
uses of race and to extinguish the racial favoritism 
that civil service laws -- excuse me -- are intended to 
prevent.

 Governmental employment actions grounded in

race must be strictly scrutinized because they engender 
divisiveness and cause race-grounded harm that the 
Constitution seeks to avert.  That standard does not 
change with the race of those the government seeks to --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I just ask this 

question?  Is it undisputed that it was a race-based 
decision?

 MR. COLEMAN:  No, Justice Stevens.  I think 
the city makes the argument that it was not a race-based 
decision simply because the effect of the scuttling 
resulted in no promotions being given at all.  We 
believe that that is not a basis for distinguishing 
this.  That it still remains a race-based decision.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Are you contending that 

that's an issue of fact that has to be tried out or that 
we should accept your version of that -- of that issue?

 MR. COLEMAN:  I believe that that's an issue 
of law, Your Honor.  It is no different ultimately than 
what the Court concluded in Croson.  This type of an 
argument that a do-over is not a racial classification 
is exactly what happened in Croson.  There was a do-over 
declared, a -- a rebidding; and yet the Court said, 
because that rebidding was declared for racial reasons, 
it would nevertheless be subjected to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That was pursuant to --

to an affirmative action plan, and here we're dealing 
with this concept under Title VII of disparate impact. 
And let's take for one example a test that's given by a 
police department, a fire department, and it -- it's a 
physical fitness test, and it disproportionately 
excludes female applicants.  And when the results come 
in and there are no women on the eligibility list, the 
department reconsiders.  It thinks there is something 
wrong with this test.  It can probably test for the 
necessary skills in a way that will not achieve those 
results.

 Would it be similarly impermissible, 

similarly based on an impermissible criterion, if the 
department said:  We're not going to -- we have got the 
results of that test.  We're going to throw it out and 
substitute another that will not have those skewed 
results.

 MR. COLEMAN:  If that decision was grounded 

in a determination that we simply need to ensure that 
there are more women on the force, then, yes, it would 
be subjected to heightened scrutiny, maybe not strict 
scrutiny under that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Not more women on the 

force, but this test that we're giving has the effect of 
excluding most women, just as the high school diploma

had the effect, a disproportionate effect, on one race.
 MR. COLEMAN:  I think your question gets to 
part of the heart of this case, and that is, ultimately: 
Is the decision that's being made one that is -- is 
based in race or is -- is based on a determination that 
there is an improper test?  But this decision is 
grounded in race if -- if the police department in your 
case had clear evidence that the test was simply 
unnecessary, that it was not job-related and could be 
clearly done by an identifiable alternative, I think at 
the end of the day there might be some basis.  But if it 
is grounded in --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So they would have to go 
-- I take it from what you said they would have to go as 
far as proving a Title VII disparate impact case against 
themselves.  They couldn't do anything short of that to 
prevail when it is the majority race that is complaining 
about discrimination.

 MR. COLEMAN:  To use the constitutional 

analogy, Your Honor, I think Wygant, Croson, Adarand, 
other cases, make clear that you do not have to prove 
the violation against yourself, but you do have to 
demonstrate that you have a strong basis in evidence for 
believing you are violating the law.  In Wygant the 
plurality set that out citing convincing evidence.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  The problem, Mr. Coleman, 
is that -- that the cases you are relying on, it seems 
to me, are cases in which ultimately what is being 
judged is a different result in the -- at the end point 
of the process which was starting.  And the problem that 
I have with -- with using cases like that and -- and 
essentially the problem I -- I have with your argument 
is that it leaves a -- a municipality or a governmental 
body like New Haven in a -- in a damned if you do, 
damned if you don't situation.  Because on -- on the 
very assumptions that you are making, if they go forward 
with -- with their -- their hiring plan, they certify 
the results and go forward with it, they are inevitably 
facing a disparate impact lawsuit.

 If they stop and say, wait a minute, we're 

starting down the road toward a disparate impact lawsuit 
and, indeed, there may be something wrong here, they are 
inevitably facing a disparate treatment suit.  And 
whatever Congress wanted to attain, it couldn't have 
wanted to attain that kind of a situation.

 Why isn't the most reasonable reading of 
this set of facts a reading which is consistent with 
giving the city an opportunity, assuming good faith, to 
start again?  And I -- I recognize there's got to be a 
good faith condition, and the -- the good faith can

always be attacked.  But isn't that the only way to 
avoid the damned if you do, damned if you don't 
situation?

 MR. COLEMAN:  No, I completely disagree with 

that, Justice Souter.  It not simply a matter of good 
faith.  The use of race in government is so -- the Court 
has been so --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But you make no distinction 

between race as an animating discriminating object on 
the one hand and race consciousness on the other.  There 
is no way to deal with a situation like this any more 
than there is a way to deal with -- with setting lines 
in voting districts --

MR. COLEMAN:  I also --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- without pervasive race 

consciousness.  That is not unconstitutional, and it 
seems to me that you are not observing that distinction 
in -- in your reply.

 MR. COLEMAN:  I disagree with that as well, 

Justice Souter.  There is a strong difference in what 
happened in this case.  In partial answer to Justice 
Ginsburg's question, et al., this is not an issue where 
the -- where the city had before it and was making a 
determination that our examination is not job related. 
In fact, it is clear on the record that what the city

said is, this comes to the wrong racial result, and, 
therefore, there must be something wrong with the test. 
When pressed --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, let me ask you this 

-- this question, and I don't mean to interrupt your 
answer, but it is based on what Justice Souter and 
Justice Ginsburg have both been asking.  Hypothetical 
case:  The city says, our test is not very good.  We 
need a new test.

 The expert says, don't pay us to have a new 

one.  There are two great ones out there.  One is in 
City A.  The other is in City B.  Use either one of 
those.  They are great.

 They check.  They find out that City A has a 

disparate impact in the statistical sense, not in the 
legal sense; that it disadvantages minorities, at least 
if you look at the passage rates.  The other test 
doesn't.  Are they permitted to take the test that 
doesn't have that differential?

 MR. COLEMAN:  Under our alternative 

argument, Your Honor, assuming that -- that fixing 
disparate impact can be a compelling interest, we 
believe that you would at least have to demonstrate a 
strong basis in evidence to show that there is liability 
under (k)(2) -- your -- your example --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My -- my question is --

and you can answer, I guess, both under Title VII and --
and under the Fourteenth Amendment.  The city says, the 
only reason -- the only reason for our selecting the 
test from City B -- and both tests are very good tests 
-- is because minorities are better represented on the 
passing rate.  Is that permissible?

 MR. COLEMAN:  Under the Armstrong basis of 
evidence test, it might very well be because it meets 
the second qualification of the disparate impact 
statute, in which there is a specific alternative that 
is equally valid.  If you are -- if you are going to 
assume that it can be shown to be equally valid and that 
it has less disparate impact --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And do you find -- and do 

you find any constitutional deficiency in the city's 
choice in that hypothetical case?  Is there any 
Fourteenth Amendment problem?

 MR. COLEMAN:  Well, we are certainly quite 
troubled that the Court would say, as it has not said, 
that the idea of -- of overcoming purely unintentional 
discrimination can be a compelling interest for cutting 
off what we believe is intentional discrimination.  But 
barring that, our test, our backup test, is then that 
the strong basis in evidence test that exists from

Wygant and Croson would at least in its -- require that 
you have a strong basis in evidence for demonstrating 
liability under this --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, what -- what if 

you've got -- what if you've got the basis of Justice 
Kennedy's hypothetical?  You've -- you've got a 
municipality.  It's a racially mixed municipality.  It's 
got two tests.  That's his hypothetical.  One of them 
seems to suggest that there is going to be a significant 
racial disparity in the results if they use it.  The 
other one from the other city or the other State 
suggests not.  That's all they've got to go on.

 Is that a strong basis in evidence, or did 
they walk their way into a lawsuit by you if they adopt 
the -- the test that doesn't -- that at least in the 
other place hasn't produced the disparity?

 MR. COLEMAN:  Under that argument, as long 
as it can be demonstrated to be equally content valid, 
equally or better content valid and to have a lesser 
impact, then it would show -- it would establish a 
stronger --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  They would not have 

discriminated against any particular --

MR. COLEMAN:  That's -- that's correct, Your 

Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- white or -- or majority 

applicants in -- in that selection, which is what 
occurred here.  You had -- you had some applicants who 
were winners, and their -- their promotion was -- was 
set aside.  That doesn't exist in these hypotheticals at 
all.  It's just an abstract question of which of these 
two systems should be adopted.

 MR. COLEMAN:  Well, I understood Justice 

Kennedy's hypothetical to be after you have taken a test 
and building upon the hypothetical.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It wasn't my --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No.  No.  It was --
MR. COLEMAN:  It was --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It was designed to show, 

and maybe it's theoretical, but I want to know the 
answer so that I can understand this case.  It's 
designed to ask you the question whether or not race 
consciousness is ever permissible.

 MR. COLEMAN:  If -- if in your situation is 
simply in your situation the initial giving of the test, 
can you choose between those two tests, then we believe 
based upon what the Court has said in the past that a 
city could do that.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  A city can in fact choose a 

test simply because there will be more minority people

who will in fact end up in the positions, that's your 
view?

 MR. COLEMAN:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You needn't do anything 
else?  I mean, that is your answer to Justice Kennedy?

 MR. COLEMAN:  Nobody can know in fact --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I want to know is that your 

answer to Justice Kennedy or not?

 MR. COLEMAN:  Under that hypothetical, we 

believe they can choose that test.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are you assuming --
JUSTICE BREYER:  The answer is yes.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are you --
JUSTICE BREYER:  If that's so, what's the 
difference here?  The most that you're saying is the 
worst that could have happened here; the worst that 
could have happened is that some experts told them, this 
test -- by the way, test one is -- is even worse than in 
Justice Kennedy's hypothetical.  It's a test that 
probably discriminates negatively against minorities. 
So if you admit he could do it even if the test didn't 
discriminate negatively against minorities, namely 
test -- in his case, why can't you do it triply, in the 
case where there's evidence that they did discriminate, 
the test does discriminate against minorities?

MR. COLEMAN:  Two very strong differences, 
Justice Breyer.  First of all, our -- our firefighters 
had already taken the test; they had earned their 
promotions under state law.  There was nothing left to 
do but to ministerially certify the lists, all right? 
The second difference is this.  The only --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, that can't be right 
if they -- if what you just answered to Justice Kennedy 
is -- is right.

 Suppose they had very strong evidence that 

the test that they had given that had these results, 
just as my physical fitness test that excluded all 
women -- that had it those results, it wasn't 
job-related, and there was a better test available, they 
wouldn't have any vested right in getting the promotions 
under those circumstances, would they?

 MR. COLEMAN:  We're not claiming that it's a 
vested right.  What we're claiming is that sometimes the 
Court has permitted governments to use race to remedy 
discrimination, and what would be needed in that 
hypothetical, Your Honor, is -- is the discrimination; 
and under your hypothetical there might very well be a 
strong case of discrimination, but under these facts 
there is no evidence in this record, and the city 
conceded below and never asserted in its bio in this

case that it had any basis to contest the 
job-relatedness of this examination or these 
examinations that were given.  That is not part of the 
record in this case.  The --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- one of the briefs 
said that, and maybe it wasn't done below, but one of 
the briefs said part of the claim is that some of the 
things that this test tested for were not -- were not 
qualities or abilities that were needed in New Haven, 
although they might be needed in other fire departments. 
The test had not been localized.  Wasn't that part of 
the -- part of the objection?

 MR. COLEMAN:  No, Your Honor, not in the 

district court.  If you look at 1024a of the Pet. App., 
the city's lawyer in front of the district court and in 
its pleadings on summary judgment very clearly states 
that they didn't believe the job relatedness is even 
relevant to the case.  All that they needed was good 
faith.  They didn't need job relatedness, they didn't 
need an actual alternative, which is the basis of some 
of the hypotheticals you're giving.  All they need is 
good faith.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then why did they have 
the testimony before the Civil Service Board, about --

multiple choice test; it tests rote memory; we could 
have come up with a test that would better test the 
skills needed to be -- nothing about the localization, 
but something about command presence.  There was a term 
used, assessment centers; that this test didn't 
effectively test the skills that you needed on the job, 
and others did.

 MR. COLEMAN:  Justice Ginsburg, that's not 

at all what Mr. Hornick said in front of the Civil 
Service Board.  What he said is first, I didn't look at 
the test; two, I looked at the results and I see 
disparate impact; three, I'm not going to tell you what 
exams we gave, but I'm mentioning this thing called an 
assessment center, but I could design a better test, not 
having even looked at this test.

 But at the end of the day he also said, I 

think you should go ahead and give these promotions and 
in the future maybe you could fix your test.  He didn't 
say here's an alternative; here's why this would be 
equally valid, here's why -- excuse me -- here's why 
this would have lesser impact.  He simply said there is 
a concept called an assessment center, and I think that 
that might help you in the future, but you should go 
ahead and give the promotions on this test.  Same --

ago you said you had two answers to Justice Breyer's 
question.  I would like to hear the second one.

 MR. COLEMAN:  Well, I actually think I got 

to the -- the first.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If you got to that, then I 

have -- I'd like one follow-up, and that's it.

 (Laughter.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maybe if you don't 

mind, you could remind me what the second answer was.

 MR. COLEMAN:  Again -- again, getting to the 

-- the fundamental point is, the use of race is so, so 
very important that the Court has always expressed 
skepticism and hostility to it, and what we're saying 
under this argument regarding a strong basis in 
evidence, and I think this answers both your 
hypothetical and Justice Souter's, is that what the city 
is saying, we don't have to demonstrate a strong basis 
in evidence for liability, we concede that we don't have 
that; all we have is good faith.  And that's not enough. 
That leads --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But you are -- as I 

understand it, you are imposing your strong basis in 
evidence test on what you referred to a second ago as 
the use of race, and that cannot be correct, because the 
use of race includes race-conscious decisions which are

not discriminatory decisions, and they certainly do not 
implicate the -- the obligation that you want to impose.
 You -- if -- if your argument is going to be 

coherent with what we start with, it can't be based 
merely on the use of race because if it does, then you 
are, in effect, turning any race-conscious decision into 
a discrimination decision, and that equation we 
certainly haven't made and we're never going to make.
 MR. COLEMAN:  That's not our intention, 

Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Then --
MR. COLEMAN:  Our argument is clearly that 
this is not race-conscious, that it is race-based.  The 
only determination that the city made is we don't like 
the results of this test; there must be something 
different that we can do; and we don't need to 
demonstrate --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But even --
MR. COLEMAN:  -- viability or strong basis 

in evidence.  We can simply fix it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I don't want to turn this 
into just a rhetoric exercise, but I think the rhetoric 
is important.  You say the city took the position, we 
don't like the results of this test.  That kind of a 
statement is consistent with saying, look, we don't like

the race of the people who are going to benefit from 
this.  It's also consistent with the city's taking the 
position that there is such a racial disparity here that 
we are either asking for trouble or walking blindly or 
perhaps foolishly into a -- a racial disparity lawsuit 
based on disparate impact.

 Those are two very, very different 

attitudes.  The first one is discriminatory.  I don't 
see how the second one is discriminatory.

 MR. COLEMAN:  But it -- it clearly is, 

Justice Souter.  I think the distinction we're making in 
part is this principle of individual dignity that the 
Court has recognized is so strong distinguishes the 
hypothetical that Justice Kennedy gave me from -- form 
the example that we have in this case where they had 
already taken the test; identifiable individuals had 
earned their promotions; and then the city says too many 
non-minorities passed this test, and we are going to 
scuttle these results based on identifiable individuals 
who have passed and not based on any -- anything 
approaching a demonstration that there is actually any 
disparate impact liability.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But the cost of drawing the 

distinction between this case and Justice Kennedy's 
hypothetical example is that if we draw that

distinction, the only way the city can get itself out of 
not only a certain lawsuit, but quite probably a 
successful lawsuit, is to make, in practical terms, a 
preliminary case against itself.

 MR. COLEMAN:  I --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  And it -- I cannot conceive 
that Congress intended to put a city into that situation 
saying you've either got to blunder ahead into a losing 
lawsuit in court, or you have got to stop and expose 
yourself to another lawsuit which you can only win by 
proving that you at least had taken some steps in 
violating the law the first time.  That is 
inconceivable.

 MR. COLEMAN:  Justice Souter, I understand 

the concern about the employer's point of view, which we 
don't think stands here just because of the blatant way 
the City went about this.  But in general terms we're 
not asking, contrary to Wygant, contrary to Croson, that 
you prove up a claim against yourself.

 But what we are saying is that the standard 

cannot be so light that the City very lightly and 
without any demonstration whatsoever that there might 
actually be liability here, based simply on the numbers, 
can say well, we're going to avoid liability and we're 
going to favor the minority group over the non-minority

group.

 All we're asking for is that the City 

undertake an honest and -- and open assessment of are we 
really likely to be liable here under the disparate 
impact provision of Title VII.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What do you do if there is 
not a liability in question?  Suppose a school district 
deliberately, to obtain greater racial diversities in 
the schools draws district boundaries in a particular 
way among neighborhoods or plans a construction program. 
Then suppose having done that, indeed having once drawn 
the boundaries, a group comes to the school district and 
says you can achieve greater diversity if you redraw the 
boundary.  You can achieve greater diversity if instead 
of building this school where the -- where the 
foundations are laid already, you build the school over 
here instead.

 Is that, in your view, different from your 

case?

 MR. COLEMAN:  I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It is?  How?
 MR. COLEMAN:  I think it is.  I think you're 

giving examples from Justice Kennedy's --

Grutter.  These are --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But I'm interested in the 

distinctions, not whether it's similar to Justice 
Thomas's or not.  I'm interested in the distinctions 
between this program -- I'll add one more if you want 
just this program, an employer --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can I hear his answer to 

this one first?  I'm getting confused.

 (Laughter.)
 MR. COLEMAN:  I think the Court is certainly 
not fully in agreement on these questions, but the Court 
has at least an opinion suggested that those types of 
examples really are more of -- as Justice Souter, you 
were saying, the race-conscious type determination, and 
they don't violate this principle of individual dignity. 
You're not taking individuals one by one who have 
already earned promotions, and you're taking away 
benefits from them clearly on the --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And the difference between 

that and drawing the school district boundary, which 
takes from the individual children who live in that 
neighborhood the right to go to this school, which they 
think is a better one, and sends them to that school,

which they think is a worse one, the difference between 
changing that boundary and changing the exam is what?

 MR. COLEMAN:  The difference that the Court, 

I believe, has suggested is that that type of a 
redrawing is likely to include a number of traditional 
redistricting factors and that race in that instance, 
unless it was shown to ultimately predominate, would not 
make it a race -- or, excuse me, a race-based effort 
that would violate equal protection.  I believe 
that's --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask you one 

question --

MR. COLEMAN:  Of course.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- because I'm not sure I 

understood your answer to Justice Kennedy?

 What is your answer to Justice Kennedy's 

question about the two alternatives, one of which would 
fit exactly into the concluding clause of the first 
question presented to achieve racial proportionality in 
candidates selected?  He says there are two alternatives 
before the school board, one would achieve the 
proportionality, the other would not.  Are they free to 
choose the former?

 MR. COLEMAN:  Again, assuming that no test 
has previously been given, if there are two tests, they

are equally valid, one can be demonstrated to have 
lesser disparate impact, if there are no other 
circumstances, then we think they could likely under 
that test --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  They could take that test, 

even though its sole purpose was to achieve racial 
proportionality in candidates selected?

 MR. COLEMAN:  I disagree that its sole 

purpose would be for that reason, Justice Stevens.  As 
long as it meets the other criteria for job relatedness, 
it would still be fulfilling the City's necessary needs 
for -- for identifying quality candidates for making 
sure --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  This is the -- putting to 

one side liability in the lawsuit, is the interest in 
avoiding disparate impact a valid State interest?

 MR. COLEMAN:  We certainly have taken the 
position if disparate impact is identified purely as 
unintentional discrimination, then we don't believe it's 
a compelling State interest to overcome --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I didn't say compelling. 
I said is it a valid State interest.  Just the interest 
in avoiding the kind of results you got here.

JUSTICE STEVENS:  The City is not merely 
trying to avoid liability, they are trying to avoid a 
disparate impact.  Is that a valid interest?

 MR. COLEMAN:  If the disparate impact is 

caused by something that could be demonstrated to equate 
to discrimination on behalf of the entity, which is what 
the elements of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I thought the whole 
idea of disparate impact is it's unintentional, that's 
the assumption, disparate treatment, intentional 
discrimination, disparate impact, unintentional, but it 
has askewed racial results.

 MR. COLEMAN:  There are two aspects to that, 

Justice Ginsburg.  The first is that you may have 
disparate impact if it is caused by unintentional 
discrimination.  But you may have disparate impact that 
occurs through no discrimination, intended or otherwise. 
And Watson clearly recognized that.  And when Watson 
said we need to have strong evidentiary standards in 
evaluating disparate impact liability, it was 
recognizing that employers can't act simply to fix 
numerical disparities, because otherwise that leads to 
soft quotas.

 What we need is some demonstration that 

there is at least discrimination on behalf of the

entity, and perhaps that's unintentional, perhaps it's 
not.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do we know whether 

something is discriminatory or just that it will have a 
certain effect?  Because it's in spite of.  For example, 
the Greek standard, the employer wants everybody to have 
a high school diploma, he wants an upgraded working 
staff, was told by this Court you can't do that because 
you would disproportionately exclude one race.

 MR. COLEMAN:  Congress has spoken on this 
issue, has identified job relatedness and lack -- and 
the refusal of an alternative in K itself.  We believe 
this is with the provisions we have cited, H, J and L, 
all in which Congress expressed a strong intent to favor 
tests.

 If I may reserve the balance of my time,

please the Court:

 This Court has long recognized that Title 
VII prohibits not only intentional discrimination but 
acts that are discriminatory in their operation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  With respect to both 

blacks and whites, correct?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, can you assure 
me that the government's position would be the same if 
this test -- black applicants -- firefighters scored 
highest on this test in disproportionate numbers, and 
the City said we don't like that result, we think there 
should be more whites on the fire department, and so 
we're going to throw the test out?  The government of 
United States would adopt the same position?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, and let me -- your 

question had two parts of it.  You said there are too 
many blacks or too many whites.  That is not a 
permissible objective under our view.  The employer's 
action has to be tied to a concern about a violation of 
the disparate impact of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah.
 MR. KNEEDLER:  -- under -- under Title VII.

department can engage in intentional discrimination to 
avoid concern that they will be sued under disparate 
impact.  Why doesn't it work the other way around as 
well?  Why don't they say, well, we've got to tolerate 
the disparate impact because otherwise, if we took steps 
to avoid it, we would be sued for intentional 
discrimination?  This idea that there is this great 
dilemma -- I mean, it cuts both ways.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, to -- to say that an 
employer violates the disparate treatment provision of 
Title VII when it seeks to -- when it acts for the 
purpose of complying with the disparate impact 
provisions of Title VII would be to set those two 
mutually reinforcing provisions of Title VII at war with 
one another, contrary to --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  They are at war with one 

another.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  No, I don't think so.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  How can one avoid --
MR. KNEEDLER:  One of the purposes of -- of 
the disparate impact test, as this Court has recognized, 
is -- is as a prophylactic against intentional 
discrimination, to root it out; also, as this Court said 
in Watson, to identify possible instances of subjective 
or -- excuse me, subconscious discrimination, and in

some cases, to break down barriers that have existed in 
the past, for example, possibly the 60/40 weighting 
requirement that was under longstanding collective 
bargaining agreement.

 The disparate impact test has been 

recognized since Griggs as fundamental to fulfilling the 
purposes of Title VII.

 Title VII also has another important 

objective, as this Court has repeatedly recognized, 
which is that the voluntary compliance is the preferred 
objective -- excuse me -- preferred means of achieving 
the objectives of Title VII.  Employers therefore 
require considerable flexibility in assessing their 
practices and deciding on appropriate action if it looks 
like one of their actions -- their practices would 
violate --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  If it looks like or if the 

employer just in good faith believes?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  We think -- we think --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  When I say they're at war 

with one another, I mean they become at war with one 
another when you say that all that is necessary to 
permit intentional discrimination is the employer's good 
faith belief that if he didn't intentionally 
discriminate, he'd be caught in a situation of disparate

impact.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, this --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  At that point, they're at 

war with each other.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, in -- in our view, the 

-- in -- in the situation here where the -- where the 
test has been given, and there is a list produced, we 
believe that the -- in order to avoid summary judgment 
and a disparate treatment case on a claim of intentional 
discrimination, the employer would have to show that his 
concerns were reasonable ones.  It has to be --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How does that --
MR. KNEEDLER:  -- more than simply a 

disparate --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I know you said that in 

your brief when you made a distinction between mere good 
faith and reasonable belief.  So how does one determine 
whether the concern that the employer is expressing is 
really in good faith or is reasonable?  What are the 
indicia of reasonableness?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- for example, a -- a 

gross statistical disparity.  A statistical disparity 
makes out a prima facie case under Title VII.  We're not 
saying that in all cases simply a statistical disparity 
would be sufficient.  A gross statistical disparity

could lead the -- the employer to believe that something 
was wrong with the test.  So I think -- but in addition 
if the employer has concerns about the validity of the 
test -- as you pointed out, concerns were expressed to 
the Civil Service Board in this case.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Kneedler, could you 

explain how summary judgment in favor of the defendants 
on the Title VII disparate treatment claim can possibly 
be affirmed, even if the employer had reason to believe 
that the test that was given would expose itself to 
liability under a disparate impact theory?  If that's 
not the employer's real reason for refusing to go ahead 
with the promotions, then isn't there liability under a 
disparate treatment -- under a disparate treatment 
theory, and that's a question for the jury?  So how can 
we possibly affirm summary judgment here?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, we're -- we're not 

suggesting that the Court should affirm summary 
judgment.  We're -- we're suggesting remand.  The 
District Court identified reasons other than complying 
with Title VII's disparate impact standard for the 
employer's action here, diversity and role model, 
promotion of role models which we do not see as falling 
within this framework.  But if the only evidence that 
the plaintiff has that the employer took race into

account was that the employer was aware, as obviously 
the disparate impact provisions require him to be, of 
the racially disparate impact of the test, and the 
employer acts in response to that, if that is the only 
evidence the -- the plaintiffs had, then the employer 
would be entitled to summary judgment.  We think that 
the evidence --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm sorry.
 MR. KNEEDLER:  We think that evidence of 

pretext or evidence that there is something else has to 
be external or something other than --

to that, is your position?

that.

MR. KNEEDLER:  If it's not reasonable, then 
we think that that would be evidence of -- of pretext --

not urging affirmance of the summary judgment.  You say 
there are or may be genuine issues of fact.  So what are 
they?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I think they go 

primarily to the district court's identification of 
diversity and -- and role models as possible motivations 
for what the -- what the employer was doing.  The 
plaintiffs have also alleged that the -- that there was 
influence on the Civil Service Board external to the --
to the board's own decision.  By the way, I should point 
out in this regard, at pages 166 and 167 of the Joint 
Appendix, the two board members who voted not to certify 
expressed concerns about the validity of the test based 
on what they had heard at the hearing.

 We don't think realistically a board in this 

situation should be required to do more, because it's 
important to recognize that the -- what the employer did 
here was not what concerned the Court in Wygant and 
cases like this.  The Court -- the employer did not 
adopt racial classifications with all the potential for 
adverse consequences for individuals who are labeled by 
race and promote on the basis of race.  That's not what 
the employer did here.  The employer paused and decided 
that there might be another nondiscriminatory or less 
discriminatory means.  In other words --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, counsel, you know, 
I've given law school examinations, looked at them, and 
bar examinations for years.  There's never been one, 
when I don't look at it after the fact and say, you 
know, this could be better, this -- this was not quite 
right.

 So shouldn't there be some standard that 
there has to be a significant, a strong showing after 
the test has been taken that it's deficient?  Before it 
can be set aside?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  We -- we don't think so, and 
for several reasons.  First of all, the action that the 
employer has taken in response, as I just said, is not a 
racial classification response.  It is a facially 
neutral response where the -- where the employer has 
decided the test will -- perhaps we'll look for another 
standard which would be given and applied equally to all 
applicants.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you would say that --

and I'm asking the same question the Chief Justice asked

the test --

neutral to set that test aside?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  And we -- and we --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think you'd say

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, we -- there also has to 
be some concern that the test may not be job-related and 
-- and that there may not be other alternatives.  And 
we've been talking just about the prima facie case, but 
those are important elements as to whether the test is 
job-related.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's whether it is -- it is 

neutral to set aside a test simply because one race 
predominates.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  No, but the -- but the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How you can call that 

race-neutral I -- I do not know.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  It's facially neutral.  I 
wanted to make the point that this is not the sort of 
intentional discrimination favoring one individual 
because of his race or disfavoring another.  What the 
employer has done here is -- is responded to the impact 
of the test in general terms, not on specific --

JUSTICE BREYER:  What do you think of an 

employer who does the following?  He advertises a job. 
Everyone comes in and applies.  He says May 1 is the 
deadline.  When he sees the applicants, he thinks, I'd 
prefer more diversity.  And solely because he lacks 
diversity among women, minorities, and whatever, he 
says, you know, I'm going to extend the deadline 2 
months, and I hope I'll get a few more minority or 
female applicants.

 Now, what's his reason?  He wants more 

diversity in the workforce.  Now, in your opinion, does 
the Constitution permit that extension?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I think that's a more 

difficult question, but there may -- there may be a 
situation where the employer is concerned that his 
recruitment or his job announcement has had a disparate 
impact in terms of the -- of the applications that he 
has gotten.  In -- in that situation, the employees who 
have responded and may be advantaged, like the people 
promoted here may actually be taking advantage of a test 
that imposes barriers and disadvantages other people.

 So when -- when we consider the impact in a 

situation like this on somebody who has passed the 
promotion test, it's important to consider that the 
people who have passed it may have benefited from a test

that is discriminatory.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, this may be 

the same question Justice Breyer asked, but I'd like 
something closer to a yes or no answer.  Does the 
government consider promotion of diversity by itself a 
compelling state interest in the employment context as 
opposed to the school context?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  We think -- we think it 

probably is a compelling state interest, but it is not 
one that -- that can be advanced by race -- by racial 
classifications.  And that -- and that is our basic 
submission here.  This was not a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can it be --
MR. KNEEDLER:  This was not a --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can it be advanced 

by taking actions to avoid what is perceived as a 
disparate impact?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In other words, the 

disparate impact is regarded as something you can 
intentionally respond to by drawing racial distinctions 
solely because you would like a more diverse workforce?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  No, not drawing racial 

distinctions.  That's our -- this -- the employer's 
response here did not draw racial distinctions.  It did

not say so many black firefighters would be promoted --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It didn't care --
MR. KNEEDLER:  -- and so many white --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It didn't care -- it 
had to draw racial distinctions because it looked at the 
test and said, we think there's a problem because of the 
racial makeup of who's going to get the promotions.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  The employer was responding 

to the discriminatory test or what -- what it was 
reasonably concerned was a discriminatory test --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it looked at the --
MR. KNEEDLER:  -- not the individual --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Counsel, it looked at the 

results, and it classified the successful and 
unsuccessful applicants by race.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  It -- it --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And then -- and you want 

us to say this isn't race?  I have -- I have trouble 
with this argument.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  No, with respect, it did not 
classify according to race; it looked in general terms. 
It did not have the names of individual people.  It 
looked in general terms at what the racial disparity of 
the test was.  It just --

names; it just looked at the label of what their race 
was.  That's all they were concerned about.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Title VII's disparate impact 
test requires -- requires an employer to be aware of and 
respond --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's inconsistent 

with your answer to the Chief Justice who was exploring 
whether or not what we have here is a -- is a racial 
criteria, pure and simple, and you say, well, it's 
general.  And then we point out that each applicant 
didn't have his name, but they had his or her race.
 MR. KNEEDLER:  But the employer -- the 

employer was not making a decision to go forward and 
appoint individuals or promote individuals because of 
their race.  The employer stopped there and said we're 
going to start over.  That new test would be given 
equally to all employees, not any one particular 
employee.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Kneedler, can I ask 
you this?  You -- you've recommended that we set aside 
the summary judgment and send the case back for a 
hearing.

MR. KNEEDLER:  As I've mentioned to Justice 

Ginsburg, I think it would go -- there are several 
things.  One, it would go to the justifications that 
were advanced by, that identified by the district court 
here that do not fit into this framework, do not fit 
into complying with the Title VII disparate impact test, 
and those are promotion of diversity and -- and role 
models.

 That is -- that is one.  Also the district 
court did not apply what we believe is the right test, 
whether the employer had a reasonable basis for 
believing that what it was doing was necessary or a 
reasonable basis to believe it might be violating the 
disparate impact test.  If it did not have a reasonable 
basis then we believe there would be a triable issue for 
the jury.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When -- when I asked that 

you question, you said that one issue of fact was 
whether the board was acting in response to improper 
influence, to racial politics.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  That -- the district 
court rejected that argument and whether or not that 
should be revisited on remand is -- is another matter.

issue of fact?  How can you possibly get around that?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, one side says what 

you say is just pretext; the real reason was just 
politics.  Isn't that an issue of fact that has to be 
tried?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, under this -- under 

this Court's decisions dealing -- dealing with summary 
judgment, even on questions of intent, the -- the 
plaintiff ordinarily has to come up with some 
affirmative evidence that there was -- that there was in 
this case an impermissible racial motive to do that. 
And the -- the district court looked at what the civil 
service commissioners said and concluded that -- that 
they did not have an impermissible racial motive, that 
they were responding to concerns about the validity of 
-- of the test.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But does the government 

think that you can just -- in a case like this you can 
just look at what -- what is said by the ultimate 
decision-maker and ignore the input from other people 
who may have influenced the process?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  No, no, we do not.  There may 

be other people who had input into the process, and 
whether the -- the district court evaluated that and

concluded that the -- that the input, that there was not 
a triable issue for summary judgment -- to avoid summary 
judgment on that question.  That would be open to the 
district court to reconsider on remand.  We don't deny 
that -- that it could go beyond that, but our principal 
concern here is the analytical framework that an 
employer who seeks to comply with the disparate impact 
requirements of Title VII which have been longstanding 
should not be teamed to have engaged in the sort of 
intentional discrimination that either the Equal 
Protection Clause or Title VII prohibits.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Mr. Meade.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. MEADE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and maybe it 

please the Court:

 Employers, both private and public, are 
required to comply with Title VII's disparate impact 
provisions, which seek to root out barriers to equal 
opportunity.  When an employer learns that a practice 
has a severe adverse impact such that it creates an 
inference of discrimination, and evidence further 
supports that inference, the employer should be granted 
some limited degree of flexibility to act.  An employer

certainly should not be encouraged or forced to make a 
promotion on the basis of the questionable practice.

 Title VII's disparate impact provisions are 

designed to remove structural barriers to 
discrimination, and when an employment practice has an 
adverse impact such that it substantiates an inference 
of discrimination, an employer should look beyond that 
adverse impact.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If all the employer --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can I ask you --
JUSTICE ALITO:  If all the employer has is 
evidence that the test results violate the four-fifths 
rule, is that sufficient?

 MR. MEADE:  In our view it is not 

sufficient, and that is not what was at issue here. 
First of all, there was a severe adverse impact, much 
lower than the four-fifths rule, much lower than what 
this Court found in Connecticut v Teal, and in addition, 
not just on the pass/fail ratio --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if I could modify the 

question.  Is there some statistical point at which 
that's sufficient, if it's not four-fifths, if it's 
nine-tenths --

MR. MEADE:  Our view --

sufficient?

 MR. MEADE:  Our view is that it might be 

conceivable under Title VII in some cases for the 
statistical disparity to be so severe such that it would 
give an employer a reasonable basis under Title VII. 
However, that's not what we argue here.

 We argue here that an employer should be 
able to act when it has a severe adverse impact which 
creates an inference of discrimination, coupled with 
evidence that creates doubts about the flaws in the test 
or the possibility of alternatives.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can I ask you to 

touch on the distinction between racial discrimination 
and race-conscious action?  The actions that were taken 
in many of our cases, in Croson and Adarand, Parents 
Involved, Wygant, were obviously race-conscious actions; 
there was a reason that the governments in those cases 
were taking the action.  It was because of what they saw 
as the impact on race.  Yet we concluded that was racial 
discrimination.  So what's the -- how do you draw the 
line between race-conscious that's permitted and racial 
discrimination that's not?

 MR. MEADE:  Well, two answers, Mr. Chief 

Justice.  First of all, this race consciousness is race 
consciousness that's mandated by Federal law.  This is

not a discretionary decision by an employer.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but if we --
if we agree with your -- I mean, you're assuming, it 
seems to me in your argument, that the actions that 
they've taken here are not intentional racial 
discrimination; and of course if they're not, then you 
don't have much to worry about.  But let's assume that 
they are, as we found they were in Croson and Wygant and 
Adarand and Parents Involved.

 MR. MEADE:  Well, the difference in those 

cases that you talk about, Croson, Adarand, Parents 
Involved, they involve express racial quotas -- excuse 
me, express racial classifications, where the government 
is making a decision based on a particular individual on 
the basis of race.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And the only reason 

you say that isn't by an individual is that you have 
blacked out the names?

 MR. MEADE:  No, because it's a facially 
neutral action which applies to all test takers the 
same.  That doesn't mean --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So your position is 

what?  They threw out the test, so you would have no 
problem at all if they looked at those results and they 
were predominantly black rather than white; you would

say the city can throw out the test and there's no 
racial discrimination there at all?

 MR. MEADE:  No, I would say that there's no 
classification.  However, there's another way to trigger 
strict scrutiny and that comes under cases like 
Arlington Heights and Feeney, and the action that the --
the facially neutral action that the city took here 
falls under that line of cases.  And then --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't see how you can 
call it facially neutral.  It's neutral because you 
throw it out for the losers as well as for the winners? 
That's neutrality?

 MR. MEADE:  There is no classification, 

because each individual, and -- when a particular 
individual is looked at and a decision is made on the 
basis of race, that is a racial classification.  If --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So this case would 
come out differently, if the list was there with then 
names and they go down and instead of saying throw out 
the test, they said Jones, you don't get the promotion 
because you're white; Johnson, you don't get it because 
you're white.  And they go down the list and throw out 
everybody who took the test; then that would be all 
right?

tests are being thrown out and different decisions are 
not being made on the basis of different individuals on 
the basis of race, then --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So they can keep --
they get do-overs until it comes out right?  Or throw 
out this test; they do another test; oh, it's just as 
bad, throw that one out; get another one that's a little 
better, but not so -- throw that one out?

 MR. MEADE:  Well, two responses.  The first 
response is a legal one, the second one is a practical 
one.  As to the legal answer, if a city were to do that 
or an employer were to do that again and again, first of 
all, that would go to intent, whether the intent of the 
employer were actually to comply with Title VII or for 
some other intent.

 Second of all, it would speak to whether 
there are actually equally valid less discriminatory 
alternatives.  Second, the practical --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well if -- how many 

times before it's a problem?

 MR. MEADE:  Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You say if they did 
it over and over again.  What if they did it twice here?
 MR. MEADE:  Well, that would be a question 

about whether they had a reasonable basis to do it.  And

I would say if they did it a second time, that could 
create an inference of discrimination.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What -- what has New 

Haven done in fact?  This certification was requested in 
March of 2004; we're now 2009.  What has New Haven done 
in order to get lieutenants and captains in the fire 
department?

 MR. MEADE:  Justice Ginsburg, this is 

information outside the record, of course.  The -- the 
city has held tests for other positions, both written 
and oral, in assessment centers that have not had a 
severe disparate impact -- actually, that have not had 
an adverse impact at all under the four-fifths rule.
 And specifically for the lieutenants and 
captains, what the city has been forced to do is have 
temporary acting promotions on a rotating basis based on 
seniority.  But the city has not gone forward with any 
promotions yet, and, in fact, the Petitioners in this 
case may in the end receive some or all of the 
promotions.  But the city has a duty to make sure that 
its process is fair for all applicants, both black and 
white.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I have purposely gone, of 

course, to the concurring opinion because I believe it's 
the controlling opinion in Parents Involved, and there

are two examples in that opinion.  One is strategic site 
selection of new schools, i.e., a planned building, and 
the second is drawing attendance zones with a general 
recognition of the demographics.  Those are given as 
examples of instances where there is race consciousness, 
but it does not trigger strict scrutiny.

 Now, why is your case like that rather than 

being like those examples where an employer or a 
government official picks particular people or uses 
quotas in order to get a certain quota or pay attention 
to race in an individual selection, both based on race, 
which clearly does require strict scrutiny?  And if 
there is a difference, even then why is yours justified?

 MR. MEADE:  Justice Breyer, there are two 

ways to enter strict scrutiny.  One is a racial 
classification which makes different decisions based on 
different individuals on the basis of race.  Cases like 
Croson or Wygant or even affirmative action plans are 
examples of making different distinctions based on 
different individuals on the basis of race.

 There is another line of cases about --
where there's a discriminatory purpose plus adverse 
impact on a certain group under the Arlington Heights 
line of cases.

 Here the Petitioners argue that there is an

adverse impact on them.  Of course, that depends on the 
assumption that there was, in fact, a valid test.  But 
here, then, under that line of cases the question is: 
What is the discriminatory purpose?  And this Court's 
cases are not clear about what a discriminatory purpose 
is under the Arlington Heights line of cases.  However, 
the answer to your question is:  Compliance with a 
Federal statute, even a race conscious Federal statute, 
cannot be deemed a discriminatory purpose under the 
Arlington -- Arlington Heights inquiry.  It is very 
different.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that -- I am 
sorry.  Is that correct if we -- we conclude strict 
scrutiny does apply under the Constitution?  Compliance 
with a statute, looking at impact, is a compelling 
interest trumping strict scrutiny under the Equal 
Protection Clause?

 MR. MEADE:  No, Your Honor.  If strict 
scrutiny applies, then the question is:  Is there a 
compelling interest?  And complying -- complying with a 
Federal statute needs to be a compelling interest under 
the Equal Protection Clause.  The reason is, otherwise, 
State and local governments would be in an impossible 
position of trying to determine whether they should --

to how you construe the statute.  It seems to me an odd 
argument to say that you can violate the Constitution 
because you have to comply with the statute.

 MR. MEADE:  Well -- well, I would disagree. 
That would only be true if there were some doubt as to 
the constitutionality of the disparate impact 
provisions.  But here that -- this Court first 
articulated "disparate impact."  Congress has reaffirmed 
that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well -- well, but you are 

loading the -- the equation.  The Chief Justice's 
question I don't think has been -- been fully answered. 
You are -- you are saying that you can eliminate 
constitutional concerns because the statute is enacted, 
which just repeats those same constitutional concerns. 
It's -- it's like having two tracks on the audio that 
don't quite fit.

 MR. MEADE:  Well, I -- I may have 

misunderstood the question, but compliance with Federal 
statutes have to be a compelling interest as long as 
that -- that statute is constitutional.  Now --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course you're not saying 

that -- that the test is -- is compliance.  You're --
you're saying the belief that it's necessary for 
compliance is a compelling State interest.

MR. MEADE:  Or --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean everybody would 

probably concede that if -- if continuing would clearly 
be in violation, of course, it's a compelling interest. 
But the issue here is:  Is it enough if the employer 
simply worries that if he doesn't make the change, he 
may be in violation?

 MR. MEADE:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what's the line 

there?

 MR. MEADE:  Well, the line is set out by 

this Court's cases.  So assuming strict scrutiny applies 
and assuming that compliance with Title VII is a 
compelling interest, then the question is whether an 
employer has a sufficient basis.  And this Court's 
cases, both in the intentional and unintentional 
context, say that that's a strong basis in evidence, and 
so that would be the relevant test.  This Court has 
applied --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You acknowledge strong 

basis in evidence is -- is what -- what the city has to 
have?

 MR. MEADE:  Assuming that strict scrutiny 

applies --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.

MR. MEADE:  -- then, yes, then the city 

needs to have a strong basis.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can I get back just 

-- just -- since I don't understand it yet, the 
distinction between intentional racial discrimination 
and race conscious action.  I thought both the plurality 
and the concurrence in Parents Involved accepted the 
fact that race conscious action such as school siting or 
drawing district lines is -- is okay, but discriminating 
in particular assignments is not.

 Now, why is this not intentional 

discrimination?  I understood you to say it was because 
you don't have particular individuals being treated on 
the basis of their race.  You are going to have to 
explain that to me again, because there are particular 
individuals here.  They are the plaintiffs, and they say 
they didn't get their jobs because of intentional racial 
action by the -- the city.  Why is that not on the 
racial -- intentionally racial discrimination side 
rather than the permissible race consciousness side?

 MR. MEADE:  Well, again, this is a question 
about what triggers strict scrutiny, and compliance with 
the Title -- compliance with the Federal statute should 
not be deemed a -- a discriminatory purpose.  However, 
if strict scrutiny applies, then this Court's

traditional strict scrutiny analysis is a way to test 
the decision.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that -- you 

may be right that that's what the question is about.  I 
still don't have in my mind from you a line about how we 
decide.  Because there are many cases, Croson, Adarand, 
Wygant, Parents Involved, where we said action taken 
obviously because of race is nonetheless discrimination. 
So -- and then there are cases where we have recognized 
that race conscious action is permissible.  Again, what 
-- when I look at something like this, how I do decide 
which side of the line that's on -- this is on?

 MR. MEADE:  Well, again, all of those other 

cases involved discretionary actions by State actors, 
and those are -- were making decisions, trying to 
comply, trying to further various goals, and in those 
cases making a very express use of race that a 
particular individual -- when that person was looked at, 
whether in Croson, whether in Wygant, whether in Parents 
Involved, a particular decision was made as to that 
individual.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But just to take 

Parents Involved, it wasn't a necessary -- the driving 
factor was not a specific decision with respect to 
specific individuals.  They didn't care whether it was

Jones or Smith that they were citing.  All they cared 
about was the race.  And it seems the -- the same here. 
You maybe don't care whether it's Jones or Smith who is 
not getting the promotion.  All you care about is who is 
getting the promotion.  All you care about is his race.

 MR. MEADE:  Well, the -- the difference 

there is that in that case, Jones and Smith, different 
decisions were being made on the basis of race such that 
there was a labeling on the basis of race.  And here 
there is no such labeling because here there is a 
question about whether this process is in fact picking 
the most qualified individuals for the job.  And that's 
what Title VII is designed to do.

 It is, yes, certainly a race conscious 

decision, a race conscious statute.  But what Title VII 
is trying to do is to make sure that we don't perpetuate 
discrimination, albeit unintentional, and, therefore, to 
take away barriers that have existed over time and that 
continue to exist.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When you say "take away 

barriers," one thing is not a hundred percent clear. 
Your position is we have to do this in order to avoid 
Title VII disparate impact liability.  Are you not 
reciting as a justification either the diversity in 
police -- policing firefighting or still overcoming a

legacy of the past where fire departments were among the 
most notorious excluders on the basis of race?  You are 
not -- you are not saying rectification of past 
discrimination?  You are not saying diversity?

 MR. MEADE:  We're not saying that.  We did 

not say that below.  And, in fact, the board members who 
voted against certification cited flaws with the test 
and flaws with the process, and that was the basis for 
their failure to certify.

 And the problem with a discriminatory test 
is that it does not set a level playing field.  It may 
create an illusion of meritocracy, but the problem is it 
not only disfavors certain individuals, but on the flip 
side, it also necessarily advantages others --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You just referred --
MR. MEADE:  -- and therefore --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  You just 
referred to a discriminatory test.  What you said in the 
district court, and I quote, the issue is not whether 
the tests were valid.

 Are you just changing positions on that?
 MR. MEADE:  No, not at all.  The ultimate 

validity of the test, our position below, was not 
relevant; the question is what was before the board. 
And the board heard 5 days of testimony over 2 months.

And as I mentioned, the two individuals who voted 
against certification cited concerns with the test and 
concerns with the process, and that was the basis for 
their decision.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you mean by --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'd like to talk just 

briefly --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kennedy.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I would like to talk just 

briefly about this point that the -- some of our 
hypotheticals where the test hadn't been given yet. 
Here the test has been given.  And I had some concerns 
along the line of Justice Ginsburg's question.  She 
said, well, it's not a vested interest.

 On the other hand, 2000e-(l)(2) says that 

test results can't be altered.  There's a statutory 
interpretation question of whether that means they can't 
be used altogether.  Two points about the statute.

 Number one, doesn't that diminish at least 

the force of the argument that this is a vested 
interest?  It means the tests are -- have a -- have a 
certain presumption in -- in their favor.

 Secondly, on -- and maybe this is a question 

for the -- for the Petitioners rather than you.  If we 
-- let's assume that we relied on that statute and said

that there's a Title VII violation here because the 
statute was violated.  I know you have an 
interpretational argument there.  Would that give the 
Petitioners all the relief they need here, or is there 
still additional relief under their 1983 cause of 
action?

 MR. MEADE:  To answer your first question, 

the question of statutory interpretation, I would 
disagree with the suggestion that that gives support to 
the Petitioners' side, and for the following reason: 
Congress made a careful judgment about what can and 
can't be done once tests have been administered, and it 
told employers it -- it can't alter the scores when 
those scores are being used.  And in -- what that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It can't alter the 

results.  But let's not get into the statutory 
interpretation --

MR. MEADE:  But the -- but the point is that 

that ties the hands of employers so that the employer, 
in fact, is limited in what it can do.  Just because a 
test has been administered doesn't mean that Title VII's 
disparate impact provisions suddenly disappear.  And as 
a number of lower courts have stated, there's no 
entitlement to be promoted on the basis of a flawed or 
discriminatory test.

The problem is, the alternative is to force 
employers to go forward and to use a discriminatory or a 
potentially discriminatory test.  That has two problems.

 First, it's inconsistent with the goal of 
merit-based selection; and second of all, if it turns 
out that there is, in fact, discrimination, a court then 
needs to undo that discrimination.  A court will often 
need to use racial quotas or set-asides to try to undo 
or to remedy the discrimination that has happened.

 So it's much better for an employer to stop, 

to not go forward with discrimination, even after the 
test has been used, rather than to rush forward and to 
create potentially further discrimination and a more 
aggressive use of race down the road.

 Another problem with creating a high 

standard is it will discourage employers from removing 
barriers to equal opportunity.  For example, with 
respect to an ongoing practice, if an employer learns 
that that practice has a disparate impact, but is not 
sure one way or another, and gets rid of that provision, 
under Petitioners' theory that employer will necessarily 
be liable to either blacks or whites.  The only way that 
it can defend against a lawsuit by whites would be to 
argue that it was, in fact, violating the disparate 
impact rights of black Americans.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What type of -- what 

type of other things are you talking about there?

 MR. MEADE:  I mean, it could -- could be, 

for example, if there were a five-part training program 
that the City or an employer set up, and individuals may 
have completed some portion of the training program such 
that there would be similar reliance interests like 
the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the question, 
I guess, would be whether the program was valid or not 
under the traditional approaches you take under Title 
VII.

 MR. MEADE:  Exactly.  But then the question 

is whether you're forced --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So does your 

position here depend on a conclusion that this test is 
invalid?

 MR. MEADE:  No, it doesn't.  The question is 
whether the employer had a sufficient basis at the time 
of its action to make a determination that the test 
should not be used.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And why didn't it have a 

sufficient basis here?  It -- it chose the company that 
framed the test, and then as soon as it saw the results, 
it decided it wasn't going to go forward with the

promotions.  The company offered to validate the test. 
The City refused to pay for that, even though that was 
part of its contract with the company.  And all it has 
is this testimony by a competitor, Mr. Hornick, who 
said -- who hadn't seen the test, and he said, I could 
do a better test -- you should make the promotions based 
on this, but I could give you -- I could draw up a 
better test, and by the way, here's my business card if 
you want to hire me in the future.

 How's that a strong basis in the evidence?
 MR. MEADE:  Well, first of all, the City did 
not act on the basis of numbers alone.  It had 5 days of 
hearings where it heard from stakeholders on all sides. 
And it heard numerous flaws in the test at those 
hearings.

 For example, there were arbitrary weightings 
of the scores which had no scientific basis; the company 
skipped critical design steps in the process; and 
although this was not before the board, it later turned 
out that there was no calibration in either the cut-off 
score or how the test was ultimately going to be used. 
Previous tests had a much less severe adverse impact. 
This test was an outlier.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What difference does the 

cut-off score make?

MR. MEADE:  The difference of a cut-off 

score is a determination, a scientifically based 
determination to determine who is qualified and who is 
not qualified for --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I understand that, but 
the people at the top would -- the problem here was not 
the composition of the people who scored above the 
cut-off, was it?  It was the composition of the -- of 
the people who would be eligible for promotion under the 
"rule of three"?

 MR. MEADE:  Well, two responses, Justice 
Alito.  First of all, as to the pass-fail rate, that 
could create a separate disparate impact violation under 
Federal law.  So that was relevant for separate 
purposes.

 But in addition, it's also true that the 
test was not calibrated for use for rank ordering, to 
ensure that a 93 was better than a 91.  And this was a 
special problem because of an intervening decision by a 
court that was -- that was rendered after the tests were 
designed, after the tests were taken, after the tests 
were scored.

 There was -- there's no evidence that the 

tests were precise enough to be able to determine who --
who should rank higher versus lower based on those

scores.  And the amicus brief of the human resources --
human resources professionals points out this point.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So your response to 
me that you don't have to show that the test is invalid, 
your argument is you just have to show that there's a 
basis for being worried that it might be invalid.  And 
then it seems to me the only distinction is how high a 
showing you require.  And you reject the idea that you 
have to show a strong basis in the evidence?

 MR. MEADE:  Yes and no --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought you just said 

that.  I just thought you just -- I was -- almost wrote 
it down.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I think your phrase was --

I guess I should say I understand from your brief if not 
from your argument that --

MR. MEADE:  No, no.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You agree with the 

strong basis in fact standard?

 MR. MEADE:  To answer in a way that's 

consistent to -- to both of you, the answer is if the 
test is under Title VII, strong basis should not be the

standard.  This Court has never indicated that it should 
be.  And that would be much too high of a standard to 
place on private employers.

 However, if this Court concludes that strict 

scrutiny applies, which we think it should not, but if 
this Court concludes that strict scrutiny does apply, 
then, yes, we agree --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So I guess, my -- so 

my -- your position is that you should never have a 
strong basis in fact standard, because you don't think 
strict scrutiny should apply, and you think if it's 
under Title VII, it's only reasonableness?

 MR. MEADE:  That's correct.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So your position is 
that the city -- the -- the government can take action 
without -- only if it's reasonable.  It's a reasonable 
view of whether or not they might or might not be 
liable.  That's the standard.  And then they can engage 
in race-based action?

 MR. MEADE:  We agree with the government's 

articulation of the standard of reasonable basis. 
Again, I would --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But does it have to be 

reasonable basis to believe they would be liable if they 
went ahead?  Or can reasonableness refer to something

other than the probability of or the -- the likelihood 
of liability?

 MR. MEADE:  I agree that it could be 

something less than that.  And if --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what is 
something less than that, that they might be sued?

 MR. MEADE:  No, not that they might -- might 
be sued.  Again, this is, just in the Title VII context, 
so this will affect all private employers, some of which 
will be small employers where a single human resource 
professional will be trying to make the determination. 
There won't be hearings as there were in this case.  And 
the question is sometimes a severe prima facie case 
could be sufficient under Title VII, not under the 
strong basis standard, but potentially under Title VII. 
And if a human resource professional or if an employer 
had a belief that further investigation could yield 
evidence of a Title VII violation, that would be 
sufficient under the reasonable basis standard.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Isn't that -- isn't 
that kind of a blank check to discriminate, if all they 
need is a reasonable basis to think that further 
investigation might be useful?

 MR. MEADE:  No, it's not because this is a

way to reconcile, under Title VII, the two provisions of 
this statute.  However, in this case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I'm sorry --

that's an answer about why it would be okay.  I'm just 
saying, isn't it in fact a blank check?

 MR. MEADE:  Well, I would disagree.  No, it 

is not a blank check.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But --
MR. MEADE:  Here, however, we had much more. 
There was a strong basis in evidence here.  This Court, 
under the strong basis standard, has suggested that a 
strong basis is met when the threshold conditions for 
liability are met.  That's what this Court said in Bush 
v. Vera, a plurality in Bush v. Vera, as well as Abrams 
v. Johnson.

 The question is how to apply that standard 
to this case.  That standard would suggest that a prima 
facie case, which, again, is not just adverse impact 
alone, but it's adverse impact that creates an inference 
of discrimination could be enough.  Here we have not 
just that, not just --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Meade, let me -- let 
me go back to one earlier question.  Suppose everybody 
agrees that you're right on the -- on the record here 
now, and the City goes ahead and does another test, with

all the advantages and studies they've made and so forth 
and so on, and it turns out you just had an unfortunate 
selection of candidates, and they come out exactly the 
same way.  Would you agree that at that time the City 
would have to certify the results?

was valid --

after talking to everybody who testified in this case 
and filed amicus briefs and everything else --

whether there is in fact a fair process.  It's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, just to get 
back to your answer to Justice Stevens, you say they'd 
have to certify it.  You say that, in that situation, 
the decisionmaker could not have a reasonable basis for 
thinking further investigation is required.  Why?  Just 
because the second test came out the same way?  It's not 
at all reasonable to think they ought to look at it 
further?

 MR. MEADE:  Well, not on the basis of -- of 

the investigation that Justice Stevens, I understood, 
hypothesized, as part of the example.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And that would be so, even 

if another Mr. Hornick showed up and said, I could --

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. COLEMAN:  There's another statute that 
the Court ought to consider in the Title VII context, 
and that's section 2000e-7, which says that Title VII 
will not overrule and pre-empt State law unless there is 
a violation of Title VII.

 In asserting that, under any reasonable 

basis, as long as they have a reasonable basis, they can 
dispense with all the provisions of Connecticut civil 
service law, all these provisions that were put in place 
to get rid of cronyism, to get rid of discrimination can 
be set aside based on nothing more than a numerical 
disparity or perhaps a concern about the test we think 
cuts against Congress's intent in Title VII in 
respecting these State and local laws that are intended

-- a university decides that tenure requirements lead to 
fewer women professors, so they say as an experiment 
what we would like to do is not have them for a couple

unconstitutional?  Because, after all, it will certainly 
mean that certain majority race assistant professors

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Oh, oh.
 MR. COLEMAN:  You're just saying we want to 

change the tenure process.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But what we are doing is 
not giving the promotions to the assistant professors 
who otherwise would have job security.

 MR. COLEMAN:  The analogy to your analogy is 

that if we have a series of people who go through the 
tenure process that exists and it turns out, you know, 
we -- we don't like the results, and --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, so.
 MR. COLEMAN:  -- therefore we want to change 

it.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It's the result -- it's 
that you identify the person that makes your -- so in 
Texas, for example, they take the top 10 percent of all 
the high school graduates and put them in the 
university.  Now, suppose they just decided, you know 
what we want to do?  The top 5 percent.  We want to see 
how that works.  And, of course, then there are people 
who in fact would have gotten into the university -- and 
perhaps we can imagine a majority of the majority race 
-- and now they don't.  Can Texas do that?

 MR. COLEMAN:  Well, you've chosen a very 

controversial subject.

JUSTICE BREYER:  I know that, but I -- I --
(Laughter.)
 JUSTICE BREYER:  That was not my objective.
 MR. COLEMAN:  If --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I want to test out just 

what it is about this case.

 MR. COLEMAN:  If -- if that is not done on 
the -- on the basis of race, then, no.  The institution 
of the 10 percent rule itself, most people believe --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you said no.  Can 

Texas do that or not?

 MR. COLEMAN:  Likely, yes.  The answer is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
 MR. COLEMAN:  -- it can do it.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  And the difference 

here precisely is what?

 MR. COLEMAN:  Is that, under State law, 

these individuals had gone through an existing process 
and had -- under State law, had been determined to be 
the most qualified candidates and, barring anything 
else, would have been promoted.  So the classification 
that is made clearly does distinguish between those who 
are qualified for promotion and those who are not 
qualified for promotion and would not receive.

 It violates that -- that singular principle

of individual dignity to have these individuals be told, 
on the basis of race, you're not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if it were shown 
that, in fact, this test was not job-related and, in 
fact, the majority of fire departments scotched this 
test years ago and substituted what most agree is a 
better test, even so you would say it would violate the 
rights of the plaintiffs you represent, even --

MR. COLEMAN:  If --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even if there's strong 
evidence that it's not job-related and that there's a 
better test that doesn't produce these skewed results?

 MR. COLEMAN:  I don't think that's what 
we've said, Justice Ginsburg.  Under our alternative 
formulation in which the Court recognizes --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what -- what would 
that do to the civil service merit system that says if 
you pass the test you should be certified?

 MR. COLEMAN:  The difference is this, 

Justice Ginsburg:  The example you have given would 
clearly satisfy or likely satisfy a strong basis in 
evidence that you are actually in violation of the 
disparate impact provision of Title VII.  There are 
three prongs.  The first is adverse impact; the second 
is that your test is not related; and the third is the

existence of this alternative that is equally valid and 
that results in lower disparate impact.

 The City has never asserted -- and I hear it 
today continue to say, we don't have to show those other 
two prongs, that a numerical disparity enough may allow 
the City to conclude that there must be something wrong 
with the test.  This kind of res ipsa loquitur theory of 
disparate impact is one that the courts have not 
recognized and that Watson said we cannot allow because 
it results in racial balancing and soft quotas based on 
disparate impact --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But in your -- in my 

example, to go back, the thing you've identified, it 
seems to me, is Texas couldn't do this.  It couldn't 
look at the class that they're going to choose with the 
10 percent and say, you know, there are not enough 
minorities, I think we'll go to 15 percent this year.
 MR. COLEMAN:  That I agree with, Justice 

Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It could not.  And 

moreover, in the case of the tenure, what the school 
couldn't do is it couldn't say, looking over at the 
present tenured faculty and those who were just ready 
for promotion and who in all probability will be, we're 
going to go to the non-tenure system this year.  We're

going to go to the non-tenure system this year.

 MR. COLEMAN:  I also agree with that.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  That they couldn't do that. 

And again you that say the ordinary employer across 
America who announces a deadline for getting in 
applications cannot, once it sees those applications, 
say, you know, there are not enough minorities.  I want 
to extend the deadline.

 MR. COLEMAN:  That's also correct, Justice 

Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  And therefore 

this is a very far-reaching decision.

 MR. COLEMAN:  No, not necessarily, Your 

Honor.  Okay, what --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  You are -- you are saying, 
as I understand it, that if the -- if the city in a case 
like this, prior to giving a test, looked at the test 
and says, wait a minute, this is going to produce really 
disparate results, they can stop, regroup, and think it 
through again and maybe come up with a different test.

 MR. COLEMAN:  If --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  But if they don't realize 
that and they go ahead with the test, and they then see 
the -- the disparate results, it's too late.  And it 
seems to me that the trouble with drawing that

distinction is that the city is not in the testing 
business.  They are unlikely to know what the results 
are going to be.  So you're saying that the city that is 
-- that is prescient can adjust, the city that doesn't 
find out there's something wrong or at least undesirable 
from their standpoint until after the test results 
cannot readjust?

 MR. COLEMAN:  I don't think that's our 

position, Justice Souter.  The first case I think is the 
hypothetical Justice Kennedy posed to me.  The second 
case, as we've been talking about, is that you identify 
the disparate impact after the test has been given. 
Under this alternative theory that would allow a -- an 
employer to respond, all we are asking under the strong 
basis in evidence test is that you not react out of a 
concern, or out of this mere reaction to the numbers, 
but that you then look, is the test valid?  Do you have 
convincing evidence, in the words of Wygant, to form a 
strong basis in evidence that if you did go forward --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But if they see it coming, 
they don't have to show a strong basis in evidence for 
changing the test prior to the time they give it?

 MR. COLEMAN:  Consistent with what -- my 

conversation with Justice Breyer, if they see it coming 
and do it ahead of time, it doesn't violate that
