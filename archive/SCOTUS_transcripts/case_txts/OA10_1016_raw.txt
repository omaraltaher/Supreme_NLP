 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. FOREMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

of Appeals of Maryland. 
 Mr. Foreman. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. FOREMAN 

1
2
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 
3
4  first this morning in Case 10-1016, Coleman v. The Court 
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
 The propriety of any section 5 legislation 
12  is judged by in reference to the historical perspective 
13  that it reflects, and that historical perspective is 
14  very clear in -- and it's set very clearly by Congress 
15
16  history of State-sponsored gender discrimination.  And 
17  those -- that discrimination embodies gender-based 
18  stereotypes that took a very firm hold in the employment 
19  area, where women had difficulty obtaining employment 
and holding employment.  And this Court in a litany of 
20
21  cases recognized these gender-based stereotypes as -- as 
22  an improper assumption about women's abilities. 
23
24  issue that women's mission were to be women -- to be 
25

wives and mothers; Stanton v. Stanton, that women were 

and by this Court.  It -- it is an unfortunate, long 

and may it please the Court: 

 In Frontiero v. Richardson, it rejected this 

3
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Foreman, I guess 

 MR. FOREMAN:  And it was directly attempting 

and the history of gender discrimination, whether 

1  to be the homemaker and men the breadwinner, and --
2
3  the question in this case is what this particular 
4  statutory provision has to do with gender discrimination 
5
6  Congress was aiming to eradicate gender discrimination 
7  through this provision or whether it was trying to do 
8  something else entirely. 
9
to address these gender-based stereotypes in a couple 
10
11  different ways as a practical matter.  At that time, 
12  when an employer saw a woman, they didn't necessarily 
13  just see a worker.  They saw a person that could become 
14  pregnant, and worked on these gender-based stereotypes, 
that that woman would either become pregnant, would be 
15
16  disabled because of pregnancy-related disabilities but, 
17  in any event, was a least -- least attractive employee. 
18
19  addresses that specifically in its purposes section.  It 
specifically says that is intended to promote the equal 
20
21  opportunity for women and men pursuant to the Equal 
22  Protection Clause. 
23
24  provision, Congress made it very clear what they were 
25

 And the Family and Medical Leave Act 

 But more specific to the self-care 

attempting to do.  If you move to the "findings" 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where -- where are 

 MR. FOREMAN:  I am reading from Appendix A 

to the brief, and it is -- that employment standards 

 That's the negative inference argument that 

1  section, first, in finding number 6, they address --
2
3  you reading from, counsel? 
4
5
6  that apply to one gender only have a serious potential 
7  for encouraging employers to discriminate against 
8  employees and applicants of employment who are of that 
9  gender.
10
11  we make in our brief.  But even more to the point, if 
12  you move to the purpose sections at appendix 2, 
13  page appendix 2, it specifically is intended to minimize 
14  the potential for employment discrimination on the basis 
of sex by ensuring generally that leave is available for 
15
16  eligible medical reasons, including maternity-related 
17  disabilities and for compelling family reasons, and to 
18  ensure equal protection under the law. 
19
20
21  seeing how providing 12 weeks of leave for self-care for 
22  both men and women affects the incentive of an employer 
23  who we will assume has an inclination to discriminate 
24  against women based on the possibility that a woman 
25

Justice Kagan's question, I have -- I have difficulty 

applicant for employment may become pregnant.  I just 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, following up on 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. FOREMAN:  The rationale of Congress at 

right? 

 Okay.  So, we're just dealing with (D), 

several different ways.  They -- and they passed (A), 

1  don't see how that would affect the incentives of -- of 
2  an employer in that situation. 
3
4  that point was that they could have addressed this issue 
5
6  (B), and (C) -- the birth of the child, the adoption of 
7  the child, and the Family and Medical Leave Act --
8  against -- again, addressing gender-based stereotypes. 
9
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, (A) is not at issue, 
10
11
12  which concerns a serious health condition.  So, you have 
13  an employer who is willing to discriminate on the basis 
14  of gender.  The employer has two applicants for 
15
16  well, if I hire the man, he might take 12 weeks of leave 
17  for a serious medical condition, and if I hire the 
18  woman, she might take 12 weeks of leave for a serious 
19  medical condition which might be something that either 
men or women could get, or it also could be a sickness 
20
21  related to pregnancy. 
22
23  an incentive for this hypothetical employer to 
24  discriminate against the woman.
25

employment, a man and a woman, and the employer says, 

 So, there still is -- there still would be 

 MR. FOREMAN:  But one of the things Congress 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. FOREMAN:  It affects the incentive by 

and women 12 weeks of leave for self-care affects the 

is an employer, if you just have (A) through (C), can 
look at an employee and, based upon gender stereotypes, 
would make the assumption that the women, because of 
historically the role they were required to play, would 
be taking all the leave under (A) and (B) and (C).  And 
so, why would I even hire that woman in the first place? 

1  tried to do is to take that incentive away. 
2
3  what I'm -- I understand that, and it's a worthy 
4  objective.  I just don't understand how giving both men 
5
6  incentive. 
7
8  providing -- it becomes the equal opportunity employer. 
9  It evens the -- the ground.  And the way it would do it 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  less often than men, do they? 
18
19
something to both sides of the balance, and it doesn't 
20
21  affect the employer's incentive.  The employer still --
22  the -- the hypothetical discriminatory employer would 
23  still say, well, women are going to be caregivers more 
24  often; so, I'm -- I'm going to not hire that person.
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But women don't get sick 

 MR. FOREMAN:  No, absolutely. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, you're just adding 

Official 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  How does it do that?  That's 

 MR. FOREMAN:  But under (A), (B), and (C) 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. FOREMAN:  There is nothing in the record 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And that's why (A), (B), and 
(C) go to the problem, but what does (D) have to do with 

1  after the Family and Medical Leave, an employer would 
2  look and say both men can take these now.  And I think 
3  we need to step back --
4
5
6  it?  If you assume that both men and women get sick at 
7  an approximately equal rate -- maybe you don't assume 
8  that -- but if you do, it doesn't seem to factor into 
9  the employer's incentives in any way.
10
11  that demonstrates that there's a differential rate 
12  between the self-care rates for men and women.  But the 
13  perception was that women, because of pregnancy, because 
14  of pregnancy-related disabilities, would in fact take 
more leave.  And so that I would look at a woman as an 
15
16  employer and say she will become pregnant, she will take 
17  leave, she will be disabled.  However, with (D) now, but 
18  the man can take a -- a disability leave on the same 
19  basis.
20
21  would happen immediately, but by the -- what would 
22  happen is, with the application of family and medical 
23  leave, at some point men would be taking (A), (B), and 
24  (C), and, in fact, women and men would be taking family 
25

 And the hope of Congress was not that it 

and medical self-care leave.  I just --

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company

trying to open up caregiving for both sexes. 

 But you have answered the question that 

said there is this close association of women with 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Foreman, I think 
1
2  everyone has been trying to get you to focus on the 
3  health care sickness leave alone, and in the -- in the 
4  portions of the Act that this Court upheld, the Congress 
5
6  children; we think it's going to be good for everybody 
7  if fathers recognize their responsibility for elderly 
8  parents, sick children, sick spouse.  So, we -- we can 
9  see the rationale, trying to change the stereotype, 
10
11
12  women and men get sick; there's no -- there's no 
13  disproportion.  So, how do you tie that, just -- just 
14  that part of the Act, where there -- there isn't the 
obvious association of women with childbearing?  So, we 
15
16  extend the benefit to men so they'll be associated with 
17  child care.  There isn't that same link here, is there? 
 MR. FOREMAN:  I think it is the same linkage 
18
19  trying to address -- it's addressing a difference there, 
but it's addressing the linkage that women will in fact 
20
21  take pregnancy-based leave or pregnancy-based 
22  disabilities and, therefore, are less attractive, less 
23  -- employees, and that's what self-care was intended to 
24  do.
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, you're saying -- let me 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. FOREMAN:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  And 

employer who thought women are going to take more family 

1  just make sure I understand.  You're saying that the --
2  that Congress is thinking that an employer actually does 
3  think that women take more sick leave because women get 
4  pregnant.  And just as Congress was thinking about the 
5
6  leave, you think Congress was thinking about the 
7  employer who thinks women are also going to take more 
8  sick leave because of pregnancy? 
9
in response to Justice Alito's question -- and I'm sorry 
10
11  if I gave a confusing response.  There are two separate 
12  ways of addressing that. 
13
 You can look at self-care as a stand-alone 
14  provision, without (A), (B), and (C).  Congress passed 
just self-care.  In that case it would be responding to 
15
16  exactly that type of gender stereotype, and 12 weeks 
17  would be a congruent and proportional response. 
 The other way to look at it is that's not 
18
19  the way Congress passed the bill.  They passed it as a 
comprehensive response with (A), (B), and (C), and hence 
20
21  (D) then becomes a bit of an equalizer to take away this 
22  negative incentive that only women would take (A), (B), 
23  and (C). 
24
25

 So, there's two separate ways that this 

Court can get to the same conclusion, and that 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you have any evidence 

two things?  Is there anything in the record that 

1  conclusion is that this is a congruent and proportional 
2  response to gender-based discrimination. 
3
4  that Congress in fact was thinking about either of these 
5
6  suggests either of those two theories? 
7
 MR. FOREMAN:  Yes, there -- there is, Your 
8  Honor, and let me -- let me take the negative inference 
9  first, because I think looking at the statute as a 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17
18  was parental leave without medical leave would encourage 
19  discrimination against women of child-bearing age, who 
constitute approximately 73 percent of all women in the 
20
21  workforce.  Employers would tend to hire men, who are 
22  much less likely to make this claim. 
23
24  passage of -- and this would be on page 42 of our merits 
brief:  "A law providing special protection to women or 
25

comprehensive makes sense -- is it was introduced -- and 
I'm reading from page 43.  It's referenced on page 43 of 
our brief, that starting in 1987, National Women's 
Political Caucus testified, quote:  "My primary purpose 
is to stress that parental and medical leave are 
inseparable.  In the words of the old song, 'You can't 
have one without the other.'" 

 And the point she then later on to explain 

 Fast forward to 1993 at the time of the

Official 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counselor, I -- I take 

statements repeatedly by many congresspeople, there 
appears to be -- have been a dual motive for this 
provision.  They were, in fact, engaged in the question 
of discrimination against pregnant women.  That was 
recognized in Hibbs, and that's clear.

1  any defined group, in addition to being inequitable, 
2  runs the risk of causing discrimination."  The FML 
3  addresses this by addressing the needs of all workers, 
4  avoids this risk.  The FMLA is based on the guarantees 
of equal protection.  So, it addresses that aspect of --
5
6  it addresses that aspect. 
7
8  your argument, but if you look at the legislative 
9  record, the reports, the findings, et cetera, and the 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  provision, they were also concerned about economic 
17  effect that -- that happened to everyone, men and women, 
18  who became disabled.  And so, they appear to have had 
19  dual motivation.  Part of the bill was gender-related; 
20
21
22  bill, where Congress may have been expanding the 
23  benefits it's giving to people, not solely because of 
24  gender discrimination, but because of this desire to 
25

part of the bill seemed to be disability-related. 

 What do -- how do we judge that kind of 

 But with respect to this particular 

address disability discrimination? 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

responsive to gender-based discrimination, then how
 

families and that families are -- benefit should not be 
used to undermine the fact that Congress indeed was 
acting pursuant to one of its broadest powers, section 5 
of the Fourteenth Amendment, and, therefore, that their 
-- their considered judgment is a congruent and 
proportional response. 

1
2  think the way you judge it is rely on what Congress's 
3  expressed findings and provisions are.  And to the 
4  extent this Court makes a determination that the FMLA is 
5
6  Congress chose to address that is congruent and
 
7  proportional.
 
 The fact that Congress may also have had
 
8
9  other motives, that there was a concern with -- with
 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  reflective of a fact that this covered both governmental 
18  employers and private industry.  So, there was reference 
19  to Commerce Clause type of -- of analysis, which my 
colleagues raised repeatedly in their brief.  But the 
20
21  court -- the Congress needed to do that because they 
22  were regulating private employment but, at the same 
23  time, recognized to the extent that we are -- are going 
24  to regulate State-based conduct.
25

 Part of -- part of the findings is clearly 

Official 

 MR. FOREMAN:  Justice Sotomayor, I -- I 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, with respect to the 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

parte Young action here that would be made -- able to be 
made consistent with the Commerce Clause, under the 
Commerce Clause? 

1  Commerce Clause, could I ask you this:  If we were to 
2  disagree with you on the Fourteenth Amendment and hold 
3  that it -- that Congress didn't validly abrogate State 
4  sovereign immunity with respect to subsection (D), would 
your client still be able to seek reinstatement or other 
5
6  injunctive relief? 
7
 MR. FOREMAN:  Justice Alito, I think what 
8  you're -- and you'll clearly correct me if I am wrong, 
9  but I think what you are responding to, is there an Ex 
10
11 
12 
13
 And the answer is -- and I know that both 
14  Justice Kennedy and Justice Rehnquist, I think, in one 
of his dissents, pointed out in the Family and Medical 
15
16  Leave Act that the employee may not be left out in the 
17  dark because there is an Ex parte Young claim. 
18
19
20
21  as you sought damages.  I -- I think you also sought 
22  reinstatement and other equitable relief, but the 
23  district court dismissed it completely. 
24
 MR. FOREMAN:  That's right.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  But you're not contesting 
25

 A couple points on that --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Here the district court 

completely dismissed your FMLA claim, not just insofar 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company

damages. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because this is for money 

 MR. FOREMAN:  Pardon? 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because this is for money 

 MR. FOREMAN:  We're not contesting it 

dismissed based upon Eleventh Amendment immunity. 
 But if I could try to respond to your 

1  that, are you? 
2
3  consistent with any Ex parte Young claim.  What the 
4  district court did was say the claim is totally 
5
6
7  question more specifically, this Court has never as a 
8  Court held that Ex parte Young type of action is 
9  available in this type of claim.  Assuming that it --
10
11 
12
13
14  damages.  Ex parte Young was just injunctive relief. 
15
16  of the State against money damages. 
17
 MR. FOREMAN:  Correct. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's not Ex parte Young. 
18
 MR. FOREMAN:  Correct.  But as -- as you 
19
pointed out in your dissent in Hibbs, that Ex parte 
20
21  Young may be available, but one of the concerns we have 
22  is, again, that the Court -- as a majority, the Court 
23  has never held that.  I believe that is in fact the 
24  correct interpretation of the law, that it would be 
25

The Eleventh Amendment primarily protects the treasuries 

available for injunctive relief.  However, the Court has 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  You said "in this case." 

That's basically what I'm asking.  If we were to 

dismissal of your claim, insofar as you sought 

1  never defined the parameters of what an Ex parte Young 
2  action really gives a plaintiff, and that becomes very 
3  important in this case. 
4
5
6  disagree with you on the Fourteenth Amendment, are you 
7  asking us simply -- would we then simply affirm the 
8  Fourth Circuit?  Or would we have to -- would we have to 
9  make some accommodation for the possibility that the 
10
11  injunctive relief, may have been improper? 
12
13  that accommodation, but, with respect, Your Honor, I 
14  think that would be an incorrect approach.  And here's 
-- here's the reason why in Ex parte Young, a perfect 
15
16  example --
17
18  little bit helpful to you.  And I --
19
20
21  and I apologize. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay. 
22
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What relief did you ask 
23
24  for?  Damages, we know, and the -- you have to overcome 
the Eleventh Amendment.  Injunctive relief, you don't, 
25

 (Laughter.)
 MR. FOREMAN:  And apparently I missed that, 

 MR. FOREMAN:  I think you would have to make

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, you --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'd go with Justice Alito 

 MR. FOREMAN:  If that's your reading of it, 

 MR. FOREMAN:  In the complaint itself, it 

1  but did you ask for it? 
2
3  does not ask for injunctive relief pursuant to the 
4  Family and Medical Leave Act.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought you --
5
6
 MR. FOREMAN:  There were combined claims --
7
 JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought you did, but maybe 
8  I'm reading your complaint more generously than you read 
9  it yourself.
10
11
12  here. 
13
14  we will certainly accept your reading.
15
16
17  such other and further relief. 
 MR. FOREMAN:  But, again, back to the Ex 
18
19  parte Young, in the case Nelson v. The University of 
Tennessee -- Texas, a -- the case that dealt with --
20
21  exactly with this issue of abrogation of Eleventh 
22  Amendment immunity, and they found that there was valid 
23  abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity, the State of 
24  Texas -- then the court was required to address the Ex 
parte Young issue.  And the State of Texas argued that 
25

 (Laughter.) 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You must have asked for 

17
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, Congress must have 

thought that giving the woman back her job was an 

1  reinstatement is not an appropriate remedy under Ex 
2  parte Young and that -- while the Fifth Circuit 
3  ultimately rejected that, that is an argument that 
4  employees would have to face:  What are the parameters 
of Ex parte Young?  And, more importantly, that is not 
5
6  the remedy that Congress in their considered judgment 
7  believed was the appropriate remedy to address 
8  gender-based discrimination. 
9
10
11  important part.  I mean, I thought the whole idea is she 
12  wasn't supposed to be fired.  So, I think that the --
13  the relief, the non-monetary relief, is certainly 
14  important.
 MR. FOREMAN:  It is extremely important, but 
15
16  Congress did not stop there.  Congress decided it needed 
17  to take one step further and there needed to be monetary 
18  relief.  And I think Mr. Coleman's case illustrates 
19  exactly why.
20
21  were supposedly guaranteed him under the Family and 
22  Medical Leave Act, and indeed under a State law, and the 
23  State of Maryland fired him, and he is out of work.  And 
24  what is the disincentive for the State to not do the 
25

same thing the next time if the only thing that you can 

 Here Mr. Coleman exercised his rights that 

18

to mitigate, try to find another job. 

 What's an employer to do?  And Congress said

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm just asking you

14  give them medical leave, to everyone, because otherwise 
the employer won't hire women.  And that's -- the

though it's unlawful? 

 MR. FOREMAN:  I -- I don't think that was 

 MR. FOREMAN:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that -- that 

1  because they wanted to eliminate or at least reduce one 
2  kind of discrimination against women in the job market. 
3
4
discrimination was refusing to hire women of child-
5
6  bearing age.  Well, they couldn't do it out and out 
7  because that would be a violation of the law.  So, is 
8  Congress having in mind discrimination that is under --
9  under the radar screen, that it's going to go on even 
10
11
12  Congress's intent, and that that's not what was 
13  reflected.  I think, again, they were trying to address 
14  it on two separate levels:  one, the gender-based 
discrimination, the gender stereotype that women simply 
15
16  become less attractive; and in the broader statute, to 
17  prevent the negative inference so that all -- that 
18  ultimately where we would get in society is the ability 
19  to take pregnancy-related leave, other leave, would not 
be viewed as a negative inference running against women, 
20
21  and, therefore, women ultimately would become a 
22  nonissue. 
23
24  reserve the balance of my time.

 So here, employers think of women as needing 

more medical leave because of pregnancy, and the 

 MR. HOWARD:  Congress, Justice Kagan, did 

1  Howard, for a second, as I took from Mr. Foreman 
2  something that I hadn't understood from his briefs --
3  maybe I just missed it -- which is that he's making a 
4  kind of analogous argument, that, just as in the -- in 
the prior provisions of the Act, employers thought of 
5
6  women as caregivers and the response of Congress was to 
7  provide a gender-neutral leave benefit that had both --
8  that both women and men were eligible for. 
9
10
11  response of Congress is to provide gender-neutral sick 
12  leave.  So, what is your response to that argument? 
13
14  not I think take that stereotype or perception that Mr. 
Foreman referred to into account.  And I'd specifically 
15
16  point the Court to page 21 of our brief, where we cite 
17  some Bureau of Labor Statistics studies indicating that 
18  men and women at the time took roughly the same amount 
19  of sick leave.  In fact, Mr. Foreman has conceded as 
20
21  will take roughly the same amount of time after the 
22  enactment of the FMLA --
23
24  was -- there was certainly much conversation and 
25

much.  And that same study projects that men and women 

testimony that, whether they in fact took the same

23

likely to take the time. 

1  amount of leave time or not, that women who were 
2  pregnant or were perceived as capable of getting 
3  pregnant were hired less frequently because, 
4  subjectively, the employers thought that they were more 
5
6
 So, frankly, for years there was questions 
7  about whether law firms were hiring young -- not hiring 
8  young women because they feared they would leave in the 
9  middle of a big case or something else.  We all know 
those stories.  So, it is sort of common knowledge in 
10
11 
many ways, but there was plenty of testimony related to 
12 
that. 
13
14  perception, because it was supported by the record or as 
15
16  Where does that leave your argument? 
17
 MR. HOWARD:  Well, I would make a couple of 
18  points in response to that, Justice Sotomayor.  First, 
19  the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was already in place. 
20
21  employers might discriminate based on pregnancy 
22  disabilities, that would be unlawful under Title VII as 
23  amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. 
24
25

much of the record as Hibbs recognized as adequate. 

And so, to the extent there were perceptions that 

 So, assume that that was Congress's 

 And the fact that -- and you are quite right 

that there is a fair amount of discussion in the 

24
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

as a type of illness. 

 But we again would note that this is valid 

1  legislative record, although I think it's less of a 
2  predominant theme than the concern for job security for 
3  working families, but there certainly is discussion 
4  about pregnancy discrimination and pregnancy disability 
5
6
7  Commerce Clause legislation.  And so, to the extent that 
8  kind of discrimination was occurring and leave was being 
9  denied or women were suffering adverse consequences in 
the workplace as a result of pregnancy discrimination, 
10
11 
they could enforce the 12 weeks through a Title VII 
12 
action. 
13
14  Pregnancy Discrimination Act says that you have to treat 
pregnancy like any other disability.  So, if they're not 
15
16  giving anybody any leave for anything, they don't have 
17  to give any leave; not 12 weeks, not 1 day.  And that's 
18  what -- that's the gap that this legislation fills.  It 
19  says, yes, you do have to provide leave for women who 
have disabling conditions, including pregnancy, but then 
20
21  you have to give that to men as well.  You can't reserve 
22  that for the one sex.  So, it was the gap in the 
23  Pregnancy Discrimination Act that this -- this was 
24  referring to.
25

 MR. HOWARD:  Yes, I agree, Justice Ginsburg, 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They couldn't -- the 

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

served as prophylaxis for Title VII but not for 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Assume for the sake of 

1  but the gap that existed was the absence of a guaranteed 
2  period of leave.  In other words, it was the absence of 
3  a substantive entitlement, and so -- to a certain amount 
4  of leave.  And, in effect, the gap that was being filled 
5
6  constitutional violations.  Now --
7
8  argument that for the -- the applicants for particular 
9  provisions -- particular positions, I should say --

12

14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21  could argue that that is connected with eliminating 
22  pregnancy disability discrimination.  It's also 
23  connected to the purposes of (A), (B), and (C).  I think 
24  that the principal reason why employers do view 
25

where the applicants are typically of a certain age, men 
tend to take less sick leave than women, because women 
also take sick leave for pregnancy-related illnesses. 
So, giving everybody 12 weeks eliminates the -- the 
possibility that women -- women who will be -- want to 
take additional -- will want to take more sick leave 
will be fired because they exceed the amount of sick 
leave allowed by the employer for everybody.  Now, isn't 
that connected to eliminating discrimination in 
employment?

potential hires as -- when they're women, as likely to

1  take a lot of time off I think goes more to the family 
2  caretaking provisions, and I think that's largely 
3  reflected in the record. 
4
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I don't think -- I 
have difficulty with the incentives argument either --
5
6  honestly, either as to (D) or as to (C).  But I'm just 
7  talking about the -- an argument based on consequences. 
8  If an employer says you get 2 weeks of sick leave, 
9  period; after that, if you can't come back, you're 
10
11  certain age range, that may have a much more severe or a 
12  more severe impact on women than on men. 
13
14  think what --
15
16 
17
18  the answer, and what I was going to say was that what 
19  you are describing is a disproportionate impact on women 
20
21  disability.  And, of course, if States were engaging in 
22  this kind of conduct or if there were a disproportionate 
23  impact, that would not state an equal protection 
24  violation under Washington v. --
25

JUSTICE ALITO:  What would the answer to 
that be, that that's not intentional discrimination? 

 MR. HOWARD:  Yes, Justice Alito, and I 

 MR. HOWARD:  That would certainly be part of 

as a result of assumptions concerning pregnancy 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why are you separating four 

27
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  things?  I mean, I've heard, it seems to me, three 
2  separate rationales.  One, the easiest, is in (D) 
3  itself.  Sometimes a woman could have a miscarriage, and 
4  of course she has to stay home.  And that isn't covered 
by (A), (B), or (C).  So, we cover it in (D), you know. 
5
6  And then we put the men in too because we don't want to 
7  make this incentive just to not hire women.  That's one. 
 The second one was the one Justice Ginsburg 
8
9  brought up, that there is a gap in the pregnancy law 
which won't work unless you have to give people some 
10
11 
medical leave.  So, here it is, (D). 
12
 And the third one, which I think was related 
13  to what Justice Alito just said, is when -- you have to 
14  read it together to understand the third one.  You get 
12 weeks all together.  All right?  Now, that means, 
15
16  once you put in (D), this Act will have less of a bad 
17  effect.  The bad effect of the Act is if you protect the 
18  women, then the -- the employers say, well, we're not 
19  going to hire women, perfect; we have to give them 12 
leaves; we'd have to give the men -- terrible, it's a 
20
21  terrible disincentive. 
22
23  disincentive.  And the way you do that, you say 12 weeks 
24  overall.  And now look what happens.  A woman wants to 
take, say, 12 weeks to look after her family, and she 
25

 But then they worked out how to lessen the

 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Now let's think of the man. 

1  gets separately sick, 4 more weeks.  But how many does 
2  she get?  Answer:  Twelve, right?  Twelve.  You could 
3  answer that part. 
4
5
6  Let's think of the man.  The man would like to look 
7  after the family, say, for 6 weeks.  And he gets sick 4 
8  weeks.  How many weeks have we got? 
9
 MR. HOWARD:  Ten.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Ten.  Thank you. 
10
11
 (Laughter.) 
12
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right. 
13
 MR. HOWARD:  I like these questions. 
14
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So -- perfect.
 So, now the employer is sitting -- and it 
15
16  will work with other numbers.  I don't rely on those 
17  alone. 
18
19
20
21  Without this Act, he's got a woman who is going to be 
22  out of there -- I mean, with the Act -- see, unless we 
23  put in four -- unless we put in the fourth part of it, 
24  we have a woman who's gone for 12 weeks and a man who's 
gone maybe for 6 but maybe for zero, okay?  Maybe for 6. 
25

 (Laughter.) 
 MR. HOWARD:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But now look what happens. 

29
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 And so, the comparison there -- and it will 

 We have three different rationales.  All of 

there is very different.  And the comparison doesn't --

1  With the Act, the woman's gone for 12, the man's gone 
2  for 10.  You see? 
3
4  work with whatever numbers you want.  The comparison 
5
6  doesn't totally erase the problem with the woman, but it 
7  may reduce it to a size where the Act itself will no 
8  longer act as such a disincentive to hiring a woman. 
9
them are related to a serious problem, which is the 
10
11  problem of discrimination against women because the 
12  employers think they'll be home more.  And so, you see 
13  the conclusion I'm drawing?  Yes, okay.  So -- so, where 
14  are we?
 MR. HOWARD:  Well, let me speak first to the 
15
16  second one, the concern about the gap.  The gap that is 
17  filled by the 12 weeks is -- is a -- is to provide a 
18  substantive entitlement.  And when it permits a claim, a 
19  damages claim enforceable against a State treasury, it 
provides an entirely -- it requires a different 
20
21  justification than simply to fill a gap with a 
22  substantive entitlement.  It becomes --
23
24  one package.  I think that's what Justice Breyer was 
getting at.  But just suppose that Congress wanted to 
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The idea is it's part of

Alderson Reporting Company

attended to. 

 Now, what leave policy would say, okay, to 

1  improve conditions for the -- in the job market for 
2  women, which I think it's fair to say was the motivating 
3  force behind this Act, and they also wanted to protect 
4  families so that sick children, sick spouses are 
5
6
7  do that, we will have leave when a spouse is sick, a 
8  child is sick, a parent is sick, but not when the worker 
9  herself is sick?  Without -- it's all part of one 
package which is designed to increase job security for 
10
11 
women and increase protection for their families.  So, I 
12 
don't think you can slice off (D) from the other three. 
13
 MR. HOWARD:  Justice Ginsburg, I think you 
14  can separate (D) on the same analysis that this Court 
15
16  case.  In Lane, of course, different sections of the 
17  same Antidiscrimination Act required different 
18  analysis -- analyses and reference to different parts of 
19  the record.  There was a single over-arching purpose, to 
20
21  disabilities, but the operation and effect of the 
22  particular claim requires a different analysis.  As 
23  Justice Stevens said, the Court is not required to 
24  evaluate statutes as an undifferentiated whole.

applied in Tennessee v. Lane, in contrast to the Garrett

suddenly the ratio from the point of view of the 

1  course.  But the whole point of the question that I was 
2  asking was, sure, what helps you by doing it separately 
3  is it helps your case.  But if we look at what Congress 
4  was trying to do, they were trying to do it as a whole. 
That's my point that I want you to answer.  And they're 
5
6  trying to do it as a whole because, no matter what 
7  numbers I use, if I look at it without (D) -- is it (D)? 
8  Yes, (D).  If I look at it without (D), the ratio will 
9  disfavor the woman.  And if I look at it with (D), 
10
11  employer of the disadvantage of hiring a woman over --
12  over hiring a man -- it goes way down.  And that helps 
13  women. 
14
 And that is why, I think -- reading this and 
listening, a major reason why they put in (D) as part of 
15
16  the other, because working with that 12-week limitation 
17  and the whole rest of the statute, we now have a statute 
18  that doesn't defeat itself.  We now have a statute that 
19  actually can achieve the end of leading employers to not 
discriminate against women.  Not perfectly, but there's 
20
21  a big improvement. 
 And that's the -- that's the argument I'm 
22
23  making.  You have to read it as a whole to see that. 
24  And that's what I -- I wonder if there's an answer to 
25

that.  Of course, I'm at the moment thinking there isn't

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if Congress had 

1  an answer to it, but I asked the question because I want 
2  to hear what you say. 
3
4  ratio, I think the premise of that point is that women 
will take more leave for serious health conditions than 
5
6  men.  And I don't think that's borne out.  And, you 
7  know, Mr. Foreman has recognized as much.  So, I don't 
8  think the ratio really changes. 
9
added three additional subsections here and said that an 
10
11  employer has to provide 12 weeks of unpaid leave so that 
12  an employee can go to a health spa, 12 weeks of unpaid 
13  leave for -- so that the employee can travel, 12 weeks 
14  of unpaid leave so that the employee can take an

 Now, that -- those could be taken advantage 
17  of by either men and women.  It makes both men and women 
18  increasingly unattractive as employees and, therefore, 
19  reduces the any special disincentive that might have

7  working families, whether single-income, double-income, 
8  and the concern that if a breadwinner falls ill, the 
9  family's going to have severe financial insecurity.  And 
10
11

 But I think that one thing I'd like to 
13  emphasize is that your -- your suggestion, Justice 
14  Sotomayor, and -- and really almost all of the 
15
16  good social policy.  We support it.  But I don't think 
17  that we've really gotten anywhere near the necessary 
18  predicate of unconstitutional State conduct when the 
19  constitutional right is defined with some precision.
20

else, you have a good point, that it seems to be related

 But when you look at (D) as passed at the 

women do as workers, then (D) assumes a different kind 
of aura. 

1  to economic security, which is not a section 5 issue; 
2  that it seems to be related to discrimination against 
3  sick people, which would also put us in a different 
4  legal universe.
5
6  same moment on the basis of the same record as (A), (B), 
7  and (C), with the overwhelming purpose of Congress being 
8  to protect women from discrimination in the workplace 
9  because of unfair stereotypical -- views about what 
10
11 
12
 And you can talk about a number of theories 
13  for that, but I guess I would just ask for your -- your 
14  reaction to that, that (D) is just part of a package 
which was about telling employers:  Get rid of your old 
15
16  stereotypes.  Don't act on your old stereotypes.  Employ 
17  women. 
 MR. HOWARD:  Well, I -- I would respond in 
18

21  package.  But from the standpoint of States, subsection 
22  (D) provides a separate claim, a separate basis to sue 
23  States, and we think that claim is incongruent and 
24  disproportionate to any conceivable unconstitutional 
25

should discuss these provisions as part of a single 

conduct that it might prohibit.

 And I think this is borne out in the case 

 So, I -- I would really emphasize, in 

1
2  law.  We've surveyed the 40 Federal cases that we could 
3  find under subsection (D).  Only two involve 
4  pregnancy-related disabilities.  Only one of them 
alludes in passing to headaches arising from pregnancy 
5
6  along with other stress-related conditions.  But -- but 
7  all of the others really have to do with men and women 
8  benefiting from this leave for -- to care for a serious 
9  health condition.
10
11  response to your question, that one could look at it as 
12  a package, but from the standpoint of States, it's a 
13  separate and independent claim, and it's an 
14  extraordinarily broad one.  And it is not necessary, not 
simply because Pregnancy Discrimination Act claims are 
15
16  available, but, Justice Alito, there are Ex parte Young 
17  claims available. 
18
19  case at the Joint Appendix pages 3 to 12, the amended 
complaint reveals that injunctive relief was sought, 
20
21  albeit -- and on page 12 is the prayer for relief. 
22  It's -- it's not clear whether that relief is sought 
23  under Title VII or FMLA or both.  But the reason why I 
24  don't think -- the claim fails separate and apart from 
any sovereign immunity argument.  Of course, Ex parte

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there's some focus in 

 MR. HOWARD:  Yes.  There is discussion in 

job security for them.  That wasn't the only group of 
women, but certainly that -- that affected the -- this 
Act as it came out, didn't it? 

1  Young is not -- does not protect on that ground. 
2
3  the legislative history particularly on the -- the 
4  family that has a single parent -- much more often a 
woman, not a man -- and the devastating impact on that 
5
6  family of the woman getting sick, the sole breadwinner 
7  getting sick.  So, that was certainly an -- a problem 
8  for families with -- with only one breadwinner.  And 
9  Congress was focusing on those women and wanting to have 
10
11 
12 
13
14  the record of the disproportionate impact that you say. 
But what -- what is left out -- well, it -- it is found

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There's a question of how 
18  Congress would do it.  If they -- if they provided only 
19  for the woman who's the single head of the family, then 
that would be vulnerable under equal protection because 
20
21  they didn't provide it for men. 
22
23  as this Court's cases have emphasized, a widespread 
24  pattern of unconstitutional conduct in the part of 
25

predominantly women, but between working families where 
it could be two parents with a single income, man or 
woman; it could be a family with two incomes, but 
neither one can be lost.  So -- and in any event, I 
think we're talking now about a disproportionate impact, 
which -- which would not state a -- an Equal Protection 
violation.

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. FOREMAN:  This is not responsive to

3  disability-based discrimination.  The findings and the 
4  purpose of the Family/Medical Leave Act make it clear 
that it is responsive to gender-based discrimination. 
5
6
 Hibbs, in fact, found that the FMLA was in 
7  response to gender-based discrimination.  In making that 
8  finding, they did not differentiate between the 
9  different leave provisions.  And, indeed, if you move to

18  about the military leave portion of the FMLA illustrates 
19  that -- what Congress was doing here when they added 
20
21  pigeonhole it into -- this is section 5 legislation.  In 
22  the circuits at that time, there was considerable debate 
23  as to whether that could be justified as proper 
24  abrogation of immunity --
25

Tennessee v. Lane, where Justice Rehnquist dissented, 
drawing distinctions between disability-based 
discrimination and sex-based discrimination, stated that 
the task of identifying the constitutional right at 
issue in the Family and Medical Leave Act was an "easy" 
one.  And that was his word, "easy."  It's responsive to 
gender-based discrimination.

declared its intent to abrogate sovereign immunity?

conclusion that (D) is linked to (A), (B), and (C)
