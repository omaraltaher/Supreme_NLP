CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

this morning in Case 15-649, Czyzewski v. Jevic Holding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Corporation. 

            

Ms. Spinelli. 

 

           

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

Chapter 11 provides one way to distribute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estate assets to creditors on account of their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prepetition claims through a confirmed plan that adheres 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to the code's priority scheme.  If a Chapter 11 plan 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't be confirmed, the bankruptcy court can convert the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case to Chapter 7, which also requires that creditors be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paid in order of priority, or it can simply dismiss the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case without distributing assets to creditors at all, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

returning all parties to their prebankruptcy position. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

No provision of the Bankruptcy Code permits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what happened here:  an order dismissing a Chapter 11 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

case that distributed all the estate's assets to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditors, but deliberately skipped over our clients' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

priority claims. 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  May I ask you:  Did the

settlement bar you from suing the debtor for the WARN 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

Act claims? 

 

            

            

MS. SPINELLI:  No, it did not. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And there was no money 

  

 

 

 

 

 

left to the debtor.  So did it bar you from suing Sun 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Life for a fraudulent transfer, which --

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MS. SPINELLI:  It did. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It did. 

  

 

 

MS. SPINELLI:  It did, Justice Sotomayor, 

  

 

 

 

 

and I think that's -- that's critical.  What this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

settlement did is it took away our client's right to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursue either the debtor or Sun and CIT on account of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their undisputed WARN Act claims, which were in the area 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of $12 million. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  In the court 

  

  

 

 

 

 

below, I understand that the -- that you represented 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that if this settlement went through, that you would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have -- I'm sorry -- that if -- without the settlement, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you would really have nothing, because there was no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money in the estate. 

 

 

 

            

So are you representing that your client 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intends to sue Sun Life?  Because that's the only way to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get money here. 

 

 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  Well, let me -- let me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

respond to that, Justice Sotomayor.  There are a few

things that could happen if this Court reverses the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order below and the case is remanded. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's fine.  Tell me 

  

  

 

 

 

5 

which one you're going to do. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  Well, that's really up to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy court. 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So what do 

  

  

 

 

 

 

you -- are you going to ask them to do? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  What we had asked for before, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and what may well make the most sense, is conversion to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter 7, in which case either the Chapter 7 trustee 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could pursue the fraudulent-transfer claim --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But there is no money in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the estate to do that.  So how will the trustee do that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  The trustee would have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

retain contingency counsel, and that does happen.  I was 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved in a Chapter 7 case where the trustee pursued 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

an avoidance action successfully with contingency 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel. 

            

Failing that, if the trustee decided not to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do that, after the bankruptcy is over, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraudulent-transfer claim would revest in the creditors, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and our clients could then bring that claim themselves. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  There is a difference --

   

  

 

 

 

there seems to be a difference between what you have

said on this point in your briefs and in your argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this morning and what you told the Third Circuit or what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

-- did you -- did your firm represent -- appear in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Third Circuit? 

 

            

stage. 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  Not until the rehearing 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, in the Third Circuit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

oral argument, it was said over and over, well, we just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to make sure that the law is filed -- is followed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's what we are interested in. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Isn't that right? 

 

 

MS. SPINELLI:  We certainly do want to make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure that the law is followed.  I mean, we --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  If you were pressed as to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what practical difference the case meant to you and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the answer was, we -- you know, we want to uphold 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the law. 

 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  Justice Alito, I don't 

   

  

 

 

believe that's the case.  The case does make a practical 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference.  It always has made a practical difference. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

That's the only reason our clients have been pursuing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  And the practical difference it makes is that on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remand, they will have an opportunity to recover on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account of their undisputed WARN Act claims, which, as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of now, they're -- they have been deprived of. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But can you point to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

anything you said in the Third Circuit, in writing or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

orally, that -- along those lines, that you -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was some practical course of action that -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- some tangible thing that you were going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursue? 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  What we told the Third 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit is that if this case went back on remand and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were converted to Chapter 7, then the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraudulent-transfer action could be pursued.  I believe 

    

 

 

 

 

that's what -- that's the argument that we made below. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I ask one other -- one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

other thing?  Something strange seems to have happened 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

between the petition stage and the briefing stage in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

The question that you asked us to take was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether a bankruptcy court may authorize the 

   

 

 

 

 

distribution of settlement proceeds in a manner that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

violates the statutory priority scheme.  And you said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a square conflict on that issue, with the Second 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit and the Third Circuit on one side and the Fifth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit on the other side. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MS. SPINELLI:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And we took the case.

your brief refers to "structured dismissal."  There is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

nothing about structured dismissal in the question that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you asked us to take, and there is no conflict on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of structured dismissal, is there? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  And, Justice Alito, we're not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

asking this Court to decide the question of whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structured dismissals are valid.  We did not change the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substance of the question presented here. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, you're not asking us to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide the broad question whether there can ever be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structured dismissal.  But you are asking us to decide 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the priorities have to be followed in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structural dismissal, and unless the answer to that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question follows from the answer to the question that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you presented in your petition, you have changed the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question that you have asked us to decide. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  We did not change the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

substance of the question presented.  In the petition, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we had a paragraph of background explaining that this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

was done through a structured dismissal.  We then asked 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the question, does the Bankruptcy Code -- may a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy court authorize the distribution of 

 

 

 

 

 

settlement proceeds in a manner that violates the Code's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

priority scheme? 

 

            

In the brief, we condensed that a bit so

that we didn't have the paragraph of background, and we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, may a structured dismissal distribute estate 

   

 

 

 

 

assets in violation of the priority scheme?  There is no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive difference there.  The authorization in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case was done through a structured dismissal. 

   

 

 

 

 

Settlement proceeds are estate assets. 

 

 

 

 

            

The basic question in this case has always 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been the same:  Was the bankruptcy court entitled under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Bankruptcy Code to authorize this distribution of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settlement proceeds, which are estate assets, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of priority? 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Exactly.  So what forbids 

  

  

 

 

 

it?  You started out by saying there is nothing in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Code that permits this kind of settlement, which in fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leaves out -- if -- it gives some money to lower-ranking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditors without giving them to your client. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think you're right.  I don't see anything 

    

 

 

 

 

permits it.  The problem:  What forbids it? 

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  The structure of the Code 

  

 

 

 

 

 

forbids it, Justice Breyer. 

 

 

 

            

Code --

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  The structure of the 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. SPINELLI:  If we --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- forbids it. 

  

 

 

 

MS. SPINELLI:  If we -- the structure and

the text of the Code.  If we take a step back for a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moment, the way business bankruptcies work is that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debtor files a petition. 

   

 

10 

            

That creates an estate, which includes all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the debtor's property, and it also includes causes of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action belonging to the estate. 

 

 

 

 

            

That estate is then held in trust, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially for the benefit of creditors.  It is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

protected against creditors' claims through the 

 

 

 

 

 

automatic stay. 

 

            

The trustee or debtor-in-possession can 

 

 

 

 

dispose of estate assets only in accordance with strict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations and subject to the bankruptcy court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervision.  And at the end of the case, those assets 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are distributed to creditors through a confirmed Chapter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

11 plan, which requires adherence to priority; or, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failing that, the case can be converted to Chapter 7, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which case the assets are also distributed in accordance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with priority. 

 

            

Those careful, reticulated mechanisms for 

 

 

 

 

the distribution of estate assets foreclose any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inference that Congress intended to allow courts to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disregard them and create a different method for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

distributing assets that's not mentioned anywhere in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Code that violates that --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why do you think --

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

MS. SPINELLI:  -- backbone priority scheme. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why do you think, though, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't mentioned someplace in the Code?  I mean, did 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress just not think that this might happen? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  No, Justice Kagan.  I think 

    

  

 

 

 

the reason that Chapter 11 doesn't expressly apply the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

priority rules to settlements is that settlements are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not intended to be a method of distributing estate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

assets.  I think it's very important to keep those two 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things distinct.  On the one hand, we have a settlement 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a cause of action belonging to the estate.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

estate relinquishes its rights in return for money, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money goes into the estate.  That is one thing. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Separately, there is a distribution of all 

   

 

 

 

 

of the assets in the estate, including the proceeds of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the settlement.  And that is done in Chapter 11 through 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a Chapter 11 plan. 

 

 

 

            

 

So Congress would not have specified that 

 

 

 

 

 

priority applies to settlements, because settlements are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not a means for distribution of estate assets. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There can --

  

 

 

 

MS. SPINELLI:  Only the plan does that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There can be a dismissal. 

   

  

 

 

 

There are three things.  Two are covered, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

Chapter 7 and Chapter 11.  But this is a dismissal, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

12 

which means, as I understand it, you -- you return to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the preexisting situation. 

 

 

            

            

MS. SPINELLI:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But -- but now you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

saying the -- there are assets, and the Court has to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something about the distribution of those assets. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  Correct -- correct, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg.  The -- there are -- there are two methods for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distributing estate assets contemplated by the corporate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, either a Chapter 11 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan or the Chapter 7 distribution set out in Section 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

726, both of which require adherence to priority. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

A case can also be dismissed.  In that case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is no distribution of estate assets at all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's not contemplated in conjunction with a dismissal. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Rather, the parties are returned to their prebankruptcy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

positions, and the bankruptcy --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the -- but the Code 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

does say, 349, "unless the Court, for cause, orders 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise."  Can you tell us how -- how that is -- what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- what was the likely purpose for that?  Because --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. SPINELLI:  Justice Kennedy, what the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- from the very literal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

standpoint, it does cover what the Respondents' position

is -- is -- is here.  Why is it inapplicable and why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- does it fall in face of the overall description 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you just gave to Justice Ginsburg? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  Justice Kennedy, what the 

  

 

 

 

 

legislative history tells us is that the "for cause" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision in Section 349(b) was intended to protect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties who took actions in reliance on the bankruptcy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I think it's important to look --

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

example? 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you give me an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. SPINELLI:  I can.  So one case that's 

    

  

 

 

 

 

cited in our briefs is In re Wiese, which is a Seventh 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit case.  In that case, there was a plan that had 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been confirmed that -- in which the debtors released 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their claim against the bank that had lent them money in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

return for the bank's releasing its lien on some cash 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they had.  That cash was then disbursed and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't be gotten back. 

 

 

 

            

The debtors then dismissed their case 

 

 

 

 

 

shortly after the plan was confirmed, and the Seventh 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit said this was an appropriate case in which to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use the "for cause" provision.  Typically, the release 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that occurred in the plan would be undone, but in order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to avoid unfairness to the bank, which had taken --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which had taken action in reliance on the plan, the

Court was not going to do that.  Instead, it was going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

to hold the debtors to their release. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well -- well, if -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fairness is -- is the -- the -- the basis for the for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause order, the Respondent will say, well, this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fair, because most creditors were paid, so whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- you can hear the arguments. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  I --

    

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, we just talk about 

    

 

 

 

 

 

fairness.  That's -- that's -- that's different from the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

careful answer you gave to Justice Ginsburg a -- about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the prior scheme. 

 

 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  Yes, Justice Kennedy. 

  

 

 

 

Section 349(b) doesn't create that kind of gaping hole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the scheme I just described.  It's important to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

understand what it actually does.  I think it's a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

relatively limited provision. 

 

 

            

So Section 349 says that -- that the default 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when a bankruptcy case is dismissed is that certain 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

transactions that occurred during the case, such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

avoidance actions, get unwound, liens that have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voided are reinstated, and property remaining in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estate is returned to its prebankruptcy owner.  In other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words, the bankruptcy is undone as far as possible. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The cause exception is an exception to that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

So what the cause exception permits a bankruptcy court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do is to maintain the status quo at the time of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissal when there is good reason to do so.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

typical good reason would be reliance by a party on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that happened during the bankruptcy case.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section --

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Go ahead. 

  

 

 

 

MS. SPINELLI:  But Section 349(b) doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

then permit the court to go beyond that and do something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's not contemplated in conjunction with a dismissal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

at all, but doesn't involve maintaining the status quo, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but involves actually distributing assets to creditors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in violation of the priority scheme. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You -- you said that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that reading was supported in the legislative history, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if I understood you correctly.  What -- what is the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

nature of that legislative history? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  The legislative history 

  

 

 

 

essentially -- there's not a lot of it, but what it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially says is the bankruptcy courts should use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that provision, the cause provision --

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, I -- where 

    

   

 

 

 

is that?  In -- in the -- in the -- a Senate Report? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Thank you. 

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  May I ask, Ms. Spinelli, 

   

  

 

 

 

just quickly:  What's the scope of the holding that you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would like us to issue? 

 

 

 

 

              

I suppose this comes back to Justice Alito's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of what's actually on the table. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. SPINELLI:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  All settlements?  All 

  

  

 

 

structured dismissals?  Just this particular kind?  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

if just this particular kind, how would you characterize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it? 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  What we think this Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

should hold is that settlement proceeds cannot be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distributed in violation of priority.  I mean, a --

    

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So a settlement that is a --

   

   

  

 

 

 

a -- that -- that distributes protest -- proceeds. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  Correct.  But it -- to be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

more specific, the -- the order that was entered here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe, would -- could never be lawful, regardless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the stage of the case at which it was entered. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So we are not saying this order would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only -- this order is only unlawful because it was part 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a structured dismissal.  We are saying it's unlawful

because it took estate assets and distributed them in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of priority. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  You're saying that -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there can never be a distribution of estate assets 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

except in compliance with the priorities? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. SPINELLI:  No.  There is one --

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  One which -- that's not what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you just said? 

 

 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  That -- well, let me -- let 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me qualify what I just said, then. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

There is one express exception in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

code -- that's Section 510 -- provides that claims can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be subordinated to other claims under the principles of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable subordination, which, as this Court said in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Noland, are limited to a creditor's bad behavior that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

harms the estate. 

 

 

            

There are also some practices that occur in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy court that -- whose validity I don't think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court needs to reach.  For instance, critical 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

vendor orders are an example.  Courts will sometimes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

permit, on the first day of a case, a debtor to pay 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain vendors on account of their prepetition claims, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because doing so is necessary to the debtors maintaining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a going concern and reorganizing and coming out the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other end a viable business.  That's based on a doctrine 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

18 

that goes back many, many years before the Bankruptcy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Code called the Doctrine of Necessity.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasoning behind that is because a going concern is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

worth so much more than the debtor's assets liquidated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

piecemeal.  That creates the possibility of a greater 

   

  

 

 

 

 

recovery for creditors higher up the priority chain. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What happened here is precisely the 

 

 

 

 

 

opposite.  There was no possibility of reorganization. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

This was a naked priority violation for its own sake, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and whatever one thinks about critical vendor orders, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what happened here, taking value from senior creditors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and giving it to junior creditors for its own sake, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not permitted. 

 

            

            

May I reserve?  Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You don't even have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the extraordinary circumstances exception? 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  No, we don't -- I mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

basically, the extraordinary circumstances exception 

 

 

 

 

that the Third Circuit wanted to apply would bring in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any case that is administratively insolvent, and that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a large proportion of business bankruptcies. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That kind of exception also gives parties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the wrong incentive to make essentially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self-serving assertions about what they would or would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not do if the particular disposition that they desire is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not approved. 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You'd presumably qualify 

  

 

 

 

that with the statutory provision that was just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned, and my guess was you want to qualify that as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well with the -- with this emergency creditor, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where you're going to sink the -- the person who has a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prepetition was just discussed. 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, the prepetition 

  

 

 

 

distributions that were just discussed, I think that --

Alderson Reporting Company

that does present a separate question that we think --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  All right.  All --

  

  

  

 

 

 

that's all I wanted to know.  You don't want a holding 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

here that is going to knock that out. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Right, but -- so I said 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that a -- a court could not resolve a case by ordering 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

the distribution of assets that would violate their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

priority scheme. 

 

            

Now, in our view, "the priority scheme" is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of a broad term that includes both equitable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

subordination law, subordination principles, which are 

 

 

 

 

 

not applicable here, and also includes the ability of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the priority claimholder to consent to impairment of its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights. 

              

I think it's important to keep in mind here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the priority claimholders here, Petitioners did not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settle.  This is not a case where the people whose 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights were impaired agreed to it, and you can't have --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can't call a settlement basically the agreement of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

other parties whose rights were not impaired and who, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, benefited from the impairment of the Petitioners' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What would be your principal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

basis for distinguishing the exception that Ms. Spinelli 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outlined at the end of her argument from what happened

here? 

21 

              

I thought your argument was that the 

 

 

 

 

 

priority scheme applies to everything that happens in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter 7 and a Chapter 11. 

   

   

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.  So in our view, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

prepetition distributions in Chapter 11 that violate the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

priority scheme are not permissible under any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances unless there is consent of the impaired 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

priority claimholder.  And so critical vendor orders, if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are done over the objection of the -- of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claimholder who skipped, we think those are not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permissible. 

            

Now, most of the time those sort of first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order distributions happen in a plane of reorganization, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

not in a plane of -- in a case of reorganization, not a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liquidation case.  They happen with the consent of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

senior claimholders, and they are generally premised on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- on a prediction that -- that allowing that kind of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distribution will ultimately result in every creditor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting more money at the end of the day.  So none of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those factors apply here. 

 

 

 

            

You didn't have consent.  This is not an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ongoing concern, and there is certainly no finding that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody is going to get more money at the end of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day.

ahead. 

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Ms. Harrington --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If --

  

 

 

22 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, if I could just -- go 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Please. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  There is another logically 

  

 

 

 

 

prior question.  And I don't know what you -- what do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you think we should do with the question of whether the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy court has to approve settlements at all? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  We think that --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  There is nothing in the Code 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that says that they have to. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  So we think that -- that a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy court does have to approve a settlement that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

disposes of a claim held by the estate or asserted 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against the estate.  We don't think this Court needs to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reach that question in this case if it doesn't want to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because we think it's very clear that a -- what a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settlement cannot do is provide for the distribution of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estate assets. 

 

              

I think it's important to remember, State 

 

 

 

 

 

assets don't belong to the debtor, and they don't belong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to a subset of creditors.  They belong to the estate. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

And so the Code provides only specific ways that those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assets can be distributed.  In Chapter 11, that's

through a plan. 

   

23 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Just to make sure I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

understand the scope of what you're saying we should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide:  Would that also knock out the thing that was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approved in Iridium itself? 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes, we think it would.  If 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

you limit your holding to the resolution of the case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then it would not, because Iridium did not involve the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolution of the case. 

 

 

 

            

We think the principle applies more broadly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to prepetition and distributions as well, when you don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have consent.  But if the course -- if the Court prefers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not to, it doesn't need to reach that question in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you don't agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

completely with Judge Scirica's dissent? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  We don't.  I mean, I would 

    

   

  

 

 

point out, again, that he is a -- he is a dissenter in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case, and so he -- even he didn't think that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case would -- would qualify, but we -- we don't think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is anything in the -- in the Code that would allow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties to override the priority claimholders' assertion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of their rights. 

 

 

            

Now, it's important to keep in mind that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter 11 is very -- is very flexible.  It allows

basically any type of plan to be confirmed if all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

parties can agree on the terms of a plan.  That was the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

innovation in Chapter 11 in 1978.  It didn't exist in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Bankruptcy Act, and I think that sort of clearly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expresses Congress' intent that parties, if they can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come to an agreement that deviates from sort of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

usual course, then they should do it and that that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that agreement should be memorialized in a plan, not in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some other disposition. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you tell me, just as a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter of practice, of practice and experience, do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

priority creditors in a settlement, structured 

   

 

 

 

settlement agreements, often allow junior creditors 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to receive something? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, they often do in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

plans.  In -- in our -- in our experience, when there is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a structured dismissal like the kind at issue here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

usually those -- the parties turn to that kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disposition, because they can't obtain the consent of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the parties that they would need to get a plan 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confirmed.  And so basically what you have is an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement that is, in essence, an unconfirmable plan. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And instead of trying to get that confirmed, they call 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it a structured dismissal to override the consent of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

priority claimholders.

And so in those cases, no, but -- but -- but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think priority claimholders all the time agree to an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impairment of their rights, and, in fact, the priority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claimholders, other than Petitioners who were paid in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case, agreed to take, you know, some cents on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollar like the tax claimholders and -- and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative expenses. 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you believe that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question presented here did not address the issue before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us?  Do you see a difference between the question 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

presented that talked about the absolute priority rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as it relates to settlement proceeds and the "structured 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissal" here. 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  I don't think so.  I think 

    

    

 

 

 

the -- the change in wording was meant to sort of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give -- give the particular context that -- that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question arises in this case.  And if any -- if there is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any difference, it's just a narrower sort of set of what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the law --

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I -- I -- it goes 

   

   

  

 

 

 

to a more fundamental question, which is, is there a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference or in our ruling whether we say no settlement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeds can be distributed in violation of the absolute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

priority rule from a statement that no dismissal, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

structured dismissal, can be entered in violation of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

absolute priority rule. 

 

 

26 

            

            

difference. 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  I think the --

    

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I do think there is a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, I think the -- your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

first formulation is a little bit broader than the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

second formulation.  And then, like I said, we think the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule would apply also to preplanned -- preplanned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispositions of estate assets. 

 

 

 

            

If you wanted to limit your holding just to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of the resolution of a case in a way that is kind 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a substitute for a plan, then I think you could just 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

say a structured dismissal can't authorize the 

   

 

 

 

 

distribution of estate assets. 

 

 

 

            

But I'd like to, again, sort of distinguish 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the settlement of the claim from the distribution of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estate assets.  The two things were put together in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, and they are put together throughout Respondents' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief.  But they are really separate things.  There's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

nothing in the Code that would authorize a debtor or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some subset of creditors to distribute estate assets. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They don't get -- they don't have any say in how estate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assets are distributed.  The Code and Congress have the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say in that.

27 

a -- a settlement if it can't be carried out?  I mean, 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you -- you're saying one thing is the settlement, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's okay.  And the other thing is the distribution of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the assets, but that's what the settlement provides for. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, what the settlement 

  

 

 

 

 

should provide for is basically a liquidation of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  And so if you have a claim by the estate against 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a third party, here a creditor, you basically reduce 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that claim to a dollar amount, and those dollars become 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property of the estate. 

 

 

 

            

If you have a settlement of a claim that's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

asserted by a creditor against the estate, then it's the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same kind of thing:  You sort of liquidate the claim, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you reduce it to a dollar amount, and that becomes the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim against the estate held by the creditor.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing in the Code would authorize -- and I think it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- it would be a violation of the priority system and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally of the system that distributes estate assets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to have parties agree on the side of how estate assets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be distributed.  Those estate assets are not the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property of the debtor once the bankruptcy starts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They're not the property of the creditors.  And so you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really need to look to the Code provisions to see how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estate assets should be distributed.  In --

argument that your argument regarding Section 103(a) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes the provisions that specifically make the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

priorities applicable in Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 

   

 

 

 

 

 

superfluous? 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, it doesn't, because 

  

 

 

 

 

if you look at those provisions, and one of them is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 1129(a)(9), and then it's Section, I think, 726 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Chapter 7, they don't just say Section 507 priority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scheme applies.  They also specify exceptions, and they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

specify the manner in which it applies. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so in Section 1129(a)(9), it says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

priority claimholders can agree to an impairment of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their rights.  That exception is not included in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 7 -- in the -- in the Chapter 7 analog.  It also 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says -- tells you what it means to pay a priority 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claimholder either through cash or through deferred cash 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payments.  Depending on the type of 507 claim, the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the parties have a right to demand one or the other. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And so there is more to it than just saying, oh, Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

507 applies.  It tells you how it applies and in what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances. 

            

provisions? 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So those are just exception

MS. HARRINGTON:  Exception, but it also sort 

  

 

 

 

 

 

29 

of tells you what it means to fully -- in -- in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter 11 context, it tells you what it means to pay a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

priority claimholder.  And so some priority 

  

 

 

 

 

claimholders, I guess, can demand cash on the date of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confirmation; others have to agree in some circumstances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to deferred cash payments.  And so there is definitely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more content to. 

 

 

            

In the Chapter 7 context, it also tells you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which type of 507 claims are allowed based on when the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

associated proof of claim was filed.  So those -- in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both cases, they kind of -- they add more substance than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Respondents would have you believe. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

I'd just like to point out that Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacted the priority scheme precisely to prohibit the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of collusive looking agreements that happened here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where you have high-priority and low-priority creditors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of squeezing out the middle creditors.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court should not allow parties to make an end run around 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that prohibition by just scrapping the main settlement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or -- or structured dismissal on what is really, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essence, an unconfirmable plan. 

 

 

 

            

We think that's what happened here.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

parties -- some of the parties reached an agreement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The agreement couldn't be confirmed as a plan because it

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Petitioners say that the bankruptcy court 

 

 

 

 

 

here was required to reject the settlement that made all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other unsecured creditors better off without making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners any worse off.  Nothing in the Code requires 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that result. 

 

            

The absolute priority rule, and this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical, applies in Chapter 11 only to plans --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You took away -- you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

took away a legal right from them. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, Your Honor --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They had a legal right 

   

  

 

 

 

to sue Sun Life.  They had a legal right to pursue their 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other claims.  And the settlement extinguished those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

rights. 

            

MR. LANDAU:  And I think the question -- the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

critical question here is, are we in a -- in a place

where the disposition of estate assets was required to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comply with the absolute priority rule?  This is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31 

absolute gist of the case. 

 

 

 

 

            

By its terms -- I think this goes back to a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question that Justice Kagan asked earlier -- the Code 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speaks to when the absolute priority rule applies in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter 11, and it applies to plans.  Whenever you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispositions of assets before plans, they are subject to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicial review.  The use, sale, and lease of -- of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assets is subject to judicial review under Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

363(b), but that is a discretionary standard. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Now, in applying the discretionary standard, 

 

 

 

 

 

it's absolutely critical to make sure that there is no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evasion of requirements for -- for a plan.  And -- and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Second Circuit in Iridium and the Third Circuit here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize that and said, this is the rare case where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's true.  But I think the --

   

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't know why this is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

a rare case. 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, it --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, every structured 

    

 

 

 

settlement of this kind is trying to exclude one set of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditors. 

            

MR. LANDAU:  No.  It -- it's a --

   

  

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And this is exactly what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

this did, and it did it in collusion among the senior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

and junior creditors to the exclusion of the disfavored 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor. 

            

MR. LANDAU:  If, in fact, you were to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

concede -- start saying, well, this is the person who's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wearing the white hat, this is the person who's wearing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the black hat --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not -- I'm not --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  It can't --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm just trying --

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well -- I don't -- yeah. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- to figure out what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

creates the exception. 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  The narrow legal issue before 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this Court is simply:  Looking at the Code, does the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolute priority rule as such apply outside the context 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of plans? 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You -- you were beginning 

  

 

 

 

 

 

your first statement -- if you remember, you were just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about to give us a special reason, which I wanted to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

hear. 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Oh.  Well -- well, the -- these 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners received a substantial distribution of 

   

 

 

 

assets on -- on -- on the first day of the bankruptcy, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as -- to pay for their prefiling -- their prepetition

wage-and-benefits claims.  They got millions of dollars; 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in fact, far more than the settlement.  So this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why -- it's no accident --

 

 

 

 

 

33 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't see what this has 

    

 

 

 

 

 

to do with that.  But my problem is quite simple.  What 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was -- this is not your asset --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- that's -- this is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is an asset of the estate? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So there is an 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

asset of an estate. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's a claim against a 

   

  

 

 

 

third party. 

 

            

            

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Very well. 

  

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And now there is a person, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

probably the trustee or a committee, that's going to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursue that claim. 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Then the claim is settled. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  Correct.

when you're in Chapter 11, doesn't the judge, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy judge, have to approve that settlement? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

            

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Not the settlement, per se. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No?  Why not? 

  

  

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  Because there's no provision in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the Code -- this is what we explained in our brief --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that specific -- it's post-1978.  There used to be -- in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the pre- 1978 world, there was a prevision that required 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review of settlements qua settlements. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

Post-'78, there is a provision, 363(b) --

   

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Ah. 

  

 

MR. LANDAU:  -- that requires judicial 

  

 

 

 

 

review of use, sale, or lease of assets.  In this case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they intersect, because this settlement actually not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only brought money into the estate, but actually then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But suppose they had 

  

 

 

 

 

settled it for a dollar, and one of the creditors says, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is all corrupt.  I'm not saying they did in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  But, I mean, wouldn't -- wouldn't -- there's an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

asset of the estate.  They bring a lawsuit.  They reach 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

a settlement.  Suppose it's a totally crooked 

   

  

 

 

 

settlement. 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor, the --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What happens? 

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Again, this is a Code case, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Your Honor.  And there's no --

  

 

 

 

 

35 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not talking about this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case.  I just want the background in my mind. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right.  I think the --

    

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  There is no power of the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the bankruptcy judge to even look at a settlement 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the company in bankruptcy has made of an asset; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

namely, the claim that he has against another party. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

governing --

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  There is no provision 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 

  

 

MR. LANDAU:  -- settlements qua settlements. 

  

 

 

 

 

What there is a provision -- and I want to make this 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very clear, Your Honor, because I'm not sure this was as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear in our brief as it should have been, and I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apologize if it wasn't. 

 

 

 

            

The fact that there's no provision for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approving settlements qua settlements doesn't mean --

 

 

 

 

 

 

which there had been under the old regime -- doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean that when you have a settlement that actually 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

disposes of estate assets, like this settlement did, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that disposition of estate assets is not subject to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the traditional Rule 363(b) review by the Court of any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use, sale, or lease.

MR. LANDAU:  I just wanted to make it clear. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  In that place, once we are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in that place --

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- what we have is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

settlement, not corrupt, not crooked, perfectly fine and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

honest and so forth, but what it does is it takes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and it says, what we'd like to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do is 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, what that seems to do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is it seems to be quite contrary to the order of -- of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

battle or the order of distribution that Congress has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said should apply to the assets of the estate --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  And --

MR. LANDAU:  And you are absolutely right. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

And -- and as the Second Circuit said in -- in Iridium, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and as the Third Circuit said in this case, that is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most important concern in the 363(b) discretionary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis, to make sure that there is no evasion of that

scheme. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, so -- right.  Now, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

you provide a case.  Congress has said 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estate asset. 

 

37 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You have an estate asset, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and you want to do -- I exaggerate -- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right.  Well --

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So where does the 

  

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy trustee or any court get the power to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that a group of people can, in fact, reverse the order 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in which these assets will be distributed? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  This is --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That is -- that is what is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bothering me, and presumably the government, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly the workers here, who are -- who are upset 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about it. 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Correct.  Well, Your Honor, and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

I think the -- the -- the clear answer to that is, as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general rule, they can't.  But this case explains 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly why Iridium said there may be some rare 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions, because once you are in this more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretionary 363(b) land, the -- the priority scheme is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to be the most important. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This case is a great example, Your Honor, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

38 

because in this case we have findings that there could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be no confirmable Chapter 11 plan because the estate was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administratively insolvent. 

 

            

So the Code system that you just described, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the waterfall of priorities, would not apply in Chapter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 because there was no way to go to a Chapter 11 plan. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but I'm sure it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

often happens that there can be no confirmable plan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the creditors -- priority creditors are not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to concede.  So that happens all the time when you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go through Chapter 7. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right.  And that --

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that's not a rare --

   

  

 

 

 

 

so this is not a rare case. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  But I'm -- this is only the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first prong, Your Honor.  Then the Court also analyzed, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, the alternative, then, is conversion to Chapter 7, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and we have findings there, too, that any conversion to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a Chapter 7 liquidation, in fact, the estate asset --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there would be no settlement there, because at that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point, once you've gone through the expense and delay of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

converting to Chapter 7, it wouldn't make sense to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settle.  That's -- there's many reasons that you might 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to -- be willing to settle at the beginning of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, but --

39 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but this seems --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but the essence of the case is not really an objection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to approval of the settlement; it's the objection of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distribution of the assets. 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Absolutely.  And that's -- I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

think that's so critical, Your Honor, and -- and their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection would actually completely come back to bite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them because there is no legal difference between a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distribution of assets on the first day where they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recovered $6 million in this case in their prepetition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wage and benefit claims. 

 

 

 

            

That's why, to go back to Justice Alito's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question earlier, it was not a slip of the pen that led 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them to change their question presented from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question -- from the petition to the merits brief.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know perfectly well that a rule that the absolute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

priority rule applies to every distribution of assets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have creamed the workers in this case and would in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

future cases, because such workers are often the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiaries of these first day orders that pay -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay wage and benefit claims, that pay critical vendor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

orders. 

            

Once you're talking about a world, as they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

seem to be suggesting, that all preplan distributions of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assets are subject to the absolute priority rule --

that's not in the Code.  That's the gist -- that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crux of the dispute here.  That was a circuit split that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

this Court granted cert to -- to resolve. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought they -- I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

thought they had a priority at the initial stage that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required them to be paid the $6 million that you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about. 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  They were not.  There were 

  

  

 

 

 

 

people above them in the chain.  There were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative creditors.  There were secure -- they did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not have the top priority at that point, and that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not subject to the priority system. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But they had the priority 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ahead of the unsecured general creditors that did get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$1.7 million.  What they are saying is that under the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

priorities, that belonged to us, not creditors who were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower down. 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Correct.  And I think that 

   

  

  

 

 

there was -- that there was a finding here that, in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, the alternative to this settlement was not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settlement where they actually would have -- was not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter 11 plan because they would have recovered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing in a Chapter 11 plan because there could have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been no Chapter 11 plan.  It was not confirmable. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And in conversion to Chapter 7, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

41 

wouldn't have gotten anything either, because all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money would have gone to the secured creditor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But that's -- I see that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

point, which you've made several times, is a very good 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point.  I -- clarify a basic misunderstanding on my 

    

   

 

 

 

 

part.  What's a structured settlement? 

   

  

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, I think a structured 

   

   

  

 

settlement is -- it's not a legal term.  It's something 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they've come up with in this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

settlement? 

            

in that --

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not just call it a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  I think you could.  And I think 

    

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Let's call it a settlement. 

   

  

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  Perfect. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So now a company finds, 

   

  

 

 

 

very surprisingly, that there, underneath the building, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is Jean LaFitte's gold treasure. 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  See?  But there is somebody 

  

  

 

 

 

 

down there who has it.  He says, give it to me; it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ours.  He says, I'll give it to you, but I want you to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use it to pay my friend who happens to be my cousin, who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the 19th ranked creditor. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right.

JUSTICE BREYER:  And as long as you give the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

majority to him, okay, then you can give the rest to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

others. 

            

All right.  Now, that would seem to be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility at least from your argument in this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor, I think what you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

are saying or the -- the point that you're getting to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can be resolved through the traditional 363(b) analysis, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which allows for play in the joints, unlike their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unyielding and absolute -- absolute priority rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Under you're hypothetical, Your Honor, there 

 

 

 

 

 

would be money there.  And in that case, it looks like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that would be an evasion of -- there could be a plan 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  By the way, if you want me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to, I will make up my hypothetical so that giving half 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the gold to this person is just as wonderful as you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would like, and I will also change the hypothetical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

around, if you could do or I could do, so that not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving the money to this person would be just terrible. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  The Earth will come to an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

end.  So the question is, do you think Congress gave to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the trustee or to you or to somebody else the power to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deviate with Jean LaFitte's gold or with these

particular -- this particular set of money or any other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set of money? 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  I think --

    

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It seems to me a dangerous 

   

  

 

 

 

 

principle to get into, but if you can tell me or that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

normally happens, I'm open to --

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, it -- it -- it doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

normally happen.  I think that is the lesson of Iridium 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and this case.  The Third Circuit said as a general 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter, if -- if the creditors were to come together and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, you know, we really just don't like this one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor, even though that person has a high priority. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're going to structure this so that that person gets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disfavored. 

            

Well, under the 363(b) analysis, if that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person would have actually have had an alternative where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they recovered something --

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Let me ask you --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  -- that would be a problem. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- Mr. Ernest, sort of a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

similar question.  You -- here's two different kinds of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy schemes.  One scheme just says every time you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distribute assets, you have to follow the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order:  one, two, three, four, five. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's -- and that's it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

44 

You just have to follow that order. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's one Bankruptcy Code. 

  

 

 

 

 

Here's another Bankruptcy Code:  It says 

  

 

 

 

 

presumptively, you have to follow one, two, three, four, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

five, but if there is a Pareto-superior solution, in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

other words, a solution in which some people are made 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

off and nobody -- in which some people are -- get better 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outcomes and nobody gets a worse outcome --

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Yep. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- if there is such a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

solution, you can go with that.  And that might be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely sensible bankruptcy provision --

 

 

 

 

            

            

enacted. 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- for Congress to have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The question is whether 

  

 

 

 

 

Congress did enact it and what you can point to in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bankruptcy Code that suggests that the continual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement that it's just one, two, three, four, five is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to a kind of equitable exception for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Pareto-superior outcomes. 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Yes.  I can -- I can exactly

answer that question.  The line that Congress drew in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Code is the absolute priority rule with its -- with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its specific one, two, three, four, five that apply as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter of law and is unyielding, applies to plans.  When 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you are not in the world of plans, you are in the world 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of 363(b), which has play in the joints.  And so the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pareto optimality that you just said, Your Honor, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that is appropriate in a 363(b) analysis. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, as the Second Circuit pointed out in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Iridium and the Third Circuit pointed out here, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical consideration in that discretionary analysis is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to make sure it is not being done for the purpose of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evading what would otherwise be something that could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceed to the stage where Congress made the absolute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

priority rule applicable. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But I don't understand 

   

  

 

 

how you get to an extraordinary circumstance in that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this situation.  It seems to me that wanting to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclude the claims of one or more creditors is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary situation.  Every junior creditor wants money. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

They're happy to exclude anybody they can --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- or anybody who will 

  

 

 

 

 

 

concede to doing it. 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how do you protect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

46 

the excluded creditor from being preyed on by one of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other creditors?  We already know the junior creditors 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a self-interest. 

   

            

            

have --

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Absolutely, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The senior creditors 

  

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It happens to be one of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the biggest senior creditors here is the one who was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insisting upon excluding the junior creditor. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So where do we go?  How 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

do we defined "extraordinary"? 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  In that 363(b) world, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor, that governs the use, sale and lease of assets, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when a court looks at that, a court can say, is the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor who is claiming that he or she or it is being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unfairly squeezed out, in your hypothetical, can show 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there is some mechanism under which that person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would otherwise, absent the settlement or the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disposition of assets that is -- is contemplated at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue before the Court, would actually make off better. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The critical problem here is that there were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

findings -- there was a hearing in the bankruptcy court

on this.  It went up to the district court in review and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then to the Third Circuit.  And there were findings. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The findings were -- and these were critical -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

there could have been no proceeding to a Chapter 11 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confirmation.  So the idea that this would have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeded to a place where the -- the person squeezed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out in your hypothetical would have actually recovered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something in Chapter 11 --

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Landau --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  -- is counterfactual. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, you might be right 

    

 

 

 

 

 

or you might be wrong about that.  Let's just assume 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you are right, that -- that this is one of these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraordinary circumstances in which some people can be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made better off and nobody will be made worse off. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Still the question is, where is the authorization for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that in the Bankruptcy Code?  Because that's like a big 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle.  I mean -- and I think we would have known 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about it if that's the way bankruptcy proceedings were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed to go.  And -- and you suggest while it's in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this "for cause" language, but this "for cause" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language, I mean, this is a pretty specific provision 

   

   

 

 

 

 

that we're talking about. 

 

 

 

            

What it says is that when you can't reach a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan and the case has to be dismissed, this is attached

to a provision that says everything has to be rolled 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

back. 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and this says, well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not -- you know, maybe, if there is a good reason, not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything has to be --

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- rolled back to exactly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the way it was. 

 

 

 

            

But that's a really different kind of 

   

 

 

 

 

provision than saying, in courts, you get to decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or -- or -- or parties, really, you get to decide, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then courts get to -- get to approve an outcome of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy proceeding that does not follow the usual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

priority rules just because these particular parties, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not all of them, but these particular parties think it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will make some people better off without making other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

peoples worse off. 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, the key point is 363(b). 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

That is the general provision that requires bankruptcy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts to review the use, sale, or lease of assets. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

When you have -- what -- what they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objecting to here in this settlement is the fact not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only that it brings money in, but that it actually then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distributes money to different people in a way that they

say doesn't comply with the absolute priority rule.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's the 363(b) discretion.  That is the standard about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

best interests of the estate.  It's been phrased various 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways; that -- that's really a judicial gloss in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language of the statute, and that's probably -- you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, the absolute contours of 363(b) are not really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within the question presented here. 

 

 

 

 

            

The question presented here really is:  Are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we in a world where there is any discretion at all, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

versus a world where the absolute priority rule applies 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

by its terms? 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, this 363(b) -- is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there -- I mean, this -- you would -- they say -- you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just saying they did it the wrong way when they reached 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the settlement; then this -- the -- the Petitioners here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should have gone to the bankruptcy judge and said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Judge, you know, there is an odd thing about this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settlement.  They're not only paying in $3 million or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever, but they want to tell you how to distribute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it. 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  And they --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And they want to tell you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

how to distribute it, and we want you to distribute it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

according to the rules, and not according to what they

That's what you say they should have done. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  Well, that's what they did do, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and exactly what they --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, if that's what they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

did do, what's the problem? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Yes -- no, but they --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And then you're saying they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have discretion there. 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Yes.

they have discretion --

 

 

 

            

            

I got it.

from the priorities as set by Congress? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Exactly.  What I'm saying is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that the -- you know --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Over the objection of one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of the creditors. 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  The basic dispute before this

rule apply to distributions of plan assets -- of -- of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estate assets, excuse me -- before a plan?  They say

It -- you -- distribution of estate assets,

a critical vendor order, is all subject --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, well, once -- then I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

back with Justice Kagan.  I'm pretty worried about that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision. 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well -- but --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And the reason I'm worried 

  

 

 

 

 

 

about it is -- and you'll be worried about it, all you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to do is represent some client or represent some --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a bank, for example, that thinks it has secured --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinks it has a secured interest in something, and lo 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and behold, there is a $40 billion settlement, and they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make it conditional that the money go to the widows and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

orphans --

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Okay, but -- but --

MR. LANDAU:  Discretion doesn't mean win. 

  

 

 

 

 

52 

And -- and I think the Second Circuit in Iridium and the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Third Circuit in this case were very, very clear that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the most important consideration for a court to look at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in -- in assessing a distribution of assets that doesn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comfort with the priority rule is:  Is there a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compelling reason why it doesn't?  We --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's, I think, 

   

  

 

 

 

where the -- the -- the issue comes down.  I mean, the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonableness of your position is directly related to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how extraordinary the extraordinary circumstances have 

 

 

 

 

 

to be. 

 

              

I mean, you're -- you're -- you're 

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting that the main criteria in approving under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

363(b) is pretty much what the priorities are under --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under Chapter 11. 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, if there is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

very close requirement there, then, you know, what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're asking for is not that extraordinary. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  It isn't -- I just --

   

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If, however -- well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

if, however, that -- it -- it's -- that priority simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

informs the exercise of discretion by the judge under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

363(b) and is not as tight a requirement, well, then,

it's -- you know, then it is pretty extraordinary. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And -- and it -- it makes a difference. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Under -- under the -- the Chapter 11 regime, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people's leverage in negotiating the plan depends to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some extent on their priorities.  Under the -- the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the settlement regime, it's, you know, the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leverage is reshuffled, and it's more or less who can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gang up on who but who else. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

line --

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right.  But Congress drew a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Could 

  

  

 

 

 

you answer my concerns? 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Just -- Congress drew a line 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that the absolute priority rule as such applies to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plans.  When you're talking about distributions of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

assets other than plans, you're in that discretionary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regime. 

            

That -- the question presented to this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the petition is the dispute between AWECO on the one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Iridium on the other, which is, is it -- is it the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolute priority rule that governs preplan 

 

 

 

 

 

distributions, or is it this discretionary regime? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

One can, in other cases, work on the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- and so you can resolve this case by simply saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are wrong to say the absolute priority rule applies

The extent to which you get into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise of discretion is something that they didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present in the question presented.  They didn't say the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Third Circuit erred --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right, but if we are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned about --

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  -- in applying the 

  

 

 

 

 

discretionary Iridium standard. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If -- if we are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned about how extraordinary the extraordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances are -- in other words, your position looks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more reasonable the tighter the extraordinariness 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement is -- what -- what type of language would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you require -- I mean, you're saying, oh, well, just say 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can do this and then it will work out over time how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraordinary it is. 

 

 

            

But what would you say if you want -- if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

felt an obligation to tighten the extraordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement? 

            

MR. LANDAU:  I don't think I could improve 

    

   

 

 

 

on the language that the Second Circuit used in Iridium 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the Third Circuit used here, saying that it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the most important consideration is conformity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the absolute priority rule.  So that if there is a

confirmable plan that is -- is -- that -- that where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 

person complaining that they were cut out would actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get something in the absolute prior -- through the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application of the absolute priority rule, that would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

almost implausible to think that it could ever be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approved. 

            

The -- the fundamental problem --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But then doesn't that run 

  

 

 

 

 

 

into -- this is what Ms. Harrington ended her remarks by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying, is that you're just saying the plans that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bankruptcy Code declare not confirmable are, in fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to be confirmed through this alternative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure? 

            

MR. LANDAU:  No, Your Honor.  Again, the --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

now we are talking about the means for terminating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter 11 plans, which is a little bit different than 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the question presented, which is all about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distribution of assets.  But just -- just to be clear, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so Section 1112 of the Code says that if a -- if Chapter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 plan can't be confirmed, you have two alternatives. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You either go to Chapter 7 conversion or to dismissal. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter -- there are specific findings here that Chapter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 conversion made no sense because the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trustee would -- the -- the estate did not have the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money to pursue the claim on its own and nobody would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

56 

bring this case on a contingency basis. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Now, the -- the -- the Petitioners here were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participating at that hearing in the bankruptcy court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where this was done.  They didn't raise their hands and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, hey, we'd be willing to pursue this on a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contingency basis, which is why it's somewhat 

 

 

 

 

 

 

farfetched, to say the least, that they're now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting that theoretically well, they -- they were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deprived of this opportunity to pursue this claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside of bankruptcy.  They were given the opportunity 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to pursue the claim on behalf of the estate in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy, and nobody wanted to do that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Landau, is there a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

difference, in your mind, because there might be in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mine, between a settlement that settles an individual 

   

 

 

 

 

 

claim, the emergency creditor claim that your -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your opponent spoke about, where there is not a total 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distribution of the assets of the company, from a plan 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's really just an alternative plan, because that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what this structured settlement was? 

 

 

 

 

            

In my mind, something that would be an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraordinary circumstance --

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- would be something 

  

 

 

 

 

that did something like the first thing, and not

necessarily the second. 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  I think Your Honor is making a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

very important point, which is, the application of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

363(b) discretion may well vary depending on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances of the case and, just -- and your first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical, maybe -- you know that -- that -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- now we are talking about, you know, the way that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that 363(b) analysis applies, and it may apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently --

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So would you tell --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  -- on the first day of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy versus the last day of the bankruptcy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- me why Sun Life --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sun Life cared? 

 

 

            

If it got its settlement -- i.e., it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to pay $2 million and get all the claims against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it released -- what was its reason for not wanting the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeds to be distributed according to the absolute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

priority rule? 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  It wanted a global settlement 

   

  

 

 

 

of all claims and they got that with all other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditors.  The -- the -- the creditors -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners here refused to settle their WARN claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that their -- those are their claims outside the context 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this claim get settled, for less than a hundred cents 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

on the dollar.  So they were -- they were holdouts, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially, refusing to join the global settlement of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I'm -- I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Does this mean that the junior creditors wouldn't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreed to this settlement because the senior creditors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could have?  What did the senior creditors, who were in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line -- in line care about how much was left over to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

junior creditors, including Sun Life? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, I think that the point is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that Sun would not have entered into the settlement at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all unless -- which -- which benefited all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditors, including the junior creditors --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But why? 

  

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  Why --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why does it care? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  Why does Sun?  Well, for --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why does Sun Life care? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  In the absence of a global 

   

  

 

 

 

 

settlement of this WARN claim outside of the -- against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sun, Sun didn't want to have a settlement that -- that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

funded the litigation against it.  Now, it --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, the settlement would 

  

 

 

 

 

have been the one that occurred.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If it --

  

 

 

 

59 

MR. LANDAU:  There's two different claims. 

  

 

 

 

 

The claim that was settled was the estate's fraudulent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conveyance claim.  These particular Petitioners had a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

separate WARN claim against Sun and the debtor.  And it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was -- in the context of settling the fraudulent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conveyance claim against the estate, Sun only wanted to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a global settlement to put this whole litigation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

behind it.  And they said, we're not going to settle the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraudulent conveyance claim in a way that funds 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the prepetition --

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So do you think they can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

still sue you for those fraudulent conveyance claims? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Not for the fraudulent --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Not you; Sun Life. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  Not -- they can certainly sue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the -- they can certainly pursue their WARN 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims, and they did.  That was their choice not to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participate in the settlement --

 

 

 

 

            

claim? 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The fraudulent-transfer 

  

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  No.  The fraudulent-transfer 

  

  

 

 

claim was ended.  But I think the key point, there are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

findings here that the fraudulent-transfer claim was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially worthless to them, because there was no

money to pursue it, and --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You don't understand. 

  

 

 

 

My basic question was --

 

 

 

 

60 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- what did Sun Life 

  

 

 

 

 

 

care if the fraudulent conveyance claim was going to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolved and released? 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Because --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why did it care to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

exclude these truck drivers from receiving whatever they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demanded? 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Because that would have funded 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the truck drivers to pursue their separate WARN claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against us.  So we didn't want them --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that eventually --

  

 

 

 

 

you had already --

 

 

 

            

            

that. 

            

MR. LANDAU:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Sun Life had already won 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  No.  We only won later. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

That -- it's -- it's the timing of that, I think, Your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor, that really gets to the point. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think the fundamental point here is we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really talking about a rule where they're saying the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolute priority rule in flexibly and invariably

applies even before a plan. 

   

 

 

            

Our position, on the other hand, is that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use/sale of assets at any point before the plan is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governed by 363(b).  There are -- that's a discretionary 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

regime.  And as the Second Circuit said in Iridium and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Third Circuit said here, it is absolutely critical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to look at making sure that it's not an evasion of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan. 

            

But -- but -- but the question that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court was asked to resolve is, is it the -- the rigid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and unyielding absolute priority rule or the 363(b)? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the Code answers this question.  And -- and so I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think in this case that the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What the Code in 363(b) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

says is the trustee can sell a suit.  Okay?  That's what 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it says.  It says nothing about --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Yes, but --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It says nothing about what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the terms are.  It says nothing about what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settlement is.  And the question for us, I guess, is, in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those words, which make no reference to it --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  But --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- can you settle it on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms that will, in fact, take these assets that belong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the company and distribute them in a way that is

contrary to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  But -- but the distribution is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a use of the estate assets, Your Honor.  So again, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goes to, can you -- what are the constraints on using 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the estate assets? 

 

 

            

And I -- I really encourage you to look at 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

the very tight way in which the Second Circuit in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Iridium said, we want to be super careful in this.  To 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say we want to be super careful is not to say -- is just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to say that the Fifth Circuit overstated it by saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can never do it.  In other words, the Fifth Circuit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has an absolute bright-line rule.  We don't care how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pareto-optimal --

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Right. 

  

 

MR. LANDAU:  -- this is. 

  

 

 

 

And I think the basic point was made by the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy court here.  The Bankruptcy Code is not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suicide pact.  So if, in fact, you have a situation 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the settlement or -- and the distribution proposed

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI 

 

 

 

 

63 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SPINELLI:  Respondents' position fails 

  

 

 

 

because Section 363(b) is not a means of distributing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

estate assets.  The -- the 363(b) discretion that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Landau referred to is discretion to approve a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settlement or a sale of an estate asset, not to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distribute the settlement or sale proceeds in violation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of priority. 

 

            

Assets are distributed under Chapter 11 

 

 

 

 

 

through a Chapter 11 plan.  That's it.  And our 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

fundamental point here is that those assets cannot be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distributed on account of prepetition claims in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of priority. 

 

 

            

To the extent there is a potential exception 

   

 

 

 

 

 

for the Doctrine of Necessity, that's hotly disputed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Courts disagree about whether that exception exists. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And that's not an issue this Court needs to resolve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the Doctrine of Necessity, by its nature, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designed for situations in which a payment to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

prepetition creditors is necessary to the reorganization 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the debtor.  There is no dispute that that wasn't the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case here.  And as for our first-day order paying the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wages of the drivers, that was consented to, and no one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is saying that you're not allowed to consent to a

priority violation. 

 

64 

            

The only point we are making about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structured dismissals is that there is no superpower 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

associated with structured dismissals that provides for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an exception to that general rule that one cannot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distribute estate property on account of prepetition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims in violation of priority. 

 

 

 

 

            

Respondents' rule would wreak havoc on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basic process of bankruptcy.  If debtors could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

distribute estate property to creditors at any time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without regard to the priority scheme before a plan, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there wouldn't be much left of the scheme.  Debtors 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could simply reach a deal with junior creditors and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

distribute property leaving inadequate resources to pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

senior creditors. 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The case is submitted. 

 

 

 

(Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
