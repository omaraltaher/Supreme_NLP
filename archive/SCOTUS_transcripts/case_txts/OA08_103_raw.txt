 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-103, Elsevier v. Muchnick.

 (11:07 a.m.)

 Mr. Sims.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. SIMS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. SIMS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Second Circuit's decision vacating for 

lack of jurisdiction a settlement agreement that 
compensated authors for all their arguably infringed 
works in the face of Congress's direction that Federal 
district courts shall have jurisdiction over any civil 
action arising under copyright is wrong for three 
reasons.  First, even -- first, the decision is 
incorrect under the unanimous holding three years ago in 
Arbaugh that where Congress affords unqualified subject 
matter jurisdiction, other statutory provisions argued 
to be jurisdictional that do not clearly restrict that 
jurisdiction won't be deemed to do so.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This is a lot harder 

case than Arbaugh, though.  Arbaugh involved the 
definition of an employer and then the scope of the 
statute.  This one says no suit shall be instituted.

MR. SIMS:  Well, Arbaugh relied heavily on 

the Zipes case, and the Zipes involved a statutory 
threshold condition much like the one here.  You 
couldn't bring a Title VII action unless you filed a 
particular kind of piece of paper with the EEOC.  And 
Zipes and Arbaugh both held that those statutory 
conditions or essential ingredients were not 
jurisdictional, and the Court relied, heavily I think, 
on the fact that jurisdiction was separately provided 
for and the provisions at issue weren't.

 The second point I want to make is that, 

even putting the clear statement rule of Arbaugh to one 
side, statutory text, structure, purpose and history all 
point to classifying 411(a) as mandatory but not 
jurisdictional.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think you are 

right that Arbaugh at least set forth a clear statement 
rule, but I think that's significant only going forward. 
I don't know that Congress, when it passed this 
provision, could have been aware of the clear statement 
rule that Arbaugh articulated.

 MR. SIMS:  Well, the Court did apply --

reiterate and apply the Arbaugh rule in the Rockwell 
case with respect to a provision that had predated 
Arbaugh, and nothing in Arbaugh said that.

But in any event, our second point is that 
if you look at the traditional indicia of not only text 
but also structure, history and purpose, this provision 
should be ranked as mandatory but not jurisdictional.

 And the third point I want to get to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you agree with the --

with the government that it's mandatory for the district 
court but prohibited to the court of appeals?  The 
government has this hybrid where, because of the public 
purposes served by registration, not only can but the 
district court should raise the failure to register on 
its own, but then the government says once you have a 
final judgment in district court, it's no longer open 
for the court of appeals to raise it on its own.

 Do you agree with that or do you say it's 

for the defendants to raise, and if they don't raise it, 
too bad?

 MR. SIMS:  Justice Ginsburg, we certainly 
agree with the government with respect to the court of 
appeals.  With respect to the district court, on the one 
hand, my clients don't -- are satisfied with the 
government's position.  On the other hand, as Justice 
Scalia's decision, I think, in Day v. McDonough pointed 
out, the traditional default rule really is that 
defenses are up to defendants to raise.

In this particular kind of situation where 

there is no reason at all, I think, to suspect that 
defense counsel will not raise 411 whenever -- none of 
the cases that Ms. Merritt raises for example, involve 
situations of waiver, where the issues weren't raised 
until the court of appeals -- I think that the Court can 
rely, frankly, on defendants and on the ability of 
district judges to nudge defense counsel when they need 
nudging.

 But if the Court felt that the provision was 
important enough so that it wanted to impose on district 
courts the obligation of strict policing, I think it 
could.  But as I say, I have been practicing copyright 
law for 25 years; I've never seen a defendant who either 
missed a defense or chose not to raise it.

 The third point I want to raise if there is 

time is simply that, even if 411(a) were deemed 
jurisdictional at the outset of the case with respect to 
its language which talks about instituting, nothing in 
either its text or purpose suggests that Congress meant 
to deprive district courts of their usual power to 
settle cases with respect to approving settlement 
agreements.

 In this case, because the plaintiffs 

complied with 411(a) at the front door by alleging

properly that they had complied with the obligation, we 
think the district court had jurisdiction to send the 
parties to mediation and then necessarily to approve the 
agreement they returned with three years later.  Now 
with respect to --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can -- can I ask you, one 

of the points made by the amicus is that, if I recall it 
correctly, that what -- what Congress had in mind in 
phrasing it this way was to enable -- enable the party 
who had not gone to the Copyright Office to go after 
dismissal on jurisdictional grounds, and the implication 
is that if it were not held to be jurisdictional, there 
would be a merits dismissal because of the failure to 
have gone to the Copyright Office first.  And therefore 
would not -- the plaintiff would not be able to come 
back to the court.

 MR. SIMS:  I don't understand the amicus to 

be making that argument.  If Your Honor is referring 
to --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't --
MR. SIMS:  -- the third -- the third 
sentence of 411(a), I think that's the principal 
argument she makes as to why this satisfies Arbaugh and 
we think, quite to the contrary, the third sentence of 
411(a) --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I didn't -- I didn't 

think it related to the third sentence.  I -- I thought 
she said the whole purpose of Congress was to make sure 
that you'd be able to come back, that your failure to go 
to the Copyright Office initially would not result in a 
merits dismissal so that you could not later go back and 
then rebring the suit.  If it was jurisdictional, just a 
jurisdictional dismissal, the jurisdiction could be 
cured by going to the Copyright Office and your suit 
could then proceed.

 MR. SIMS:  Your Honor, I think that the --
because of the way 411(a) is phrased, dismissals under 
411(a), whether we are correct that it's not 
jurisdictional or whether they are correct that it is, I 
think ordinarily --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You would be --
MR. SIMS:  -- without prejudice --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You'd be able to come back 

anyway?

 MR. SIMS:  Absolutely.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what I thought.
 MR. SIMS:  That's the nature of this 

requirement.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what I thought you'd 

say.

MR. SIMS:  Yeah.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yeah.
 MR. SIMS:  With respect to the Arbaugh --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would -- if the statute of 

limitations had run, could you still come back?

 MR. SIMS:  The problem in this case, and 

really the reason why the settlement agreement has 
turned out the way it did is there is no effective --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, not -- not 

necessarily in this case, but in -- but in a typical 
case.

 MR. SIMS:  There is no effective statute of 

limitations in these cases, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I said in a typical case.
 MR. SIMS:  Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or is it just --
MR. SIMS:  In -- in a case where the 

infringement is the existence of something on the web, 
then there is no statute of limitations effectively, 
because the argument would be that the making available 
is an infringement.

 We don't think that the last sentence of 

411(a) satisfies Arbaugh or indeed is -- is any evidence 
toward this being jurisdictional.  The last sentence was 
inserted, as the history makes perfectly clear, to solve

the problem created by the Vacheron decision that the 
Second Circuit had decided in 1958.  And in that case, 
what justice -- Judge Hand had done, and other courts 
have done it, too, is to say it is -- district courts 
cannot review the registrar's action in denying 
registration, and that has to be done in a separate 
mandamus action, at that point in Washington, D.C.

 So the lesson simply is Congress's way of 

saying very clearly:  We want to get rid of that 
rigamarole and we want to allow all this to be done 
efficiently.  But the statement that this could be done 
even if the registrant didn't show up is not at all any 
statement, much less a clear statement, that this was 
intended to be jurisdictional.  Now --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Sims, it has been 

pointed out that you have taken inconsistent positions. 
That is, back in the district court before there was a 
settlement, you urged before the district court that 
411(a) was a jurisdictional bar and that that precluded 
certifying a class that included the non-registered 
copyright holders.  You did make that argument in the 
district court, and now you are saying -- you are 
confessing error, that was wrong?

 MR. SIMS:  Your Honor, I don't think it's 
fair to say that we made that argument.  We did -- we

did issue, we did say that sentence in one or two 
places, and the argument --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The argument --
MR. SIMS:  But I think it's -- I think it's 
different, because the issue in the district court was 
the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the 
settlement and there was an attack on the different 
valuation for unregistered claims.  In that context we 
relied on 411(a).  The argument would have been exactly 
the same had we said, as we should have, that 411(a) is 
mandatory but not jurisdictional.  We were guilty of 
exactly the loose language that this Court was guilty of 
in Robinson and Smith, as it pointed out in Eberhart or 
Kontrick.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and --
MR. SIMS:  But as -- but as the Court 
decision in that case said, there was no need to 
overrule Robinson or Smith because really what was going 
on there was the Court had been saying the rule was 
mandatory, and the additional language that was 
jurisdictional was loose language.

 Our argument never focused on the ranking of 

411(a).  It was always rooted in the existence of the 
rule which did justify, and on the merits of the appeal 
back in the Second Circuit we will again argue did

justify, a different valuation of the claim.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you shouldn't use 
loose language, especially when it's the same loose 
language, supposedly, that seems to have been used by 
all the courts of appeals and all the district courts.

 MR. SIMS:  Not all the courts --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  For years and years.
 MR. SIMS:  Your Honor, the first court of 
appeals which said that 411(a) said -- not held -- was 
jurisdictional was in 1990.  That's well after the 1976 
act, and the original act had been -- I mean, the 1909 
act, which it was patterned after, had been nearly 
100 years earlier.  There was no court of appeals that 
ever said that the 1909 act was jurisdictional, and when 
this Court had that case in the Washingtonian case in 
the 1930s, there was no reference to it being 
jurisdictional by either the majority or the dissent. 
And I think Washingtonian is particularly interesting 
because there the district court had originally held 
that it was jurisdictional and then sua sponte recanted 
a few days later and issued another position.  And that 
is in the record of this Court in Washingtonian and it 
was pointed out by Professor Ben Kaplan in the report to 
the register and to Congress in connection with the 1976 
act.

So the issue was raised for people to think 
about if anybody had.  But Congress did not in 1976 or 
at any time earlier say that this was intended to be 
jurisdictional or was jurisdictional.  So if -- if 
passing the Arbaugh argument with respect to text, 
structure, history and purpose -- the structure I think 
is particularly telling, because in this case the 
provision of jurisdiction is in Title 28, the provision 
of registration is in the Copyright Act.  They've been 
separated --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But still it's a statute 

and didn't this Court say in Bowles that a statutory 
qualification on the right to sue is generally 
jurisdictional?

 MR. SIMS:  I don't think the Court said 

that.  I think that the Court said that in Bowles with 
respect to time limits for appeal.  I think Bowles is 
quite clearly limited to time limits for appeal, and the 
Court's decision rested on -- heavily on stare decisis. 
With respect to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I thought they made a 
distinction to distinguish the other cases, the one -- I 
forgot -- the one involving Criminal Rule 33, on the 
ground, well, that's a court rule, but when Congress 
makes the qualification then it's jurisdictional.

MR. SIMS:  But this doesn't involve a time 

limit.  This involves, as Arbaugh and Zipes did, 
ingredients of the claim, preconditions to the claim, 
threshold steps with respect to the claim, and I think 
there is no reason for the Arbaugh approach not to 
apply.  But in any event the structure is telling here; 
the language is telling as well.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if you are 
talking about the language, what about John R. Sand & 
Gravel?  That said we held it was jurisdictional when 
the statute said:  "Suits shall be barred."  The 
language here is "No suit shall be instituted."  That 
sounds pretty close.

 MR. SIMS:  I think not, Chief Justice 

Roberts.  The language here has been used in copyright 
statutes in 1831, as our reply brief points out, and 
includes the language for statutes of limitation and for 
copyright notice.  And all of those have always been 
deemed mandatory.  None of them has been deemed 
jurisdictional.

 Again, Section 507 of the Copyright Act, the 

statute of limitations provision here, has almost 
exactly the same language as in 411.  John R. Sand I 
think the Court treated as in Bowles --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, that was -- that

was a statute of limitations provision, right?  It shall 
be barred after six years?

 MR. SIMS:  Well, John R. Sand involved a 
special situation of suits against the government and 
considerations of sovereign immunity.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought the Court said 
it was mandatory.  I don't remember when they used the 
word "jurisdictional."

 MR. SIMS:  Well, I think John R. Sand held 

that provision was jurisdictional, but I think the 
decision went off on -- on stare decisis, and the fact 
that the Court had, with respect to the Tucker Act and 
matters of suits against the government, taken a 
different position.

 Those, I think, are really the only 

carve-outs, the statutory time limits for appeal and 
suits against the government, from the general Arbaugh 
rule.

 So here Congress has used this language 

repeatedly.  This Court's own forms for copyright 
infringement, which were first promulgated in the 1930s, 
have patterned our argument and are contrary to the 
amicuses'.  They have always treated the registration 
provision of the model complaint differently from the 
jurisdictional provisions.  Those are in separate

sections, not next to each other even.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We have forms for 

copyright infringement actions?

 MR. SIMS:  You do.  The Federal Rule --
(Laughter.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Live and learn.
 MR. SIMS:  And because they haven't changed 
very much in 70 years, you probably haven't spent much 
time with them.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It'S Form 19.
 MR. SIMS:  Yes.  It was originally Form 17. 
We have gone through the history.  But I think there is 
really only one change and in every respect it is 
identical to what it was in 1938.  And, again, as I say, 
it separates out the registration provision from the 
jurisdictional provision.

 If Congress had wanted to make registration 
jurisdictional, it would have been extraordinarily easy 
to do so.  All they would have had to add at the 
beginning of 411(a) is "notwithstanding anything in 1338 
and 1331."

 We have -- we have included in our brief as 
an appendix about 60-odd Federal statutes, which carved 
out jurisdiction otherwise provided by 1331 or other 
provisions, and 411(a) looks nothing like them.  They

all look, roughly, like each other.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Can I ask a sort of basic 

question I never understood about this case.  As I 
understand it, the end-of-the-line concern of the 
fairness of the settlement, and particularly to people 
who have copyrights who have never been registered.  Am 
I right, that that's what --

MR. SIMS:  Well, not -- not quite.  There 

were -- there were ten authors who objected, I mean, as 
a group, and they wanted more money for unregistered 
authors.  There were, needless to say, tens of thousands 
of other authors who didn't object, but it is true that 
the objectors wanted -- thought that they had gotten a 
bad deal.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But those were people who 

owned some registered copyrights, but had other works 
that were not -- had no registered copyrights.  Is that 
right?

 MR. SIMS:  I --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Were there any of those 

people who had no -- no copyrights at all?

 MR. SIMS:  Well, they -- I don't know, Your 
Honor, whether the objectors had any registered works. 
I know that the named plaintiffs had more unregistered 
works than registered works.

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But they had some 

registered works?

 MR. SIMS:  Yes.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  You see, one of the -- one 
of the risks involved here is whether people who had no 
registered works are being adequately protected by this 
Class C settlement.

 MR. SIMS:  Yes.  This is not a situation --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  And just to get the 

question on the table -- I don't want to take up much of 
your time.  I don't understand how it makes any 
difference whether you say the rule is mandatory or the 
rule is jurisdictional, in terms of the fairness of the 
settlement, at the end of the line.

 MR. SIMS:  I don't think that has anything 
to do with the fairness of the settlement.  I think we 
are here because the Second Circuit blew up the 
settlement and said we can't settle this case, and the 
only way it was settleable was to give the publishers 
and the databases complete peace by clearing all off of 
this off.

 And so --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that -- that, 

certainly, would be open.  If you are correct that the 
Second Circuit shouldn't have cut this off at the

threshold by saying it's jurisdictional, the question of 
the fairness of the settlement is what you were 
contending.

 MR. SIMS:  That is correct, Your Honor.
 I would like to reserve the balance of my 

time.  But the -- the adequacy and fairness of the 
settlement is back in the Second Circuit on remand.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Ms. Anders.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER ANDERS
 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MS. ANDERS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Statutory prerequisites to suit like Section 

411(a) often fall into one of two distinct categories. 
They are either jurisdictional and therefore unwaivable 
or they are not jurisdictional and are fully waivable. 
Section 411(a)'s registration requirement falls in the 
middle of those two extremes.

 It is not jurisdictional, but it should not 
be fully waivable.  The provision does not speak to the 
power of the courts to decide cases and therefore it 
does not limit the court's jurisdiction to adjudicate

infringement suits.

 But, because of this phrase and mandatory 
language, the requirement should be strictly enforced 
whenever the defendant asserts it, and because the 
requirement serves important public interest that are 
independent of the concerns of the parties to any 
individual suit --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So your position is that 

the district court really should have dismissed this 
case at the outset?

 MS. ANDERS:  I think that, in the ordinary 

case, the district court should -- when -- when the 
defendant waives the requirement, which would be the 
rare case, when the defendant doesn't assert it.  When 
the defendant waives the requirement, the district court 
should consider whether accepting that waiver would 
undermine the public interest behind 411.

 Now, in this particular case, it may not 

have been an abuse of discretion for the district court 
to consider those interests and decide that here it 
would have been acceptable to accept the defendant's 
waiver and permit the resolution to go forward because, 
in this case, the periodicals that -- that are 
involved -- the works at issue were primarily already in 
the possession of the Library of Congress, because they

had been registered as -- the periodicals themselves had 
been registered.

 So the Library's interest is not as strongly 

implicated here.  In addition, this is a case in which 
there was going to be settlement, so the Court wasn't 
going to need to adjudicate the copyright claims and 
therefore the opportunity for the register's views to be 
taken into account was less important.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Maybe this is the same 
question.  Are you representing the interest of the 
Library of Congress?

 MS. ANDERS:  Yes, we are representing the 

interest of the Library of Congress.

 So I think in this case it may have been 
appropriate for the district court to conclude that --
that it could let someone go forward, notwithstanding 
the fact that some unregistered copyrights were 
involved.

 But after adjudication on the merits, the 
defendant has waived the requirement, and, having come 
up, Section 411(a), like any other non-jurisdictional 
rule, should be subject to the general principle that 
issues that are not raised below should not be 
considered for the first time on appeal, absent 
extraordinary circumstances.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You were candid to say 
that this is in a hybrid category, that the government 
was taking an intermediate position.  Do you know of any 
other provision where the district court has an 
obligation to raise the question on its own motion that 
is yet not jurisdictional?

 MS. ANDERS:  I believe this Court has 

recognized that waiver doctrines in general are 
discretionary, and so, particularly in the area of res 
judicata, the Court has recognized in the Plaut v. 
Spendthrift Farm and Arizona v. California that the 
Court has some discretion to enforce res judicata on its 
own motion.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Very, very limited.  I 
think Arizona didn't say any time there's -- there's a 
preclusion plea, the Court can raise it on its own.

 MS. ANDERS:  That's correct.  I think also 

the plain error rule presupposes that there are some 
errors that the district court has a responsibility to 
correct on its own, even though neither party has 
brought the error to its attention.  So in other words, 
the district court has the obligation to issue a legal 
ruling that neither party has asked for, and I think 
that kind of regime is appropriate here because the 
public interest at issue, the Library's interest and the

interest in the public record of copyright, those don't 
depend on the defendant's litigation decisions -- they 
shouldn't depend on the defendant's particular strategic 
decisions within a particular case.

 The Library's interest will always be in 

having every work registered and the public interest and 
public record will be the same.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is your discussion 
of that, including in your response to Justice Ginsburg 
and in your brief, do you think that that's within the 
question presented, rephrased?

 MS. ANDERS:  I think it is fairly within the 
question of whether the rule is jurisdictional or not, I 
think, is -- also encompasses the question of how the 
rule should be enforced, assuming that it is 
non-jurisdictional, of what should happen in this case.

 So I do think that the -- the 

characterization of this rule as a mandatory or a 
waivable rule is -- is within the question presented. 
So I think that the regime we're proposing best gives 
effect to the mandatory, but non-jurisdictional language 
that Congress used in Section 411(a).

 And it also protects the public interest 

that the requirement serves, which, again, the 
compilation of a public record of copyrighted works in

the copyright office, which allows a robust licensing 
system under the Copyright Act.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But how -- how would we get 

to hold what -- what you say is the law?  It seems, to 
me, once we decide it's not jurisdictional and once we 
agree with you, that it doesn't -- at least in this 
case -- didn't have to be raised sua sponte by the 
district court.

 That's the end of the case, and so why do we 

have to engage in the further discussion, well, 
ordinarily, the district court must raise it on its 
own and -- you know, and, if it doesn't ordinarily --
you know, the appellate court should.

 Why do we have to get into that?
 MS. ANDERS:  I don't think you have to get 

into it, Justice Scalia.  I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which means we shouldn't.
 (Laughter.)
 MS. ANDERS:  Well, that may be the case, but 
I think we are simply trying to -- trying to explain to 
the Court what we think how the rule should be applied 
in the district court, in the -- in the ordinary case, 
and then, in the rare case, this one, where the 
defendant has waived, and permitting the settlement to 
go forward, it wouldn't adversely affect the public

interest that are normally in force here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you have an 

example of the non-ordinary case?  I mean, you seem to 
say, either -- I guess it's not always after judgment 
that it shouldn't be implemented, I guess.  But when 
wouldn't it be after judgment?

 MS. ANDERS:  I think that the -- that in 

general, the requirement would be considered waived if 
it's not raised before judgment.  We can't think of a 
case in which the extraordinary circumstance would be 
fulfilled.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it's more -- so 

it's more or less jurisdictional after judgment?

 MS. ANDERS:  No, I'm sorry.  What I meant to 

say was that I don't think this rule could ever be 
enforced, in the first instance, on appeal if it has 
been waived below.  I think the general civil rule for 
non-jurisdictional requirements is that if it's not 
raised before judgment, it's lost on appeal --
circumstances --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's normal, but 

not invariable.

 MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think that's the 

rule -- that's the rule that this Court has applied to 
constitutional rights with the plain error rule, and

also, with respect to structural constitutional rights 
that might implicate other public interests, the general 
rule is that if the requirement has not been raised 
during the -- during the trial stages of the case, then 
it can't be enforced for the first time on appeal.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Unless it is plain error.
 MS. ANDERS:  Unless it's plain error, and in 
this situation, if the plain error standard applied, or 
something even more -- even more heightened in the civil 
context, we can't think of a case in which registration 
requirements --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's pretty plain that the 

things haven't been registered.  I mean, right?  And 
it's pretty plain that if they hadn't been registered, 
the district court should not have proceeded with the 
case.  So I don't know why it wouldn't normally be plain 
error in -- in the court of appeals.

 MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think those -- those 
circumstances would be true in most cases in which the 
-- for some reason, the requirement hadn't been reached 
at the trial stage.  So I don't think that the 
extraordinary circumstance is present here that would 
justify overturning the independent interest in judgment 
that our legal system has, the finality of judgment, the 
rights of the parties in relying on that judgment and

the judicial resources expended.

 You know, I think in some ways we can think 
of this requirement as sort of like a filing fee, that 
it's -- it serves interests beyond those of the parties 
at the district court, and therefore you wouldn't think 
of it as waivable at the instance of the defendant.  But 
--

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There really are, in 

our recent decisions, it seems to me, two different 
lines of authority.  There is the Bowles and the John R. 
Sand and Gravel, which treats these sorts of things as 
jurisdictional, and the Arbaugh line that doesn't.  And 
it does seem to me that the language here, "No suit 
shall be instituted," sounds an awful lot like "suit 
shall be barred," or the other language in -- in Bowles.
 MS. ANDERS:  I think it's similar to a lot 

of language that's used in statutes of limitations, 
which are traditionally considered non-jurisdictional, 
that no statute -- no suit shall be instituted.

 I think what's important is that it speaks 

in terms of the actions of the parties, because the 
parties institute a suit, not the Court.  So it doesn't 
speak in terms of the power of the Court.  And there's 
no evidence, I don't think, that Congress intended to 
withdraw the broad grant to jurisdiction in 1331 and

1338.  I think Bowles and John R. Sand are cases in 
which the Court's own precedents had previously treated 
the rules at issue as jurisdictional, had accorded them 
jurisdictional consequences.  So those are cases in 
which the Court relied on stare decisis, but I don't 
think that we have any similar situation here.  There's 
no --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the 

congressional reaction to the Second Circuit's decision? 
It provided that the -- there was to be no 
jurisdictional bar in criminal matters.  Didn't -- it 
didn't affect jurisdiction in criminal matters, but it 
didn't say anything about civil matters.  So isn't that 
some kind of reflected acceptance that in some of the 
civil -- in civil cases, it would be jurisdictional?

 MS. ANDERS:  I don't think so.  I think, in 

enacting that, Congress had recognized that the 
incentives for registration should stay in place in the 
civil context, but that making an exception wouldn't --
wouldn't make a difference in the criminal context.

 I think Congress still spoke of it as a --
as a non-jurisdictional requirement in the legislative 
history, so I don't think that there is any indication 
that Congress has ratified the Second Circuit's decision 
here.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEBORAH JONES MERRITT

 AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT

 OF THE JUDGEMENT BELOW

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  Mr. Chief Justice and 

may it please the Court:

 We will start with the statutory language as 

the Court has been discussing for the last half-hour.
 Section 411(a) appears on page 1 of the 

Petitioner's brief.  It uses, first, the mandatory word 
"shall" in commanding that no action shall be 
instituted.

 It does not contain a limitations period, as 
statutes of limitations do.  It simply says, "No action 
shall be instituted."  No waiver --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  "Until."  That's a 

limitation period.

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  Until?
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Until preregistration or 

registration has been made.

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  That's correct, Justice 

Scalia, and that makes --

period.

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  That makes -- it's a --

it's a requirement that registration be made.  It is 
quite analogous, although stronger than the statute in 
the Hallstrom case.  The hybrid argument that the 
Solicitor General was referring to is the Court's 
decision in the Hallstrom case, which was a provision of 
the environmental statutes that is common in several of 
those statutes providing:  No action may be commenced 
until a notice is filed.

 Our provision here is stronger.  It says: 
"No action shall be instituted," instead of "No action 
may be commenced."  Even if this case is not -- even if 
this statute does not impose a jurisdictional limit, 
which I will strongly argue that it does, it at the very 
least imposes a mandatory command like the statute in 
Hallstrom.  And there is no reason in this case to 
reverse the Second Circuit, even if this is a mandatory 
provision.

 As you will recall, in Hallstrom, the 
parties had gone through four years of complicated 
environmental litigation.  Went up through the court of 
appeals.  The court of appeals reversed, saying, you did 
not comply with this notice provision.  This Court held 
that it did not need to decide whether that provision

was jurisdictional in the strictest sense of the term, 
because it was at least mandatory.  And the Court 
reversed despite that time, sent the case back.

 In fact, I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, you 
asked about whether the mandatory issue would be within 
the Court's grant of certiorari.  The grant of 
certiorari in Hallstrom referred to the jurisdictional 
issue and the Court decided that rather than get to the 
strict issue of jurisdiction, it would decide on a 
mandatory forum.

 But there is no reason, if we are -- if the 

Court wants to avoid the jurisdictional issue and to 
endorse the mandatory hybrid one, the Second Circuit 
should still be affirmed in this case.  The parties 
raised Section 411(a) quite clearly to the district 
court.  They used this provision as their major defense 
of both the substance of the settlement's fairness and 
the representation.  The representation was the major 
issue that the objectors raised in the district court. 
And so both parties, the Plaintiffs and the defendants, 
argued in their briefs -- and it's simply not a few 
sentences; we've provided the parts of the record in the 
appendix to our brief -- that the reason that this 
settlement should be upheld was because of this 
mandatory, they called it then, jurisdictional

provision.  That was an essential argument that they 
made to the district court and that they then repeated 
to the Second Circuit in the merits briefs long before 
the circuit said, then:  Wait a minute; you are making a 
curious argument here that this is a jurisdictional 
provision that upholds your settlement, but that we 
still have the ability to look at this settlement if 
it's jurisdictional.

 I would like to return to the language of 
Section 411(a).  As I have argued, it begins with this 
mandatory language, "No action shall be maintained."

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In -- aren't there 

statutes that have exhaustion requirements, or like the 
EEOC filing requirement, that say, you can't sue until 
you have gone to X administrative agency?  And those are 
not considered jurisdictional.

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  That's correct.  That's 
correct, Justice Ginsburg.  Many of those statutes refer 
specifically to exhaustion.  The Prison Litigation 
Reform Act, for example, that some of the parties cite, 
refers specifically to exhaustion of remedies after the 
"no action" sort of language.

 Every jurisdictional statute has its own 

language and its own story.  We could say they are like 
Tolstoy's unhappy families; they are all different.  And

in this case, the story of the Copyright Act and its 
language is very distinctive, both in the public 
purposes that it furthers and in the language that it 
uses.

 Again, on the statutory language, we have 

the very mandatory language, "no action shall be 
instituted."  No modifiers; there's no provision for 
waiver.  The Solicitor General's assistant mentioned 
that this statute is like fee waivers.  It's not at all 
like a fee waiver, because the statute for fee waivers 
explicitly gives the district judge authority to waive 
the fee in the case of an in forma pauperis plaintiff. 
This statute contains no waiver for the parties.  It 
contains no discretion for the district judge.

 And in the last word of -- the last sentence 

of this very short three-sentence provision, Congress 
referred explicitly to jurisdiction.  And I would like 
to look very closely at that word, because any plain 
reading of this section will show -- shows that Congress 
intended the entire provision to refer to the 
jurisdiction of the court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that -- that 
last sentence is just relating to the court can -- has 
authority to decide this particular issue, 
copyrightability, even though the registrant has chosen

not to enter the suit.  The sentence simply says, court, 
you have authority to decide this question.

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  That's the most 

immediate reference, Justice Ginsburg, but the three 
sentences work together.  And if we look at the three 
sentences, they appear on the first page of the 
Petitioner's brief.  The first sentence creates two 
categories of cases:  Those that the Court may decide 
and those it may not.  Let us say for now we are not 
meaning what that power is.  We are simply saying two 
categories of cases, one the court may decide, the other 
one it may not.

 The second sentence then adds a small group 
of cases to this first category, the one that the court 
may decide.  As opposing counsel mentioned, Congress did 
that in response to a particular case, the Vacheron 
case.  Vacheron itself was built on a line of cases 
holding that the previous section like 411(a) was a 
jurisdictional limit.

 The reason that courts could not consider a 

copy -- an application for -- a petition for 
infringement complaint, I'm sorry, from a person who had 
not yet gotten registration was because they construed 
that predecessor as jurisdictional and therefore, they 
had no jurisdiction to hear an infringement claim until

this person instituted a mandamus suit and got the 
certificate from the registrant.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would have thought 

that cut against you in the sense that the same 
paragraph Congress used the word "jurisdiction," but 
they didn't use that in the provision that you are 
arguing, does deprive the court of jurisdiction.

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  No, Mr. Chief Justice, 
because when Congress revised this statute in 1976, it 
had before it 60 years already of courts construing its 
language, no action shall be maintained, which was the 
previous 1909 language as a jurisdictional limit.  There 
had not been any resistance to that notion.

 Even courts as early as the 1920s in the 

Lumiere case, the Second Circuit did not hold there was 
"jurisdiction," but it held that this provision was 
unwaiverable.  What the parties want to do here, of 
course, is to waive the provision.

 So the language was working quite nicely for 
Congress.  No action shall be maintained, they switched 
it to instituted to make clear that they meant at the 
beginning of the action.  There had been a few parties 
who had argued during the early 20th century that if 
they snuck in the door, they could remain inside -- or 
I'm sorry, once they got inside, they could file the --

certificate, and the courts rejected that, but Congress 
cleared up that particular problem.

 So Congress knows that its first sentence is 

working quite well.  Congress then adds this second 
sentence to -- these, of course, are people working with 
the Copyright Office, experts in the area of copyright 
law.  Congress adds the second sentence which adds the 
small category of cases to the ones that may come before 
the court.  And then in the final sentence, Congress 
gives a clarification about that final group of cases.
 As Justice Ginsburg said, the -- Congress 

made clear that when the registrar decides not to appear 
in these cases, the Court may still go on and has the 
power to decide these cases.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's not -- it's not 

a very big deal to register your copyright, right?

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  It is not at all a big 
deal, Your Honor.  In fact, for freelance writers one 
may register an entire year's worth of work on a single 
form for $65.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And -- but -- but 

doesn't that mean that it would be odd to make 
jurisdiction over an action for infringement hinge on 
whether you've, you know, dotted an "I" and crossed a 
"T"?

MS. JONES MERRITT:  Not at all, Your Honor, 

because again, the copyright statute has a different 
history than other jurisdictional statutes.  Before 
1909, owners of copyright had to dot every "I" and cross 
every "T" within a limited period of time.  If they 
didn't, they lost their entire ownership in the 
copyright.

 What Congress wanted to do in 1909 was to 

give copyright owners a longer period of time to comply 
with some of these formalities.  But, it still wanted to 
preserve the public interest that registration serves.

 We haven't talked yet about the major public 

interest that Congress had in mind here.  It is 
ironically the very problem that gave rise to this 
lawsuit, trying to find the owner's of copyrighted 
works.

 Before using a copyrighted work, any person 

needs to find the owner to ask permission.  The 
electronic databases in this case have argued that they 
are somehow special, that because they need to obtain 
many permissions, they shouldn't have to do it.

 Universities, libraries, archives obtain as 

many or more permissions as electronic databases in 
every year.  For large universities like Harvard 
University or the Ohio State University, we have to

obtain permissions for every article that is distributed 
in course packs to our students.

 If one of those articles is a freelance 

work, written by Mr. Muchnick, for example, we have to 
track him down and get his permission to use that 
article.

 So the registration system was Congress's 

response to this problem of finding the owners of 
copyright.  In this --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't it true, though, 
that -- that most copyright holders, most people who 
write articles, freelance articles, even if it's only 
$65, it's not -- it's not worth it because they really 
don't expect to get -- they don't think anybody is going 
to infringe, in the first place, and if they did what 
establishes to be, just wouldn't be economically 
worthwhile?  So I think it's a fact that most copyrights 
are not registered, isn't it?

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  The beauty, Your Honor, 
though, of the solution that Congress adopted with the 
registration, moving the registration to a 
jurisdictional element rather than to an element of the 
claim, as it was in the 19th century, is that the 
copyright owner may do this any time.  Copyright lasts, 
of course, for the lifetime of the owner plus another

70 years after death.  Sixty-nine years after my death, 
my heirs could register my copyright if they are finding 
that somebody is now making a lot of money off of my 
works.  And they could then bring an infringement suit 
against that person.

 It's odd to think of a jurisdictional 
restriction as being a looser element than a claim 
element, but in this particular story of copyright, it 
is.

 What Congress did was to say, we want people 

to own copyrights immediately without complying with 
formality.  And in 1976, Congress even extended that to 
unpublished works, so I already have a copyright of the 
notes I have in front of me and in the e-mails I print 
last night and so forth.

 What Congress said, with this huge sea of 

copyrighted works, before somebody can bring an 
infringement action in the Federal court, we want them 
to confer a public benefit.  We want them to register 
the copyright so that other people can find the owner 
and request permission.

 What will happen in this case under the 

terms of this settlement is that the defendant who did 
not take time to find the owners of these works, even 
though the owners of these works were easier to find

than many of the very elusive of works that archives and 
historical societies search for, they did not find --
look for the owners because they thought it would be too 
difficult.

 This settlement now gives the defendants a 
perpetual right to use all of those works without ever 
identifying the owners, and without the owners ever 
being identified on the national copyright register, 
which is what Congress wanted.

 If I want to create a competing database for 

any of the defendants, I have to undertake the arduous 
work of tracking down all the owners.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, there's some that 
can't be found.  So if we take your position, there's 
some that can't be found, we just can't create our 
database.

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  Justice Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, that's the problem 

that's underlying the fairness of this thing.

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  I'm --
JUSTICE BREYER:  In terms of if we take your 

approach, no matter how hard it is to find owners, you 
are just out of luck.  That is to say, there will not be 
databases collected, because they cannot be complete 
because we cannot find the owner.  If we take the

position that it is sometimes waiverable, that obstacle 
disappears and now it's a question of the fairness of 
the situation.

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  Justice Breyer, that 
concern exists for everybody, not just for electronic 
databases.  In fact, there is -- the copyright --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's right.  I just 

wonder why Congress would have ever wanted this kind of 
provision to serve as that kind of obstacle in any area.
 MS. JONES MERRITT:  Because Congress wants 

to protect the rights of copyright owners.  Congress has 
more than 200 years' experience balancing these two 
interests.  And, in fact, as we speak, Congress is 
considering orphan works legislation to address that 
specific issue.  What Congress has -- and that 
legislation would apply to all types of works, 
electronic databases, national archives, historical 
documentaries.

 And what Congress is proposing in that 

legislation is quite illustrative.  Congress says that 
if somebody makes a diligent search and cannot find the 
owner, then the person may use the work --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the underlying 
fairness.  There might be -- maybe they will win on 
that.  I don't know what the merits of that are.  But

certainly an absolute bar might sometimes help some 
copyright owners, but many times it will hurt them, 
because since they can't be found they can't be 
compensated.  And if we set up a system and put some 
money in it, so if they are ever found they will be 
compensated, that will help them.

 So that's why I ask the question, why would 
a Congress, that wants to help copyright owners create 
this kind of system?  When all the things you are 
talking about can be brought into play when we consider 
the fairness of the system.

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  This is a -- the system 
that Congress put in play is, Your Honor, one in which 
copyright owners have an absolute right to control the 
disposition of their works.  That is the current system, 
even without getting to the jurisdictional issue. 
Congress may change that disposition, and that is within 
Congress's control.  What they have been trying to do is 
to balance the interest of the copyright owner with the 
interest of the public in using works.  And that is the 
perennial challenge in copyright law, how to balance 
those two interests.

 Section 411(a) is actually a vital cog as 
part of that balance, because what Section 411(a) does 
is it says to the copyright owner don't worry about all

this business of registering or anything else, you have 
your copyright, and you will have it for your life plus 
70 years.  If it ever becomes important to you to bring 
a lawsuit, then you can register at that time, come into 
court.  It's a deal that Congress has offered to 
copyright owners in order to strike this particular 
balance between the public interest and the private 
interest.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do they -- if they are 

just suing, not for money but for an injunction, do they 
have to register before bringing an injunction suit?

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  Yes, Your Honor, they 
do.  In order to bring any action -- if the injunction 
is based on infringement.  So we're -- if the plaintiff 
brings an action for infringement and the remedy they 
seek is an injunction, then the copyright must be 
registered first.

 There are some cases in the lower courts in 
which we have a plaintiff who has a longstanding pattern 
of infringements that a particular defendant has been 
engaged in against that plaintiff.  The Owen Mills case 
is an example.  A local photography studio was upset 
because a photo duplicating shop kept copying their 
copyrighted photographs.  They entered an action for 
infringement, had registered several of the photographs.

The Court issued an injunction that covered future works 
as well, but those were all works within the same 
judicial controversy.  So an injunction could reach 
further than a single registered work as long as we are 
talking about one single controversy.

 In this case we don't have an injunction, we 

have damages, and we have thousands of different 
controversies.  As the Court knows the class action 
rules do not change the substantive law or the rules of 
-- of jurisdiction.  We have here thousands of different 
controversies that have been aggregated for convenience 
under rule 23(b)(3), but the court must have 
jurisdiction over each of those controversies.  Or if we 
take the alternative route of Hallstrom, the hybrid 
approach, and we say that this is a mandatory 
requirement.  Congress has been quite clear about this 
mandatory requirement, and that mandate must be 
satisfied with respect to every controversy in this 
class action.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask -- I just hate 

to reveal my ignorance on something like this, but I had 
the same problem with your opponent.  I really don't 
understand why it makes any difference whether you call 
a requirement mandatory or you call it jurisdictional in 
terms of the fairness of settlement, all the

considerations you are discussing.  It seems to me as a 
practical matter it doesn't seem to make any difference.
 MS. JONES MERRITT:  It depends on the brand 
of mandatory, Your Honor.  There are in this case three 
different proposals before the Court.  I, as appointed 
amicus I have argued that Section 411(a) is 
jurisdictional which I think the clear history and 
language of the statute, which I will still come back 
to --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But would you not make all 

the arguments directed at the fairness of the 
settlements and so forth if it were merely mandatory?
 MS. JONES MERRITT:  Yes, because then the 

two versions of mandatory are -- the flavor of mandatory 
that the Solicitor General urges is that the district --
this is very mandatory, as in Hallstrom -- even if a 
party doesn't raise the issue, the district court sua 
sponte should raise the issue on its own.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The -- so mingle -- rule. 

I think Ms. Anders answered that question.  In this 
situation it would be appropriate for the judge to 
accept the waiver.

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  That was -- that was 

what Ms. Anders argued.  I disagree with that, because 
the public interest that Congress has put forth here

would not be satisfied.  The parties in this case argue 
the same public interests that parties argue in every 
copyright case.  The plaintiffs in a copyright case 
always argue that their interest should be protected 
even if they haven't complied with Congress's mandates. 
The defendants in a copyright case always argue that 
allowing them to copy the plaintiffs' works would give 
the public greater access to those works.  There are no 
special public interests here.

 In fact, the electronic databases in this 

case have been superseded technologically.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If we -- if we are 

talking about the ordinary case, and someone sued for 
infringement apart from this settlement in the context 
that we are in, certainly it's not going to raise that 
question whether it's mandatory, optional or whatever. 
What defendant who is sued for infringement wouldn't 
say, judge, I'm relying on 411(a); they haven't 
registered their copyright; they can't sue me?  I can't 
imagine a defendant in an ordinary copyright case who 
wouldn't raise it.

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  Actually there are quite 

a number, Your Honor, just as there are defendants who 
will waive statutes of limitations.  There are times 
when a defendant would rather have the resolution on the

merits, because that then would not allow the plaintiff 
to come back into court and sue again.  Or the 
defendant -- the plaintiff in this case might have sued 
-- that you are referring to -- might have sued for 
infringement, and the defendant wants to make clear that 
it has the right to use this work.  That would then 
establish that principle with this plaintiff with 
related works or with other works.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then let's switch to the 

plaintiff.  If the plaintiff is in it for money, for 
real money, for damages, the plaintiff's going to 
register because then the stakes are such that $65 is 
well worth it, if the plaintiff thinks it can get a 
large infringement award.

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  The problem, Your Honor, 

is that there are many naive people who believe that 
famous movies and novels have infringed their freshman 
college essays.  There are cases exactly like that in 
the courts.  And in fact the case I cite in the brief is 
one in which the author sued the university, claiming 
that the department of English obviously had released 
his freshman essay to Hollywood, because this movie 
built upon his fresh man essay.

 In those cases, and this is another 

distinction, Justice Stevens, between mandatory and

jurisdictional, the defendant doesn't even have to 
appear.  The district court can sua sponte dismiss the 
complaint for lack of jurisdiction.  We cite I believe 
seven or eight cases in the brief where exactly that 
happened, including two different cases --

JUSTICE BREYER:  They wouldn't waive it 

then.  I mean, the problem, I take it, realistically is 
this:  let's take a group of people who want to make 
databases; now they want to use copyrighted material. 
There is a subset of people who have written it they 
can't find, so they say here's what we will do.  We will 
take $100 billion, and we will put it in a fund, and 
like ASCAP, that fund can administer this money for the 
benefit of anyone who turns up.

 Now, maybe that's illegal under some law. 

Maybe the class isn't right.  Maybe they can't get 
proper representation.  Maybe it's inadequate, et 
cetera.  But what I don't fail to see -- what I fail to 
see, is how -- whether you could do that or not do it 
has anything to do with registration, because we are 
talking about the people who aren't here, all of whom, 
if you ever bring suit when he's found, will register 
the copyright.  The only reason they haven't registered, 
we don't know who they are, that's why.  Maybe they have 
registered, for all we know.

MS. JONES MERRITT:  All of the people who 

haven't registered yet, Your Honor, will not be able to 
bring suit, because the class action will extinguish 
their claims.  That's the important --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe they can't do that 
because it would be an unfair result.  But where is it 
in this provision of law that's designed to stop that 
ever from happening?

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  This provision, if we go 

back to section --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe it won't, by the way.
 MS. JONES MERRITT:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  It depends on what the 

terms of the settlement are.  We could have a subclass 
that allows a subset of those people to come into court. 
No reason you couldn't.  So I don't know whether or not 
it's true that they won't register when they are found.

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  Justice Breyer, once 

again the Copyright Act itself already makes that choice 
that no person may -- and I'm not talking yet even about 
the jurisdictional provision -- no person may use 
another's copyrighted work without their permission.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  In 1909 Congress thought 

all this through with the databases and so forth?

 (Laughter.) 

49

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

MS. JONES MERRITT:  Oh, yes.  The database 
issue -- sometime -- sometimes -- in 1976, by the way, 
Congress did because LEXIS and Westlaw existed before 
1976.  The -- but the databases are a red herring here.

 Sometimes, technology is different, and, 

sometimes, it's not.  The Library of Congress recently 
did a project in which they sought 7,000 permissions for 
a single project because they were digitizing the 
letters of Hannah Arendt.

 They sought those permissions.  They -- if 

they could not get permission, if they couldn't find the 
author or if they didn't get an okay from the author, 
they had to leave the work off of the web site because 
they are following copyright law.

 They have a copy of the original work that 
was given to them or that they purchased, and they may 
display that, but, if they are going to make a copy of 
the work, then they have to comply by copyright law.

 I mentioned a moment ago that the databases 

here have been superseded by technology, and that is 
another way in which technology is not -- is not 
different in this case.  It is now possible for works to 
be scanned in photographic form or PDF form and put in 
to electronic databases that are fully searchable, and 
that does not violate copyright law.

If you compare, for example, law review 

articles on --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But why doesn't it?  Just 

out of curiosity.  You are making a --

MS. JONES MERRITT:  Because it is -- it is 
part of the original collection -- I'm sorry.  If the --
if the publisher of the collected work consents to that. 
I am thinking of this case in The New York Times --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you say if somebody 

who owns the copyright.

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  Yes.  But who owns --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  No.  No.  But what we 

want to do is we want to have, in our database, all of 
the material written about slavery, and, lo and behold, 
there are 4,000 books that we can't trace.  Who, now, 
owns the copyright 100 years later?  And there is no way 
to get those into our database.  Whether --

MS. JONES MERRITT:  That's correct.  That is 

correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, that's a 

sort of loss, and my same point, that maybe that's as it 
should be, but it's rather surprising that this law is 
the law that will answer that question.

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  This law relates to the 

question, Your Honor, because this law relates to the

access to the Court.

 The way it relates to the question is that 
what Congress was trying to do was to give people like 
you and me information about those copyright owners, so 
that we could find the owner of the book on slavery.
 And, as a way to maintain that register, 

which Congress started in 1790, it said, to the authors 
of copyrighted works, if you want to use our courts, the 
judicial powers of the United States, you need to confer 
this benefit, so that Justice Breyer could find you, if 
he wants to include your work in the database.  And that 
was the story that Congress did.

 I would like to say just one more word about 

the word "jurisdiction" in the third line of Section 
411(a) because we were interrupted there.  The parties 
have offered no convincing explanation for that word, 
other than to show that Congress understood this whole 
provision was jurisdictional.

 It refers, most immediately, to 

registrability, but that was not a new issue in 1976. 
Courts have always decided registrability.  And, as the 
rules of civil procedure make clear to us, a party's 
absence never deprives a court of subject matter 
jurisdiction.

wrong in Form 19, when they did not write 411(a) as 
jurisdictional.  They say copy the 1331, 1338, that is 
jurisdictional, and then they put the certificate 
requirement below the line -- below the jurisdictional 
line.

 So that was -- well, that was wrong, in your 

judgment.

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  As the -- as the 

Congress made -- I'm sorry, as the Court made clear, in 
issuing those forms, they are advisory only, and they 
are not -- they are not intended to give legal advice to 
counsel about what the issues in the case are.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I suppose, if you picked 

up any copyright complaint, you will see the 
jurisdictional allegation will say 1331, 1338, and 
nothing about 411.

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  And that is quite 

common, Your Honor, because, in many situations, what 
Congress has done is given a general grant of 
jurisdiction in 1331 or 1338 and then pulled it back for 
a subcategory of cases, which is what 411(a) does.

 In those circumstances, not just in 

copyright, but in all sorts of areas, the complaint will 
plead jurisdiction under the general grant and then may 
show that it satisfies the condition later.

This is -- we are not arguing that -- and 

the Second Circuit has not argued that 411(a) is a 
jurisdictional grant.  It is a section that takes back 
part of the jurisdictional grant in 1331 and 1338.

 Congress has more than 200 years' experience 
working with copyright law, as the questions today have 
revealed -- I'm sorry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Finish your 

sentence.

 MS. JONES MERRITT:  And the questions today 

have revealed striking the balance between the public 
and the private interest is a difficult one.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 MS. JONES MERRITT:  Thank you very much.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Sims, you have 

two minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. SIMS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. SIMS:  Thank you, Your Honor.
 I, first, want to correct the misimpression 

given that the databases think they are special.  The 
databases haven't thought they don't need to get 
permission.  They thought they had permission under 
Section 201(c), and this Court had the case and 
decided -- two of you believed we were right, and more

of you believed we were wrong, but the databases took no 
position that they had no obligation.

 They got the rights by contract from the 
publishers, with representations and warranties, and 
that's why, when this case was instituted, they went to 
mediation.  They resolved this in a way.  They got money 
from the publishers, who were exposed under 
representations and warranties.

 The authors were represented by the three 
major national freelance author groups in the country, 
and this was a way, we thought, to address this problem 
responsibly and without taking the Court's time.

 Now, Mr. Chief Justice Roberts, you said a 

couple of times that you wonder whether the language 
here, "No action shall be instituted," doesn't sound 
jurisdictional, and exactly to the contrary, the Court's 
decision of Jones v. Bock, which, I think -- if I am 
remembering, you authored, but, in any event, it was 
within a year or two, said that was boilerplate language 
used all the time for statutes of limitations that are 
not jurisdictional.  And, indeed, that is correct.

 In the footnote of our reply brief, we list 
three times in the 19th century when that very language 
was used for statutes of limitations.  And, if you put 
it into LEXIS or Westlaw, you will get a zillion

statutes with respect to -- exhaust nonjurisdictional 
statutes.

 So I think, quite to the contrary, that --

that is the language Congress uses when it wants 
something to be not jurisdictional.

 Now, Ms. Merritt began with the word 

"shall," in 411(a).  I want to be clear.  This case was 
instituted in compliance with 411(a).  The named 
plaintiffs registered their works and came into court. 
It went to mediation, and the next thing the court knew, 
it had a settlement agreement to review, and it did 
review under Rule 23.

 She relies on the Hallstrom case, but, of 

course, the Hallstrom case, which did avoid saying 
whether it was mandatory or jurisdictional, involved the 
enforcement of a mandatory -- at least mandatory rule, 
on the application of a party, and that's what the Court 
does, and that's why, to some extent, other than with 
respect to settlement agreements, this case doesn't 
matter a lot because the defendants will always be 
raising this defense.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Ms. Merritt, you were appointed by this 

Court as an amicus to defend the judgment below, and you 
have ably discharged that responsibility.
