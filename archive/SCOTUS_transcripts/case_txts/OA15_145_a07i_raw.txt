CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next  in  Case  No.  15­145,  Husky  International  Electronics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

v.  Ritz. 

 

            

Mr.  Dvoretzky. 

 

             

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  SHAY  DVORETZKY 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DVORETZKY:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

            

Congress  amended  the  discharge  bar  in  1978 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  add  actual  fraud  as  an  additional  ground  for  barring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge.  That  amendment  must  be  given  meaning.  Our 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  is  the  only  one  that  does  so. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Consistent  with  the  common­law  understanding 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  codified,  "actual  fraud"  is  a  term  of  art 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  includes  a  recipient's  knowing  participation  in  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

deliberate  fraudulent  transfer.  By  contrast,  the  Fifth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit's  holding  that  actual  fraud  invariably  requires 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  misrepresentation  makes  Congress's  amendment 

 

 

 

 

superfluous  because  it  equates  actual  fraud  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preexisting  terms,  "false  pretenses"  and  "false 

 

 

 

 

 

representation." 

            

Respondent's  interpretation  is  even  worse. 

 

 

 

 

It  merely  restates  a  preexisting  scienter  requirement.

And  in  any  event,  Congress  could  not  plausibly  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

added  "or  actual  fraud"  to  the  discharge  bar  in  order  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modify  the  previous  terms  to  mean  intentional  false 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretenses  or  an  intentional  false  representation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You'd  ­­ you'd 

  

 

 

 

 

acknowledge,  wouldn't  you,  that  if  the  language  we  used 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Field  against  Mans  is  applicable,  or  if  we  meant  it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  lose?  Some  degree  of  reliance  is  required  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfy  the  element  of  causation  inherent  in  the  phrase 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"obtained  by"? 

 

            

MR.  DVORETZKY:  I  don't  think  that  language 

    

 

 

 

 

is  applicable  here,  because  that  language  has  to  be  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No,  no.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

understand,  and  I  understand  your  argument  there.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

if  it  is,  if  we  think  that  language  does  apply  across 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  board,  you  certainly  lose. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DVORETZKY:  Yes,  if  you  believe  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"obtained  by"  invariably  requires  reliance,  but  it  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not.  The  ­­ the  language  in  Field  was  in  the  context  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  misrepresentation  case.  What  obtained  by  requires  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

causation.  In  the  context  of  a  fraudulent  transfer 

   

  

 

 

 

 

where  the  recipient  knowingly  participates  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deliberate  fraudulent  transfer,  centuries  of  common  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established  that  he  commits  actual  fraud  himself.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore  obtains  the  property  by  actual  fraud.  That's

that  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  you  would  have  to  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  would  have  to  show  down  the  road  that  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  was  obtained  by  Ritz.  Because  as  I  understand  it, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  transferred  from  the  first  company  to  a  bunch  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  companies,  not  to  Mr.  Ritz  himself. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DVORETZKY:  That  ­­ that's  correct, 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg.  Down  the  road,  we  would  need  to  show 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  our  State  law  veil­piercing  theory  is  correct. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That,  however,  is  not  the  basis  on  which  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fifth  Circuit  rejected  our  claim.  The  Fifth  Circuit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rejected  our  claim  on  the  sole  ground  that  it  thought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual  fraud  invariably  requires  a  misrepresentation. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Would  you  have  to  show 

  

 

 

 

 

 

under  State  law  not  only  the  veil­piercing  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

that 

there's  veil  piercing,  but  that  there  is  fraud  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law? 

 

            

MR.  DVORETZKY:  Correct.  We  would  need  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

show  two  things  under  State  law:  First  of  all,  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ritz  orchestrated  a  fraudulent  transfer  by  transferring 

   

 

 

 

 

assets  from  Chrysalis  to  his  other  entities  in  order  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hinder  creditors. 

 

            

Second  of  all,  we  would  have  to  show  that  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perpetrated  that  fraud  for  his  own  personal  benefit, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  what  would  then  allow  us  to  pierce  the

corporate  veil  and  hold  him  personally  liable  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud  that  he  committed. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Are  you  piercing  the 

  

 

 

 

 

corporate  veil  as  to  the  first  company,  or  as  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transferee  companies? 

 

            

MR.  DVORETZKY:  We  are  piercing  the  ­­ it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  either,  but  ­­ but  I  think  we  are  piercing  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

veil  as  to  the  transferee  companies  because  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuing  this  on  a  recipient  theory. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Right.  Because  ­­ because  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

understood  your  whole  brief  to  be  pursuing  this  on  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recipient  theory. 

 

            

            

MR.  DVORETZKY:  Correct. 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  your  brief,  you  know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

makes  some  sense  as  that.  But  then  when  you  look  back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  your  complaint,  it  suggests  that  the  veil­piercing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  was  attempted  as  to  the  transferor  company, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  doesn't  do  you  any  good  under  your  theory. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DVORETZKY:  So  the  complaint  fully  spells 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  all  of  the  details  related  to  the  transfers.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally  ­­ this  is  at  Joint  Appendix  97  ­­ asks  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

avoidance  of  all  fraudulent  transfers  to  the  extent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary  to  satisfy  plaintiff's  claims.  Throughout  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

litigation,  the  claims  were  then  pursued  on  a  transferee 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory.  The  Fifth  Circuit  understood  the  claim  that  way

and  rejected  it  solely  because,  again,  the  lack  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misrepresentation. 

            

 

The  problem  with  the  Fifth  Circuit's 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  is  that  it  nullifies  Congress's 

 

 

 

 

 

amendment,  or  actual  fraud.  It  makes  it  meaningless 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply  by  restating  the  previous  terms,  "false 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretenses"  or  "false  representations."  When  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

added  "or  actual  fraud"  to  the  discharge  bar,  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislating  against  the  backdrop  of  hundreds  of  years  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common­law  usage  of  that  term. 

 

 

 

 

            

For  centuries,  courts  had  used  "actual 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud"  to  refer  to  fraudulent  transfers. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  ­­ I  know.  And  I'm 

    

   

  

 

 

rather  slightly  self­regarding  the  statement.  But,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  20,  30  years  ago,  I  had  a  case  on  fraudulent 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

conveyance  where  my  law  clerk  looked  up  every  single 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  in  sight,  poor  man.  And  we  went  back  to  Queen 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Elizabeth,  and  I  wrote  down  what  I  thought  it  was. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Well,  obviously,  that  affects  my  ­­ my  ­­ my  thinking  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this.  And  I  don't  have  any  way  of  knowing  that  it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  ­­ what  I  wrote  was  correct.  It's  called 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Burnazos,  if  you  want  to  look  at  it.  But  not  now. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  ­­ but  the  point  of  the  classical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples  that  we  found  ­­ let's  take  one  of  them  ­­ is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  knowing  that  he's  about  ­­ has  creditors.  He  has

to  know  that  he  has  creditors.  Maybe  he  knows  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insolvency,  and  he  transfers  money  to  his  wife  rather 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  to  the  creditors.  And  she  knows  it  too,  and  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  way  of  getting  the  money  away. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

That's  a  fraud  classic,  right? 

   

 

 

MR.  DVORETZKY:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  So  now  when  I  look 

   

  

  

 

 

 

at  the  statute,  I  see  these  words:  To  the  extent  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  debt,  it's  a  debt  obtained  by  actual  fraud. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  wait.  Whose  debt  are  we  talking  about? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're  talking  about  Creditor  C,  who  was  a  creditor  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  transferor.  And  it's  the  transferee,  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wife  who  obtained  ­­ she's  the  one  who's  got  the  money. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  it  sounds  like  the  bankruptcy  statute  is  saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she's  the  one  in  her  bankruptcy.  Now,  that  can't  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right.  And  so  ­­ so  how  is  this  supposed  to  work? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  now  you're  ­­ the  obvious  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ask  you  is  the  question,  if  it  doesn't  mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representation,  give  me  one  example  of  what  it  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean.  Well,  I  just  gave  you  one,  and  as  you  can  see, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  ­­ I'm  quite  confused  as  to  how  that  works.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't  seen  another  one. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DVORETZKY:  I  think  the  way  your 

    

 

 

 

 

hypothetical  works,  Justice  Breyer,  is  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recipient  in  that  instance,  the  wife  ­­

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Uh­huh 

  

 

MR.  DVORETZKY:  ­­ commits  actual  fraud 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yeah. 

  

 

MR.  DVORETZKY:  And  when  she  commits  actual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

herself. 

            

            

fraud  herself,  she  incurs  her  own  debts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  for  the  fee  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  with  her  is  she  is  not  trying  to  deceive  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor  of  hers.  She  is  not  ­­ she  is  not  trying  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deceive  her  creditor,  it's  the  transferor  whose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditors  are  being  fraudulently  deceived. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DVORETZKY:  True.  But  if  she  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

conspiring,  in  effect,  with  the  transferor,  she  is

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  So  you're 

  

  

 

 

 

saying  in  a  bankruptcy  of  the  wife,  this  is  money 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtained  by  fraud,  which  it  is.  And  the  fact  that  she's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

helped  him  defraud  his  creditors  is  sufficient  to  bring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us  under  the  1924  Massachusetts  Statute.  It's  copied 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  UCC,  which  ultimately  is  traced  back  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Statute  of  Elizabeth.  That's  how  it  works? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  DVORETZKY:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Thank  you.

it's  nondischargeable  under  523(a)(2)(A). 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Thank  you. 

  

 

 

MR.  DVORETZKY:  That  understanding  is 

  

 

 

 

consistent  with  the  common­law  understanding  of  actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud,  which  is  what  Congress  codified  in  order  to  add 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  additional  ground  for  discharge.  The  legislative 

  

 

 

 

 

 

history  of  the  1978  Code  makes  clear  that  Congress  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adding  an  additional  ground  for  discharge,  so  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expanding  ­­ an  additional  ground  for  barring  discharge, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excuse  me.  So  it  was  expanding  the  scope  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge  bar. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  It  does  make  the  language 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"false  pretenses"  or  "false  representations"  completely 

 

 

 

 

 

superfluous,  yes? 

 

            

MR.  DVORETZKY:  It  does,  but  the  key  point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  is  that  it  also  expands  upon  that  language,  whereas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Fifth  Circuit's  ­­ the  Fifth  Circuit's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  also  makes  "false  pretenses"  and  "false 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representations"  superfluous  without  giving  Congress's 

 

 

 

 

amendment  any  additional  work  to  do. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  too  for  Respondent's  interpretation, 

 

 

 

 

which  first  of  all,  merely  restates  a  preexisting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

scienter  requirement,  so  it  gives  the  amendment  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional  broadening  scope.  And  second  of  all,  is

grammatically  indefensible  because  "or  actual  fraud"  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  a  narrowing  phrase  that  modifies  what  comes  before 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it. 

            

Congress  could  perhaps  have  simply  replaced 

 

 

 

 

 

"false  pretenses"  and  "false  representations"  with  "or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual  fraud,"  but  that  might  have  led  to  an  unwarranted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negative  inference  by  the  deletion  of  terms  "false 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretenses"  and  "false  representations"  that  had  been  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  for  a  very  long  time. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  you  ­­ you  would  like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  to  ­­ to  hold  that  "actual  fraud"  means 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  other  than  false  pretenses  or 

 

 

 

 

 

misrepresentation;  that  it's  ­­ it's  a  broader  term,  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

includes  things  that  were  not  already  included,  period, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  then  whatever  other  issues  would  be  ­­ to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolved  on  remand? 

 

 

            

MR.  DVORETZKY:  That's  ­­ that's  correct, 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg. 

 

            

With  respect  to  Respondent's  interpretation, 

 

 

 

 

first  of  all,  as  we  established  in  our  reply  brief, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

false  pretenses  and  false  representations  already 

 

 

 

 

 

required  intentional  fraud.  No  court  had  interpreted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

those  terms  in  the  discharge  bar  before  1978  to  apply  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

innocent  conduct,  and  so  there  is  no  basis  to  think  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  Congress  added  "or  actual  fraud"  to  the  statute,  it

was  simply  restating  an  existing  rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  Court  has,  in  the  past,  refused  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infer  ­­ to  interpret  congressional  amendments  simply  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restate  existing  rules  when  there  is  a  plausible  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

indeed,  settled,  in  light  of  the  common­law  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding,  like  the  one  that  we  offer  that  gives  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amendment  an  additional  function. 

 

 

 

            

The  other  problem  with  Respondent's 

 

 

 

 

interpretation,  of  course,  is  grammatical.  "Or"  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

disjunctive  term  that  expands  on  what  comes  before;  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  a  term  that  limits  what  comes  before. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  moreover,  "actual  fraud"  is  a  noun 

   

 

 

 

 

phrase  that  in  ­­ that  represents  both  conduct;  fraud, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  way  in  which  it  is  carried  out,  intentionally. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  not  simply  a  mens  rea. 

   

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Why  did  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

take  the  term  "fraud"  out  of  the  Bankruptcy  Act  in  1903? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DVORETZKY:  The  legislative  history 

  

 

 

 

doesn't  tell  us  why  Congress  did  that.  What  we  do  know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  when  Congress  took  out  that  term  in  1903,  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least  one  legislator  expressed  concern  that  this  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leaving  a  category  of  frauds  outside  the  discharge  bar, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  that  was  a  mistake  because  the  ­­ the  purpose 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  discharge  bar  has  long  been  to  afford  relief  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  honest  but  unfortunate  debtor  and  not  to  allow

the  Bankruptcy  Code  to  be  used  for  an  engine  for  fraud. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  1978,  Congress  closed  that  gap  by  adding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  additional  ground  for  discharge  back  in. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  all  ­­ all  you've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

got  in  1903  is  one  ­­ one  legislator. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DVORETZKY:  Yes.  We  have  one  legislator 

  

  

 

 

 

 

expressing  the  concern  ­­

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  have  a  big  ­­ this 

    

   

 

 

 

 

isn't  necessarily  hostile  to  your  position,  but  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  a  big  change  to  take  fraud  out  of  a  bankruptcy 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  I  mean,  nobody  seems  to  know  why. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DVORETZKY:  Nobody  seems  to  know  why. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

We  don't  dispute,  of  course,  that  typically,  most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commonly  frauds  will  involve  misrepresentations,  and  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  frauds  were  still  covered.  And  of  course,  as  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

result  of  Congress's  drafting,  there  are  other  discharge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bars  that  apply  to  narrower  types  of  ­­ narrow  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  types  of  fraud. 

 

 

 

            

And  so  Congress  didn't  completely  forget 

 

 

 

 

 

about  fraud  in  1903.  It  did,  however,  take  it  out  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  particular  discharge  bar,  over  the  concern 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expressed  by  at  least  one  ­­ one  legislator. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  the  interim  period,  between  1903  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1978,  courts  did  note  that  the  discharge  bar  in  effect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  that  time  covered  only  false  pretenses  and  false

representations,  and  that  there  was  in  fact  a  gap.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  in  1978,  as  part  of  a  comprehensive  overhaul  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bankruptcy  Code,  Congress  closed  that  gap. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  we  submit  that  this  Court  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret  the  ­­ the  discharge  bar  in  a  way  that  gives 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

full  effect  to  Congress's  amendment.  Our  interpretation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  consistent  with  the  plain  common­law  meaning  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words  "actual  fraud."  It  does  not  require  grammatical 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

distortions,  and  it  accords  with  the  purpose  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge  bar,  which  is,  again,  to  provide  relief  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  honest  debtors  and  not  to  allow  the  Bankruptcy  Code 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  used  as  an  engine  for  fraud  in  the  way  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurred  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Ms.  Murphy  points  out  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  lots  of  other  provisions  in  523(a),  which  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  lot  of  overlap  on  this  provision  on  your  reading.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  also  the  fraudulent  conveyance  provisions,  if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  talk  a  little  bit  about  those. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DVORETZKY:  Sure.  Let  me  address  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

fraudulent  conveyance  provisions  first. 

 

 

 

            

The  fraudulent  conveyance  provisions  are 

 

 

 

 

targeted  at  the  transferor,  not  the  transferee.  And  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  reading  of  523  complements  those  provisions  rather 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  conflicts  with  them. 

 

 

 

            

727  provides  that  there  is  no  discharge  at

all  if  a  debtor  transfers  assets  to  ­­ to  hinder 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditors  within  a  year  of  the  bankruptcy  filing. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

548  allows  the  trustee  to  pursue  claims  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transfers  within  two  years,  but  nothing  about  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading  of  523  is  inconsistent  with  that.  It  simply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provides  that,  in  addition  to  those  things,  creditors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  pursue  fraud  claims  where  there  is  a  fraudulent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

transfer  against  the  ­­ the  transferee.  And  if  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transferee  ends  up  in  a  double  bankruptcy  situation,  so 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  speak,  then  at  that  point,  523  complements  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions. 

            

With  respect  to  the  other  discharge  bars 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  address  fraud,  there  is  inevitably  some  overlap 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

among  these  discharge  bars.  Partly  that's  a  result  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Congress's  drafting.  Congress  chose  to  use  the  word 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"fraud"  in  multiple  places,  and  so  you're  going  to  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overlap  as  a  result  of  that.  Partly  it  is  a  result  of  a 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

belt­and­suspenders  approach  to  effectuate  the  policy  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ensuring,  again,  that  fraudulent  debtors  don't  get  away 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  their  fraud. 

 

 

            

Our  reading,  however,  does  not  lead  to  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  overlap  than  Respondent's  reading  does.  Either 

  

 

 

 

 

 

way,  there  is  going  to  be  overlap  between  the  false 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretenses  and  false  representations  type  of  fraud,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent  thinks  (a)(2)(A)  is  limited  to.  And

The  Court  of  Appeals  erred  in  holding  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  523(a)(2)(A)  always  requires  proof  of  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intentional  misrepresentation  in  order  to  prove  actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud.  There  are  three  main  reasons  why  Petitioner  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  are  right  about  our  interpretation  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  523(a)(2)(A). 

 

            

 

 

 

The  first  is  that  this  Court  has  said  many 

 

 

 

 

 

times  that  when  Congress  uses  a  term  that  has  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established  common­law  meaning,  courts  should  give  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  meaning  when  it's  used  in  a  statute. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

For  centuries,  the  term  "actual  fraud"  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  used  at  common  law  to  refer  to  schemes  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ that  ­­ that  where  property  is  transferred  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ with  the  intent  to  hinder,  delay,  or  defraud  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor.  There  is  no  reason  to  give  that  text  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  meaning  than  in  Section  523(a)(2)(a). 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  second  is  that  our  view  is  the  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing  that  ­­ the  only  interpretation  that  gives  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning  to  the  1978  amendment. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  third  is  that  our  view  is  consistent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  Congress's  overarching  purpose  and  the  Bankruptcy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Code,  that  ­­ that  dishonors  creditors  ­­ excuse  me  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dishonors  debtors,  not  be  permitted  to  use  the  Code  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  rid  of  their  debts. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  Respondent  offers  a  competing  textual

interpretation  of  the  term  ­­ of  the  phrase  "or  actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud."  I  think  Petitioner  has  explained  well  why  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  doesn't  make  any  sense  as  an  ­­ as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grammatical  matter.  It  also  wouldn't  give  any  effect  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  1978  amendment. 

 

 

            

Petitioner  also  relies  on  the  ­­ on  the  word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"obtained,"  which  Justice  Breyer  was  referring  to  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well.  Excuse  me.  Respondent  does  ­­ Respondent 

  

  

 

 

 

 

suggests  that  our  interpretation  doesn't  give  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning  to  the  word  "obtained,"  if  obtained  doesn't  mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  false  representation  was  directed  at  a  creditor. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

But  under  our  view,  the  word  "obtained" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  does  two  things:  The  first  thing  it  does  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  work  that  this  Court  described  it  as  doing  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cohen  v.  de  la  Cruz,  which  is  it  requires  a  causal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

connection  between  the  fraudulent  act  and  the  debtor's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquisition  of  ­­ or  possession  of  the  property  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money. 

            

But  the  second  thing  it  does,  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraudulent  transfer  context,  specifically,  is  it  sort  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

screens  out  the  innocent  recipient  of  a  fraudulent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

transfer.  And  so  if  Congress  had  instead  used  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phrase  "obtained  as  a  result  of  actual  fraud,"  then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

argue  ­­ arguably,  that  could  have  brought  in  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

innocent  recipient  of  a  fraudulent  transfer,  because  as

a  result,  I  would  suggest  that  you  focus  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transaction  that  caused  the  transfer  of  property. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

But  "obtained  by"  really  focuses  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

action  of  the  recipient.  And  so  it  really  just  gets  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  recipient's  mental  state  and  ­­ and  fraudulent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  the  part  ­­ you  see, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  still  gnawing  at  me  is  I  wish  you  had  read  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  Because  ­­ because  when  we  went  through  it, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  ­­ this  sentence,  fraudulent  ­­ and  I  wouldn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

raise  this,  except  the  only  example  other  than  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misrepresentation  that  you've  come  up  with  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraudulent  conveyance. 

 

            

And  what  I  said,  after  reading  all  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

"fraudulent  conveyance  law  permits  creditors  to  recover 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  that  a  debtor  has  disposed  of  in  a  manner 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

similar,"  and  then  I  described  three  paradigm  cases. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

All  right.  So  what  they're  thinking  of  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transferor  has  creditors.  And  what  he  did  well  before 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  into  bankruptcy,  but  he  knew  he  was  likely  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insolvent,  the  transferor  transfers  money  to  his  friends 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather  than  the  creditors,  to  a  place  that  it's  hard  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  at,  you  know,  to  somebody  who  is  going  to  ­­ all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right. 

            

Now,  looking  at  this  statute,  it  seems  to  me

that  the  person  whose  debt  is  going  to  survive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy  is  not  the  transferor,  because  normally, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraudulent  conveyance  law  permitted  his  bankruptcy  judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  claw  back  the  money.  But  that's  not  what  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about.  You're  talking  about  the  transferee,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  saying  here,  the  transferee's  participation  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  transferor's  effort  to  defraud  his  creditor  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that  also  survives. 

 

 

 

            

And  at  that  point  I  ask,  of  all  the  bad 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  that  people  can  do  that  might  survive,  why  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

heaven's  name  do  they  pick  on  this  one  in  respect  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transferee?  I  mean,  after  all,  maybe  the  transferee 

    

 

 

 

 

 

robbed  a  bank.  I  mean,  there  are  all  kinds  of  bad 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  that  might  survive,  and  ­­ and  don't. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  was  ­­ so  am  I  ­­ something's  wrong  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  analysis,  as  you  understand  it,  and  that's  what  I've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got  to  get  into  my  head. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Well,  see,  there  are  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

kinds  of  debts  that  ­­ that  do  survive  a  bankruptcy, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including  the  debt  for  the  transferor. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yeah.  If  I  got  what  I'm 

   

  

  

 

 

 

talking  about  right,  in  terms  of  the  debt. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Well  ­­ so  I  think  it  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

important  to  realize  there  are  two  distinct  debts: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's  the  original  debtor  ­­ there's  original  debt

from  the  creditor  to  debtor  one.  Debtor  one  transfers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  property  to  a  friend.  If  the  friend  ­­ with  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intent  to  defraud  his  creditor.  If  the  friend  shares 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  intent,  then  the  State  law  or  some  Federal  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives  the  creditor  a  cause  of  action  to  go  after  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recipient,  to  go  after  the  friend. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  that  ­­ if  that  is  successful,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  new  debt  that's  created  from  ­­ to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor  from  the  ­­ from  the  friend.  And  that's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt  we're  talking  about  here. 

 

 

 

 

            

With  respect  to  why  that  wouldn't  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dischargeable,  when  ­­ if  you're  outside  the  time  limits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  covered  by  548  or  727,  the  transferors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  ­­ it's  because  the  transferee,  the  recipient, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  person  who  ends  up  with  the  money  or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property,  right? 

 

            

So  the  second  overarching  purpose  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bankruptcy  Code  is  to  let  creditors  get  their  money  back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  they  can.  And  so  it  makes  sense  that  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  wanted  to  give  maybe  a  stronger  remedy  ­­

actually  has  the  stuff  at  the  end  of  the  day. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  I  think  that's  why  our  ­­ our  reading 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  consistent  with  the  purpose  of  the  ­­ of  the  Code  in

as  well,  or  just  the  companies  to  which  Chrysalis's

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Well,  you  know,  Mr. 

  

 

 

 

 

Dvorestzky  suggested  that  it's  ­­ with  ­­ with  respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  recipients,  recipient  corporations,  I  think  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

there  ­­ there  are  many  questions  about  the  State  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause  of  action  that  would  need  to  be  resolved  on  remand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  Court  were  to  reverse. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  would  just  point  out,  on  ­­ on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

final  page  of  our  brief,  we  have  the  text  of  the  veil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

piercing  ­­ the  Texas  veil  piercing,  such  that  in  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  ­­ in  order  to  prevail  under  that  section,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  is  going  to  have  to  prove  it  says  an  actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud  for  the  direct  personal  benefit  of  the  holder. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  they're  basically  going  to  have  to  prove  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Ritz  obtained  money  or  property  by  actual  fraud,  in

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  how  does  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

work  in  the  bankruptcy  case?  We  say  this  debt  can't  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharged,  but  maybe  it  will  turn  out  that  it  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been,  depending  on  how  ­­ how  the  State  law  claim

MS.  HARRINGTON:  There's  ­­ so  what  happens 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  there's  an  adversary  proceeding  in  the  bankruptcy  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  larger  bankruptcy  proceeding  itself.  And  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead  of  having  parallel  litigation  in  State  court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  action  was  stayed  when  the  bankruptcy  petition  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed.  And  basically,  all  the  action  is  transferred  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  bankruptcy  court. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  the  bankruptcy 

  

 

 

 

 

court  will  decide  the  question  under  State  law? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Yes,  yes. 

  

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Okay. 

  

 

 

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  And  the  bankruptcy  court 

  

 

 

 

 

held  that  it  ­­ it  wasn't  satisfied  in  this  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  bankruptcy  court  viewed  those  Texas  laws  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requiring  a  misrepresentation,  and  also  as  523(a)(2)(a) 

   

 

 

 

 

is  requiring  misrepresentation. 

 

 

            

And  so  I  think  there  ­­ there  are  a  lot  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  that  would  need  to  be  sorted  out  about  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  cause  of  action  on  remand. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  just  want  to  say  one  last  thing  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redundancy,  if  I  could.  There's  a  couple  of 

   

   

  

 

 

specific  provisions  in  523  that  the  Respondent  suggests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  redundant.  One  of  them  is  523(a)(4),  and  Respondent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggests  that  ­­ and  that's  the  ­­ that  covers  fraud  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  fiduciary  capacity,  such  that  if  we're  correct  that

anything  that  would  be  covered  by  (a)(4)  would  ­­ would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  be  covered  by  523(a)(2)(A). 

 

 

 

 

            

But  that's  not  correct,  because  523(a)(4)  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  ­­ is  not  limited  to  situations  in  which  money  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  was  obtained  by  fraud.  And  so  it  could  cover  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud  where  a  fiduciary  caused  one  of  your  properties  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  to  a  third  party.  And  ­­ and  so  that  would  be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covered  by  (a)(4)  and  wouldn't  be  covered  by  (a)(2)(a). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  just  in  general,  one  last  thing  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redundancy,  I  think  Congress  is  trying  to  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

comprehensive  in  preventing  dishonest  debtors  from 

 

 

 

 

 

discharging  their  debts  in  bankruptcy.  And  so  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  broad  words  like  "fraud,"  and  instead  of  sitting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down  and  thinking  ­­ trying  to  think  up  every  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraudulent  scheme  that  people  might  come  up  with, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  just  wanted  to  be  comprehensive  and  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"fraud,"  and  it  uses  the  same  word  "fraud"  in  multiple 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

places.  That's  going  to  create  overlap.  But  that's  a

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Section  523(a)(2)  applies  to  a  specific  type 

   

 

 

 

 

of  debt,  a  debt  for  something  with  which  the  debtor  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraudulently  induced  the  creditor  to  part.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion  follows  from  the  text  of  the  statute  for  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least  three  reasons:  First,  because  the  statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

expressly  says  that  the  debt  has  to  be  for  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtained  by  the  debtor's  conduct;  second,  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  explicitly  and  repeatedly  talks  about  forms  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  where  the  debtor  obtains  something  by  inducing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detrimental  reliance;  and  third,  because  the  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes  clear  on  its  face  that  it's  the  creditor  whose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detrimental  reliance  has  to  be  induced. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Because  Section  523(a)(2)  applies  only  when 

 

 

 

 

 

the  debtor  induces  the  creditor  to  part  with  something, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  does  not  apply  to  a  debt  for  receiving  money  through 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  fraudulent  conveyance.  That  may  be  a  form  of  fraud. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  may  well  be  a  form  of  actual  fraud,  but  it's  not  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

form  of  fraud  that  gives  rise  to  a  debt  that  is  subject 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  exception  from  discharge  under  523(a)(2). 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Well,  what  ­­ what  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  have  to  write  to  cover  a  scheme  like  this? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Well,  I  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You  say  it's  not  covered 

  

 

 

 

 

 

under  (a)(2).

MS.  MURPHY:  Sure.  I  think  the  most  natural 

    

  

 

 

 

 

way  to  do  it  would  be  by  saying  "fraudulent  conveyance" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  "fraudulent  transfer"  or  a  "fraud  that  involves 

   

 

 

 

 

 

intent  to  delay,  defraud  or  ­­ or  hinder  a  creditor." 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Those  are  the  terms  that  Congress  uses  when  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislating  about  fraudulent  conveyance,  which  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

has  done  repeatedly  and  pervasively  for  a  hundred  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

fifty  years. 

 

            

If  you  look  at  the  fraudulent  conveyance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes,  not  a  single  one  of  them  uses  this  term 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"actual  fraud."  So  this  is  not  a  term  that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

associated,  particularly  with  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  you  have  the  1924 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts  statute  copied  from  the  Uniform  Commercial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Code,  which,  in  referring  to  fraudulent  conveyance  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  7,  uses  these  words:  "Each  conveyance  made  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual  intent  as  distinguished  from  intent  presumed  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  to"  ­­ da,  da,  da  ­­ "hinder,  delay,  or  defraud 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present  or  future  creditors  is  fraudulent." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Sure. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  grant  they  did  use  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

word  "actual  intent,"  rather  than  "actual  intent  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hinder  delay,  defraud,"  and  then  they  said  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraudulent.  That  sounds  an  awful  lot  like  the  words 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"actual  fraud."

MS.  MURPHY:  And  ­­ and  to  be  clear,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  dispute  that  fraudulent  conveyance  is  a  form  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual  fraud.  It's  just  not  a  form  of  actual  fraud  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

falls  within  the  scope  of  this  particular  exception 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  this  exception  says  more  than  just  the  words 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"actual  fraud."  It  says  that  you  have  to  have  a  debt 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  money,  property,  services  or  credit  to  the  extent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtained  by  false  pretenses,  false  representations  and

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  a  ­­

   

  

 

MS.  MURPHY:  ­­ actual  fraud. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  ­­ the  friend  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

obtained  the  $40,000  which  the  friend  knew  was  owed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  creditor  of  the  transferor  has  obtained  money,  money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  ­­ it  is  a  debt.  She  owes  the  debt.  She  now 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owes  the  debt  to  the  creditors  of  the  transferor  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she  has  the  40,000  knowing  that  it's  wrongly  conveyed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  she  now  owes  the  debt  to  the  creditors,  and  her  debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  obtained  by  actual  fraud. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MS.  MURPHY:  I  don't  think  it  was. 

    

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Because? 

  

 

MS.  MURPHY:  Because  she  didn't  use  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

fraud  to  obtain  the  money.  And  this  gets  back  to  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  were  talking  about  when  you  were  giving  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical.  The  fraud  in  a  fraudulent  conveyance  is

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  We're  not  limited  to 

  

 

 

 

 

fraudulent  conveyances  here.  You  want  to  read  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  and  say  something  like  for  money  obtained  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  innocent  party  in  the  first  instance  by.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  ­­ but  fraud  can  continue  through  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  a  whole  chain. 

   

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Sure  and  ­­ and  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  ­­ and  if  it  continues 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  the  whole  chain,  the  person  on  the  end  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chain  may  have  never  had  any  relation  with  the  innocent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party  at  all. 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Well,  I  think  that  what  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

need  to  have  the  fraud  that  comes  within  (a)(2)  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inducement.  Now,  the  inducement,  the  fraudulent 

  

 

 

 

 

inducement,  it  doesn't  have  to  be  direct.  It's  not  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  that,  you  know,  unless  the  misstatement  is  made

can  have,  you  know,  a  misstatement  that  you  cause  to  be

causing  a  misrepresentation  to  be  made  that  the  victim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  end,  the  creditor  ultimately  relies  upon. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  we're  not  saying  there  has  to  be  a  direct 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship  here. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  totally  confused 

  

 

 

 

because  I  think  ­­ I  was  following  you  up  until  that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

last  statement. 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Okay. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right? 

  

 

 

              

I  was  following  you  up  to  when  you  said  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  has  to  be  a  debt  you  obtain  by  fraud  from  the  person. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Whether  I  agree  with  you 

   

  

 

 

 

or  not,  that's  a  different  issue  because  I'm  not  sure 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  fully  answered  Justice  Breyer.  But  I  don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

understand  where  the  inducement  comes  into  this.  Why  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  did  ­­ you  can  commit  fraud  against  a  person 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly  in  a  variety  of  different  ways  that  don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

require  a  misrepresentation.  And  we  know  that  actual 

   

  

 

 

 

 

fraud  doesn't,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  require  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

misrepresentation. 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Well,  as  far  as  I  can  tell,  and

only  two  forms  of  fraud  here.  There  is  ­­ there  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misrepresentation  or  fraudulent  conveyance.  They  really 

  

 

 

 

 

haven't  pointed  to  anything  else.  So,  you  know,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  I  think,  really  is:  Is  fraudulent  conveyance 

   

  

 

 

 

 

supposed  to  be  in  this  statute?  And  in  this  particular 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  I  think  fraudulent  conveyance  sticks  out  like  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sore  thumb. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  you  just  said  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not  contesting  that  fraudulent  conveyance  is  a  form  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual  fraud;  is  that  right? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  When  it's  done  with  intent,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  the  necessary  intent  to  make  it  actual  fraud.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes,  that's  right. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So,  now,  this  language  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  the  language  just  seems  a  lot  more  simple  than 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  making  it,  because  you  add  inducement  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language,  you  add  from  the  creditor  to  the  language. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  the  language  doesn't  say  any  of  those  things.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  says  is  there  a  debt?  And  we  know  that  there  is  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt  here.  The  debt  is  for  money.  The  language  says, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  what  has  to  be  true  of  that  money?  It  has  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtained  by  actual  fraud. 

 

 

 

            

And  here,  the  money,  the  allegation  is,  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtained  by  fraudulent  concealment.  So  whether  or  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  creditor  has  been  induced  and  whether  or  not  the

money  has  come  from  the  creditor  seems  to  be  irrelevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  this  very  simple  statutory  phrase. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  I  think  that  there  is  two  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  problems  with  that,  in  our  view. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First,  I  don't  agree  that  the  fraud  is  how 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  obtained  the  money.  You  obtained  money,  and  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  so  helped  someone  else  commit  a  fraud  on  their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor.  But  you  did  not  use  fraud  to  obtain  the  money 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  fraudulent  conveyance.  You  have  been  a  participant 

   

   

  

 

 

 

in  a  fraud  on  someone  else.  So  I  think  even  ­­

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That  leaves  out  every 

  

 

 

 

 

conspiracy  theory  that  exists.  I  mean,  if  you're 

    

 

 

 

 

 

helping  someone  by  accepting  the  money,  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committing  a  crime. 

   

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Right.  But  this  statute  says 

  

  

 

 

 

 

more.  It  says  that  you  have  to  obtain  the  money  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  gives  rise  to  the  debt.  It's  a  very  different  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  A  conspiracy  theory  says 

    

 

 

 

you  don't  have  to  commit  every  act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  MURPHY:  The  ­­ the  question  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  The  transferee  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

transferee  obtains  the  money  by  way  of  the  fraudulent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conveyance,  right?  How  else  does  the  transferee  obtain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  money?

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Through  a  fraudulent 

   

  

 

MS.  MURPHY:  The  fraud  occurs  on  the  back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

end.  Because  of  the  transfer,  there  is  then  fraud  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  debtor  effectively,  you  know,  either  conceals  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transaction,  that's  the  fraud,  or  conceals  the  true 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nature  of  the  transaction. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  about  Mr.  Ponzi's 

  

 

 

 

 

cousin  who,  in  fact,  had  nothing  to  do  with  any  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misrepresentations,  but  knowing  the  entire  truth  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ponzi,  my  friend,  when  you  get  those  bags  of  cash,  hide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  under  my  bed,  all  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  he  himself  has  not,  in  fact,  lied  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anybody  or  made  any  misrepresentations,  but  he's  part  of

MS.  MURPHY:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  I  take  it  we  would  say

actual  fraud,  hasn't  it?

your  hypothetical,  where,  you  know  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  There  was  ­­ I  mean,  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

know,  there  are  dozens  and  dozens  of  cases  where  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  people  do  have  misrepresentations.  There  is  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt  there's  a  misrepresentation  in  this  thing.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

after  all,  not  every  participant  in  the  great  scheme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

himself  lies. 

 

            

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Sure.  But  ­­

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  those  people,  I  would 

   

  

 

 

 

think,  would  ­­ you  would  expect  to  have  fall  within  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

since  they're  part  of  the  big  Ponzi  scheme,  they  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  right  within  this  statute  and  their  debts  would  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  forgiven  ­­

 

 

            

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ because  they  weren't  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ones  who  lied. 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  (a)  just  ­­ it's  not  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy  statute.  And  Petitioner  themselves,  they 

  

 

 

 

 

offer  as  their  example  something  that  doesn't  fall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  (a)(2),  aiding  and  abetting  somebody  else's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud.  So  they  ­­ they  say  that  this  is  one  of  the  ways 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  which  this  statute  ­­ you  know,  they  have  to  give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  theories  as  to  what  narrows  this  statute  so  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  completely  swallow  the  additional  fraud 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  that  Congress  has  added  here.  And  that's

part  of  their  theory,  is  that,  you  know,  you  do  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  used  the  fraud  to  obtain  it  yourself. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  think  that  part  of  it  is  that  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  just  look  at  the  term  "actual  fraud"  in  isolation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  as  the  other  side  agrees  that  you  can't  look  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

term  "false  representation"  in  isolation.  Because  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

assume  that  false  representation  means  fraudulent 

 

 

 

 

 

misrepresentation.  That's  not  what  the  statute  says, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  that's  not  what  false  representation  means  at  common 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law. 

            

At  common  law,  false  representation  includes 

 

 

 

 

 

negligent  misrepresentation  and  innocent 

 

 

 

misrepresentation.  If  you  look  at  the  Restatement  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1976,  it  expressly  says  that.  So  does  Prosser.  So 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  agreeing  that  you  can't  just  take  these  terms 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  pluck  them  out  of  the  statute  and  say,  oh,  what  did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  mean  at  common  law?  That's  the  end  of  the  analysis. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  question  is,  what  did  these  terms  mean  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute?  And  when  you  look  at  this  statute,  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put  the  term  "actual  fraud"  next  to  a  bunch  of  terms 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  by  their  nature  speak  of  inducement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  it  would  be  a  very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

strange  thing,  Ms.  Murphy,  if  ­­ if  I  agreed  with  you, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  I  were  Congress  and  I  said,  I  want  to  make  it  really 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  that  this  should  be  only  intentional,  false

pretenses  and  false  representation.  There  are  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

gazillion  ways  to  do  that,  but  starting  with  the  simple 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one,  saying  intentional  false  pretenses  and  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intentional  false  representation. 

 

 

            

But  the  one  thing  I  wouldn't  do,  I  think,  is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

to  say  actual  fraud.  Because  actual  fraud  is  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

synonymous  with  ­­ with  intent.  Actual  fraud  refers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ to  conduct  that's  done  with  a  certain  kind  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intent.  And  that  conduct,  as  you  just  said,  includes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  than  false  representation  and  false  pretenses. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  wouldn't  use  a  term  that  had  to  do  with 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  just  to  state  a  mens  rea  requirement. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  So  ­­ so  here's  why  ­­ and  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responses  as  to  why  I  don't  think  it's  actually  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unusual  in  this  context.  I  mean,  first  of  all,  this 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  a  theory  that  we  concocted  after  the  fact.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sponsors  of  the  bill,  when  they  introduced  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislation  on  the  House  and  Senate  floor,  both  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

key  sponsors  said  what  Subsection  (a)  was  intended  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do,  and  I  quote,  "It  was  intended  to  codify  current  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law,  e.g.,  Neal  v.  Clark,  interpreting  fraud  as  actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  intentional  fraud  rather  than  implied  fraud." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

But  if  they  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  if  I  have  that  case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

right,  that  case  is  actually  a  case  about  a  fraudulent

conveyance.  It's  not  a  case  about  a  false 

   

   

  

 

 

representation.  So  they  said,  look  at  this  case.  It's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  case  about  a  fraudulent  conveyance  that  suggests  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  more  fraud  in  the  world  than  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misrepresentations.  And  we  want  to  make  clear  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  going  ­­ that  that's  supposed  to  be  a  part  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this. 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  That's  ignoring  the  second  half 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  what  the  sponsor  said,  because  they  didn't  say,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intend  this  to  codify  Neal  v.  Clark,  period. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  Neal  v.  Clark  didn't  hold  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraudulent  conveyance  was  something  that  comes  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  scope  of  the  statute.  It  held  that  the  fraudulent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conveyance  there  did  not  come  within  the  scope  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Whatever  ­­

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Whatever  may  have  been 

  

 

 

 

 

said  in  ­­ in  the  course  of  the  legislative  history,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  says  "or."  And  I  think  you  would  concede  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  reading  requires  converting  "or"  into  "by";  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  misrepresentation,  false  pretenses  by  actual  fraud. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  I  think  that's  a  fair 

    

   

 

 

statement,  but  I  think  that  this  case  is  pretty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

analogous  to  the  McNally  case  where  this  Court  also  had

the  disjunctive  "or"  before  it  in  interpreting  the  Mail 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fraud  Statute.  And  in  that  case  the  Court  ­­ it  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  similar  situation  where  you  had  a  statute  that  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  books,  you  had  decisions  from  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting  that  statute,  and  then  Congress  added  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  language  that  was  mirroring  the  language  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court's  cases. 

 

 

            

 

And  in  that  circumstance,  the  Court  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know  what,  we  have  to  look  at  that  language  in  light 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  fact  that  they  took  it  from  our  cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  here,  if  you  look  at  the  ­­ the  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  took  this  language  from,  they  are  cases  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  actual  fraud  to  distinguish  intentional  fraud  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constructive  fraud.  They  are  not  cases  that  use  actual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud  to  say,  oh,  here's  what  kind  of  fraud  counts  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  statute,  fraudulent  conveyance. 

 

 

 

            

In  fact,  the  only  cases  that  happen  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involve  fraudulent  conveyance  and  the  term  "actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud"  are  cases  where  the  Court  held  that  the  debt  did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  fall  within  the  scope  of  the  exception  to  discharge. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Do  you  have  any  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

example  in  all  of  the  U.S.  Code  where  the  word  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

series  of  words  A,  or  B,  or  C,  and  "or"  is  taken  to  mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"by,"  and  refer  not  to  a  discrete  category,  but  modifies 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  earlier  category.

MS.  MURPHY:  I'm  not  sure  I  have  an  example 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

where  it  would  ­­ you  know,  where  ­­ where  it  quite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

works  like  that.  But  what  I  would  say  is  that  there  are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  places  in  the  U.S.  Code  where  an  item  that  comes  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  end  of  or  later  in  a  list  is  used  to  inform  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning  of  the  word  before  it.  And  if  you  look  at  Neal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

v.  Clark  itself,  that's  exactly  the  reasoning  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employed  there. 

 

            

The  reason  the  Court  concluded  that  the  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  fraud  that  counted  was  intentional  fraud  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  next  item  in  the  list  was  embezzlement.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  said  because  embezzlement  requires  intent, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  going  to  infer  from  that  term  that  fraud  requires 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intent  as  well. 

 

 

            

So  the  basic  principle  that  adding  language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  a  statute  can  inform  and  limit  the  words  that  come 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  it  is  nothing  that  extraordinary.  It's  just  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Can  you  give  me  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

example  in  common  parlance,  not  ­­ not  in  the  U.S.  Code, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  someone  would  speak  along  the  lines  you're  saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  is  written? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Sure.  There's  an  example  in  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  construction  book  of  the  phrase  "cats,  dogs, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  domesticated  animals."  When  you're  thinking  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  phrase,  "domesticated  animals"  is  the  one  that

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  That's  not  great  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS.  MURPHY:  ­­ the  veterinarian  says,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

know,  I  will  treat  these  three  types  of  animals.  It's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

limiting  the  one  that  comes  before  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  another  phrase  that  I  came  across 

   

 

 

 

 

was  highways,  bridges,  and  public  sidewalks.  You  know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"public  sidewalks"  is  what  tells  you  that  bridges 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  include  the  one  in  my  backyard.  So  the  third 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

term  can  be  a  term  that  informs  the  meaning.  Now,  here 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  ­­ I  don't  think  you  have  to  conclude  that  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  only  thing  "actual  fraud"  achieves  in  this  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  order  to  accept  our  reading  of  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

"Actual  fraud"  in  this  statute  ­­ you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  concept  of  misrepresentation  doesn't  have  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely  synonymous  with  the  concept  of  false 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representation.  What  you  can  essentially  view  "actual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

fraud"  as  doing  is  putting  a  thumb  on  the  scale  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broadest  conception  of  misrepresentation  possible,  even 

 

 

 

 

 

if  that's  broader  than  the  common  law  tort  of  false 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misrepresentation. 

            

So  one  thing  that  some  courts  have  said  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  at  this  statute  is  that  it's  not  clear  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

false  representation  reached  future  looking,  you  know,

statements  about  whether  I  intend  to  perform  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

future.  And  some  courts  have  said,  well,  you  know,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  need  to  resolve  that  debate  anymore  because  now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  statute  says  "actual  fraud,"  that's  good  enough 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  tell  us  that  the  kinds  of  misrepresentations  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  within  the  scope  of  this  statute  include  any  kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  misrepresentation  that  induces  the  creditor  to  part 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  something,  even  if  it  might  not  technically  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualified  as  false  representation  at  common  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  think  that  there's  plenty  of  ways  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  term  to  do  work  without  having  it  kind  of  put  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sore  thumb  into  the  statute  of  fraudulent  conveyance, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  just  nothing  like  the  rest  of  the  terms  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute. 

            

It's  nothing  like  false  statements,  false 

 

 

 

 

 

representations,  false  financial  statements.  All  of 

  

 

 

 

 

those  types  of  conduct  that  this  statute  has  always 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covered  involve  inducing  the  creditor  to  part  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something.  And  that's  what  differentiates  (a)(2)  from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  18  other  exceptions  in  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  is  not  the  intentional  fraud  provision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's  plenty  of  other  provisions  in  the  statute  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cover  forms  of  intentional  fraud,  some  of  them  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly  using  the  word  "fraud,"  others  like  (a)(6)  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covering  intentional  injuries  to  property  interests.

So  it's  not  as  if  you  need  to  put  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy  into  (a)(2)  in  order  to  ensure  that  if  you  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  have  intentional  fraud  in  the  receipt  of  a  fraudulent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conveyance,  there  will  be  a  means  of  having  a  debt 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

that's  nondischargeable.  So  I  don't  know  why  you  kind 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  strain  to  get  it  in  here  where  it  seems  like  such  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

poor  fit. 

 

            

And  the  other  thing  that  I  think  is  worth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

keeping  note  of  is  that  Congress  has  legislated,  quite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically,  on  fraudulent  conveyance  for  150  years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  there  are  two  things  that  you  can  note  repeatedly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  Congress  does  so. 

 

 

 

            

First  of  all,  it  uses  particular  language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  ­­ of  fraudulent  convenance.  It  talks  about  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraudulent  conveyance  or  a  fraudulent  transfer,  or  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

transfer  made  with  intent  to  injure,  hinder,  delay,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defraud  a  creditor. 

   

            

But  the  other  thing  is  that  the  remedies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  has  created  for  fraudulent  conveyance  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor­specific.  They  are  instead  consistent  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

basic  principle  of  equitable  distribution. 

 

 

 

 

            

Under  727(a)(2),  you  have  a  complete  bar  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

discharge  which  benefits  everybody  because  no  debtor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gets  a  discharge. 

   

            

Under  548(a)(1)  and  the  other  provisions

that  allow  the  trustee  to  void  transactions,  the  money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes  back  to  the  estate  and  then  gets  distributed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitably  to  all  creditors. 

 

 

 

            

Here,  instead,  you  have  a  creditor  who's 

   

 

 

 

 

basically  jumping  the  line  and  saying  we  should  get  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  this  money,  even  though  within  the  context  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chrysalis  bankruptcy,  the  trustee  did  not  see  fit  to  try 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  void  these  transactions,  and  there  was  no  attempt  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  trustee  to  void  transactions  in  this  bankruptcy, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either. 

            

So  you  end  up  with  a  remedy  that  is  really 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  like  the  ones  that  Congress  has  offered  when  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  actually  legislating  clearly  on  the  topic  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraudulent  transfers  ­­

MS.  MURPHY:  No,  I'm  not.  Because  the

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That  one  creditor  has  ­­

­­

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ the  expense,  et 

  

 

 

 

 

cetera. 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  ­­ try  and  get  the  trustee  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

void  the  transaction,  and  the  trustee  can  void  the  next 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transaction  on  down  the  line  as  well.  The  statutory 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

powers  include,  you  know,  if  ­­ if  the  recipient  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraudulently  conveys  away  the  property,  you  can  keep 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undoing  the  transfers  until  you  ultimately  get  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property.  So  there's  plenty  of  ability  for  the  trustee 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  get  at  the  property  without  resorting  to  this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  we're  not  saying  that  there  can  never 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  creditor­specific  remedy  for  the  receipt  of  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraudulent  conveyance.  If,  say,  you  have  a  trustee  who 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

has  that  debt  against  the  recipient,  I  think  the  right 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing  for  them  to  do  is  to  go  use  the  Subsection  (a)(6) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception,  which  allows  an  exception  for  willful  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

malicious  injury  to  the  property  interests  of  another. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  courts  have  ­­ every  court  that's  looked

place  for  this  kind  of  debt  to  be  accepted  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge.  So  you've  got  courts  who  have  looked  at  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  and  said  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  does  it  take  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

show  ­­ what  is  it,  the  phrase  "malicious,"  or  what? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MS.  MURPHY:  "Willful  and  malicious  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Oh. 

  

 

MS.  MURPHY:  ­­ injury  to"  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  ­­ what  ­­ what  does  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  to  show  that? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  So  it  can  be  either  subjective 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

intent  to  cause  injury,  or  it  can  be  a  substantial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainty  that  injury  will  result.  There's  a  bit 

   

  

 

 

 

 

of  dispute  below  in  the  ­­ in  the  courts  of  appeals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  whether  an  objective  substantial  certainty  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harm  will  result  is  sufficient,  or  you  need  a  subjective 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial  certainty. 

 

            

I'm  not  sure,  at  the  end  of  the  day,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ever  is  an  outcome  determinative  distinction. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  for  this  case,  it  makes  no  difference  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all,  because  the  Fifth  Circuit  is  the  circuit  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies  the  broader  objective  test.  And  applying  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

objective  text  here,  the  Fifth  Circuit  concluded,  as  did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  two  courts  below,  that  these  transfers  were  not  made

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  your  case.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  I'm  still  ­­ as  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor  said,  seemed  to  me  there  is  a  ­­ look  what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  saying  here.  The  bankrupt  or  insolvent  person 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

transfers  the  jewels  to  his  wife.  Okay?  And  now  what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  would  be  saying  under  their  reading  is  the  jewels 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

survive  her  bankruptcy,  and  quite  right,  that  her 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

husband's  trustee  could  have  clawed  it  back  before,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  didn't.  And  so  now  it  went  through  her  bankruptcy, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  if  it  survives,  somebody  can  get  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  maybe  the  fair  thing  to  do  is  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  what  you  do  with  environmental  cases  or  you  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bunch  of  people  who  are  victims  and  they  divide  it  up, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  you're  quite  right,  that  all  of  the  creditors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  might  have  shared  in  the  jewels  are  the  victims,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditors  of  the  transferor.  But  so  what?  I  mean,  how 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  ­­ how  does  that  help  you  with  your  basic  argument? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  just  ­­ it's  a  different  argument  that  says  that  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  creditor  shouldn't  get  all  of  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Well,  I  think  it's  actually 

   

  

 

 

 

kind  of  true  in  every  fraudulent  conveyance  case  because

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It's  also  true  in  every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

misrepresentation  case.  If  it  survives  bankruptcy  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Not  at  all.  No,  it's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

absolutely  not  true.  In  a  misrepresentation  case,  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

misrepresentation  was  made  to  the  creditor.  So  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor  ­­ the  debt  that  the  creditor  is  trying  to  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  money  for  is  directly  related  to  inducing  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor  to  part  with  the  money. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  he  does,  perhaps,  to  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thousand.  He  lied  to  a  thousand  people. 

   

  

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Well,  then  each  one  of  them  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  There  are  a  thousand 

   

  

 

 

victims.  And  here  we  have,  let's  say,  a  thousand 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

victims,  all  those  creditors  who  didn't  get  the  money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  should  have  gotten.  I  mean,  it's  the  same  problem, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  it? 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  I  ­­ I  don't  think  it  is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

because  in  that  context  you  have  a  creditor­specific 

   

 

 

 

 

 

injury  and  a  creditor­specific  remedy,  and  I  think  you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

need  that,  too,  in  the  fraudulent  conveyance  context. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if,  for  instance,  you  know,  the  jewels 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

belonged  to  one  of  the  creditors,  then  they're  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  use  (a)(6)  and  get  the  jewels  back.  They're  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  have  a  problem.  (a)(6)  is  available  for  that

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  see. 

    

 

MS.  MURPHY:  ­­ interest. 

  

 

 

So  you  don't  need  it  over  here  when  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

a  very  different  statute  that  has  been  focused  on  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concept  of  inducement.  And  I  would  note  here,  every 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

single  one  of  this  Court's  cases  that  involved  (a)(2) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  always  had  a  debtor  who  is  using  fraud  to  induce  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor  to  part  with  something.  That's  the  way  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  had  been  understood  up  until  the  Seventh 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit's  decision  came  along  and  ­­ and  had  this  new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

idea  that  you  could  get  at  fraudulent  conveyance  through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  statute. 

 

            

Before  that,  it  was  pretty  commonly 

 

 

 

 

 

understood  that  what  (a)(2)  was  about,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differentiated  it  from  other  provisions,  was  that  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  fraudulent  inducement.  And  that's  the  ultimate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

problem  here.  They  may  have  a  debt.  They  may  have  a 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt  that  even  involves  actual  fraud,  but  they  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  debt  for  anything  with  which  Petitioner  was  ever 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraudulently  induced  to  part  resulting  in  my  client 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtaining  anything  by  the  kind  of  fraud  that  counts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  5  ­­ Section  523(a)(2). 

   

 

 

            

If  there  are  no  further  questions.

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  SHAY  DVORESTZKY

MR.  DVORETZKY:  Thank  you. 

  

 

 

              

A  veterinarian's  office  with  a  sign  saying 

   

 

 

 

that  the  veterinarian  treats  dogs,  cats  or  domesticated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

animals  treats  more  than  just  dogs  and  cats.  Surely

And  so  the  "domesticated  animals"  phrase  does  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  in  common  with  dogs  and  cats,  just  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"fraudulent  transfers"  has  something  in  common  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

false  pretenses  and  false  representations. 

 

 

 

 

            

These  are  all  schemes  to  cheat  creditors. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  by  adding  "or  actual  fraud,"  Congress  was  expanding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon  the  pre­existing  terms,  expanding  upon  dogs  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cats  to  cover  something  additional. 

 

 

 

 

            

Respondent  does  not  have  any  theory  for  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  was  doing  through  this  language  to  expand  upon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  previous  terms. 

 

 

            

With  respect  to  false  representation,  courts 

 

 

 

 

 

had  unanimously  interpreted  false  representations  to 

 

 

 

 

 

refer  to  the  tort  of  deceit.  In  his  brief,  Respondent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equates  false  representations  with  the  tort  of  deceit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Even  if  false  representations  might  have  been  understood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  something  else,  adding  "or  actual  fraud"  would  not

narrow  false  representations  to  exclude  unintentional  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

unintentional  representations.  It  would  at  best  simply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

show  that  you  could  also  have  a  discharge  bar  for  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intentional  misrepresentation. 

 

            

 

With  respect  to  Neal,  Neal  has  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood  in  light  of  what  was  at  issue  at  ­­ in  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  The  ­­ the  fundamental  premise  of  Neal  was  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  forms  of  fraudulent  transfers  are  fraud  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predecessor  of  Section  523(a)(2)(A).  And  so  the  only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  that  the  Court  drew  a  line  there  between 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

"intentional"  and  "unintentional"  participation  was  on 

 

 

 

 

 

the  premise  that  if  the  participation  had  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intentional,  that  would  have  been  nondischargeable 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud. 

            

With  respect  to  the  statutory  text  here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  about  the  statute  talks  about  inducing  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor  to  part  with  anything.  It  simply  talks  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtaining  money  by  fraud.  And  for  the  reasons  that  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explained  earlier,  a  transferee  commits  fraud  and, 

   

 

 

 

 

therefore,  incurs  a  new  debt  for  which  he  is  liable  if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  knowingly  participates  in  a  fraudulent  transfer. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Ms.  Murphy  made  the  point  that  there  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested  that  there's  something  anomalus  about  allowing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditors  to  pursue  a  fraudulent  transfer  remedy  for  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit  of  an  individual  creditor.  There's  nothing

anomalus  about  that.  State  fraudulent  transfer  laws 

  

 

 

 

 

 

exist  outside  of  bankruptcy,  and  so  before  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy  stay  takes  effect,  it  is  essentially  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

free­for­all  where  creditors  can  pursue  their  rights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  State  fraudulent  transfer  laws. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  We  ­­ we  treat  ­­ we  treat 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  our  veterinarian  clinic  domestic  animals,  your  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestic  animals  or  your  household  ­­ domestic  animals, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  dog  ­­ your  ­­ your  favorite  friends  or  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestic  pets,  you  see.  Domestic  pets  is  meant  to  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  domestic  animals?  Domestic  animals,  dogs,  cats, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

or  household  pets?  Domestic  animals  seems  to  cover  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole  thing.  They're  saying,  or  it's  like,  i.e., 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

household  pets. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Come  on  and  answer  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  not  for  you.  I  mean, 

    

  

 

 

 

 

it's  good  for  you,  this  word  "or." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  grant  you,  I've  had  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

horrible  time  trying  to  find  an  example. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  ­­ but  it  could  be  it  means  i.e.  She's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  it  means  i.e.,  household  pets. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DVORETZKY:  Not  when  Congress  adds  "or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

domestic  animals"  as  a  specific  amendment.  That  has  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

be  given  some  effect.

Lastly,  (a)(6)  doesn't  solve  this  problem. 

 

 

 

 

 

If  (a)(6)  simply  covered  any  intentional  wrong,  it  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply  subsume  all  of  the  discharge  bars.  Any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

intentional  misrepresentation  would  fall  within  (a)(6). 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(6)  has  to  be  given  a  narrower  construction  in  order 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  differentiate  it  from  the  other  bars. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Moreover,  (a)(6)  doesn't  apply  in  Chapter 

 

 

 

 

 

13.  In  particularly  in  2005  when  Congress  reformed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  13  to  crack  down  on  fraud,  it  did  not  mean  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow  the  sort  of  scheme  that  went  on  in  this  case  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  sort  of  fraudulent  transfer  that  Justice  Breyer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothesized  to  ­­ to  lead  to  a  discharge. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Are  you  limiting  actual 

  

 

 

 

 

frauds  to  just  fraudulent  conveyances?  Are  there  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

deceptive  schemes  that  you  would  include? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DVORETZKY:  There  are.  I  think  the 

    

  

 

 

 

Heartland  usage  of  "actual  fraud"  at  common  law,  most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commonly  it  did  refer  to  fraudulent  transfers  to  hinder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditors.  There  were  ­­ may  I  answer? 

   

  

 

 

 

            

There  were  also  other  types  of  conveyances, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conveyances  to  defeat  a  divorcing  spouse's  interest,  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

example,  the  devastatit  in  Neal  to  diminish  an  estate. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  also  give  an  example  in  our  brief  of  undue  influence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These  are  also  forms  of  actual  fraud,  but  the  Heartland 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  it  is  fraudulent  conveyances.
