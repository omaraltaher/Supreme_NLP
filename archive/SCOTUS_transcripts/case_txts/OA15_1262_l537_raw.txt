CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

in Case 15-1262, McCrory v. Harris. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Clement. 

 

            

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

This case involves the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutionality of two congressional districts in 

 

 

 

 

 

North Carolina that should be familiar to the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because they've been before the Court on multiple prior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occasions. 

            

Even though the two congressional districts 

 

 

 

 

 

here -- and they're both North Carolina congressional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts -- the issues presented by the two districts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are actually quite distinct. 

 

 

 

            

With respect to Congressional District 12, 

 

 

 

 

 

it is different from both the House of Delegates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts in the previous case and Congressional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

District 1, because this was not a district that was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawn with an avowed intent to create a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority-minority district to comply with the Voting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rights Act; rather, with respect to Congressional

District 12, this was avowedly a political draw. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

Now, if that all sounds familiar, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it's the exact same dynamic that was before this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court in Cromartie II.  And in Cromartie II, this Court, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in reversing a district court on the clear error 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard, concluded when the State actually said this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was a political draw, that race did not predominate over 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

politics in the drawing of this district. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that is essentially the exact same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dynamic that is before this Court now with one major 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference.  This is a much easier case for this Court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to reverse than Cromartie II was, because -- and even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before this Court gets to the clear error standard of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review, there is a clear legal error here that was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

created by my friends on the other sides and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court's failure to abide by the teaching of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cromartie II. 

 

              

I think Cromartie II was about as clear as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it could have been, that in a case where you have a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority-minority district or something approximating 

 

 

 

 

it, and you have race and politics highly correlated, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and you have somebody challenging the State's suggestion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this is a political and not a racial draw, what the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs must show -- not can show, not may show, not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it would be nice that they show -- must show, is that

there are alternative ways that the legislature could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have accomplished its political goals without a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

comparable emphasis on race --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Clement, that passage 

  

 

 

 

 

in -- in Cromartie II says in a case like this one. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And -- and it's pretty clearly following off analysis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- in a case with purely circumstantial evidence, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather than direct evidence of race-based districting. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think you would have heard it, and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have sounded different if the Court had really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meant that in every case where the question was, is this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

politics or is this race, there was a requirement to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present maps.  That passage just would have read a lot 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently. 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  I respectfully disagree, 

    

 

 

Justice Kagan, for at least two reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

One is, there was direct evidence in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cromartie II; and, indeed, the direct evidence is eerily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

similar.  In Cromartie II, you had evidence that the map 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawer -- drawer himself had taken race into account 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the treatment of the African-American community in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Greensboro, which is Guilford County. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  In talking about that, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

guess that's why I say I was the problem. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.)

JUSTICE BREYER:  What I wrote was in a case 

   

   

  

 

 

 

6 

such as this one.  And then people can argue:  What does 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that mean, "in a case such as this one"? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  By the time we reach the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alabama case, there is a need seen by a majority of the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court to try to bring clarity.  We're speaking as a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court.  Not every individual gets his own way, or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should. 

            

And so if we go back into an area and try to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reconcile the cases and try to come up with, in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complicated area, a set of standards that will prevent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

us from being -- turning into the nineteenth court of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence to consider some highly detailed matters and so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forth, you know, all the problems here, I would take 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- or at least I'd start taking that last case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the -- the Alabama case, as at least trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set the way in which a district court should go about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deciding a case such as this one. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, just --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Do I not do that? 

   

  

 

 

 

MR. CLEMENT:  No, in the following respect, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

which is Alabama and Cromartie II are different cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

MR. CLEMENT:  And I'll take your point that

Alabama is this Court's last, best guidance on how to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

deal with a case like Alabama and like Congressional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

District 1 where you have a State that says, why did we 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do it?  The Voting Rights Act made us do it.  We did it. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We wanted to draw a majority-minority district. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

But Cromartie II is this Court's last and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

best word on cases like this, where the State says, why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did we do it?  Politics.  We don't want to -- we looked 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the benchmark map.  The benchmark map had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congressional District 1 over, which was here a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

majority-minority district, or at least close.  And we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted to preserve that as majority-minority district. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We know how to tell you when we're taking race into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account.  We -- we've said we're doing it.  We're not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

playing hide the ball here.  We did it with respect to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CD1.  And when it comes to CD12, we look at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benchmark map.  That's a political draw. 

   

  

 

 

            

            

Would it be --

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the question is:  Is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

it?  Right?  I mean, that's the question that the 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

district court was trying to answer.  Is it politics or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is it race?  If it's politics, it's fine; if it's race, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's not. 

 

            

And -- and so let's just take a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical.  Not this case, but let's take a

hypothetical, which is:  A State really does decide to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

do race-based districting.  Says, we want to segregate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all the African-American voters; this is the way we want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do it.  But then they say, well, we'll -- we'll --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we'll justify it based on politics, because that sounds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better, right? 

 

            

So -- and -- but -- but there's lots of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct evidence that, in fact, the justification is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

politics, but the true reason is race. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, were you suggesting when you stood --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when -- when -- in -- in -- in your -- in your first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statements there, were you suggesting that even if a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff comes in and has all this direct evidence that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are really trying to do race, that the plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to present its own maps? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  And I would say yes.  And I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

would say why not?  I mean, we're talking about a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation where the plaintiff is going and asking a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal court, in this case after they've already asked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State court and lost -- I'll get into that later 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe.  But we're asking a Federal court to say and hold 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that a sovereign State legislature that says it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

politics was dissembling, and it's actually race. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's a big thing to ask of a Federal court. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

It's a unique thing in these Cromartie II 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

cases, which is different from what you're asking a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

Federal court to do, when the State is forthright that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we took race into account to comply with the Voting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rights Act. 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it's also a big thing to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

ask plaintiffs to come in with their own maps, if they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have direct evidence that the State is doing race-based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather than politics-based districting. 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I'm -- I guess I'm a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

little less troubled by being demanding of plaintiffs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than I am of putting sovereign State legislatures in a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficult position.  And if there's all that direct 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence, gosh, I think the alternative map drawing is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to be a breeze.  I mean, if -- you know, if there 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really -- all this direct evidence that this was really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about race and -- and -- and the idea that this was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about politics is just a pretext, I think it's going to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

be easy as pie to show, well, actually, right here you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could have drawn this map differently and you would not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have taken race into account. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Not so easy, because we know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that race and politics correlate.  And the question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- is not -- I mean, that's just a fact of the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter.  But we've said, notwithstanding that, if race 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is your motive, you get one result; and if politics is

your motive, you get another result. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So these maps are actually hard to do, given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the extent of correlation there is, but direct evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of race-based -- which, I have to say, there really is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

some in this case, because the principal line-drawer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, they told me to get above 50 percent BVAP --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct evidence, you know, that basically makes the case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for somebody. 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Your Honor, just to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear, that -- that -- the direct evidence of the map 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawer actually is incredibly helpful for my clients as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to CD12, because the same guy who had no problem saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as to CD1, it's above 50.1 percent, also testified that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he had exactly the opposite instructions for drawing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CD12, and that when he drew the map he didn't even look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at racial data.  He looked at the 2008 presidential 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

election and the political results from that, and drew 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the map in order to bring in Democrat voters and exclude 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Republican voters.  So -- and -- and that's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Didn't --

  

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Didn't he say that he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

was told specifically to not consider race except with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to Guilford County?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Which is probably the 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

most important piece of this discussion. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  No, that's not what he said. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

He didn't say -- he -- he basically was -- said, look, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do it as a political draw, and then you're going to have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to, essentially, check what you did in Guilford County 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the African-American community, because Guilford 

 

 

 

 

 

County is a covered jurisdiction. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We can go back to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

original deposition testimony, which is what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court -- I think what the court below relied 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on. 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely.  But you look at 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that deposition testimony and you look at his testimony 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at trial and it all fits together, because he -- and, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again, he never says, oh, well, actually, when it came 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Guilford County, I turned off the political screen on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my map-drawing software and picked up the race-drawing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

screen. 

            

What he did is, the whole time he drew the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maps, he had political data up there.  Precisely because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race and politics are highly correlated, he drew the map 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to draw the Democrats in and the Republicans out.  Then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he checked his work specifically with respect to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guilford County, and he did treat Guilford County

differently, and he should have because Guilford County 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

is the only covered jurisdiction in CD12.  And he looked 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and he said, all right.  I got the African-American 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

community together.  I don't have a problem. 

    

   

 

 

            

Well, my friends on the other side want to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take -- whatever quibble there is about Guilford County, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's essentially uncontroverted here that with respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to every other part of the map, race wasn't taken into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account at all.  It's essentially uncontroverted because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

nobody says he turned the political stuff off for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guilford County.  So all he did is he did a crosscheck 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as to Guilford County to make sure there wasn't a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retrogression problem with Guilford County, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly what he should do, by the way.  But talk about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eerie similarities. 

 

              

I mean, it was Guilford County and it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Greensboro and Cromartie II, and what this Court said in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving that direct evidence relatively minimal weight 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was to say, well, you know, if you look at the rest of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that e-mail, the map drawer was very candid about taking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race into account in drawing CD1 and was much -- there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much less race involved in CD12 so it didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predominate. 

            

Again, the -- the similarities could not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more dead-on with this case.  So the most you can get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

13 

out of Guilford County is that race was taken into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account in some way that did not make it predominate, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the same evidence here as in Cromartie II, that, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you contrast the way the legislature proceeded with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to CD1 and CD12, it's virtually impossible to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that this was all a pretext. 

   

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, you know, I -- I understand why you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

want to search a little bit more when you have a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature who comes up with these racial maps and they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, as to all of it, race had nothing to do with it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But when the legislature repeatedly says we treated CD12 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently from CD1, I would think that you would want 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty substantial evidence before you second-guess that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion and overrode it.  And I would think that you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would want the maps --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But isn't -- isn't it --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  You would want the maps.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

if I could just --

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Isn't there substantial 

  

 

 

 

evidence that Congressman Watt comes in and he sits on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the witness stand and he says, I had a conversation with 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the map drawer and the map drawer said that my bosses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

told me I have to get up over 50.1 percent black votes. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  So it --

evidence.  A Congressman says -- reports on a direct 

    

   

 

 

 

 

conversation he's had with the map drawer, who -- who --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

who says he has received orders from on high.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, no.  He -- see, that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the thing.  I mean, there's a dispute whether that 

    

   

 

 

 

 

conversation ever took place. 

 

 

 

            

In the -- in the record in this case, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have Senator Rucho, who protests that that's not what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened.  You also have another witness.  That's all in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the record here. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But wasn't there a 

  

 

 

 

 

credibility finding?  Didn't the district judge say --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the three-justice court say they credited Watt and not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rucho? 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  They -- they -- they did say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, but that only gets you to the point that -- okay. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I mean, maybe -- even if Rucho said that, it didn't get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

translated to the map drawer.  Rucho and Lewis make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

multiple public statements that say that CD12 is not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial draw; it's a political draw. 

   

 

 

 

            

You look at all the other evidence here --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and let me get back to the maps, because here's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing.  I mean, you didn't just make that stray comment 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Cromartie II.  You did it after your analysis in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion where you looked at the maps, because they --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

it -- it wasn't like the problem in Cromartie II was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

they didn't have alternative maps. 

 

 

 

 

            

The problem was in -- in Cromartie II, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they had the alternative maps and they showed that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are very, very useful just because race and politics are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so highly correlated.  So when you try to draw an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative map, as in Cromartie II, and it's like, oh, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess what?  You can get a better racial balance only if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you pair two incumbents?  Like --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I understand the problem of 

    

 

 

 

 

Cromartie II.  I understand it.  Believe me.  And I -- I 

    

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

think that the problem in Cromartie II is it doesn't say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in all cases.  I mean, it's pretty clear.  It's -- I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

write that for a purpose.  You know, the Court writes, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it says in a case like this one, it's a little 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguous, but it means it. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. CLEMENT:  We --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  By the time as time 

  

 

 

 

 

 

progresses, as time progresses, we face what you see and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I see as the problem right now, which is a set of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards that district courts can't apply, which will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

try to separate sheep from goats, without us spending 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the entire term reviewing 5,000-page records.  Right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

That is a problem that you have by the time 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we -- pretty clear, by the time we get to the later

cases.  So I don't know. 

   

  

 

16 

              

I understand your argument.  I understand 

    

 

 

your argument.  I'll go back and look at it.  You think 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's absolutely determinative, the Cromartie II.  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not so sure. 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  I think it's determinative, 

    

 

 

 

because you didn't just say "in a case such as this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one."  You said "in a case such as this one where" it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a majority-minority district or a close approximation, 

   

 

 

 

 

and race and politics are closely correlated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I'll even give you a third criteria, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

which is in the cases where the -- the legislature's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stated goal was politics, not race.  And so it's -- you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely said it, but you are also absolutely right, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and before you decide whether it's sheep or goats, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it's perfectly fair to say that there are two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

breeds here, generally. 

 

 

            

There are the cases where -- and the more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common ones, the Alabama cases, the Shaw cases, those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are all cases where the State comes in and CD1 -- which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'll talk about in a minute.  Those are all cases where 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State comes in and says, yep, it was race.  It was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race because of the Voting Rights Act.  We don't think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race predominated.  And if it did, we survived strict 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scrutiny.

Alderson Reporting Company

But there's a whole separate class of cases, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

17 

the smaller cases, where the State comes in and says it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't race at all; it was politics.  And sure, they're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

highly correlated, but it was politics.  And it's very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sensitive cases for the State, because if the State does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, as this case shows, if they lose because they --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're found to have dissembled, they don't even get to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the second half of the case, because I can't come up 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here and argue that it was politics, not race.  But if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you think we're lying, by the way, we narrowly tailored. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I mean, you don't have that opportunity.  And so there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to be a very high threshold. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

And Cromartie II addresses those cases like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a laser beam.  If you want to give guidance to the lower 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts, don't tell them you faked them out in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cromartie II.  I mean, say that you are going to stick 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with that and identify this class of cases and say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the test for those kind of cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And it's -- it's not the world's, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

biggest burden to come up with an alternative map.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if the alternative map shows that the way that you take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race -- rather, politics into account to the same extent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without -- with -- with better race is by pairing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incumbents or making a district that looks like this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

look like this -- which is exactly what you found in

Cromartie II.  You looked at those alternative maps, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

they weren't, you know -- I mean, you know, it was not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond the ken of man to come up with alternative maps 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in that case.  The problem with alternative maps in that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case is that they actually showed that the legislature 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was exactly right. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What you want me to say is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even though the district court listened to the map 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawer and believed him, and his statements are pretty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much against you, and then they heard two of the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

senators, and they were pretty much against you, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's up to the district court to evaluate the strength 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of witnesses, and came to the conclusion on the basis of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact that, in fact, it was -- race was really the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explanation. 

            

Despite that, everyone who comes in has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have an alternative map.  And, of course, if we have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

five intervenors and so forth, we're going to have five 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or six different alternative maps drawing 400 -- I don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, a hundred State legislatures and so forth. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

That's what I'm supposed to say? 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, first of all, I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think that the direct evidence here is of a character 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is materially different from Cromartie II itself. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I would say that, look, you're trying to give

district courts directions for a whole bunch of cases. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

Everybody is going to be able to say, I have direct 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence.  There's obviously going to be some direct 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence.  The quality and character of it is going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differ from case to case. 

 

 

 

 

            

But what I think you should do is in this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class of cases, where the State's defense is politics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not race, is all five intervenors can get together, pool 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the costs, which are going to be minimal, give me at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least one alternative map that shows that you can do the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same political thing without a comparable effect on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

race. 

              

I don't think that's too much to ask.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it would make your jurisprudence much more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrable.  It would also have the virtue of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

applying stare decisis, because you did say it in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cromartie II. 

 

            

And again, you know, every one of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's cases says that this is an extremely difficult 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business, that it's an inherently legislative business, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it is a humbling and big thing to have a court 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second-guess these decisions. 

 

 

            

So I think in a world like that, especially 

   

   

 

 

 

 

when you've already said it, to say that there is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative map requirement as a gatekeeping function,

to guide a district court, to give the district court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same tools you used in Cromartie II, to say, ah, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, it's easy to say that there was a pretext, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

when I actually look at this -- you know, and I'm going 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- I'm going to -- at the end of the day, I mean, I'm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to look at the alternative map in conjunction with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the direct evidence, the circumstantial evidence, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm at least going to be guided by something that says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, there was another way to do this, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really does make me think that this direct evidence is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot more probative than it might otherwise, because I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see there was an easy alternative. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But --

  

 

 

MR. CLEMENT:  If they really just wanted to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

help the Democrats hurt the Republicans or vice versa --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. --

  

 

 

MR. CLEMENT:  -- they could have done it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with a completely different racial balance. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What do we do with our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statements in Miller, that what the evil we're trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address is the use of race?  And once it's met, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't need a manifestation of it.  You need just the use 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of race.  Does it predominate?  That's the evil the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution is intended to avoid. 

 

 

 

 

            

See, your way is to say that State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

legislatures go out and always say it's politics, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

because it's real easy to say politics, even though 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a lot of direct evidence that it really was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race, and put the added burden on a plaintiff now to do 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a map where you'll come up and say on their map, oh, ah, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this takes care of this problem, but there's another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political reason for not doing it that way.  There's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another political reason for not doing it this way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's impossible to ask a plaintiff to come up with a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race-neutral map in light of the entire region. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The issue is, are the State legislators 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibited from using race predominantly?  And if they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are and the proof is they have, then they should go back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the drawing board and do it without it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Your Honor, I think 

   

  

 

 

 

that, sure, at the end of the day in these districts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where you basically have one party saying it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

politics and the other party is saying it's race, you do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately have to have a mechanism for determining 

   

 

 

 

 

 

which one it was. 

 

 

 

            

And our humble point is everybody agrees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they're highly correlated.  That certainly creates 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the possibility for abuse, so we're not saying there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't be any test.  What we're saying is that, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, this is a difficult thing.  It is a particularly

damning thing to say that a State legislature, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

22 

especially when they're being candid about their use of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race of CD1, to say that they were dissembling is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty big thing.  And it's going to be the only issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the case because there isn't going to be any strict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scrutiny to fix it on the back end because they're going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to say we don't take race into account at all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

To simply say -- and it's certainly not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond the ken of man or woman or anyone else to come up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with an alternative map, and it's not just you're doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it to be mean or imposing costs.  They're actually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceedingly useful for the analysis.  And you only have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to look at the Cromartie II opinion to show how they can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really show, well, yeah, if you do that, you're going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elongate it.  And that's not going to be the case in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every case.  In some cases, you'll be able to come up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with a perfectly functional alternative map. 

   

 

 

 

            

If I could turn my attention now to CD1, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is an issue -- which is a case that is more like 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Virginia districts in the sense that here it is, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the avowed use of race in order to preserve a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority-minority district. 

 

            

Now, as to this one in particular, we think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the district court erred in applying strict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scrutiny simply based on essentially the adoption of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

BVAP floor of 50.1 percent.  But the easiest way to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

affirm is probably to do what the North Carolina Supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court did in the parallel State litigation, which it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also confronted a district court that applied strict 

   

 

 

 

 

 

scrutiny because a BVAP floor was applied.  But the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

lower court there had said, but applying strict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scrutiny, we think this is narrowly tailored. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The North Carolina Supreme Court said, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, the district court screwed up on finding strict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scrutiny triggered, but nevertheless, we agree this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrowly tailored.  And I think you could do the same 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing here, obviously if you're reversing the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court on the legal judgment about narrow tailoring, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it may be the easiest way to decide CD1. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Because here, the map drawers -- of course, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they admitted they took race into account, but they were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealing with a difficult problem, which is they had a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benchmark map that had CD1 as a majority-minority 

   

 

 

 

 

 

district.  Now it was -- to be sure, it was a coalition 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district.  It was at about 48 -- a little bit north of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 percent BVAP, but it had also lost 97,000 votes.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so they want to preserve it as a majority-minority 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

district. 

            

Based on their reading of Strickland and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some other things, they say, you know, the safest way

Alderson Reporting Company

for us to do this is to get it over 50.01 percent.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

we're going to tell the map drawer that we want this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over 50.01 percent.  The map drawer gets that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction and draws a district that ends up at about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52.6 percent. 

 

            

Now, the very fact that it's at 52 and not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50.1 shows that it's not like this ratio was preserved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over everything else, but also I think it's worth in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case in particular to understand it's not like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a myriad ways to do what the map drawer did in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this situation.  There are really two opportunities. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

You could either draw the district to get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of Wake County, and that would get you over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50 percent, or you could go into the city of Durham and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get over 50 percent that way.  The first time the map 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawer drew the map, he drew it in Wake County; got to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50 percent that way.  There was some back-and-forth with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Representative Butterfield and the like, and they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided, you know, okay, we'll do the Durham County.

circumstances does Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

require that a contiguous district be drawn in order to

race and then you have to comply with strict scrutiny.

or contiguous district? 

 

 

25 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  I think it requires a 

    

 

 

 

 

reasonably contiguous district.  And I think -- I mean, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

this is a situation where, you know, this was -- you had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- you had a more compact district.  And in order to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get either Wake County or Durham, you'd essentially have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to extend the district to capture those territories. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The one thing I'd say before I sit down, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional thing I'd say before I sit down about CD1 is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think very telling to look at Representative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Butterfield's testimony in the record here, because what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the lower court found is that the reason that we lost on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strict scrutiny was there was not racially polarized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voting in CD1, or more particularly, the State hadn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done enough to show that. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, nobody thinks that there isn't racially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

polarized voting in CD1.  They don't think that.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think we didn't do enough to prove it, but they don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think.  Representative Butterfield doesn't think that, 

  

 

 

 

 

and he was the incumbent in that district. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The dispute is not over whether there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racially polarized voting.  It's whether, well, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

know, as -- as Representative Butterfield testified, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's -- it's -- it's got to be at least 45 percent.  46 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or 47 is probably better.  It couldn't go south of

45 percent. 

 

            

Representative Butterfield says that fully 

 

 

 

 

two-thirds of white voters will never vote for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

African-American candidate in CD1.  So he admits this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

26 

racially polarized voting. 

 

 

            

So all this comes down to, it's not about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether we like racial targets or we don't like racial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

targets.  It's whether you're going to give the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature the flexibility to choose between 47 or 48, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the one hand, or 50.1 or 52, on the other.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference to legislature means anything that has to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within the deference -- the -- the zone of deference.

talk about CD1. 

 

 

            

The problem that the State has in CD12 is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the finding of predominance was more than amply

supported by the record that the trial court found, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are under a clear error standard. 

   

 

 

 

 

27 

            

The question as, Justice Breyer, you -- you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed out is whether race was a dominant and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

controlling factor in moving a significant number of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

voters in or out.  And it seems that the primary defense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the -- that the State has, in trying to overturn 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the decision of the lower court, is that an alternative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

map was not introduced. 

 

 

 

            

While certainly an alternative map is a way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to adduce evidence, it can't be that it's the only way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to adduce evidence.  There are all manner of ways to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove that race predominated.  I would point out that we 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offered no alternative map in the last case.  I would 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point out that we offered no alternative map in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Personhuballah, which was the case you heard earlier 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this year. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why not? 

  

 

 

 

MR. ELIAS:  Because in each of these cases, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and in Alabama, they offered no alternative map.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each of these cases, there was no need to provide an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative map to prove circumstantially what amply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existed directly.  It is not true that the State of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alabama, in that case, or the State of Virginia, in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, did not assert political motives as a defense to

some of the districts.  I actually --

    

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Did they -- did they in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 

respect to this district, District 12?  Because when I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go back to Cromartie II, I think he's right.  It does 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say that at least where the evidence is close, where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a close question, where one side is saying it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial, the other side is saying it's political, then it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says the party attacking the legislature's boundaries 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to show that the legislature could have achieved its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are equally consistent with traditional principles. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, it does say that. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  It does, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So what -- what -- what is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it that you suggest?  My having been quite strong for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following stare decisis in this, but what do you suggest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about that?  Are you going to say this isn't a close 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case? 

            

MR. ELIAS:  I --

    

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Are you going to say we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

should overrule that?  What -- what is it you want to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say? 

            

MR. ELIAS:  I would say two things, Justice 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer. 

            

The first is, I'm taking issue when they

suggest that trial courts are confused and that this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

a reversal on trial -- of the trial courts.  The trial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court in North Carolina was not confused that a map was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not required.  The trial court in Virginia was not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confused. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Explain why isn't -- not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

map, but some kind of -- of evidence that they could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have achieved their political objectives with less 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reliance on race.  That's what it seems to say. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. ELIAS:  I think, Your Honor --

    

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Are you saying it doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

really say that?  You could say -- I mean, there are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many things you might say.  I'm not suggesting the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer.  I want to know what you do say.  Or you could 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, it doesn't matter because we have a -- a -- giving 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weight to the district court doesn't matter, isn't that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important.  But I don't want to suggest something.  I'm 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

not. 

            

            

think. 

            

MR. ELIAS:  Your -- Your --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I want to hear what you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

MR. ELIAS:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think that 

    

  

 

 

 

 

Cromartie -- the language in Cromartie that is being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focused on is discussing the -- the -- that case, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case in which, as you say, there were lots of maps.

That was a -- fundamentally a maps case, where there --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

where each side is proving their case through maps, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principally through circumstantial evidence of what was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

in various versions of maps. 

 

 

 

 

            

In that case, where we're offering a lot of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

maps on both sides, you at least have to offer one that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shows you -- you achieved the -- the goals, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political goals, without -- without -- without race 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predominating. 

              

I would point out as a -- as an important 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

footnote, the State -- on remand, the State of North 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Carolina actually did draw a remedial map in this case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So it's not a hypothetical whether they could draw a map 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that achieved their political goals that did not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gerrymander based on race, because, in fact, the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of North Carolina, after this, drew a map of -- validly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on political data, not using race data, and, in fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drew this district at a lower BVAP and yet protected the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Republican nature of the district. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Did they say that that map 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

served political ends to the same degree as the map 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's before us? 

 

 

            

Honor --

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  I don't know what it -- Your 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  If they -- if they didn't

say, then --

 

 

            

            

MR. ELIAS:  That's --

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- the fact they were able 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to draw another map doesn't -- doesn't really prove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything. 

            

If -- if a legislature says, this was done 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

on -- based on politics, and there's no way we could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have achieved our political objective without doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this, they can't prove a negative. 

   

 

 

 

            

So it makes sense to turn to the other side 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and say, prove that that's wrong.  Prove that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political ends could be served without taking -- without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawing the map that was -- that was before -- that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that was drawn. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  Your Honor, I think the problem 

   

  

 

 

 

 

with the reading -- that reading and the reading that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being offered, is it puts the constitutional cart before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the horse.  The -- the -- the harm is in using race as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the predominant factor.  There is no constitutional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

right to political gerrymandering that has to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protected.  What has to be protected is voters' 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights --

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, but the question is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what was the basis for it?  Was it politics, as they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, or was it race?

MR. ELIAS:  Precisely, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

32 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So if there isn't -- if no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one can point to a way of achieving the political 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objective, other than through the map that was drawn, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then that's evidence that politics was the reason for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it. 

            

MR. ELIAS:  It -- Your Honor, it may be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence of it.  It may also be evidence of race serving 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a proxy for partisanship, which is not permissible. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

But even if it's not that, Your Honor, it may be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence.  But that doesn't mean there can't be other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence --

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  Well, would you --

  

  

 

 

 

 

MR. ELIAS:  -- on the other side. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Would you accept that a map 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is necessary, except in a case where there is quite 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strong evidence --

 

 

            

            

            

MR. ELIAS:  I don't -- I --

    

   

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- that race was the basis? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. ELIAS:  I don't think that this Court 

    

 

 

 

 

 

needs to define out the strength of the evidence.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it's evidence.  I think a map is evidence.  I 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

think direct testimony is evidence.  I think, like most 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

trials, it's a mosaic.  It's not a -- it's not a smoking

evidence in this case --

 

 

 

 

33 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, how much weight do you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think the absence of a map is entitled to? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  I think the absence of a map is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to no weight.  I think that the fact that there 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a -- that there is a map that -- that was enacted is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously -- is obviously -- and the evidence that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adduced at trial that race and party correlate to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

large degree is obviously evidence that it was -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was political. 

 

 

            

But in this case, look at what it is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rucho and Lewis said.  Before we get to Hofeller, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

map drawer, let's talk about what they said, what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sponsors said.  Quote, "Because of the presence of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guilford County" -- this is not descriptive.  This is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because, but for.  "Because of the presence of Guilford 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

County in the 12th District, we have drawn our proposed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12th District at a black voting age level that is above 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the percentage of black voting age population found in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the current 12th District." 

 

 

 

            

That is the statement from the sponsors that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was race. 

 

 

            

What did -- what did the expert say?  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert said in his expert report -- and this is

African-American community in Guilford County.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

could avoid the possibility of a charge of fracturing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that" -- "fracturing our community and inhibiting

Section 5.  This extension of the New 12th District

"caused the circumscribing circle around the district to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

increase in diameter and lower the Reock Score." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I think the -- the evidence 

    

 

 

 

 

 

with respect to Guilford County is your strongest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence; but beyond that, the rest of it is not very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strong. 

            

MR. ELIAS:  Your Honor, but that is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

where the -- where race predominated.  Race 

  

 

 

 

 

 

predominated -- your -- in a district -- Justice Breyer, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to a question you asked in the last -- in the last case, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this was a district that was overpopulated by 2,800 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

people.  2,800 people.  This was -- this was almost 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

spot-on one-person, one-vote.  And yet they moved 75,000 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

African-Americans into the district. 

 

 

 

            

So to say, well, Guilford County, is that my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strongest case -- yes, that is, in fact, where they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moved.

wanted to put all of their eggs in the -- so to speak, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the politics, not race basket, or whether their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert wouldn't support that this was actually necessary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to comply with the Voting Rights Act, I don't know.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they -- but that was not their argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It's also important, Your Honor, though to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

realize that the evidence doesn't stop there.  You have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mel Watt, who it did -- who by the time he testifies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before the district court, he's out of Congress.  He has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no stake in this district one way or the other for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

himself.  Okay.  He has moved on to the administration 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and -- and an after -- and a life after electoral 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

politics.  And he says he's told that the reason why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this happened was that -- that -- that it had to ramp up

36 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I think they -- they did 

    

 

 

 

 

 

make the case.  They said, yeah, we did that, and the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason we did it is most of the African-American voters 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vote for Democrats --

 

 

 

            

            

MR. ELIAS:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and we want to get all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Democratic voters in one district, so the 15 that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are Republican.  That's just what the Democrats did last 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time.  And yet that -- that's the kind of argument that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they make. 

 

            

            

            

MR. ELIAS:  What it -- what --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What about that? 

  

 

 

 

MR. ELIAS:  What Mel Watt was told is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he, as a respected African-American, was going to be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

expected to sell to the African-American community. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's what he said. 

 

 

 

            

He's going to be expected to sell to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

African-American community that this needed to be over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50 percent to comply with the VRA.  And you know what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mel Watt said in his testimony?  You should read it.  He 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laughed.  And he said it's not possible, because the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people in this district will know that there isn't a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason why this has to go above 50 percent to comply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the Voting Rights Act. 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

The trial court also discounted the 

 

 

 

 

 

37 

testimony that you -- that -- that my -- my good friend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and colleague has -- has suggested was offered by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

map drawer, Mr. Hofeller, about what he was told and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he only used -- that he turned off race and he only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used partisanship.  That whole -- that whole analysis, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court didn't credit.  Didn't credit.  Said 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that I -- I heard the testimony.  I did what a trier of 

    

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

fact did.  I listened to the live witnesses, and I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't credit it.  It wasn't believable. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, can I go back to -- to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congressman Watt's testimony?  Now, you referred to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

something other than what I thought you highlighted in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

your brief. 

 

            

What you highlight in your brief is double 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearsay:  Congressman Watt said Rucho told him that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody else told him something, and none of those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people is actually the person who drew the map.  Now, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't even know whether any of that is admissible to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove the truth of the matter.  But if it is, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty weak evidence. 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  Well, Your Honor, it was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

admitted.  All -- there was no objection to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence.  And it is evidence that the trial court, in

front of it, credited as important evidence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38 

            

So I understand -- obviously, the Supreme 

   

 

 

 

 

Court, you can -- you can do whatever you want, but I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that the role of an appellate court is to look at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the triers of fact and say, look, you weighed the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credibility of this, and whether it sounded like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attenuated double hearsay or whether it sounded --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against all of the rest of the evidence, it sounded like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that is believable when judging demeanor and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- and the like. 

 

 

 

 

            

The other thing that I think is -- here, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is -- that is overlooked is, look at what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual number came in at.  Right?  Isn't it coincident 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that politics drove the map, and yet it wound up with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- with a -- with a BVAP of 50.66.  Isn't that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

coincident?  Shocking that they turned off political --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they turned off racial data, and they drew a map, and it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just so happened that it came in at 50.66.  That's not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coincidence.  And the trial court was entitled to not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find it to be a coincidence. 

   

 

 

 

            

But the fact that the number that ultimately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

came in was -- was just a hair above, above -- a hair 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above the threshold for a Section 2 VRA district is not 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

coincidence.  It's further evidence that race -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

race predominated.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Elias, I'd like to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ask you about the procedural issue in this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. ELIAS:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There was another case --

  

 

 

 

 

 

39 

it was in the State court -- the same issues; just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided the opposite way.  We're hearing this case, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you are urging that the plain error to your error is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- is the legal standard by which we should judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the three-judge court did.  But if we had the State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case before us, I suppose their findings would also be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judged by the clear error standard. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It's just -- isn't that so?  That if the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if the -- if the State case that went the other way came 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to us, we would look at that and say, no clear error? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  Your Honor, I think two 

   

  

 

 

 

responses.  First is, the -- the Court applies clear 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error to the case before it where there's a finding of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact by the trier of fact.  And that's the -- that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules of -- of appellate procedure.  That's what this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has done for many, many years, and it is what my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clients are entitled to. 

 

 

 

            

This is their case.  They brought this case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

They are entitled to have it adjudicated under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

normal rules, the well-established principles of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but Justice Ginsburg 

  

 

 

 

 

40 

can pursue and protect her own question.  What's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sustained is a matter of just luck of the draw and --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it's true that the State case was first. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  Well, so -- and the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second point I would make -- I said there were two 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

points. 

            

The second point I would make, Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

Kennedy, is that the State case was really quite a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different case, in several respects. 

 

 

 

 

            

First of all, the State case was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predominantly -- to use a word that's come up a lot, was 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predominantly about the State lines.  Yes, they were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenging the congressional districts, but most of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony in that case actually didn't relate to these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two congressional districts.  It actually related to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

State districts, number one. 

 

 

 

            

Number two is, there are not the findings of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact in the Dixon case, the case -- the State case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There are not the specific findings of fact about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credibility of witnesses that are found in this opinion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So this -- this -- this trial court was very meticulous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in laying out what facts they found most credible, what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they were relying upon. 

 

 

 

            

The -- the State court action was much more

conclusory in that regard, in part because, frankly, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was dealing with a mountain of evidence around the State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative and the State Senate -- the State Senate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts. 

            

And then finally I would say, Your Honor, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

there are other judicial mechanisms available to this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court and to district courts generally to control --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to handle the question of -- of multiple cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moving through the system. 

 

 

 

            

Congress made a -- a decision that in the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

cases of statewide redistricting, there would be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expedited process for cases to move up through the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal system to the Supreme Court.  Whether that was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good policy on the part of Congress or bad policy on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of Congress, it was a policy decision on the part 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Congress, that those -- that cases that come up out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Federal courts come from a three-judge panel on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct appeal to this Court. 

 

 

 

 

            

And the other -- the other case -- the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case goes through the normal cert channel, and this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court might choose to hear it; it might not to choose to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hear it.  But that's not an accident.  That's not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fortune.  That is actually a deliberate decision that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Congress made in structuring -- structuring the review. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And then finally I'd say is that this is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

question of the application of Federal law and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

Federal Constitution.  Our -- our claims are, in fact, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal constitutional claims.  The defenses are largely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

under the Voting Rights Act, and it -- there is no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason why this Court wouldn't give the same normal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weight to a Federal three-judge panel in the finding of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts in those kinds of case -- cases and somehow defer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- defer to --

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's not a question 

   

  

 

 

 

of deferring.  It's a recognition that the State courts 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

have an obligation to construe the Federal Constitution 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the same extent the Federal courts do.  I would have 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought that was a pretty well-established principle. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  They do, Mr. Chief Justice, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is also an equally well-established principle that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court judges findings the fact by lower courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under clear error. 

 

 

            

            

Whatever the State of North Carolina --

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

seem responsive to the point you just made, which I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood to be that we ought to give greater deference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the Federal court's findings and rulings than we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would with respect to a decision from a State court. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  Then I misspoke, Your Honor. 

   

  

 

 

 

I'm not saying we should give greater deference.  I'm

saying we should follow the rules.  We should follow the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary rules, the ordinary course, which is the case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is before you is the -- is the case before you, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the findings of fact by the trial court in this case are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the findings of fact that are entitled to clear error. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What I was -- what I think I was trying to 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

address is, there are circumstances, for example, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- in the grow situation where you have a deadlock 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where there is no map before a State court.  I'm sorry. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's no map because the map's either been deadlocked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or it's been thrown out.  There, the -- the Court has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, well, let's let the State courts go first, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're exercising a policy judgment in the State. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's not present here.  Here, it's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Constitution and it's the Federal -- Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Voting Rights Act.  So there really is no unique State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perspective that ought to cause you to overturn 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

100-plus, 200-plus years of jurisprudence about 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs having a right to have their case heard. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think we should give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

any consideration to the State court decision, or should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we proceed as if it never occurred? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  I think you can read that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

decision in the way in which you would read any other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision of a lower court that may be of interest to the

Court.  So I don't think it is entitled to any more or 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less deference than a -- you know, than a -- the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court that it may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have had in a -- in a racial gerrymandering case from 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

1998.  You know, it -- it -- it certainly can -- can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inform you, but it is -- you know, can inform your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinking of the -- of -- of the case, but I don't think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the findings of fact are entitled to any weight in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  I think the clear error standard applies. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

With respect to a seat in Congressional 

   

 

 

 

 

District 1, I just, because my time is about to expire, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to make the point that this was just a clear error 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of law.  The Court found -- the Court relied on an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorrect reading of Bartlett.  That led it to believe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it needed to destroy a crossover district, which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- which is what it did, where there was no evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of racially polarized voting actually preventing 

 

 

 

 

 

African-Americans from electing a candidate of their 

   

 

 

 

 

choice. 

              

I appreciate your indulgence.  Thank you. 

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

MS. SAHARSKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

45 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

I'd like to start with Congressional 

 

 

 

 

 

District 12.  This is the serpentine district, the one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that basically everyone agrees looks terrible, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is whether race was the predominant motive or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it was politics. 

 

 

 

            

Now, this determination, the Court has said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on numerous occasions, is one that's reviewed for clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error.  And the district had a lot of evidence before 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  It went through a three-day trial.  And I just want 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

to highlight some of the key evidence that it relied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon in making credibility determinations and in finding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that race was the predominant motive. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that starts with Congressman Watts' 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony that Rucho, who was one of the architects of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the plan, told him that they had to ramp up the minority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voting percentage in the district to over 50 percent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So that's the racial target at the starting point in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order to comply with the Voting Rights Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And then as counsel mentioned, we have that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

target being hit on the nose, 50.66 percent.  And then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have evidence, direct evidence, of the way that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State did it.  And that came from the mapmaker.  And he 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said -- although he did also say, first, that he did not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

use -- he only used politics, did not use race, he made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46 

contradictory statements and said that he did use race 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with respect to Guilford County in that he pulled the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

black population from Guilford County in order to comply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the Voting Rights Act. 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think if you looked at the record, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Breyer, you would see exactly what you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anticipated, which is that the -- that the State was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pulling in concentrations of the black voting age 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

population.  And the concentrations were so high that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that supported this inference that they really were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using race.  And there's a chart in the -- the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff's briefs and there's evidence cited in our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief that shows that you really had that concentrated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pulling in.  That's how it was done with respect to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guilford County. 

 

            

And then the last thing, and I think that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is important, is that the district court made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credibility findings that the political motive had been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discredited.  Mr. Clement is right:  There is evidence 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that was there about political motive, but the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court found that it just wasn't credible in light of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congressman Watt's testimony, which the court credited, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the target, and in light of the fact that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political testimony, which was mostly put on by the

mapmaker, had been contradicted by the mapmaker himself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

when he said that he used race and also contradicted by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the two architects of the plan, who kept trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

downplay politics in their statements. 

 

 

 

 

            

And so when we look at this, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly in light of the clear error standard, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a -- a three-judge panel that went through three 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

days' worth of evidence, made credibility findings, went 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through volumes of evidence.  And even the one judge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that disagreed with respect to this particular holding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized that what the majority did was reasonable, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referred to it as eminently reasonable, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well-reasoned opinion of the majority.  And in those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases, I just don't think that you can find clear error. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- what do you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to say about the Voting Rights -- I mean, the clear 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error standard with respect to the State court decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as well?  I mean, it is certainly something of a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fortuity that we have the Federal case before us and not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State case.  And if it were the State case, we'd be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reviewing their factual findings on the same question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for clear error.  And now you're saying, well, this one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is here, so we should apply clear error.  It seems to me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that response is not terribly helpful in addressing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the conflict that's before us.

MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, a couple of responses. 

   

  

 

 

 

48 

First of all, the way that the Court deals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with potential two-bites-at-the-apple problems is 

 

 

 

 

through the Res Judicata/Claim Preclusion and issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preclusion doctrine.  So to the extent that you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to figure out what weight, if any, the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court decision has, we think that that is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate lens because this Court --

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What does that mean? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Whichever one was decided first, or whichever one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrives here first? 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, I think you would have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to ask whether the -- the res judicata principles had --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it -- it would have been the State court being decided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first, but you have to ask whether res judicata 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles were met. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you're saying we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

should apply the res judicata principles, and that leads 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us to favor the State court? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  No, I'm not saying that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't understand. 

 

            

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  I --

    

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  State court was 

  

 

 

 

 

decided first. 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Right. 

  

 

49 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And then you say we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

should apply res judicata.  So what does that mean? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, the -- the application 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of res judicata would depend on North Carolina law in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this instance because it was a case out of the North 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Carolina courts.  And we don't have a position on the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

application of North Carolina law.  I'm just saying that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way that you deal with this question is through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application of the res judicata framework, as opposed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing something different like saying, now we won't use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear error anymore.  We'll go to de novo review or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something like that. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You want us to apply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

res judicata to decide this question, and you don't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a position on what the answer is? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, I think if the Court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

worried about the State court having some effect, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it would ask there whether there was a res judicata bar. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And there would be three hurdles, I think, that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State would have to overcome in order to prove -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order to show that there was a res judicata bar:  First 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of all, whether the argument was waived.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

addressed in the briefs. 

 

 

 

            

Second of all, whether the factual predicate

for privity that the State claims is there.  There's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also a substantial question on that. 

   

 

 

 

50 

            

And then, third, whether North Carolina law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uses a concept of privity that is very expansive, really 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond where this Court was in the Taylor v. Sturgell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision. 

            

My point is not that you need to resolve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that or that you need to decide it a certain way.  It's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just that if you're asking about, how do I -- what do I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do with the State court decision, the way that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure out what to do is by using those principles. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What you don't do is simply defer to the State court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

findings.  I don't see how you would do that, because 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case is here on appellate jurisdiction.  You need 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to decide the case before you.  And we don't think you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would do something like use de novo review, because, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after all, Rule 52, which mandates clear error factual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

findings, applies to this Court.  So I think this Court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

should decide this case as it comes to it, and with --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is with the clear error standard with respect to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

District 12. 

 

            

have --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What do you mean, you would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just on District -- just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

on District 12, you say there was racial predominance.

51 

Strict scrutiny fails because? 

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Because the State didn't give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

any reason to pass strict scrutiny.  The only potential 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason would be Section 5 that the State had, I think, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested, and that that wouldn't make sense because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 5 is to prevent retrogression, and here they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

increased the black voting age population by 7 percent. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

So it wasn't a matter of preventing retrogression. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What is your view of when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

maps should be required? 

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  So we don't read the Court's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision in Cromartie II to require a map any time a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political motive is asserted.  We take the Court at its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word in a case like this one, and that was a case of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstantial evidence of race.  There really was very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

little direct evidence of race.  The Court even put 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"direct" in quotes because it thought the direct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence was so insubstantial. 

 

 

 

            

But there was strong evidence of politics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and a correlation between race and politics.  So when 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you have the strong evidence of politics, little 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence of race, and the correlation, then we think it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made sense in the context of that particular case for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court to say, particularly since the maps were put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in.  Like, give us a -- give us an alternative that

really shows this. 

 

 

52 

            

But when you have a case, conversely, which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is a strong direct evidence of a racially predominant 

   

   

 

 

 

 

motive, it just doesn't make sense to require the map, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because what the Equal Protection Clause gives you is --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not having race being used for an unjustified reason. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's not -- the map isn't a per se.  It's just the map. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's just an evidentiary thing that you could have or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not have.  It's one type of evidence. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But if there's not strong 

  

 

 

 

 

 

direct evidence, would a map be necessary? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, we think that this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court has tried to give flexibility in terms of proving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial predominance.  So we see Cromartie as a strong 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

direct evidence of politics case. 

 

 

 

 

            

And -- and maybe one other thing that I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might say is that we just don't think that the Court --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we think the Court if it were adopting a map requirement 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for some clear set of cases, that it would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explained it in its opinion, and it would have done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something with its prior cases. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But, what -- what exactly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is going on, in part, is a very tough matter.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years -- go back years ago. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes. 

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE BREYER:  There were many States that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

53 

had many black citizens and had no black representation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and there was a thing called -- let's have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority-minority districts. 

 

            

And the problem is, how does the law permit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the creation of that, and at the same time, prevent the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of packing that might appear in other cases, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is gerrymandering?  And -- and no one, I think, has a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good answer to that question.  There is just slightly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better, slightly worse. 

 

 

            

So if you're too tough in this case in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rejecting the notion that it was politics, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correlated with race, then what's going to happen out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there to a successful effort to create majority-minority 

   

 

 

 

 

 

districts where matters change, times change, oceans 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rise, you know, et cetera?  And how do we keep -- how --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how -- how -- do you see the problem? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes.  I mean, we're very 

    

  

 

 

 

sympathetic to the States' interests.  And we think that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court has tried to be sympathetic to the States' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests.  And we think the Court has done it in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions like Alabama.  And there's two things in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular that the Court has done --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's not just the States' 

  

 

 

 

 

 

interest.  It's the constitutional interest in seeing

that minorities have representation in reality in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislatures. 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Right.  And so what this 

  

  

 

 

 

 

54 

Court has done, first of all, is to ask about racial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predominance, the first question being, was race really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the predominant motive; not just one factor, but the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predominant motive?  Show us your evidence.  And here, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the district court had the evidence. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But then the second thing is when we get to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strict scrutiny, the Court has said, give us your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justification.  And that's really, I think, the problem 

   

  

 

 

 

 

with the 1st Congressional District in this case, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the State was operating on an error of law, first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of all; and second, that it just did not provide the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justification.  And that's what the Voting Rights Act 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 2 and Section 5 focus on. 

   

   

 

 

            

It's not just -- as you said in Alabama for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court, not just picking a number out of thin air, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but showing us there's a problem here with --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

potentially with respect to retrogression.  There's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

problem here with respect to vote dilution. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And with respect to the 1st Congressional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

District in this case, there just wasn't evidence of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potential problem with vote dilution, because at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower percentage, not being a majority-minority

district, the African-American community was able to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 

elect its candidate of choice, really, on a -- on a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sustained basis over a period of many years and by wide 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

margins, so -- and this is on page 49A of the District 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's opinion -- it said, look, the State just didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make the case.  It also said the State was operating on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a mistake of law. 

 

 

 

            

And so just getting back to your question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, we -- we -- we understand that this is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somewhat delicate balance, and we think that the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has attempted to balance the important interests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protected by the Equal Protection Clause against the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern that States have and the flexibility that States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need by adopting these two different parts of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard racial predominance, and then the strong basis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in evidence for strict scrutiny. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

remaining.

A few points in rebuttal. 

 

 

 

            

First of all, it is worth recognizing that

District 12, and four out of the six said that politics, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56 

not race, prevailed.  So it's a funny sort of law that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to defer to the minority of two.  I don't think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can just ignore the State court decision on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grounds that, well, they weren't specific enough or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something. 

              

I would point you to Appendix B, 161 through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

163, which are the relevant fact findings of the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial court, where they were unanimous in finding, among 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other things, quote, "Dr. Hofeller constructed the 2011 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12th Congressional District based on whole voter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tabulation districts in which President Obama received 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the highest voter totals during the 2008 election." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The only information on the computer screen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used by Dr. Hofeller in selecting the VTDs for inclusion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 12th District was the percentage by which President 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Obama won or lost a particular VTD. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

And that -- of course, that gets to the need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for an alternative map and the difficulty here, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's all well and good to say, well, we looked at it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

afterwards, and they pulled in all these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

African-Americans.  But guess what?  They pulled them 

  

  

 

 

 

 

all as Democrats, too, because the African-Americans are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Democrats. 

            

And if you're -- and what they could have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

done, which would have been simple enough if it were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true, is to draw a map that shows, actually, Hofeller is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a liar.  He wasn't using the 2008 presidential election 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

results, because if he had used those, he would come up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57 

with a different map.  That would have been easy to do. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They didn't do that.  Any alternative map would have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

easy to do here, and they didn't do it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, they say they didn't do it in other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases as well, and I think there are two reasons that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain that, neither of which reflect particularly well 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the idea we should get rid of the map requirement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

One reason they didn't do it is because in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all of these cases, they thought that as long as they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could get the State to say, we had a BVAP floor of 50.1, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or 55 point -- percent, we've off the strict scrutiny 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

land, so we don't need a map on predominance. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's actually wrong, and I think this 

   

 

 

 

 

Court will say that's wrong. 

 

 

 

 

            

The second reason is, most of these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenges are brought by people who are at least as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned about Democratic political prospects as they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are about avoiding race.  And the problem with putting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an alternative map together is, should you actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevail, those no-good, dirty Republicans on the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side could use the map and then say, well, look, you

can't really complain about that being a partisan 

   

 

 

 

 

 

58 

gerrymander, because it was your map. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So if you really want people to bring race 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims and not dressed-up partisan claims, make them --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put them to their proof.  Make them put together an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative map that works. 

 

 

 

            

Now, as to Guilford County, there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

several responses here. 

 

 

            

First of all, it's all well and good to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they pulled in 75,000 African-Americans or hauled in all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these African-Americans.  They were all Democrats, as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

well.  And that's why, even there, if you had an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative map that showed, oh, there's a different way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do Guilford County, and that would prove -- bring in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Democrats and not bring in African-Americans, then you'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have something. 

 

            

But just the fact that they brought in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bunch of African-Americans because they were trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring in Democrats is about as interesting as the sun 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coming up in North Carolina, because everybody agrees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's about a 90 percent correlation between race and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

partisan identity. 

 

            

The second thing is, there's a very good 

   

 

 

 

 

 

reason, Justice Kagan, that we didn't make a Section 5 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense, because this wasn't a case about Guilford 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

County.  Their theory is not that we did something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nefarious in Guilford County to overly comply with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 5.  Their theory is that CD12 was drawn as a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59 

majority-minority district.  And the problem is, 

  

 

 

 

 

nothing was --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I think they would --

   

  

 

 

 

 

they did present both theories.  They said, proposed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

findings in McCrory, that it was purposely -- they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposely included a substantial number of 

   

 

 

 

African-American residents of Guilford County in CD12. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The intentional placement of a significant number of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

black voters within CD12 establishes racial 

 

 

 

 

 

predominance. 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  If I may respond:  To get them 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

to 50 percent. 

 

 

            

And here's the thing:  If they focused on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guilford County, they would have had two problems.  One, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we would have had a Section 5 defense, if that's the way 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they actually conduct the --

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yeah, but the other --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But because Senator Rucho 

  

 

 

 

 

apparently believed doing so was necessary to avoid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retrogression for Section 5 purposes.  Is that --

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Exactly, Your Honor.  Exactly, 

  

  

 

 

 

Your Honor.  If you look at everything --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You didn't respond to it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. CLEMENT:  Everything that they said 

  

 

 

 

 

60 

about CD12 was a concern about retrogression, which is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

why, when Senator Rucho talked about CD12 and -- and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Guilford County, he didn't say, and so we drew it as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a majority-minority district.  He said, and we avoided 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

any problem by making sure that we had at least a higher 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

BVAP percentage than in the benchmark map.  And that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

avoids any potential Section 5 concern with splitting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that county and putting the African-Americans in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guilford County in the neighboring CD6, which a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Republican-leaning district.  And they'd be the first to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

complain about that.
