CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

(11:06 a.m.) 

argument next in Case 11-1175, Marx v. General Revenue 

Corporation. 

Ms. Zieve. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MS. ZIEVE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Rule 54(d) provides a standard for an award 

of costs to a prevailing party that, by the Rule's 

express terms, does not apply where Federal statute 

provides otherwise.  The Fair Debt Collection Practices 

Act provides otherwise because it states a different 

rule for awarding costs than does Rule 54(d).  Whereas 

Rule 54(d) gives district courts wide discretion toward 

cost-prevailing defendants, the FDCPA limits courts' 

discretion to cases brought in bad faith and for the 

purpose of harassment. 

The text of the Act provides that, on a 

finding that action was brought in bad faith and for the 

purpose of harassment, the court may award attorneys' 

fees of reasonable relation to the work expended and 

costs.  That's a matter of grammar.  The unmistakable

meaning of that sentence is that an award of costs, like 

an award of attorney's fees, is subject to the condition 

that the plaintiff's suit be brought --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Under -- under that 

provision, that's certainly true.  You can't -- you 

can't get costs under that provision unless there has 

been that prerequisite.  But it's -- you know, it's 

ancient law that repeals by implication are not favored. 

And what you're arguing here is that that provision 

effectively repeals another provision which allows costs 

in all cases, whether or not there has been misbehavior. 

Now, why -- why is this an exception to our 

general rule?  I just don't -- this doesn't seem to me 

like a clear repealer. 

MS. ZIEVE:  Well, there's no need to 

consider repeal by implication in this case, Your Honor, 

because Rule 54(d) expressly states that its presumption 

does not apply for a Federal --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, indeed, but -- but 

you are assuming a conflict.  You're saying either 

the -- the statute applies or Rule 54(d) applies, but 

the statute can be read to say, we're describing one 

category of case, we are describing the worst case, the 

bad-faith harassing plaintiff, and the statute deals 

with that category of person and no other.

So if you're not a bad-faith harassing 

plaintiff, but you, nonetheless, lost, then you're under 

54(d). 

MS. ZIEVE:  Well, Your Honor, if you look at 

Section k(a)(3), as a whole, the two sentences together 

confirm that this is not a provision about bad-faith 

plaintiffs, that rather, the provision is addressing 

both fees and costs to -- to plaintiffs and defendants. 

And if -- if the Congress merely wanted to state in that 

second sentence that fees were available and didn't mean 

to say anything about costs to defendants, there would 

have been no reason for Congress to have put costs in 

that sentence. 

If --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, there are a number 

of reasons.  One is symmetry because they have costs in 

the part about defendants.  And the concern that, well, 

if we leave out costs for the bad-faith harassing 

plaintiff, then it -- it may be assumed that they get 

only attorney's fees and not costs. 

So the statute's provisions like this may be 

redundant, but one can see that a drafter might very 

well want to say, well, we said we're dealing with the 

defendant costs, we want to put the same thing in with a 

plaintiff.

MS. ZIEVE:  Well, you've made a few points, 

and I'll try to address each of them. 

First, there -- there would be no reason to 

include costs in the second sentence, just because it 

was in the first sentence, because the first and second 

sentences are not parallel.  The first sentence makes an 

award of costs mandatory, and, therefore, it does do 

some work beyond 54(d).  It clearly has -- has a 

function in that sentence.  Whereas the second sentence, 

the award is subject to the "may," that is, that it's 

not mandatory that the court award them. 

If -- if Congress was -- Congress would have 

no need to be concerned that if it left costs out of the 

second sentence there would be some negative implication 

because there are several statutes that mention fees 

without costs.  And GRC has cited no instance in which a 

court has read a negative implication into that. 

We, in our reply brief, cited a couple cases 

that do the opposite.  If -- so, therefore, if 

Congress had omitted costs, left it out of the sentence, 

then Rule 54(d) would have continued to apply in cases 

where the defendants. 

One more example --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Didn't -- don't district 

courts always have the authority to award costs for

sanctionable behavior like bad faith?  So this provision 

is duplicate, no matter how we read it.  It's either 

duplicative of a power the court already had to award 

costs for bad faith, or it's duplicate of Rule 54. 

MS. ZIEVE:  Well, if you read this sentence 

as a misconduct provision, then it does repeat the 

Court's inherent authority; although, as this Court has 

mentioned in a couple cases, sometimes, statutes want to 

reiterate authority that exists elsewhere. 

If you read it our way, however, the 

statute -- this provision does actually do some work 

that it wouldn't otherwise do; that is, it limits cost 

awards to prevailing defendants of these circumstances. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It limits Rule 54. 

MS. ZIEVE:  Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think your -- your 

answer is always that Rule 54 obligates courts to give 

costs.  And this rule, as you read it, is a permissive 

grant only.  Even in bad faith litigations, the court 

could choose not to give costs. 

MS. ZIEVE:  Well, Rule 54 doesn't obligate a 

court to give costs.  It establishes a presumption --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  True. 

MS. ZIEVE:  -- and this says the presumption 

is limited to cases brought in bad faith and for

purposes of harassment.  There are other statutes that 

do -- similarly, do what we've -- what's done here. 

Congress could have omitted -- if GRC is correct, 

Congress could have just omitted the words, "and costs," 

leaving the costs to be determined under Rule 54. 

An example of that is 15 U.S.C. 15c(d)(2), 

which is actions by state attorneys general and provides 

that the court may award attorney's fees to a prevailing 

defendant upon a finding that the action was in bad 

faith. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Zieve, if we look at 

other statutes, it seems to me we would want to look at 

statutes involving lenders, so we would look at the --

the Truth in Lending Act and the -- what is it, the 

Credit Organizations Act --

MS. ZIEVE:  Fair Credit? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- and those do not 

provide for attorney's fees.  They are covered only 

under 54(d), which is costs, not fees.  Why should we 

read this Act in a way that -- so -- so that a defendant 

under this Act who can get attorney's fees is worse off 

with respect to costs than defendants under the other 

lending legislation, the ones that have only 54(d)? 

Congress gave defendants something more 

here.  Why -- why would -- why should it be that 54(d)

would apply to the lender under the Truth in Lending 

Act, but not to the lender under -- under this Act? 

MS. ZIEVE:  Well, first, Your Honor, the --

Congress' purpose was not simply to -- this isn't just a 

defendant-friendly provision.  Congress had dual 

purposes in enacting k(a)(3).  On the one hand, Congress 

wanted to deter nuisance suits.  But on the other hand, 

Congress wanted to ensure that meritorious suits by 

impecunious debtors were not deterred by the prospect 

that an award of costs would exceed the value of the 

damage that could be recovered in a successful suit. 

And the two provisions of k(a)(3) show the line Congress 

drew -- drew and how it balanced those two objectives. 

As to the other statutes, the Truth in 

Lending Act, the Credit Repair Organizations Act, they 

were enacted at different times by different Congresses. 

They have different sorts of provisions, some better for 

plaintiffs, some better for defendants. 

And -- but this category -- in -- in 

enacting this statute, Congress emphasized that the 

widespread and national serious problem of collection 

abuse that Congress said inflicts substantial suffering 

and anguish, and noted specifically in the Senate report 

this Court has cited to in the Jerman case, that 

consumers, the impecunious -- the people who can't even

afford to pay their debts, are the primary enforcers of 

the statute. 

The FTC got about 120,000 complaints from 

consumers about debt collectors last year, more than any 

other industry.  So Congress may reasonably have decided 

that the primary enforcers of this statute weren't going 

to be doing that work if they were -- if they were at 

risk of significant cost awards in cases that have 

frequently small value. 

There are other ways, if Congress wanted to 

preserve Rule 54(d), that it could have done it, that 

did not happen here.  For instance, in 49 U.S.C. 

14707(c), Congress has a similar provision about 

attorney's fees to prevailing -- attorney's fees to 

prevailing parties, and then states expressly that fee 

is in addition to costs allowable under the Federal 

Rules of Civil Procedure.  Congress didn't do that here. 

Or Congress could have made it clear that it 

was not displacing Rule 54(d) as to cost awards by 

stating that the Court could award attorney's fees as 

part of the cost, therefore, distinguishing fees and 

costs.  Congress has done that sort of thing frequently, 

including in a statute that provides for an award in 

cases of bad faith. 

I'm looking at 28 U.S.C. 1875, that provides

the courts may award fees as part of costs if an action 

was frivolous or in bad faith. 

So -- but Congress did none of those things 

here.  Instead, what it did was draft a sentence that 

links the term "cost" to the term "attorney's fees" with 

the conjunction "and" and subjects both of those objects 

of the sentence to the same condition, the condition 

that the plaintiff suit was brought in bad faith and for 

purpose of harassment. 

GRC suggests that the reading -- that the 

statute the Justice mentioned -- benefits plaintiffs. 

But what Congress wanted to do here -- I mean, would 

benefit plaintiff -- what Congress wanted to do was to 

help defendants.  There's actually no legislative 

history about why this provision was put in there. 

What we have instead, for what it's worth, 

is a markup later where this provision is discussed in 

response to concerns that frivolous suits -- suits 

should be deterred, and this provision, which is now 

already in the statute, is discussed as one means of 

deterring frivolous suits. 

But the bad faith and harassment standard is 

the dividing line that Congress drew between nuisance 

suits and other suits.  This case is clearly on the 

non-nuisance side of the line, and cases on that side of

the line are not subject to an award of costs. 

If the Court has no further questions? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I would assume that, if 

Rule 54, instead of saying what it currently does, said 

something like, "except as expressly repealed in another 

statute," would what happened here meet that express 

requirement of repeal?  It was Justice Scalia's question 

to you, but reformulated in a different way. 

MS. ZIEVE:  If Rule 54(d) incorporated a 

requirement that a statute expressly referred to Rule 

54(d)? 

54(d). 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Expressly repealed 

MS. ZIEVE:  That would be a very different 

case.  But of course, Rule 54(d) doesn't do that. 

Instead, when Rule 54(d) was adopted, the Rules 

Committee actually -- the advisory committee notes list 

25 statutes that it says will not be affected by the 

rule. 

Those are statutes that allow fees, forbid 

fees, condition fees, allow fees in a broader scope of 

cases than Rule 54(d) does.  And, of course, none of 

those would have mentioned Rule 54(d) because they 

preceded adoption of the rule. 

I would reserve the balance of my time.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Feigin. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN, 

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

MR. FEIGIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

Rule 54(d) expressly codifies in absolute 

form the well-established principle that a specific 

provision displaces a more general one.  And I think 

that principle is very helpful here in answering a 

couple of the questions that have come up. 

First of all, it makes clear that no express 

textual conflict is necessary.  This Court's never 

required one, and the specific governs the general 

cases. 

That's made even clearer, if you look at the 

pre-2007 version of the rule, which is meant to be 

substantively identical to the current version of the 

rule -- this is at page 12 of the government's brief --

and the original version of the rule said, "Except when 

express provision therefore is made either in a statute 

of the United States or in these rules, costs shall be 

allowed as of course to the prevailing party, unless the 

Court otherwise directs."

I think that makes quite clear that 

when, as the FDCPA does, there is a specific statutory 

provision that addresses an award of costs incident to 

the judgment, that specific statutory provision prevails 

over the default rule that Rule 54(d) contains. 

Another point about the specific governS 

the general principle is it would apply here, even if 

the Court believed that Section 1692k(a)(3) covered some 

type of circumstances that Rule 54(d) and other things 

don't. 

And that's made quite clear by this Court's 

recent eight-Justice unanimous opinion in RadLAX Gateway 

Hotel v. Amalgamated Bank, in which the Court said --

and I quote -- "We know of no authority for the 

proposition that the canon," -- they're talking about 

the specific governs, the general canon -- "is 

confined to situations in which the entirety of the 

specific provision is a" -- quote -- "'subset' of the 

general one." 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, my problem with 

this is I don't -- I mean, I read the whole statute, and 

they have a good claim until I think you read the whole 

statute.  And I don't know what to say, other than the 

impression -- the impression is that subsection 3, which 

is what's at issue, the whole thing is meant to say that

the winner, when it's the plaintiff, is going to get 

attorney's fees. 

You know, it mentions costs, but that's the 

background rule.  And then when you get to the second 

sentence of that, it means, and if you're in bad faith, 

the plaintiff, then the defendant gets attorney's fees. 

It doesn't really mention costs.  That's the background 

rule. 

So -- and I look at the legislative history, 

there's some staffer, at least, who's tried to find that 

interesting; the -- they're talking about what the point 

of this is, and say the whole point of this section is 

to help prevent frivolous suits. 

Well, so there we are.  That's -- that's 

where I am at this moment. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Justice Breyer, I think 

it does expressly mention costs, both in the first and 

the second sentence. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I didn't say, on some 

technical linguistic basis, it may do that, that's 

correct.  But perhaps I'm unique in this, but I don't 

just look at the language, I look at the context, I look 

at the purpose, and -- and I don't see anything in the 

language that gets rid of the background rule, and I 

don't see anything in the purpose that gets rid of the

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't see anything in the 

consequences that suggests that you get rid of the 

background rule.  I don't see anything in our traditions 

that says you should get rid of the background rule. 

So what -- what do you do with some 

obstreperous judge who doesn't just look at the 

language?  I mean, I know who uses it, but that's not 

the only thing. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, if Congress 

were satisfied with the background rule, then I think 

it's strange that they added the words "and costs" to a 

sentence that is expressly --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, why?  A person who is a 

drafter says -- you know, you get your costs and you 

also get the attorney's fees.  They don't -- they don't 

know every statute, the people who draft this.  They --

they -- they just say, Senator, what are we trying to 

do?  He says, we're trying to give them attorney's fees. 

They say, okay, we'll give them the costs and the 

attorney's fees. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, I think that gets 

back to Justice Ginsburg's question of why weren't they

just saying "and costs" here, just to make clear that 

not only fees would be available, but also costs.  And I 

think that's an implausible hypothesis of what Congress 

was trying do for the following reason:  A 

congressperson who is concerned that a reference to fees 

alone in the second sentence of Section 1692k(a)(3) 

would preclude application of the default rule in -- in 

Rule 54(d), couldn't possibly have thought that the way 

to make clear that Rule 54(d) applies in full was to add 

the words "and costs" in a sentence that's expressly --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's if you had been 

drafting it, perhaps.  But the people who actually draft 

these things are a whole section over in Congress, they 

don't know every statute, and you give them a general 

instruction. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And the -- the general 

instruction would be add attorney's fees on the 

plaintiffs and add attorney -- Alright.  You 

understand the point.

 (Laughter.) 

 MR. FEIGIN:  Let me -- Your Honor, let me --

let me address that directly.  If we're presume that 

6  Congress is aware of Rule 54(d), then I think it's quite 

7  peculiar and, in fact, quite counterproductive to have 

8  added the words "and costs" to a sentence that's 

9  expressly conditioned on a finding of bad faith and 

10

11

purpose of harassment. 

 But if I accept your hypothesis that 

12  Congress was not aware of Rule 54(d).  Again, it's quite 

13  strange that, when thinking about the cost-shifting rule 

14  that should apply in FDCPA cases, what Congress decided 

15

to do was put the words "and costs" into a sentence 

16  that's expressly --

17

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, then they shouldn't 

18  have put those words in.  But we're talking about the next 

19  sentence.  And the next sentence doesn't put the words 

20

in.  So you're -- you're -- you're assuming from that 

21  fact that, in a pro defendant -- this is a pro-defendant 

22  provision they put in, that was their whole point 

23  apparently reading it -- that what they decided to do is 

24  take away from defendant's costs, which they normally 

25

get, without saying anything about it.

I mean, that's -- you understand the 

problem. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, the words "and 

costs" appear in both sentences.  I agree with Ms. 

Zieve, that the legislative history does not indicate 

that this is a uniquely pro-defendant division --

provision, and that's what the Court found in Jerman. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It doesn't -- where does it 

say that?  Where was the --

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, first of all --

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- I would like to read it. 

MR. FEIGIN:  -- you can look at -- there is 

no legislative history directly addressing the sentence 

we're trying to interpret today.  But I think, if you 

look at the Court's opinion in Jerman and the hearing 

cited at page 31 of the red brief, it reflects that 

Congress was trying to balance deterrence of nuisance 

suits and incentivizing good-faith consumer enforcement. 

If I could, I would like to address the 

policy reasons why Congress would have found it 

particularly useful not to have plaintiffs pay costs in 

these circumstances. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's a 

pretty odd way to balance.  I mean, if you're -- if 

you're trying to balance, then you say, well, here's an

idea, let's give them attorney's fees, but let's not 

give them costs. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, the reason not to give --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's a very 

curious way to dilute what was otherwise a 

defendant-friendly provision. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I don't think 

the provision is uniquely defendant-friendly.  I think 

it draws a dividing line between nuisance suits and 

non-nuisance suits, premised on a finding of the suit 

being brought in bad faith and the purpose of 

harassment. 

And the reason why Congress thought it was 

necessary to shield good-faith plaintiffs from costs 

here in order to incentivize enforcement, is, first of 

all, these are particularly low-value suits, especially 

when compared to other statutes in the CCPA.  They're 

the kind of suits that can be incentivized by a mere 

$1,000 in statutory damages.  And as this case 

demonstrates, the cost of a suit, if taxed against the 

plaintiff, can do much more than 1,000 --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Did you look up -- did you 

try to do any sampling on that?  Because I did, 

actually, and -- and I discovered something that I think 

is not as strong for you, but it isn't too much against 

20

1  you.

 We just did a random sample of 28 successful 

3  cases, and I think the average recovery -- except for 

4  one outlier, where it was very high, -it was around 

5

$4,000 -- 3 to 4, and the average costs on the ones that 

6  the defendants won, I guess, was around a thousand.  So 

7  you have a point --

8

9

10

 MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But it isn't quite as good 

a point, as you seem to suggest.  That is, it's a not so 

11  low value and the costs are not so high --

12

13

14

15

 MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, plaintiffs --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- in order to make it. 

 MR. FEIGIN:  Plaintiffs here are uniquely likely to 

be deterred because they're the kind of people who have 

16  been pursued by debt collectors.  They're going to be in 

17  debt themselves.  They're not going to be able to pay 

18  costs.  That's why attorneys -- and that's why the 

19  statute provides for attorneys generally to take these 

20

cases on contingency, on the hope that they'll recover 

21  fees when the plaintiff is successful. 

22

 Now, if plaintiff's looking to bring this 

23  kind of case, the only out-of-pocket expense the 

24  plaintiff is facing is the potential that if it loses 

25

the case for some reason that it can't be aware of

initially, such as a bona fide good-faith defense or the 

law being interpreted against them in an area where the 

law is unclear, they're going to have to pay out of 

pocket against the plaintiff himself, not the 

plaintiff's attorney, who are the people the defendant 

claims is -- are responsible for the abuses they allege 

in FDCPA cases.  This is going to come out via judgment 

directly against the plaintiff. 

It's difficult to believe that Congress 

enacted a provision specifically because it believed 

the -- the debt collection industry was forcing, among 

other things, personal bankruptcies and wanted the kind 

of plaintiffs who were going to be in a position to 

enforce the FDCPA to have to face the risk of incurring 

thousands of dollars in costs if they lose a suit that 

they bring in good faith. 

And the reason --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Am I to understand your 

simple position to be that what Rule 54(d) does -- says 

is if another provision deals with costs, you're 

relegated to that other provision? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Unless, and this --

you're inverting the express -- unless that provision 

refers you back to 54? 

22
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1

 MR. FEIGIN:  Well, no, Your Honor, I'd 

2  qualify that a little bit.  I think what -- we just 

3  think it codifies an absolute form of the 

4  specific governs the general principles. 

5

So the first question you asked is whether 

6  they're covering the same territory, and they are here. 

7  Both 1692k(a)(3) and 54(d) cover awards of costs 

8  incident to the judgment. 

9

10

 The second question you asked is the scope 

of the displacement.  So it's possible that you might 

11  have a provision, as the first sentence of 1692k(a)(3) 

12  does, that only governs in certain circumstances and 

13  mandates an award of costs in those circumstances. 

14

15

 We don't think a sentence like that, 

standing alone, would displace a court's discretionary 

16  authority under Rule 54(d) to award costs in other 

17  circumstances.  But we don't think there's any need --

18  may I finish the sentence, Your Honor?

sentence. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Finish that 

 MR. FEIGIN:  We don't think there's any need 

22  to adopt some new special rule for Rule 54(d) that's 

23  different from how this Court normally applies the specific 

24  governs the general principle.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MS. BLATT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

Our position is that the second sentence of 

section 1692k(a)(3) is a pro-defendant provision that 

does not strip courts of their discretion under Rule 54 

to award costs to prevailing defendants.  We think that 

first because of the text and structure and, second, 

because of the statutory history and purpose. 

As to the text, the second sentence states 

that a court may award an affirmative grant of power, 

rather than the court may award attorney's fees and 

costs if a plaintiff files a lawsuit in bad faith.  The 

text doesn't say that a court may not award costs in the 

absence of bad faith.  The text doesn't say or even 

address a court's discretion to award costs to 

prevailing defendants as an ordinary incident of defeat. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Blatt, it -- it seems to 

me that the -- the most natural way to read this 

statute, and it's not -- it's not your way, it's, look, 

we have this Federal Rule of Civil Procedure that --

that contemplates that Congress sometimes doesn't

write -- it writes statutes authorizing lawsuits without 

providing a cost provision. 

And because we know that about Congress, we 

provide a default rule.  And the default rule is what's 

laid out in subsection (d) as to costs and then also 

later as to attorney's fees. 

But, we know that Congress sometimes does 

address costs and fees, and where Congress in a 

particular statute has addressed costs and fees, we look 

to whatever Congress has said -- you know, unless 

Congress has otherwise provided.  And here, this is --

1692k is a provision that addresses costs and fees.  It 

addresses them comprehensively and specifically. 

MS. BLATT:  Yes.  I disagree with everything 

you said for the following reasons --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I expected you might. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. BLATT:  This is not a field preemption 

case.  Rule --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's not a question of field 

preemption. 

MS. BLATT:  Yes, it is.  You're saying that 

if it addresses costs, that it trumps it.  And it is 

a -- you would never think -- this -- Rule 54 doesn't 

say, don't award costs if a statute can be plausibly

read to address it.  It says, unless it provides 

otherwise, which means Congress actually intended to 

displace. 

And unless you actually think that this 

provision intends to take away a cost authority --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Maybe I'm --

MS. BLATT:  -- you don't get there. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- not in the business of 

trying to figure out what Congress's intent is.  All I'm 

trying to figure out is whether this Federal statute 

provides otherwise, and this Federal statute does 

provide otherwise. 

MS. BLATT:  Okay.  Here's why it doesn't: 

It doesn't displace it.  It doesn't in terms of the 

plain text.  It just doesn't.  It doesn't say any --

there's no disabling aspect about it.  It's an 

affirmative grant to protect a defendant.  And when you 

say to a court it has sanctioning power to award 

attorney's fees and costs, that doesn't say anything 

about what happens in the ordinary case, where the 

defendant has prevailed at trial and been found to be 

completely innocent. 

There --

is different from RadLAX, in which the two provisions -­

where we held the specific covers the general -- but we 

held that because the two provisions contradicted each 

other. 

MS. BLATT:  Not only do they not contradict, 

this is not a specific -- when you said -- the other 

thing I disagreed with, when you said this 

comprehensively addresses costs, no, this 

comprehensively is about attorney's fees. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's both, you know? 

MS. BLATT:  It is --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And if I might say, I mean, 

you object to this statute; it's perfectly reasonable to 

say Congress should have written a separate provision 

about costs and attorney's fees, but for whatever bad, 

good, or indifferent reason, Congress didn't, and so 

this statute basically says, here's what prevailing 

plaintiffs get as to both costs and fees, here is what 

prevailing defendants get --

MS. BLATT:  That's not correct.  It doesn't 

mention prevailing --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- under what circumstances, 

as to both costs and fees, and those are the rules. 

MS. BLATT:  Yes.  Unlike -- unlike the whole 

statute that talks about prevailing plaintiffs, this 

doesn't.  What is fascinating about this case is, in all

provisions that say, plaintiffs shall not be liable for 

costs, or a plaintiff shall not be liable for costs 

unless a certain condition occurs. 

There's only one statute -- we looked at all 

50 titles -- there is one statute that says, a court may 

award costs if a certain condition occurs.  That's

mean to trivialize it, but there's only one other 

statute, that Electronic Fund Transfers Act, that talks 

about the court shall award attorney's fees and costs if 

there is bad faith. 

And there is one other statute that says, 

for a prevailing defendant, the court may award costs if 

the lawsuit is frivolous.  And in those three

significant ways, I think it shows why we win, and 

that's a statute they relied on to say it's just like 

our statute, on page 18 of their brief, page 29 of our 

brief. 

First, it only refers to costs.  The statute 

is about costs.  Our statute is about attorney's fees 

being the main event upon a finding of bad faith. 

Second, it mentions prevailing defendants; 

ours doesn't. 

And, third, which I think is missing from 

the entire 30 minutes that you heard, their argument is 

plaintiff -- Congress sat down and wanted to incentivize 

frivolous suits and nonfrivolous -- nonfrivolous suits 

alike.  At least in the Pipeline Safety Act, Congress 

said, if it's frivolous, the defendant gets its costs. 

Here --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  This statute is very -- is 

very normal if it were just about fees, right?  It would 

be just like the civil rights fees statutes, where it 

said prevailing plaintiffs get fees, but prevailing 

defendants only get fees upon some higher standard, 

here, bad faith.  What makes this statute different --

and it is different -- is that this statute twice says 

not only fees, but also costs. 

MS. BLATT:  Right.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now, you might say that's 

very uncommon, but in both sentences, it says, we want 

the same rule for costs as we do for fees. 

MS. BLATT:  Well, I mean, a couple things 

about that, it's both very common -- fee shifting 

provisions routinely refer to both fees and costs, just 

like salt and pepper, peanut butter and jelly, they go 

together as a set. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And with that, is that 

there are some statutes that don't? 

MS. BLATT:  Yes.  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it's not always 

peanut butter and jelly. 

MS. BLATT:  Okay. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's peanut butter and 

honey sometimes. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. BLATT:  Yes.  And here --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Love and marriage. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. BLATT:  I don't know about that one. 

But here -- here, I think Congress -- first 

of all, it's just wrong that the reference to "and 

costs" is grammatically inexplicable and devoid of 

practical function; and that is the fundamental point of 

30


Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  the blue brief, that this is just grammatically 

2  inexplicable, and that's just not true. 

3

 What "and costs" does is it -- basically, 

4  the word "and" is being used to mean "in addition to." 

5

"And" means "in addition to."  And so what Congress is 

6  saying is, when courts fee shift -- attorney's fee shift 

7  upon a finding of bad faith, courts additionally may award 

8  costs in addition to and over and above the attorney's 

9  fees that were measured in relationship to the work 

10

performed. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose you're right.  What 

12  about their policy argument here, that you're a --

13  you're a potential plaintiff, you've borrowed a lot of 

14  money, you don't have a lot of money, and the deal is 

15

this, under your interpretation, if you win, you're 

16  going to get 2 or $3,000; if you lose, it will cost you 

17  about a thousand. 

18

20

 That's -- that's under your interpretation. 

 MS. BLATT:  Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And under theirs, it's if 

21  you win, you get 2 or $3,000, and if you lose, at least 

22  you don't lose anything.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, it could be worse. 

 MS. BLATT:  No, it couldn't be worse, and 

3  here's why:  A homeless person filing a civil rights 

4  case has to pay costs, and at least that person has to 

5

pay -- has to prove damages.  This plaintiff gets $1,000 

6  for free.  Second of all, the plaintiff in this case 

7  never asks for relief.  Well, 54 is discretionary.  If 

8  this woman was in pain and suffering, why didn't she 

9  say, district court, I can't afford this? 

10

It is the law in every circuit that the 

11  district courts don't have to award costs.  It's just 

12  discretionary.  So Rule 54 has a built-in safety valve; 

13  it accommodates all the policy concerns on the other 

14  side, and every other informal paupers litigant, every other 

15

consumer protection plaintiff, every civil rights plaintiff, 

16  every plaintiff in the country faces the risk of a cost 

17  award, but doesn't get $1,000 thrown in for free. 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Blatt, we do have in 

19  this case the views of the government regulators, the 

20

FTC and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, and we

reasonable attorney's fees, and then the next sentence,

passed a firewall.  Congress said, we need to encourage 

frivolous suits and nonfrivolous, but let's put a 

firewall in and give them fees and costs, that, God 

forbid, there is bad faith and harassment. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm not in the business --

I'm not in the business of trying to figure out exactly 

what Congress is doing.  I'm in the business of just 

reading what Congress did.  And what Congress did is it 

created a set of rules that applies to attorney's fees 

and costs at the same time. 

MS. BLATT:  It -- it affirmatively gives 

district courts emboldening power to sanction.  So --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that sounds very 

terrible. 

MS. BLATT:  But not if you file a lawsuit in 

bad faith and for purposes of harassment.  So, I mean --

I think even -- I think the history is obvious; this was 

trying to make defendants better off than the 

defendant's suit under the Truth in Lending Act, which 

is part of the same umbrella Consumer Credit Protection 

Act. 

And they're -- inexplicably, somehow, by 

trying to make them better off, made them worse than 

every other creditor that they serve and immunized these

plaintiffs from the universal risk of cost shifting that 

every other litigant has to face.  And so -- and you 

don't get there from -- all they have is a negative 

inference. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Ms. Blatt, you say 

it -- it's supposed to make defendants better off by 

focusing on just part of the provision, but the 

provision is -- as a whole, it does a set of things.  It 

treats plaintiffs and prevailing plaintiffs in a certain 

set of ways.  And it treats prevailing defendants in a 

certain set of ways. 

MS. BLATT:  It doesn't speak to prevailing 

defendants. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Prevailing defendants, but 

when -- prevailing defendants are treated worse than 

prevailing plaintiffs because they have to show that 

there is a bad-faith lawsuit. 

MS. BLATT:  Yeah, I'm going -- I'm going to 

keep repeating it because it's my position.  This 

doesn't -- the fact that this doesn't refer to 

prevailing defendants speaks volumes that what was not 

on Congress' mind, was Rule 54.  What was on Congress' 

mind is victimized debt collectors who were sued in bad 

faith. 

Now, I understand this is a pro-plaintiff

statute, but this would be extraordinary to think that 

they gave them attorney's fees when they -- but it's 

basically saying -- this is a -- this is a defendant who 

went to trial and won, was law-abiding, didn't do 

anything wrong, and Congress in that situation said, not 

only might -- might not the suit be -- be -- have merit 

or good faith, it might have even been frivolous. 

When under Rule 54 -- again, this is what I 

find so mystifying about this case.  If the petitioner 

thought, oh, I had a really hard case in the law, or, 

oh, I'm really poor, she could have asked for 

discretionary relief.  Instead, the lawyer went into 

court and said, I have a recent Ninth Circuit decision, 

and I don't have to pay costs at all. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Blatt, let me try it a 

different way. 

MS. BLATT:  Okay. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Let's just suppose that 

54(k) didn't exist at all.  Okay? 

MS. BLATT:  54(d)? 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  54(d) didn't exist. 

MS. BLATT:  Okay. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And all you had was this 

provision.  Okay?

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So this provision says, on a 

finding by the court that it's brought in bad faith, the 

court may award to the defendant attorney's fees and 

costs.  So suppose a defendant wins, but there's not a 

finding that it was made in bad faith, would then the 

person be entitled to either attorney's fees or costs? 

MS. BLATT:  Well, we wouldn't -- certainly, 

we sought costs here under Rule 54. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So I'm saying that --

MS. BLATT:  I know.  Okay.  And you've took 

it up.  So that takes out my route seeking for costs 

under Rule 54, it doesn't exist in your world. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  In my world, you would not 

get fees or costs. 

MS. BLATT:  Now, we would -- I'm imagining 

then the world in 1936, and we rely on 1920 or 1919 or 

the long-standing practice of courts awarding costs. 

Now, a court might --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm just asking you a simple 

question. 

MS. BLATT:  We would not get costs under 

this provision, you're correct. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You would not get costs 

under that provision. 

MS. BLATT:  Because this -- in that sense, I

think this was a question that another Justice asked. 

If you just look at this provision, the only basis for 

costs and fees in this provision is the bad faith and 

finding of harassment. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  So if you would not 

get costs under that provision --

MS. BLATT:  Under 1692. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- under 1692, a provision 

that talks about fees and costs, generally, as to both 

plaintiffs and defendants, then how does a rule that 

says what -- where you would get costs unless a Federal 

statute provides otherwise change matters? 

MS. BLATT:  Because -- because, again, 

Rule 54 is not preemption -- a field preemption.  It's 

saying if Congress intended to displace -- the proviso, 

unless otherwise provided, it was recognition that other 

statutes might displace Rule 54.  And if you look at all 

the statutes that we cite on pages 19 and 20, they 

actually do prohibit costs. 

And then if you look at the statutes on 

pages 24 and 25, where, time and time again, Congress 

has said, a prevailing party may recover attorney's fees 

and costs.  Well, the "and costs," in their view, I 

guess those statutes are inexplicable.  I mean, it's 

clearly they're redundant, and they overlap with Rule

54.  They don't displace it. 

Official 

And even the practice guides that we cite on 

page 22, which is basically Wright and Miller and Moore, 

say something that merely overlaps with Rule 54 doesn't 

displace the court's discretion. 

And again, I think you have to ask yourself, 

what was Congress doing?  To me, this is -- this is a --

the attorney's fees are the main show, it goes with bad 

faith.  Congress was not thinking about Rule 54, and I 

think you can be quite confident Congress was not 

thinking, we want plaintiff lawyers to go around saying, 

not only Congress, but the government wanted us to file 

frivolous suits. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You might be right, but 

suppose Congress wasn't thinking about Rule 54.  Suppose 

it didn't occur to the drafters what Rule 54 said or 

what the default provision was.  They just wrote a 

statute about fees and costs.  And then -- it doesn't 

really matter whether they were thinking about Rule 54 

or not. 

MS. BLATT:  Yes, if you -- right.  And so 

there's like that Oncale case, with same-sex harassment, 

Congress can write a very -- can write a plain language 

provision, and regardless of what Congress intended, if 

the language covers it, that's tough, we're going to

This is not that.  This -- this doesn't say 

anything about prevailing parties.  This is talking 

about bad faith and attorney's fees.  It doesn't say a 

court can't act in the absence of bad faith.  It doesn't 

say anything about prevailing parties.  It doesn't 

reveal any intent to displace it, especially when you 

compare it with all the other statutes, you look at the 

history -- sorry. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, it was thinking 

about prevailing parties because the predecessor 

sentence --

MS. BLATT:  Prevailing defendants -- I 

agree, sorry. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But it was talking --

no, prevailing parties.  The provision is geared towards 

prevailing parties in some form.  The first sentence 

says, "a prevailing plaintiff," not whether it's on a 

substantial basis or any exception. 

MS. BLATT:  Yeah. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It says you get fees or 

you can get fees and costs. 

MS. BLATT:  Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it then decides to 

limit what a prevailing defendant can do.  Isn't that

the natural reading? 

Official 

MS. BLATT:  No, because it says expressly, 

in a case of successful action, it talks about 

prevailing plaintiffs.  And then it says if there's --

to me, it's just -- it's natural when you just read it 

in light of sort of common sense in context in what 

Congress was doing.  If a plaintiff files in bad faith, 

the court is empowered and emboldened -- it's like a 

neon light -- courts, you have authority to award 

attorney's fees and costs. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that's -- that's just 

a different way of saying the following:  The first 

sentence says, when you're a prevailing plaintiff, you 

get costs and fees.  How about defendants?  Well, 

prevailing is not enough for defendants.  Defendants 

have to show --

MS. BLATT:  Yeah. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that the suit was filed 

in bad faith --

MS. BLATT:  Yeah.  And I think --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- and then they get costs 

and fees. 

MS. BLATT:  Right.  But I think you have to 

keep this in mind, that there are completely 

diametrically opposed background presumptions in our

legal system.  It's an extraordinary event to get 

attorney's fees, and it's an extraordinary event not to 

get costs. 

And so the court -- the Congress has to use 

explicit language to over -- overturn the American rule. 

And so what Congress did here, that is the most natural, 

even if I drew you to a tie --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I completely agree with 

that.  But that's what it comes down to, that if you 

think that Congress has to use super extraordinary 

language to over -- to -- to get out of 54(d), then 

you're right.  But 54(d) doesn't say that.  It just 

says --

MS. BLATT:  Right.  And --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- unless the Federal 

statute provides otherwise. 

MS. BLATT:  And I think you can look -- the 

Petitioner did -- did a valiant job of trying to drudge 

up as many statutes as they can.  All the statutes on 

point are explicit.  Now, there's one statute that might 

not be, the pipeline safety one. 

And so the question is:  Do we think that 

Congress actually tried to displace a court's authority 

under that statute?  And that's a statute that just says 

a court may award costs if a lawsuit is frivolous.  This

one just doesn't say that. 

Official 

You at least -- even if you don't think of 

it as magic language or an explicit statement, the fact 

that Congress repeatedly has used explicit language 

casts considerable doubt that this was done by mere 

implication. 

And then you look at the fact that it 

doesn't mention prevailing parties.  It's talking about 

bad faith, it has attorney's fees, what was Congress 

doing, you look at the legislative history.  It shows 

that it was -- it was trying to make them, better, off 

than a class of defendants, but their view inexplicably 

makes them worse off. 

And then you look at the result that they're 

actually advocating, that the government thinks it's a 

good idea that plaintiffs can file lawsuits cost-free 

that are frivolous.  I mean --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I guess, in the first 

sentence of 3, the phrase "the costs of the action" is 

really superfluous in light of 54(d)(1).  You really 

don't know that.  I mean, that would have been the case 

anyway. 

So there's no reason to think that it isn't 

frivolous in the second sentence -- or superfluous in 

the second sentence, right?  Why did they have to say

the costs of the action in the case of a successful 

action? 

MS. BLATT:  Successful action to enforce it. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The costs of the action, 

together with a reasonable -- as determined by the 

court. 

MS. BLATT:  Why isn't --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  They -- they have the costs 

anyway, if Congress didn't write anything, right? 

MS. BLATT:  I mean, I think that -- again --

I mean --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm trying to help you. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. BLATT:  Yeah, I know.  And I was going 

to say there's so much is superfluity in here, I don't 

know where to begin.  It's all over the place.  The 

whole thing, obviously, overlaps with the Court's 

inherent authority. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You don't think that 

there's a serious argument that the first sentence does 

away with the discretionary nature? 

MS. BLATT:  No, it's clear, "shall."  It's 

clear "shall," obviously.  The first sentence does --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it's a command. 

54(d) is permissive, according to your earlier argument?

MS. BLATT:  Oh, yes, that's right.  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so this does -- it's 

not superfluous because it went to mandatory? 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Gotcha. 

MS. BLATT:  That's true. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well-taken. 

MS. BLATT:  Yeah.  The question, though, 

was, in the case of any successful action when, 

obviously, they prevailed to begin with, so the question 

is whether that's superfluous.  But the whole provision 

overlaps with the Court's inherent authority.  And I 

know it hasn't come up, but I just think it's strange 

that it says, for the purposes of bad faith and 

harassment, Congress was obviously using belt and 

suspenders there, so it's not surprising that Congress 

added "and costs" here. 

If you look at Rule 54 -- let me just say 

one other thing, Justice Kagan -- if you look at Rule 

54, it also says, "unless the statute provides 

otherwise, costs other than attorney's fees."  So why --

they didn't have to say that because, in the next 

provision, it talks about attorney's fees.  They just --

they wanted to make clear for whatever reason or maybe 

they just wrote some really excess, redundant, silly 

language, but they said costs, meaning anything that's

not costs -- it's just that Congress sometimes uses 

these. 

And I guess this was the honey and peanut 

butter thing, is that a lot of fee-shifting statutes 

talk about both attorney's fees and costs.  And so they 

went together and -- they also mentioned it.  Obviously, 

it's different.  I agree that there's a verb in the 

first sentence that's mandatory, so it trumps Rule 54. 

But with respect to the two objects, 

Congress was already thinking about attorney's fees and 

costs anyway, and so there's nothing wrong with them 

saying, in addition to the attorney's fees that you can 

get in bad faith, once you calculate the attorney's fees 

reasonable in relation to the work performed, you also 

get costs. 

And the only thing I would say is -- when we 

define "and" as in addition to, they seem to think that 

that was an extraordinary reading of the word "and," 

citing something -- from something called 

dictionary.com, and if you just went to dictionary.com, 

which I had not done before, and you type in "and," the 

first definition is "in addition to." 

If there are no further questions --

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MS. ZIEVE:  Thank you. 

First, the FDCPA doesn't just encourage 

frivolous suits.  Ms. Blatt repeatedly referred to 

plaintiffs getting a free $1,000.  If the -- if the 

plaintiffs win their suits, that means both that they're 

not frivolous and they're not in bad faith. 

In cases that are frivolous, but a court 

makes a finding that it's not in bad faith, defendants 

have other means of recovering fees and costs using 

Rule 11 or Section 1927.  And there are cases in which 

courts have denied fees and costs under the FDCPA and 

granted them under Rule 11 or 1927. 

Ms. Blatt suggested that --

JUSTICE GINSBERG:  Would you explain why we 

would look to other rules?  You wouldn't look at the 

Rule 54(d), but we might look at Rule 11 and we might 

look at something else?  I thought your -- your position 

was that this statute governs all requests for fees and 

costs under this particular Act. 

MS. ZIEVE:  Our position is that this 

provision, k(a)(3), discusses the allocation of fees and 

costs that come at the end of the case, based on who won 

and who lost.  And if you read it as a whole, as I think

Justice Kagan suggested, that's what Congress was doing. 

It was carefully calibrating the allocation of fees and 

costs at the end of the case.  And, in fact, in 

instances in which -- which defendants have asked for 

fees and costs in FDCPA cases based on bad faith, they 

do always come at the end of the case, which also shows 

this is not a misconduct provision. 

If it were a misconduct provision, it 

wouldn't just be about bad faith in bringing the action. 

The Fair Credit Reporting Act, for example, has a 

provision that provides for fees, but not costs, that 

speaks to conduct throughout the case, but with respect 

to bad faith filings of pleadings, motions, or other 

papers, that's a misconduct provision; this one isn't. 

The main --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't it -- isn't it the 

case that, in order to appeal to the proposition that 

the specific governs the general, you -- you have to 

read the second sentence of 3 as containing a 

negative -- a negative implication?  As saying --

MS. ZIEVE:  Yeah.  We do read the "court may 

award" to mean "and, in other circumstances, it may 

not." 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It may not.  So you are 

reading in a negative -­

MS. ZIEVE:  Just as this Court -- just as 

this Court read "may" in Cooper Industries or Crawford 

Fittings and said, "If you don't read 'may' to define 

the scope of what Congress is authorizing the Court to 

do, then that provision has no meaning." 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I understood Ms. Blatt to 

actually agree with that, that if you put Rule 54 aside, 

this does say, you may, under a certain set of 

conditions, which implies you may not, under -- if those 

conditions are not met. 

MS. ZIEVE:  Right.  She did agree that, 

without Rule 54, this provision -- that -- that no costs 

could be awarded to a defendant, unless they had acted 

in bad faith. 

I mean, I think, at some points, GRC and 

Ms. Blatt here today asked you to just ignore that "and 

costs" exists in the sentence at all, although the fact 

that this sentence is not replicated numerous times 

throughout the U.S. Code doesn't seem to me reason for 

ignoring it, but, rather, for giving effect to it. 

Congress obviously thought it was doing 

something when it enacted this sentence and when it 

added these words to the statute.  It does not say, "The 

court may award fees in addition to costs" or "as part 

of costs" or "together with costs."

Again, grammatically, it treats the two 

terms, "fees and costs," on a par --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Suppose -- suppose the 

words "and costs" were left out in the second sentence? 

Would not the argument be made that you cannot award 

costs even in an action brought in bad faith? 

Wouldn't -- that this sum argument you're making --

MS. ZIEVE:  No, I don't think so.  There 

are -- no.  There are statutes that provide for fee 

awards and don't -- don't say anything about costs, and 

these cases are --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you're saying "negative 

implication."  If it -- if it says only "attorney's fees 

in reasonable relation to the work expended," the 

implication would be you --

MS. ZIEVE:  Justice Scalia, other --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- you cannot -- you 

cannot, even in the case of a frivolous action, award 

costs.  Wouldn't that be the reading of it? 

MS. ZIEVE:  In other cases, under other 

statutes, that argument has been made occasionally and 

rejected.  It's also rejected in the treatises that we 

cite, that if you don't mention costs --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but I'm suggesting if 

that argument is rejected, so should yours be.

MS. ZIEVE:  No, because --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because it seems the two 

are parallel. 

MS. ZIEVE:  If the -- if the statute does 

not mention costs, then it doesn't provide otherwise 

with respect to costs. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So she says if I -- if I 

tease -- if you tease your sister, I'm going to give 

you -- give her your allowance and her allowance, that 

that doesn't mean that the sister loses her allowance if 

you don't tease her. 

I mean, there are a lot of instances --

MS. ZIEVE:  Well --

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- where you put the "and" 

in and it doesn't mean that that's the exclusive place 

for giving it.  Sometimes, it does; sometimes, it 

doesn't.  That's her point. 

MS. ZIEVE:  Well, put -- well, putting aside 

that I hope that Congress drafts a little more carefully 

than a mother may threaten her child --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I doubt that it does. 

I'm sorry.  I mean, they're human beings over there; 

they're not necessarily all --

MS. ZIEVE:  But they're -- the presumption

behind that hypothetical is that the one child is going 

to get their allowance no matter what.  The presumption 

here is that Rule 54(d) will apply unless a statute 

provides otherwise.  This statute doesn't. 

Thank you, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
