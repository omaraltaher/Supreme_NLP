(11:11  a.m.) 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next  in  Case  15­458,  Dietz  v.  Bouldin. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Shanmugam. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  KANNON  K.  SHANMUGAM 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice,  and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

When  a  judge  discharges  a  jury  after  it 

   

   

 

 

 

reaches  a  verdict,  the  jury's  service  is  at  an  end  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jurors  return  to  being  ordinary  members  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public.  This  case  presents  the  question  whether  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  has  inherent  authority  under  Article  III 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Constitution  to  recall  discharged  jurors  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further  service  in  the  same  case,  here,  for  the  purpose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  deliberating  anew  and  reaching  an  entirely  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict. 

            

The  answer  to  that  question  is  no.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

established  rule  of  common  law  forbade  the  recall  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharged  jurors.  In  numerous  respects,  the  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Rules  of  Procedure  reflect  the  understanding  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court's  authority  ends  at  the  point  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge.

clear  bright­line  rule  until  I  got  to  page  9  of  your 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reply  brief,  where  you  say,  "A  jury  may  remain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effectively  undischarged  despite  a  judge's  pronouncement 

   

 

 

 

of  discharge." 

 

            

There  are  cases  where  you  agree  that  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge  says  you're  discharged,  they're  not  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharged,  and  the  judge  can  say,  oh,  come  on  back. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I've  got  something  else  you've  got  to  do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  our  rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  clear.  It's  a  rule  that  a  district  court  lacks  the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

authority  to  recall  discharged  jurors.  The  question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  discuss  at  page  9  of  our  reply  brief  is  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  what  the  definition  of  a  discharge  is.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  we  offer  ­­

 

 

 

            

lawyerly. 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  that's  pretty 

  

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

Justice. 

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Saying  anytime 

  

 

 

 

you're  discharged,  it's  over.  Now,  discharge  may  not  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge  in  every  case.  Because  you  recognize  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  cases  where  the  judge  says  you're  discharged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  you  would  allow  them  to  come  back.

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  And  that  is  simply,  Mr. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Chief  Justice,  because  we  believe  the  discharge  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

act;  it's  not  just  a  pronouncement.  And  that's  what  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

vast  majority  of  the  lower  courts  have  said.  They  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  that  a  jury  is  discharged  when,  having  been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

released  from  service,  the  jurors  have  left  the  judge's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presence  and  control. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Okay.  Presence  and 

  

  

 

 

 

control.  Now,  that's  ­­ that's  the  key  distinction  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have? 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  That  is  what  lower  courts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  said,  and  we're  certainly  comfortable  with  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction.  And  if  ­­

  

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  if  they're 

  

 

 

 

 

still  ­­ if  they're  still  in  the  courtroom,  he  can  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wait,  hold  up.  You've  got  to  come  back  and  do  this. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  Yes,  that  is  correct.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that  is  basically  the  line  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  if  they're  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  hall  outside  the  courtroom? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  The  hall  ­­

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Nothing's  happened. 

  

 

 

 

They're  all  still  there. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  The  hall  is  outside  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

judge's  presence  and  control.  And  the  only  cases  where

jurors  have  been  permitted  to  be  recalled  outside  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courtroom  under  this  standard  are  cases  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurors,  say,  have  gone  back  to  the  jury  room.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  fair  to  say  under  those  circumstances,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jurors  are  no  longer  ­­ are  still  within  the  judge's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presence  and  control. 

 

 

            

 

 

Certainly,  we  don't  think  that  that 

 

 

 

definition  could  be  stretched  to  facts  like  this  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  the  jurors  have  not  only  left  the  courtroom,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  least  two  of  the  jurors  have  left  the  immediate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vicinity  of  the  courtroom.  And  it  appears  from  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  as  if  one  of  the  jurors  has  left  the  courthouse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

altogether. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  they're  worried 

  

 

 

 

 

about  ­­ what  they're  worried  about  with  the  rule  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge  and  then  bringing  them  back  is  that  the  jurors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  have  talked  to  somebody  about  the  case,  heard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  about  it,  had  information  that's  going  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudicial  to  the  defendant  that  they  shouldn't  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gotten.  Why  doesn't  it  make  sense  to  say,  well,  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  right  out  in  the  hall  or,  you  know,  they're  down 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  hall,  bring  them  back  in  and  ask,  just  as  the  judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  here,  have  you  talked  to  anybody  about  the  case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

that  the  courts  that  have  adopted  that  functional

definition  of  discharge,  that  have  looked  at  discharge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  the  point  at  which  jurors  have  separated  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispersed,  have  focused  on  the  potential  for  influence, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  fact  of  influence.  In  other  words,  those  courts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aren't  applying  ­­ aren't  engaging  in  a  prejudiced 

   

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry  under  the  guise  of  defining  discharge. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Instead,  what  they  are  saying  is,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essence,  the  point  at  which  the  jurors  are  no  longer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

together  as  a  unit  and,  again,  no  longer  within  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  instruction  and  direction  is  the  point  at  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they've  been  discharged.  And  I  think  that  that  has 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

proven  in  the  case  law  to  be  a  relatively  easy  line  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply. 

            

And  many  of  the  cases  on  which  Respondent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relies  are  cases  in  that  category;  in  other  words,  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  courts,  at  the  same  time  as  they  have  recognized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  common  law  rule,  have  applied  this  functional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  "discharge." 

 

 

            

Now,  again,  we  think  that  this  case  plainly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  fall  even  within  that  somewhat  broader 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition,  and  the  issue  of  whether  the  jury  has  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharged  in  this  case  is  obviously  not  in  dispute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  this  Court.  But  I  do  think  that  in  practice,  if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  were  to  adhere  to  the  common  law  rule,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  would  be  pretty  easy  to  apply  in  practice,

and  there  aren't  a  lot  of  lower  court  decisions  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seem  to  have  struggled  with  the  application  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision.  And  once  you  take  those  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  ­­

    

 

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  I  was  just  going  to  say  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

once  you  take  those  cases  away,  Respondent  really  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  have  very  much  by  way  of  common  law  authority  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  to  rest. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Am  I  ­­ are  you 

   

  

 

 

 

confirming  that  you're  not  raising  a  constitutional 

   

 

 

 

 

barrier  to  the  recall  of  jurors? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  Yes.  I  think  we  have 

    

  

 

 

 

consistently  made  the  point  all  along  that  this  issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously  implicates  the  underlying  right  to  a  fair 

   

 

 

 

 

 

trial.  And  the  rule  that  we're  articulating  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  protective  of  that  interest,  but  it  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right.  But  not  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

not  directly. 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  Yes,  that  is  correct. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  In  most  fair  trial 

  

 

 

 

 

analyses,  we  look  to  prejudice.  You  don't  get  a  fair 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial  unless  there  is  a  likelihood  of  prejudice.  So  why 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  it  that  we  would  make  an  absolute  rule  barring  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recall  of  the  jury,  except  in  the  circumstance  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceding?  Why  don't  we  go  back  to  what  the  Chief

Justice  said?  Why  aren't  we  looking  for  more  specific 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice? 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  Justice  Sotomayor,  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

for  the  simple  reason  that  we  believe  this  is  really  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  about  a  district  court's  authority.  And  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

analyzing  whether  a  district  court  ­­

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  there's  no 

  

 

 

 

statutory  bar. 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  Well,  that  is  correct,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  no  explicit  bar  in  the  rules.  But  when  you  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considering  whether  a  court  has  inherent  authority  under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Article  III  of  the  Constitution,  the  three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considerations  on  which  this  Court  has  relied  are, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first,  the  history  ­­ and  we  believe  that,  far  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  being  a  long  history  in  Respondent's  favor,  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  history  really  points  decisively  in  our  direction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Federal  rules,  and  while  it  is  true  that  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules  do  not  explicitly  prohibit  jury  recall  after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge,  time  and  again  the  Federal  rules  indicate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  court's  authority  is  limited  at  the  point  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge  and  that  a  court's  authority  after  discharge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is  constrained  in  various  respects.  And  critically,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  rules  also  provide  specific  and  concededly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adequate  remedies  for  the  defect  at  issue  here,  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalid  or  ambiguous  verdict.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  we  don't  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

specific  rule  that  permits  district  courts  to  rescind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  order  they've  issued.  But  we've  routinely,  through 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

history,  permitted  district  courts,  when  they  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they've  entered  an  erroneous  order,  to  just  rescind  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why  isn't  this  one  of  those  orders? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  District  courts  have 

  

 

 

 

authority  to  be  sure  to  rescind  certain  types  of  orders. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  our  reply  brief,  we  point  to  various  examples  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

orders  that  cannot  be  rescinded,  such  as  a  decision  by  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  to  transfer  venue,  a  decision  by  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  judge  to  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  those  are 

  

 

 

 

statutorily  barred  from  happening. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  Well,  I  don't  ­­ I  don't 

   

   

  

 

 

think  that  that's  right.  I  think  that  courts  have  said 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  those  orders  are  essentially  like  the  order  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  here,  final  in  the  relevant  sense;  in  other  words, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  district  court's  authority  is  at  an  end  when  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  transfers  the  case  to  another  district, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  a  judge  recuses  himself  or  herself,  when  a  district 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

court  enters  final  judgment  over  part  of  a  case  under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule  54(b),  so  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  until  ­­ until  final 

  

 

 

 

 

 

judgment,  is  the  ­­ the  rule  is  everything  is

interlocutory.  The  ­­ when  ­­ when  the  judgment  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entered,  that's  it,  that's  an  end  of  the  case.  District 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  loses  authority  over  it.  But  here  we  haven't  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  final  judgment.  Yes,  the  jury  was  discharged,  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  judgment  that's  been  entered  in  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why  doesn't  the  judge  retain  authority  up  until  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  where  he  enters  ­­ where  judgment  is  entered  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  verdict? 

 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  And,  Justice  Ginsburg,  all 

  

 

 

 

 

of  the  examples  to  which  I  just  pointed  are  orders  that, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding  the  fact  that  final  judgment  in  the  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  not  yet  been  entered,  are  nevertheless  orders  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  entering  judge  cannot  revoke.  And  so,  too,  here. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Our  submission  is  a  quite  straightforward  one.  It  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  active  discharge  denotes  the  point  at  which  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court's  authority  over  the  jury  is  at  an  end, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  jury's  authority  over  the  case  is  at  an  end. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  to  finish  my  answer  to  Justice  Sotomayor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  Federal  rules,  I  think  it  is  critically 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  here  for  the  purposes  of  analyzing  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  inherent  authority  that  there  are  specific  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceivably  adequate  remedies  for  correcting  an  invalid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  ambiguous  verdict  both  before  a  discharge  and  after 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge. 

            

So  first,  before  a  discharge,  we  certainly

concede  that  before  the  jury  is  discharged,  a  district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  has  the  authority  to  recall  a  jury,  and  it's  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  recalling  the  jury.  It's  simply  reinstructing  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  and  ordering  the  jury  to  engage  in  further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deliberations.  That  conspicuously  did  not  take  place 

  

 

 

 

 

 

here,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  both  the  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  and  Respondent's  counsel  acknowledged  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict  of  $0  would  be  invalid. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

After  discharge,  there  are  actually  two 

 

 

 

 

 

remedies.  The  first  is  the  remedy  of  a  new  trial,  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  certainly  think  that  that  has  long  been  the  remedy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  type  of  defect  at  issue  here,  a  verdict  that  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary  to  the  weight  of  the  evidence,  and  indeed,  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  contrary  to  the  weight  of  the  evidence,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary  to  any  of  the  evidence. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  other  remedy,  which  I  do  want  to  focus 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court's  attention  on,  is  the  remedy  that  is  provided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Civil  Rule  60(a).  And  that  is  the  remedy  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enables  a  district  court  to  essentially  conduct  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

streamlined  proceeding  to  correct  clerical  errors  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

oversights  and  omissions  in  a  judgment.  And  so  in  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  major  category  of  cases  on  which  Respondent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relies,  those  are  cases  in  which  there  were  simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mistakes  in  the  original  verdict,  cases  where  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict  forms  might  have  been  found  in  the  record  or

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  In  your  ­­ in  your  view  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's  suppose  the  jury  were  truly  discharged  and  they  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  were  away  for  a  day,  could  ­­ but  the  judgment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hasn't  been  entered  yet.  Could  the  judge  amend  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  or  state  in  the  judgment  that  $10,000  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

awarded? 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  No,  for  the  simple  reason 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  I  don't  think  you  would  know  what  a  correctly 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

instructed  jury  would  have  done  in  that  circumstance. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  indeed,  in  this  case,  the  further  complication  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  jury  was  required  not  only  to  award  the  $10,000 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  stipulated  damages  for  past  medical  expenses,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  to  award  some  amount  for  future  expenses.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indeed,  when  the  jury  came  back,  it  returned  a  verdict 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  $15,000.  So  I  don't  think  that  that  could  have  been 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  if  the  jury  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharged  and  the  judge  is  looking  at  the  verdict  and, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  don't  know,  shows  it  to  the  lawyers  and  says,  okay, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  28,000.  The  lawyer  says,  no,  that's  a  three.  It's 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

23,000.  Can  the  judge  just  stop  the  jury  and  say,  well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  what  is  it?  Is  this  28  or  23? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  The  proper  remedy  in  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  would  be  the  one  that

I've  just  suggested,  namely  a  proceeding  under 

   

 

 

 

 

Rule  60(a)  of  the  Civil  Rules.  And  in  aid  of  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding,  the  judge  has  the  ability  to  call  back  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurors,  but  not  as  a  jury.  That's  the  critical  point. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  can  call  back  the  jurors,  essentially,  as  witnesses, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  judge  could  subpoena  the  jurors  if  necessary, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  take  affidavits  or  oral  testimony  from  the  jurors  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct  the  verdict. 

 

 

            

And,  again,  I  think  that  that's  an  answer  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  significant  category  of  cases  that  Respondent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relies  on.  Those  are  cases  where  you  have  these  various 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

types  of  clerical  errors,  mistakes  of  a  verdict  being 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

recorded.  That's  different  from  the  verdict  that  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  orally  delivered  in  court.  And  all  of  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  under  our  interpretation,  are  readily  correctable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Rule  60(a)  and  what  does  not  need  to  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly  complex  proceeding. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  does,  in  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  sense  ­­ I  don't  know  if  I  ­­ it's  certainly  not 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  clerical  error,  but  it  is  a  simple  error.  I  mean,  the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  is  the  judge  told  the  jury,  you  have  to  award  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount  in  medical  expenses,  and  the  jury  didn't.  Why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  that  fall  under  a  different  category  than  the, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  questions  of  certainly  guilt  or  ­­ or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability  or  no  liability?

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  So,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  certainly  fair  to  say  that  the  error  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  was  an  obvious  one.  Indeed,  it  was  so  obvious  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less  than  an  hour  earlier  when  the  jury  issued  a  note 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking  about  whether  the  damages  had  already  been  paid, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again  both  the  district  court  and  Respondent's  counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acknowledged  that  if  this  was  heading  in  the  direction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  $0  verdict,  that  verdict  would  be  invalid. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  think  it's  critically  important  to 

   

 

 

 

 

realize  that  we're  not  dealing  with  a  case  here  where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  verdict  is  somehow  facially  invalid.  I  mean,  if  you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  the  verdict  form,  which  is  at  Page  22A  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petition  Appendix,  the  four  corners  of  that  verdict  form 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  fine.  The  verdict  simply  says,  we're  finding  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favor  of  Petitioner,  but  we're  awarding  $0. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  is  a  case  that  falls  into  the  ­­ the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

category  of  cases  where  the  verdict  is  contrary  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weight  of  the  evidence. 

 

 

 

            

And,  again,  the  remedy  for  that,  both  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  rule  ­­

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  you  mean  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  the  amount  they  were  ­­ they  were  obligated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  award? 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  Well,  that  is  correct. 

  

 

 

 

 

Well,  with  regard  to  the  award,  more  generally.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official ­ Subject to Final Review 

16 

other  words,  they  could  not  have  awarded  $0  as  a  matter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  law  by  virtue  of  Respondent's  stipulation,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  the  only  sense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

­­ the  only  sense  in  which  it  was  contrary  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  was  that  they  didn't  award  the  $10,000.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

awarded  zero. 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  Yes. 

  

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  If  they  had  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  Well,  plus  some  amount  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

future  medical  expenses.  But  my  point  is  simply  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  at  common  law,  the  remedy  in  these  circumstances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  always  been  a  new  trial. 

   

 

 

 

            

So  in  other  words,  Rule  59(b)  is  not  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

newfangled  invention.  If  you  go  back  and  look  at  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  prohibiting  the  recall  of  discharged  jurors,  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  way  back  to  Loveday's  case,  the  case  that  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cite  from  the  Exchequer  from  1608,  those  cases  say  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  remedy  in  these  circumstances  is  a  new  trial. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  May  I  ask  you  about  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

basis  for  the  legal  rule  you're  asking  us  to  adopt?  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's  just  assume,  for  the  sake  of  argument,  that  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  any  Federal  rule  that  sheds  very  much  light 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly  on  this  question. 

 

 

 

            

So  then  your  argument  seems  to  come  down  to

two  points:  One  is  that  there's  nothing  that  gives 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  ­­ expressly,  or  maybe  even  by  implication, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives  the  trial  judge  the  power  to  do  this.  But  trial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judges  do  hundreds  of  things  that  are  not  expressly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized  by  rule.  So  what  ­­ we  ­­ we  certainly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  adopt  that  rule,  a  Federal  judge  ­­ a  trial 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

judge  can't  do  anything  unless  there's  a  rule  that  says 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  judge  can't  ­­ can  do  it.  Trials  would  come  to  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end. 

            

The  other  is  based  on  the  common  law.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  were  all  sorts  of  common  law  procedures,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures  that  continued  into  the  19th  century,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  abandoned  in  modern  practice. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  you  want  us  to  say  if  there  was  a  ­­ an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established  practice  at  common  law,  and  into  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe  the  late  19th  century.  Trial  judges  today  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  courts  today  must  follow  that  rule  unless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  something  that  gives  them  a  dispensation. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  So  Justice  Alito,  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

certainly  not  here  arguing  that  there  has  to  be  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

express  grant  of  authority  in  the  Federal  Rules.  And  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  is  true  that  Federal  courts  have  brought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  to  structure  their  proceedings  as  they  see  fit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while  the  case  is  pending.  And  I  think  if  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified  various  specific  procedures,  you  would  find

that  they  would  comfortably  meet  the  standard  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inherent  authority. 

 

            

And  so  to  take  the  government's  seemingly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favored  example,  in  limine  rulings  by  district  courts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  courts  obviously  have  the  inherent  authority, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  indeed  the  express  authority  to  make  evidentiary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rulings.  And  the  question  of  the  timing  of  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rulings  is  simply  incident  to  the  exercise  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority. 

            

Our  point  is  simply  that  to  the  extent  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  court  has  that  broader  authority,  it  has  never  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood  to  confer  the  specific  authority  to  recall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharged  jurors. 

 

            

And  to  get  back  to  the  Federal  Rules, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  I  really  don't  think  that  this  is  a  case  where 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  Rules  are  silent  on  the  issue  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  Well,  before  you  do  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  ­­ what  rule  should  we  adopt  with  respect  to  common 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  practices,  common  law  trial  practices  where  not  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  19th  century  trial  practices?  Courts  have  to  follow 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  unless  there's  something  that  says  they  don't? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  No,  not  at  all.  And  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

perfect  example  of  that  is  sequestration.  Again, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  a  ­­ a  district  court  has  the  inherent 

   

   

 

 

 

 

authority  to  sequester  the  jury,  but  a  district  court  is

not  bound  to  adhere  to  that  practice  simply  because  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  the  practice  in  1789. 

 

 

 

 

            

Our  argument  is  simply  that  you  have  to  look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  this  Court's  decisions  on  inherent  authority  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  history.  And  in  the  absence  of  a  long  history,  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  not  be  recognizing  an  inherent  authority,  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least  absent  some  necessity.  And  that's  really  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  boils  down  to. 

 

 

 

 

            

Respondent  and  the  government's  argument  at 

 

 

 

 

 

the  end  of  the  day  turns  entirely  on  considerations  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

efficiency.  It  turns  on  the  argument  that  it's  going  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  more  efficient,  in  at  least  some  of  these  cases,  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recall  the  jury  rather  than  to  conduct  a  new  trial. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  it  has  to  be  absolutely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary.  What  should  the  ­­ what  should  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial  judge  ­­ at  one  point  jurors  weren't  allowed  to

them  to  have  lunch. 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  ­­ was  that  absolutely

that  ­­ and  this  just  sort  of  goes  back  to  the  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of,  you  know,  what  is  the  affirmative  source  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  here? 

 

            

 

And  this  Court  has  never,  in  its  inherent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  cases,  as  Respondent  freely  concedes  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page  39  of  his  brief,  said  that  efficiency  alone  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient  justification  for  the  exercise  of  inherent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority.  And  again,  this  is  where  the  Federal  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why  not?  Why  not?  Why 

  

  

  

 

 

 

isn't  it?  I  mean,  it's  very  expensive  to  have  new 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trials.  Hardly  anyone  can  use  a  court.  You've  been 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

calling  all  these  jurors  back  as  witnesses  costs  money. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  you're  arguing  that  rather  than  ­­ it's  going  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay,  that's  their  efficiency  argument.  And  ­­ and  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  here  turns  on  whether  the  jury  is  still  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  courtroom  or  whether  they've  gone  into  the  hallway 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  is  asked,  did  anybody  talk  to  you?  No.  Okay. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  if  it  saves  a  lot  of  money,  and  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  only  difference,  why  don't  we  say  the  efficiency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument's  what  counts?  It  matters  to  people.  It  means 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  they  can  get  their  cases  resolved  or  not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  So  Justice  Breyer,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

analyzing  questions  of  inherent  authority,  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  never  engaged  in  policy  balancing,  and  it's  focused

really  isn't  much  reason  in  terms  of  fairness  not  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it. 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  And  I'm  not  sure  that  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  always  going  to  be  true.  I  think  that  Respondent  and 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  in  their  briefs  try  to  sort  of  set  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  dichotomy  between  technical  defects  in  the  verdict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  one  hand  and  burdensome  new  trials  on  the  other. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

With  regard  to  technical  defects  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict,  truly  technical  defects,  those  can  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corrected,  short  of  a  new  trial,  under  Rule  60(a).  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

recall  of  the  jurors  is  going  to  be  burdensome  in  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  as  this  one  where  the  jury  is  being  asked,  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply  to  correct  a  technical  defect,  but  to  deliberate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

anew  and  to  reach  an  entirely  different  verdict.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  respectfully  submit  that  of  all  of  the  cases  in

Respondent  and  the  government's  briefs,  they  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hard­pressed  to  identify  any  case  that  actually  fits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  pattern  where  a  district  court  is  being  told  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  a  district  court  is  telling  a  jury  to  go  back  and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reach  an  entirely  different  verdict. 

 

 

 

 

            

With  respect  to  the  policy  considerations,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  think  that  there  are  policy  considerations  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strongly  support  the  bright­line  rule  that  we  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advocating.  As  we  point  out  in  our  brief,  fairness  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finality  considerations  point  strongly  in  our  direction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  while  it  is  certainly  true  the  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  are  able  to  engage  in  prejudice  inquiries,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  risk  of  prejudice  is  particularly  great  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  context.  And  at  least  the  government  seems  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize  as  much  when  the  government  attempts  to  cabin 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  rule  under  the  guise  of  the  abuse­of­discretion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  in  various  respects.  And  I'll  come  back  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defects  with  that  proposed  rule  in  a  minute. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  only  other  thing  that  I  would  say 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  regard  to  the  policy  balancing  is  that  I  think  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  very  strong  workability  argument  in  support  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  position. 

 

            

If  you  accept  what  I  understand  to  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent's  position;  in  other  words,  to  confer  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  courts  essentially  an  unbounded  power  to  recall

discharged  jurors  subject  only  to  the  constraints  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outer  bounds  of  due  process,  courts  and  litigants  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  have  very  strong  incentive  to  pursue  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

option  to  correct  all  sorts  of  errors. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  this  case  actually  illustrates 

   

 

 

 

 

the  problem.  There's  a  lot  of  back  and  forth  in  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs  about  who  should  have  raised  this  issue  before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  district  court  before  discharge.  Well,  in  a  case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

like  this  one,  my  co­counsel,  Mr.  Angle,  would  have  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  incentive  to  raise  this  issue  before  discharge  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  simple  reason  that  the  jury  was  last  seen  returning 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  verdict  that,  not  only  did  not  award  the  minimum 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount,  it  awarded  nothing  at  all  to  our  shared  client. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

By  contrast,  in  cases  such  as  this  one, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties  like  Respondent,  upon  recognizing  that  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  obvious  error  with  the  verdict,  are  going  to  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  incentive  to  pursue  recalling  the  jury  as  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative  to  a  new  trial,  because  after  all,  for  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  reasons  that  my  co­counsel  probably  didn't  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  jury  very  much,  Mr.  Katyal's  co­counsel  presumably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  this  jury  was  the  best  jury  on  earth.  And  so  in

all  that  often,  though  it  does  seem  to  come  up  with  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frequency  in  the  State  courts.  And  there  are  a  number 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  cases  cited  in  ­­ in  the  briefs  going  back  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  to  the  early  days  of  the  Republic.  But  I  think  what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  would  say  is  that  to  the  extent  that  the  Court  thinks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  isn't  a  problem  that  comes  up  very  often,  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicates  to  us  that  it  is  simply  not  worth  the  candle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  adopt  either  Respondent's  approach,  which  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  create  a  motion  to  recall  the  jury,  as  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative  to  the  remedy  that's  actually  provided  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  rules,  a  motion  for  a  new  trial,  or  the  government's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach,  this  sort  of  presumptive,  one­hour  limit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  simply  don't  think  that  there  is  any  need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  this  Court  to  move  the  line  from  the  point  of

discharge  to  the  point  of  discharge  plus  one  hour  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  other  ­­ whatever  other  limitations  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants  to  impose  under  the  abuse  of  discretion  standard, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly  because  a  court  will  have  the  ability  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct  obvious  defects  before  discharge. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  this  Court  adopts  our  rule,  it  will, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  anything,  create  incentives  for  courts  and  litigants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  forward  to  pause  for  a  moment  at  the  point  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  the  jury's  verdict  is  returned  and  published 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  discharge  to  determine  whether  there  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obvious  error  that  can  be  corrected,  consistent  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  power  to  do  so  prior  to  discharge. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  freely  acknowledge  that  if  a  court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

wants  to,  for  instance,  take  a  short  recess  at  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point,  it  can  do  so. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  to  the  extent  that  the  specter  is  given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  elaborate  new  trials  in  complex  cases  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trials  have  been  particularly  lengthy,  I  would 

   

 

 

 

 

respectfully  submit  that  it  is  precisely  in  those  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  courts  and  litigants  ought  to  have  the  incentive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  that. 

 

 

            

And  the  last  thing  I  would  say  before 

   

 

 

 

 

 

reserving  the  balance  of  my  time  for  rebuttal,  to  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  to  Justice  Alito's  question,  is  that  with  regard  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  Rules,  we're  not  just  pointing  to  the

specific  rules  like  Rule  48  and  Rule  51,  the  rules  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

polling  and  the  rules  on  instructing  juries.  We're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointing  as  well  to  Rule  59(a)(2),  which  is  the  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  says  that  in  nonjury  trials,  a  court  has  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  upon  receiving  a  motion  for  a  new  trial  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  further  proceedings  to  take  evidence  to  reach  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  judgment,  but  conspicuously  does  not  confer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  such  power  in  jury  trials.  And  that,  to  us,  while 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  an  express  prohibition  on  the  recall  of  discharged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurors,  is  the  next  best  thing. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  would  respectfully  reserve  the  balance  of 

 

 

 

 

 

my  time.

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  NEAL  K.  KATYAL 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As  the  Chief  Justice  and  Justice  Breyer  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicated,  under  Petitioner's  rule,  a  trial  lasting  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

week,  a  month,  a  year  would  have  to  be  entirely  done 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  because  one  juror  took  one  step  outside  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courtroom  one  minute  after  a  verdict.  Now,  Petitioner 

   

  

 

 

 

 

says  that  new  trial  is  required,  not  because  of  anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Constitution  or,  Justice  Sotomayor,  actual

prejudice,  but  because  of  inferences  that  he  draws  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  rules. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Katyal,  my  problem 

  

 

 

 

 

is  I  have  problems  with  his  rules;  I  have  problems  with 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

yours. 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  you've  got  to  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  I  think  it's  some  of  what  the  government  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying. 

            

Putting  aside  the  questioning  here,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

troubles  me  in  its  adequacy,  okay,  it's  not  uncommon  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  perhaps  uncommon  in  this  case  for  families  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crying  outside  of  courtrooms,  for  families  to  be  talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  each  other  and  visibly  expressing  either  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pleasure  or  displeasure  at  what  a  jury  did.  Not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

uncommon  for  court  correction  officers  in  the  State  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

New  York  to  get  very  close  to  juries  ­­ when  they  used 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  sequester  them,  but  even  today  ­­ and  a  corrections 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer  saying  something  like,  good  job,  guys,  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end  of  the  verdict,  okay,  when  the  jury's  discharged. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There  is  expressions  in  the  courtroom.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we  do  a  prejudice  test,  how  are  we  going  to  ensure  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  concept  of  a  fair  trial  is  wholesome  enough  to  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permit  what  I  consider  some  ­­ could  be  potentially 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

great  contamination  of  the  jury  and  of  their  emotional

state? 

              

I  mean,  there  are  juries  all  of  the  time  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  the 
 

 

night  to  think  about  a  case  who  change  their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind. 

            

MR.  BASH:  So  ­­


  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  the  next  day,
 

  

 

 

 

 

they're  reaching  out  to  the  court  or  they're  reaching 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  to  one  of  the  party's  attorneys  and  wanting  to  undo 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  verdict. 

 

            

But  what's  the  rule  that  takes  care  of  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  those  things?  Is  ­­ is  it  the  boundless  ability  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recall  juries?  What  are  the  circumstances  a  court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

should  look  at?  What's  your  rule?  Give  me  a  rule 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Justice  Sotomayor,  I'll  give 

  

 

 

 

 

you  a  rule,  and  then,  hopefully,  I  can  explain  why  I 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  his  rule  is  really  problematic. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  our  rule  is  very  simple  and  deals  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  those  things,  which  is  that  power  after  discharge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  parallel  to  the  power  before  discharge.  So  all  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  know,  but  you're 

    

 

 

 

making  that  up. 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  No,  no,  no.

of  the  things  I  talked  about. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Well,  it  does.  I  think  it 

    

  

 

 

 

 

does.  Because  as  this  case  comes  to  the  Court  ­­ and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  reply  brief  at  page  13  admits  this  ­­ the  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  have  been  resubmitted  with  this  and  had  all  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things,  the  juror  crying,  the  folks  crying  outside.  All 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  those  things  could  have  happened  if  the  judge  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  a  different  word,  "recessed"  instead  of 

   

 

 

 

 

"discharged." 

            

says  ­­

 

            

We  are  not  here  defending  some  rule  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  it  depends  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

courthouse.  In  most  courthouses,  certainly  the  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

system  and  a  lot  of  State  systems,  the  jury  doesn't  get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  go  out  and  mix  with  the  public. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Quite  ­­ quite  right, 

  

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor.  But  all  I'm  saying  is  whatever  the  rules 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  for  predischarge,  those  rules  are  just  parallel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  discharge  so  long  as  you  have,  like  here,  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge  of  a  couple  of  minutes  where  there  is  no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice  to  the  other  side.  And  I  think  courts  are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

well­versed  in  ­­ in  kind  of  evaluating  those  prejudice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiries.  They  do  it  all  of  the  time.  Governments

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Would  your  rules  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ but  you're  not  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ apply  equally  in  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

criminal  case? 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  We  think  that  ­­ that  you  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  get  into  it,  but  we  do  think  that  they  generally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  here.  And  that  underscore  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  What  about  impaneling  the 

  

 

 

 

 

jury?  Suppose  the  judge  impanels  the  jury  and  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decides  that  the  impanelment  was  defective  ­­ one  juror 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  there  ­­ and  three  hours  later,  reimpanels  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury.  Is  that  proper? 

  

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Well,  I  think  in  that 

   

  

 

 

 

circumstance,  again,  it's  ­­ you  know,  the  discharge  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  to  do  with  it.  It's  either  proper  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I'm  talking  about 

  

 

 

 

impanelment. 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Right.  And  so  I  don't  think 

   

  

  

 

 

 

that,  you  know,  we  have  a  position  on  impanelment.  Our 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  is  just  simply  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  you  said  it  applies 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  criminal  and  civil  cases.  And  you  say  that  what  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  your  brief,  you  say  whatever  the  judge  can  do,  he  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undo. 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Correct.

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Which  is  a  sweeping 

   

  

 

 

statement  when  we  talk  about  ­­ but  in  double  jeopardy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules,  double  jeopardy  applies  the  moment  there's  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impanelment. 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Absolutely.  They  should  have 

  

  

 

 

 

said  that,  Justice  Kennedy  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  I'm  not  ­­ and  I'm  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure  how  your  rule  would  accommodate  that  principle. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  So  we  have  a  very  limited  undue 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

principle.  It  is  not  anything  ­­ that  anything  goes, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  rather  it's  tempered  by  the  Constitution  and  by  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  inherent  power  cases  which  say  it's  got  to  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  exercise. 

 

            

So  for  the  answer  to  that  is  it's  a  double 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jeopardy  violation;  it's  a  double  jeopardy  violation  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  discharge  has  nothing  to  do  with  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  if  I  could  go  back  and  explain  why  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  their  rule  is  really  problematic. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  but  your  ­­ your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

principle  is  whatever  ­­ you  say  whatever  the  judge  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do,  he  can  undo.  What  ­­ what  a  court  can  do,  it  has  an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inherent  power  to  undo. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  That's  ­­ but  we  do  make  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  that's  tempered  by  the  inherent  power  limitations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  this  Court,  which  are  very  extreme.  And  so  I  don't

test.  The  Chambers  test  is  at  page  49  and  50  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion,  which  says  that  it's  got  to  be  actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimate  response. 

 

            

And  ­­ and  I  think  Mr.  Shanmugam  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely  wrong  when  he  says,  oh,  if  there's  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative,  that  means  there  is  no  inherent  power. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chambers  on  those  two  pages  is  absolutely  crystal  clear: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  existence  of  an  alternative  doesn't  deprive  inherent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power. 

            

Now,  our  concern  about  their  rule,  and, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again,  going  back  to  the  first  questions  the  Chief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked,  it's  not  even  clear  what  their  rule  is,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  most  of  this  case,  before  the  entire  Ninth  Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  blue  brief,  the  rule  was  the  magic  words  rule, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  was  discharge  ends  things.  Now  ­­ the  word 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge  ends  things.  Now  the  rule  happens  to  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

geographic  limitation. 

 

            

By  the  way,  his  reply  brief  at  page  10  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yet  an  entirely  different  rule,  which  is  the  Burlingame 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule,  which  is,  you  can,  even  after  discharge,  even  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

next  day,  have  the  jury  come  back  and  reorder  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impose  an  additional  verdict.

not  sure  you're  the  one  that  should  be  complaining  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  rule  that's  not  very  clear.  I  mean,  yours  is

ask  the  questions,  and  particularly  ­­ it's  a  variant  on

sense  to  say  it's  a  bright­line  rule.  We  don't  want  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waste  courts'  time,  you  know,  figuring  out  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  adequate  prejudice,  how  far  is  too  far. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Let's  just  have  a  clear  rule.  If  the  judge 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

says  discharged,  you're  discharged.  And  if  he's  made 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  mistake,  you  know,  he'll  be  more  careful  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

future. 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  our  rule  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  the  way  Federal  courts  deal  with  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues,  the  rules  in  the  inherent  power  cases  generally, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  to  leave  this  and  the  hundreds  of  decisions  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  courts  to  handle  in  the  first  instance.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it  would  be  a  terrible  idea  to  adapt  a  bright­line

recall.  He  doesn't  tell  you  that  that  case  was  reversed

thinking  of  something  like,  if  they've  been  exposed  to

you  can't  recall  it?  Are  there  any  limits  to  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power? 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  There  ­­ there  are  strong 

  

 

 

 

 

 

limits.  And  those  limits  are  found,  for  example,  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ninth  Circuit's  decision  below,  which  says  that  it's  got 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  a  short  recall.  There's  got  to  be  an  inquiry  into 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  or  not  there's  contamination.  And  if  there  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  contamination,  absolutely. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  How  short  is  short?

Sometimes  the  trial  lasts  a  year,  a  year  and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

a  half,  Justice  Sotomayor.  In  Russo,  I  think  your  trial 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  one­and­a­half  months,  and  you  wouldn't  want  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily  throw  something  out  for  quite  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

length  of  time.  And  in  some  cases,  the  jury  is  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked  a  very  simple  question  that  they  have  to  answer, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  so  it  might  be  something  that  could  be  more  than  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple  of  minutes.  So  I  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  what  about 

  

 

 

 

geographic  ­­ you  wouldn't  draw  a  line  at,  say,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courthouse  door?  Once  they  leave  the  courthouse,  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  While  they're  in  the  court,  it's  okay. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  I  think  the  Federal  case  law, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

and  this  is  clear,  actual  prejudice  is  the  inquiry.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  adopt  his  test,  what  is  that  door?  Do  you  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  have  an  NFL  referee  to  adjudicate  whether  or  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone  is  outside  the  threshold  of  the  door  or  inside? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  just  think  that  gets  very  unworkable.  I  think  there 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  no  reason  to  do  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  They  have  to  ­­ to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  each  juror.  Now,  when  you  went  out  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

street,  did  you  talk  to  anybody? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  I  think  ­­ I  think  that  would 

    

   

 

 

 

 

be  preferable,  but  I  do  think  an  en  masse,  you  know,

may  be  appropriate,  or  something  like  this  in  which  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  a  couple  of  minutes  and  there's  no  allegation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatsoever  of  any  actual  prejudice  that  anyone  talked  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anyone  besides  the  clerk  of  the  court.  You  know,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  that's  perfectly  appropriate.  But  in  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  case,  absolutely  probably  different. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Katyal,  I  wonder  whether 

   

  

 

 

 

there's  one  difference  between  the  postdischarge  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  predischarge  case.  You've  been  talking  a  lot 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

about  contamination  and  outside  influence.  In  there  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  as  though  the  inquiry  is  roughly  the  same,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  way  in  which  the  postdischarge  case  seems 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different,  which  is  that  once  you  are  discharged,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  take  off  your  juror  hat  psychologically,  mentally, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  you  start  thinking  about  a  case  in  a  different  way, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  you  start  even  wondering  whether,  when  you  had  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

juror  hat  on,  you  were  thinking  about  it  in  the  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way.  And  I  wonder  whether  that  is  a  difference  that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

makes  a  difference  in  this  context. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  I  can  certainly  see  a  Federal 

    

   

 

 

 

court,  particularly  if  the  length  of  discharge  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lengthy,  getting  into  that  and  saying,  that's  why  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  going  to  have  a  recall.  But,  you  know,  there  ­­ no 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  court  ever  has  adopted  the  version  of  ­­ has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted  that  argument  or  Mr.  Shanmugam's  argument  and

said,  the  courts  lack  authority  for  that  reason. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  maybe  the  Rules  Committee  at  some  point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants  to  get  into  that  and  say,  we're  really  concerned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  people  taking  their  hat  off  and  this  psychological 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference.  But  that  is  not  something  either  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules,  and  it's  certainly  not  something  in  this  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inherent  power  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It's  certainly  not  going 

  

 

 

 

 

to  help  courts  if  we  adopt  a  Federal  rule.  I'm  looking 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  a  principle  that  would  apply  for  where  this  problem 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurs  the  most  often,  which  is  State  court.  So  tell  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  we  rule  in  a  way  that,  because  this  is  what  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned  before,  how  many  jurors  change  their  mind? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Right.  Well,  with  respect  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

State  court,  at  least  as  I  understood  the  new  position 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now,  nothing  this  Court  will  do  will  ­­ will  solve  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  problem.  So  because  this  is  ­­ is  ­­ it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coming  up,  as  he  characterizes  it,  an  Article  III  issue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  State  courts  overwhelmingly  have 

 

 

 

 

solved  this  problem.  21  different  States  permit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

recalls.  Only  11  do  not.  And,  yes,  it's  true  in  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

old  common  law  we  had  a  different  ­­ a  difference  in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

variable  times.  But  starting  in  1839,  courts  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

permitted  recall,  and  the  Federal  system  has  permitted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recall.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  guess  in  answer  to  my 

    

 

 

 

 

 

question,  I  was  not  looking  so  much  for  a  historical 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

answer.  You  both  have  your  historical  arguments.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

for  an  answer  about  why  we  should  take  this  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seriously  and  think  that  it  makes  the  postdischarge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  different  from  the  precharge  ­­ predischarge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  where  the  ­­ the  inquiry  that  we  do  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predischarge  context  about  have  you  talked  to  anybody, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  you  read  a  newspaper,  just  really  doesn't  get  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  heart  of  the  matter  in  the  postdischarge  context, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  that  you've  just  taken  off  your  juror  clothes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  maybe  started  thinking  about  what  you  did  when  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  on  in  an  entirely  different  way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Justice  Kagan,  I  do  think  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you  should  take  it  seriously.  I  think  district  courts 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  that  all  the  time,  which  is  why  recalls  don't  happen, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

except  in  circumstances  like  this,  and  why  he  can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  to  any  abuse.  I'd  caution  the  Court  because  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  ­­ if  the  Court  is  animated  about  the  psychological 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern  about  adopting  some  one­size­fits­all  solution 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  entire  country  and  undoing  trials  that  sometimes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  lengthy,  sometimes  impose  huge  psychological  costs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  those  who  testify  before  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

For  example,  the  first  time  I  was  before  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  year  in  Kansas  v.  Carr,  the  Court  was  concerned

back,  do  they  get  ­­ do  they  get  resworn?  I  mean,  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge  just  said,  thank  you  very  much  for  your  service. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  are  now  discharged.  You  are  no  longer  jurors. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Then  he  recalls  them.  Do  they  get  sworn  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again  as  jurors? 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  I  think  that  would  be  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

preferable  thing  to  do.  But  what,  again,  in  response  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy,  what  was  happening  in  a  case  like  this, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  undoing  the  earlier  pronouncement  of  discharge. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're  turning  it  to  the  status  quo  ante.  And  then  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  that  swearing  again.  You  have  the  ­­ effectively 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  first  swearing  working  out.  And  here,  as  this  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes  to  the  Court,  there  is  no  allegation  whatsoever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  was  any  prejudice  to  Mr.  Dietz  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recall. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Again,  you  would  apply  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

same  rule  in  a  criminal  case  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Again,  I  think  the  Court

shouldn't  get  into  it.  But,  in  general,  inherent  power 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions  are  treated  the  same  way.  But,  you  know,  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  A  defendant  who  thinks 

    

 

 

 

he's  been  acquitted,  five  minutes  later,  an  hour  later 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  find  out  that  he's  guilty? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Well,  as  the  government  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

last  footnote  points  out,  that  does  happen  in  the  double 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jeopardy  context  with  respect  to  mistaken 

 

 

 

 

 

pronouncements.  And  this  Court  already  said  that's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  problem.  Now  if,  Justice  Kennedy  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  the  jurors  haven't 

  

 

 

 

 

been  discharged  in  those  cases. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  In  those  cases,  yes,  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

right.  So  Justice  Kennedy,  if  you're  concerned  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  I  suspect  that  could  be  something  that  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  ­­ the  district  court's  determination  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  what  is  and  is  not  a  reasonable  response  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  at  hand.  And  there  is  no  example  whatsoever  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  like  this  hypothetical  happening,  and  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why,  as  the  Court  writes  its  opinion,  we  think  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  bracket  those  types  of  concerns.  See  if  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ever  arise.  They  should  first,  I  think,  be  dealt  with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  Rules  Committee,  but  not  in  a  one­size­fits­all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

solution  by  this  Court.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  The  rules  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Rules  Committee  is,  I  would  say,  unlikely  to  address 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  for  the  simple  reason  that  it  doesn't  come  up  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

often.  I  gather  no  Federal  cases  at  all.  So  the 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  Rules  Committee  probably  has  bigger  fish  to  fry. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

How  ­­ how  long  was  the  trial  in  this  case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  KATYAL:  The  trial  was  two  days. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

And,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  the  Rules  Committee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  handle  a  lot  of  issues  that  do,  you  know,  involve 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

small  issues.  But  here,  of  course,  there  have  been  six 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  Federal  circuit  courts  that  have  ruled  on  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue,  which  is  what  the  cert.  petition  focused  on.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  don't  think  that  this  is  something  that,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  attract  the  attention  of  the  Rules  Committee. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  my  friend's  idea,  which  is  somehow  the  Rules 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Committee  has  already  resolved  this  issue,  I  think,  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

intentioned  with  that  very  ­­ very  notion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

If  there  are  no  further  questions. 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel.

I'd  like  to  begin  by  stating  very  simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  we  think  the  rule  is,  and  in  doing  so,  hopefully 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clarify  something  about  this  case  that  I  think  generates 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  little  bit  of  confusion. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  rule  we  would  apply  is  that  if  this  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation  where  before  the  discharge  the  judge  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  sent  it  back  to  the  jury  with  a  clarifying 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction,  then  the  mere  formal  pronouncement  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge  does  not  bar  the  judge  from  doing  that  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation  where  no  actual  prejudice  would  result. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  reason  I  said  I  think  that  relates  to  an 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

area  of  confusion  in  this  case  is  that  in  his  argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  here,  Petitioner's  counsel  has  characterized  this  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  weight  of  the  evidence  problem.  But  that's  not  how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  or  the  judge  understood  the  problem  below. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  understood  the  problem  as  a  legally  impermissible 

   

 

 

 

 

 

verdict  that  demonstrated  that  the  jurors  were  confused 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  instructions,  and  Petitioner  has  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contested,  as  this  case  comes  to  the  court,  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge  could  have  sent  it  back  to  the  jury  before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge.  I'm  not  sure  that's  true  if  the  judge  says, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  I  think  it's  against  the  weight  of  the  evidence. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  would  utterly  be  coercing  a  verdict. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

So  as  the  case  comes  to  the  court,  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceded  that  the  judge  could  have  sent  it  back  before

discharge.  The  only  question,  as  I  understand  it, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

before  this  Court  is  whether  the  formal  pronouncement  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge  irrevocably  barred  the  court  from  rescinding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  discharge  and  resubmitting  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  for  reasons  we've  set  out  in  the  brief, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  think  the  prejudice  standard  comports  with  how  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  always  thinks  about  jury  impartiality  issues. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  far  more  extreme  circumstances,  take  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foundational  Remmer  decision.  That  was  a  criminal  case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

in  which  a  juror  ­­ there  was  an  attempted  bribe  to  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

juror  and  then  the  FBI  investigation  of  that  juror  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  attempted  bribe.  So  the  juror  had  a  huge  incentive 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  quit  at  that  point  because  he  had  been  bribed  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  to  ­­ excuse  me  ­­ to  convict,  because  he  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  bribed  by  the  defendant  to  convict.  The  FBI  knows 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he's  been  bribed.  And  what  the  Court  said  in  Remmer  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  is  an  actual  prejudicial  determination  after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearing,  and  it's  within  the  discretion  of  the  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court,  subject  to  abuse­of­discretion  review,  how  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy  even  that  kind  of  problem.  And  that's  a  very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  problem. 

 

            

And  it's  the  same  thing  when,  for  example,  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge  forgets  midtrial  to  admonish  the  jurors  to  avoid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside  influence,  which  is  parallel  to  a  situation  here 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  one  caveat,  which  relates  to  Justice  Kagan's

question  earlier,  in  that  jurors  are  exposed  to  outside 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

influence  without  an  instruction.  And  even  in  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  courts  have  been  uniform  in  saying  ­­ courts  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  almost  uniform  ­­ I  think  there's  an  Eighth  Circuit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  went  the  other  way  ­­ in  saying  that  you  conduct  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice  inquiry. 

 

            

Now,  Justice  Kagan's  question  was  is  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  different  postdischarge.  And  I  think  it  may 

   

  

 

 

 

 

be  reasonable  to  think  that  at  some  point, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

postdischarge,  it's  kind  of  like  getting  out  of  the  bar 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exam.  Or  you  studied  all  the  stuff,  you  remember  it, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  now  the  commercial  paper  information  is,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receding  from  your  brain  in  a  way  that  it  wouldn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  the  bar  exam. 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  BASH:  But  I  ­­ I  don't  think  that's  ­­

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

and  I  think  a  district  court  could  properly  take  that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

into  consideration,  but  I  don't  think  that's  true  a  few 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

minutes  after  the  discharge. 

 

 

 

            

It's  one  thing  to  say  when  you  get  home  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  go  back  to  your  spouse  or  your  friends  and  you  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  what  we  did,  and  they  say,  wow,  I  can't  believe 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  did  that.  That  ­­ that's  going  to  cause  you  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

start  to  reconsider  your  verdict  as  a  citizen,  not  what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  juror  had  on.  But  here  it  was  a  few  minutes.

Everybody  concedes  it  was  a  few  minutes. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

At  the  time,  Petitioner's  counsel  ­­ I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  on  27(a)  of  the  Ped  AP  ­­ said  we  ­­ I  don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  jurors  talked  to  anybody  about  the  case.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  talking  to  the  clerk  about  other  stuff,  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reimbursement.  Didn't  talk  to  anybody  about  the  case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  was  a  few  minutes. 

   

 

 

            

And  given  that  where  a  juror  is  attempted 

   

 

 

 

 

 

bribed,  or  jurors  sleep  through  trial,  or  jurors  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  exposed  to  extraneous  information  where  jurors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speak  to  counsel,  we  always  conduct  a  prejudice  inquiry. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  would  be  entirely  anomalous  to  say  in  this  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance  there's  a  three­minute  break,  you  can't 

   

 

 

 

 

bring  the  ­­ the  jurors  back  and  resubmit  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  why  can't  we  recall  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  six  months  later?  Just  this  case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BASH:  Well,  I  think  that  the  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  mean,  they  didn't  talk 

    

 

 

 

 

about  it  afterwards.  It's  not  an  earth  shattering  case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why  can't  we  call  them  back  the  next  day,  the  day  after, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  ask  them  did  you  talk  to  anybody?  They  say  no. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Then  you  go  back  and  resubmit  the  case  now. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  Well,  Petitioner  had  ­­ we  don't

standard. 

            

MR.  BASH:  Because  of  the  prejudice 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What  prejudice?  You 

  

  

 

 

haven't  shown  any  prejudice.  They  didn't  with  anybody 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  case.  They  didn't  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  I  think  it  would  be  reasonable 

    

 

 

 

 

 

for  ­­ so  I  guess  we're  in  the  situation  where  six

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  talking  about  one  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

infinity,  because  if  ­­ presumably  I'm  interested  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  limits  to  this. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  And  we  think  it  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  for  a  district  court  to  say,  and  even  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  to  say,  as  a  matter  of  giving  guidance  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower  courts,  that  once  jurors  have  returned  to  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

daily  lives,  they've  probably  spoken  to  friends  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

family  about  the  case.  They've  taken  off  their  jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hats  for  more  than  a  de  minimis  period.  It's  so  likely 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there's  going  to  be  prejudice  that  we're  just  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  allow  that  anymore. 

 

 

 

 

            

I'd  also  say  there's  a  more  formal 

   

 

 

 

 

limitation,  which  this  Court  has  said  in  cases  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Casey  and  Quackenbush,  that  once  final  judgment  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entered,  a  court  can't  rescind  interlocutory  orders.

I  think  there  would  be  a  question  about  when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  occurs  in  this  case.  We  don't  think  it  would  ever 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  that  far  under  the  prejudice  standard,  but  it  might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  be  when  the  Rule  58  judgment  is  entered,  which  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  happened  the  same  day  as  the  second  verdict. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  a  case  I  did  last  year,  it  happened  five  days  later. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  often  happens  very  soon.  Or  you  might  say  that  once 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  notice  of  appeal  is  filed,  or  once  the  time  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expired  for  filing  post  verdict  motions,  that's  when  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

final  judgment  occurs.  So  there'd  be  that  more  formal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bound  on  the  time  limit,  but  I  think  in  practice  there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  an  actual  prejudice  limit  that  would  bound  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  tightly. 

 

              

I  just  want  to  emphasis,  this  case  has  come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  ­­ this  issue  has  come  up  for  the  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  come  up  in,  actually,  a  surprising  number  of  lower 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  cases.  And  if  you  look  at  the  cases  cited  in  both 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties'  briefs,  they're  almost  invariably  very  short 

 

 

 

 

 

 

periods. 

              

I  mean,  this  is  a  judge  wanting  a  do  over 

   

   

 

 

 

 

after  a  few  minutes  where  he  made  a  mistake.  This  is 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

not  people  calling  things  back  months  later.  There  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  five­month  case  that  Petitioner  cites,  but  as  Mr. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Katyal  noted,  that  was  reversed  as  gross  error  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California  Supreme  Court.  We  don't  think  our  standard

would  allow  that.  But  where  there's  a  minutes­long 

   

  

 

 

 

 

error,  judges  ought  to  have  the  opportunity  to  fix  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  they  can. 

 

 

              

 

I  know  Mr.  Shanmugam  said  that  it  hasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

been  the  case  in  any  of  the  cases  cited  in  the  briefs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  juries  retired  for  future  deliberations,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  one  of  the  circuit  split  cases  that  the  United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  was  involved  with,  the  Third  Circuit  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figueroa,  the  judge  discharged  the  jurors  and  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

realized  there  was  a  bifurcated  felony  possession  count 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to  try.  And  it  was  only  a  few  minutes,  and  the  judge 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  them  back,  and  they  were  reinstructed.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  evidence  presented  on  that  count,  and  ­­ and  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  deliberated  further. 

 

 

            

So  it  does  happen.  It's  ­­ it's  rare, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

hopefully,  because  it's  a  mistake.  But  it's  not  so  rare 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  I  think  it  ­­ it  warrants  a  bright­line  rule  that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  impose  really  serious  costs  on  ­­ on  parties  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigants. 

            

If  there  are  no  further  questions.

Justice. 

            

The  rule  that  we  are  proposing  to  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  simple  one.  It  is  that,  consistent  with  the  common 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  and  the  Federal  rules,  a  district  court  lacks  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  to  recall  discharged  jurors  for  further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service  in  the  same  case,  with  "discharge"  being  defined 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  the  point  at  which  a  jury  released  from  service 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leaves  the  judge's  presence  and  control. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  writing  an  opinion  in  that  direction,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  respectfully  submit  that  the  Court  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reiterate  the  district  courts  have  multiple  available 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedies  to  cure  the  perceived  problem  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Again,  we  do  freely  concede,  as  Mr.  Katyal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

points  out,  that  a  district  court  has  the  authority  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reinstruct  the  jury  and  to  order  the  jury  to  engage  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further  deliberations  prior  to  discharge,  and  that  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  care  of  many  of  the  cases  in  the  category  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obvious  errors. 

 

            

After  discharge,  it  is  true  that  a  court  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  authority  to  recall  jurors,  but  not  for  the  purpose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  reconstituting  them  as  a  jury.  Instead,  simply  for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  purpose  of  correcting  clerical  errors  and  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

oversights  in  the  judgment.  And  where  the  errors  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  substantial,  however  ­­

clerical  errors?  I  understand  that's  what  the  rule  you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed  to  deals  with,  clerical  errors.  But  you  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"and  others,"  so  what's  the  others? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHANMUGAM:  Well,  I  think  that  the 

   

  

 

 

 

others  are  these  cases  like  the  ones  I  referred  to  in  my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opening  argument  where,  you  know,  a  jury  returns  two 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict  forms  and  the  question  is  which  verdict  form  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  correct  one. 

 

 

            

In  other  words,  courts  have  the  authority  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deal  with  situations  where  what  you're  trying  to  do  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  intuit  the  jury's  intent  at  the  time  of  the  original 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict;  to  take  evidence  on  historical  facts  concerning 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  jury  actually  did.  And  the  relevant  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule  of  Evidence,  Federal  Rule  of  Evidence  606(b),  makes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  that  that  is  an  exception  to  the  ordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable  rule  that  evidence  from  jury  deliberations  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inadmissible. 

            

And  of  course,  finally,  the  last  available 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy  is  to  order  a  new  trial.  And  again,  however  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

characterize  the  error  at  issue  here,  whether  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

characterize  it  as  a  verdict  that's  contrary  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

weight  of  the  evidence  or  an  instructional  error,  a  new 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial  has  always  been  the  default  remedy  in  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances. 

              

I  think  that  the  problem  with  Respondent  and

the  government's  rule  was  well  pointed  out  in  Mr.  Bash's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument.  To  the  extent  that  the  driving  concern  here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  prejudice,  the  government's  limitations  ­­ proposed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations  really  don't  make  a  lot  of  sense,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

neither  does  Respondent's  suggestion  made  for  the  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  at  oral  argument  today  that  there  is  a  limitation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  time  period  in  which  juries  can  be  recalled. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

And  that  is  for  the  simple  reason  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  have  a  jury  that's  been  out  for  a  long  period  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  where  you  don't  have  prejudice,  and  conversely  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  have  prejudice  almost  instantly,  particularly  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world  of  smart  phone  communications.  And  the  rule  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  articulates  here  is  going  to  apply  in  civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  criminal  cases  alike. 

 

 

 

            

And  Justice  Ginsburg,  the  final  judgment 

 

 

 

 

 

limitation  really  provides  little  solace  in  the  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  because  when  a  jury  returns  a  verdict,  final 

   

   

 

 

 

 

judgment  is  typically  not  entered  until  after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing,  which  again  typically  takes  place  sometime 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later. 

            

And  at  bottom  ­­ or  the  question  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  is  really  whether  extending  a  court's  power  beyond 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  point  of  discharge  is  worth  the  candle.  And  again, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  light  of  all  the  available  alternatives  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation,  we  would  respectfully  submit  that  it  is  not,
