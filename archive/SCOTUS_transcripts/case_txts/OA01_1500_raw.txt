CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 01-1500, Eric Cornell Clay versus The


United States.


Mr. Goldstein.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,


and may it please the Court:


Paragraph 6 of section 2255 provides that,


quote, a 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a


motion under this section.  The limitation period shall


run from the latest of -- and it identifies four events,


the first of which is, quote, the date on which the 

judgment of conviction became final.


Congress did not define or otherwise explicate


when the judgment becomes final in that provision, and the


question presented by this case is that, given that final


can mean many different things in different contexts, when


does it -- judgment become final here?


Petitioner agrees with the clear majority of


circuits and the United States that the judgment becomes


final upon the conclusion of direct review or the


expiration of time for seeking such review.  As applied to

this case, petitioner's time to seek 2255 relief began to


run when his time to seek certiorari in this Court


expired.


Congress most likely intended that


interpretation for two reasons.  First, it is the one that


this Court has consistently used in the most analogous


context, and that is the dividing line between direct and


collateral review; and, second --


QUESTION:  Are you talking about now our


retroactivity cases?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Not merely retro --


QUESTION:  The --


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Those included, Mr. Chief


Justice, but also cases like Barefoot versus Estelle,


dealing with the presumption of correctness, and also Bell 

versus Maryland, which addresses the question of when a


statute is repealed, when does that repeal affect --


what -- what convictions does it affect?


QUESTION:  Well, those come from quite diverse


contexts.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and that


is, in effect, our point.  Those -- most of those


contexts, however, do deal with the dividing line between


direct and collateral review.


The amicus quite rightly points out that there

are other meanings of final.  We do believe, however, that


they don't -- they aren't as close as this one, and they


aren't the one that Congress most naturally looked to, and


since Congress didn't tell this Court what it meant, you


would look to the dividing line between direct and


collateral review, because that's the point of this


provision in section 2255.


I mentioned there was a second reason that I'll


come to, and that is that the -- the minority rule doesn't


work textually and would produce anomalous results.


The -- as I mentioned, the Court has picked up


the notion of final -- the judgment of conviction becoming


final, and that language appears almost verbatim in


Linkletter, in contexts like Teague, Barefoot, and Bell.


QUESTION: 


Well, Link -- Linkletter was really a 

bygone era by the time Congress passed AEDPA.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, but I think


the point still would favor us.  You're absolutely right,


because although the Court has changed the line for


retroactivity and changed the test, it has never changed


the definition of what is final, and so for 40 years plus


the Court has consistently included the time to seek


certiorari, and that's a perfectly sensible result, as it


would be applied in this case.


The -- the minority rule, by contrast, would

produce anomalous results.  It would mean, for example,


that in the couple of months after the mandate issues in


the court of appeals, a judgment of conviction would be


both final and non-final at the same time, because you


wouldn't -- although the statute refers to the judgment of


conviction becoming final, you wouldn't actually know at


that point.


QUESTION:  I thought that their -- amicus wrote,


you know, a pretty good argument on that side, and I


thought one of his better points, which is that if we're


looking at the -- the 1-year limitation from a person in


State proceedings, what it says is, it runs from the


latest of the date on which judgment became final by the


conclusion of direct review, or the expiration of time for


seeking such review; and then when you look to the 

parallel for somebody in Federal proceedings, it says it


becomes final from the date on which the judgment of


conviction becomes final.


In other words, they use the first half of the


sentence, doesn't use the sentence -- the second; and in -


- in the State proceeding it has two, and here it has one,


and he says you have to give some meaning to that


difference.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I understand.  Justice Breyer,


that is exactly what has caused the Fourth and Seventh

Circuits to scratch their head.  It's a conceivable


inference.  We don't dispute that.


Of course, the majority of courts have applied


another canon of construction here, and that is that when


Congress uses the same phrase in a statute, it's


interpreted generally, absent some strong contrary


indication, to have the same meaning.


QUESTION:  Oh, no, it doesn't, see, because you


have became final by the conclusion of direct review, and


then we have the date on which judgment of conviction


became final, and he's saying that he would interpret it


so they mean the same thing.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Ah, but he wouldn't, and here's


the reason, and let -- let me just take you very carefully


through this, and for anyone who wants to look it up, it's 

the blue brief on page 1 would be the different statutory


provisions.


2255 says, the limitation period shall run from


the latest of the date on which the judgment of conviction


became final.  According to the amicus, that means the


date on which the mandate issues.


2244(d)(1) says -- has the -- has that, and it


has some more, and that's your point.  The limitation


period shall run from the latest of the date on which the


judgment became final, and then he gives that -- that same

phrase, judgment became final, a different meaning in the


same statute.  He reads that to mean either review in this


Court, or the expiration of time to seek cert, so it


does -- it would have actually a -- that phrase, judgment


became final, would have a different meaning in 22 --


QUESTION:  Well, but the -- the -- that


doesn't -- the sentence doesn't end with judgment became


final.  It goes on to say, by the conclusion of direct


review, or the expiration of the time for seeking such


review.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's right, so what we have,


Mr. Chief Justice, is 2244, Congress explicates a phrase. 


2255, it doesn't explicate it at all, and our --


QUESTION:  So you are saying that in the --


within 2244(d)(1), those words are surplusage, they don't 

do anything, that -- the -- that 2244 would mean the same


thing if there were a period after "became final."


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Ginsburg, it is correct


that we think it would mean the same thing even if it


weren't there, but it's not surplusage.  It does have a


role, and so I have several reasons to articulate to the


Court why there's no negative pregnant -- our view is, and


this Court has said, not every silence is pregnant.  What


we have in 2255 is silent.


My point, Justice Ginsburg, is that the

inference that the minority of courts draw, that Congress


was doing something special in 2244, and therefore


impliedly didn't intend to do the same thing in 2255, is


not correct, and I have several points.


The first one goes to yours, Justice Ginsburg,


and that is, it's reasonable for this Court to ask, okay,


why did it put it in 2244 and it didn't put it in 2255? 


It would have been easier, obviously, if it had put it in


2255.


The reason we think they put it in 2244 is not


to specify which among the Federal interpretations of


"judgment becomes final" applies, but to say that it's the


Federal one, not the State one.


That's the real difference of force between 2244


instead of 2255. 


2244 cases come out of the State courts, 

and State courts define finality differently, and so what


Congress did there in 44 was make quite clear that they


were applying the Federal rule.


That was very important in particular, because


State proceedings have the added complication of not just


State direct review, but State post-conviction review, and


so Federal habeas courts could be terribly confused on


when the judgment and --


QUESTION:  But -- but you're going to get State


post-conviction review in connection with Federal habeas

cases because of the exhaustion requirement.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and that


is our point, and that is that Congress really needed to


do a better -- a very good job, as -- as good as they did


in AEDPA in any context, but they needed to do a good job


in telling Federal habeas cases in the 20 -- courts in the


2244 context when the judgment of conviction became final,


because if 20 --


QUESTION:  Well, but you can also say that they


had to give a special meaning of finality so that we could


respect the processes of the States and make it clear that


the -- all of the State procedures had to be exhausted, as


the Chief Justice indicated, because of the intrusive


nature of -- of habeas jurisprudence, of habeas orders


from the Federal courts, and so you can read this as -- as 

being an exception to this general Federal rule when, in


fact -- that brings me to another point -- you can address


both.


I -- I had -- I had thought, as the amicus brief


does indicate, that finality usually does mean from the


date of the issuance of the mandate, and then you go back


and you toll if there's -- if there's discretionary


review.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Kennedy, this is the


second point on the question of do -- does this Court have

some reason to believe that the presence in 24 -- excuse


me, 44 but not 55 creates a negative inference, the sort


of Russello presumption, and I agree with you that it


would rest on a view that this interpretation in 44(d)(1)


is unusual, and our point is that it's not unusual.


You are correct that the -- the -- as they said


in Melconian, for example, that the term of art, final


judgment, does generally mean the judgment of the district


court, but everyone agrees that that's not the


interpretation here.  In fact, it's very clear that the --


the phrase here, if I could again take you back to -- take


you back to it in 2255, is judgment of conviction becomes


final.  That phrase, judgment of conviction, picks up


Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.


Judgment of conviction includes the conviction, 

the judgment of conviction and the sentence, and it is by


necessity already final and appealable.  If this Court


were to say that the baseline rule is final judgment in


the sense of a district court, that would mean in the 2255


context that, although your -- your direct appeal could be


sitting here in the Seventh Circuit for 2 years, after the


first year, you need to be back in the district court on


2255, because the judgment of conviction would have become


final when it was entered by the district court, and no


one thinks that's sensible.

 In fact, the -- the notes to rule 5 of the -- of


the 2255 rules make quite clear you're not supposed to be


in on your 2255 until the direct review process is over,


so that -- my point was that the -- what you're describing


as the normal background rule of when a judgment of


conviction becomes final actually describes the term


"final judgment," which couldn't apply here.


QUESTION:  When you're -- when you're appealing


from the district court to the court of appeals, when does


the term, final -- what does the term of final mean there,


as to the district court judgment?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  In this -- in -- in our view,


under 2255, Mr. Chief Justice, or --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. GOLDSTEIN: 


It -- it does not become final, 

in our view.  What happens is, if you did not appeal, it


would -- the judgment of conviction would become final


after the 10 days --


QUESTION:  Well, characterize for -- for us,


then, your understanding of the amicus view.  I thought


their view is that it just becomes tolled.  The minute


you -- the minute you file the appeal it becomes tolled,


so there's no problem.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, Mr. -- Justice Kennedy,


I do agree with you that that's the amicus's view.  Our

point is that it doesn't pick up what you're describing as


the normal rule of final judgment.  That wouldn't be the


normal process.  Our point is that the most --


QUESTION:  Oh, I should think the normal rule


does include the tolling exception that I -- that I --


we've just explained.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Kennedy, as a matter


of -- for example, Melconian, if we go back to what this


Court has described as the normal background


understanding, the normal background understanding is that


just when it's entered by the district court; but if,


again if I could come back to my basic point, and that is,


we all agree final can mean a lot of things, and the


closest one, it seems perfectly clear, is the one that


divides direct and collateral review, because that's what 

this provision does.


I won't deny to you, Justice Kennedy, that it


could mean different things.  But no one -- and my third


point I wanted to make, Justice Ginsburg, about why you


shouldn't draw negative inferences, nobody's got a good


reason.  Nobody's got a reason to think that Congress


would have wanted this time to be available to State


prisoners, but not to Federal prisoners.


If I could reserve the balance of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Goldstein.

 Mr. Roberts, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. ROBERTS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


When a defendant does not petition this Court


for certiorari on direct appeal, his judgment of


conviction becomes final within the meaning of section


2255 when the time for filing a petition expires.  That


interpretation accords with the well-settled meaning of


final and the law of collateral review, and it sensibly


provides Federal prisoners the same time to prepare


collateral attacks as similarly situated State prisoners.


QUESTION:  What about an appeal from the


district court to the court of appeals? 

MR. ROBERTS:  The judgment would become final if


there -- if no appeal was filed at the time -- when the


time to file an appeal expired after the 10-day period.


QUESTION:  And yet that's contrary to a lot of


other things, is it not?  I mean, you can't go into the


district court 60 days after your time -- after the


district final judgment was entered and still maybe have


30 more days to appeal, and the district court isn't going


to do anything.


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, we're talking about finality

for -- for a different purpose here.  It's not a question


of finality for the purpose of seeking appeal, or when a


judgment -- in the term like final judgment, which is --


which would be the sense of finality when, for the


purposes of deciding --


QUESTION:  Why -- why should those be different?


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, in -- in terms of -- of


collateral review, first of all the Congress used the


particular phrase, when the judgment becomes final, that


has an established meaning in that context.  Second of


all, it's logical that the time to commence collateral


review should start to run at the conclusion of direct


review, which this Court has made clear includes the


period when -- within which to seek certiorari even if a


petition isn't filed, and that's, in fact, what Congress 

concluded in section 2244, the parallel provision for


State prisoners, and there's no persuasive reason why


Congress would have started the -- the time limitation at


a different time for Federal prisoners. 


QUESTION:  Except that -- except that they wrote


the two sections differently.  That -- that certainly is


something of a reason.


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, that -- that -- well, I'm


talking about a -- a reason why they would have intended


that result as opposed to a -- a canon or a textual

indication that there might be a difference, but even as


to the textual indication --


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I thought they would


intend it in order to show special respect for the


processes of the State, so that a State has completely


exhausted all of its procedures for determining what the


law ought to be --


MR. ROBERTS:  But --


QUESTION:  -- before they're disrupted by a


Federal judgment.


MR. ROBERTS:  But this doesn't concern the


processes of the State, Your Honor, it concerns review


in -- in this Court, and this Court's made clear the --


the distinction of the time is between whether the -- the


time to seek review in this Court is included or is not 

included, and that's not a -- a State -- a remedy, this


Court's made clear that exhaustion of State remedies


doesn't require a petitioner to seek review in this Court,


that State remedies are exhausted as long as all avenues


of review are pursued in -- in the State court system.  So


concerns about -- concerns about requiring them to go


through the full State court system wouldn't justify the


difference in the rule, nor would generalized concerns


about comity, which would suggest that State prisoners


ought to have less time to seek review from their

convictions, if -- if anything, to upset their State court


convictions, rather than -- than more time.


And really, collateral review rules are driven


more by finality concerns, which are equally strong in the


Federal context and the State context.  That's why the


Teague retroactivity rules and rules of procedural default


apply equally to both, and because finality concerns are


the same, there -- there isn't any persuasive reason why


Congress would have started the time limit at a different


time.


The negative -- the negative inference points,


to address the negative inference point, there are three


reasons why it would be inappropriate to draw a negative


inference from the omission of the clarifying language


here. 


First, it contradicts the presumption that Congress 

used final in accordance with its settled meaning in the


collateral review context, which petitioner discussed


earlier.


QUESTION:  But I -- I think, Mr. Roberts, that


as I pointed out in the question to petitioner's counsel,


2250 -- 44(d)(1) doesn't just stop with the word, final,


it goes on to kind of explicate the possible -- possible


meanings.


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, it explicates the meanings,


but it explicates the meanings by providing the definition

that is the -- is -- by providing an explication that's


consistent with the background definition that you would


expect final to have, and there's a -- there are good


reasons why Congress would have -- might have wanted to


explicate the -- to explicate it more carefully in 2244.


Petitioner discussed one, which is that 2244


concerned State prisoners, and Congress might have been


concerned that, absent clarification, courts might import


the definition of finality used by the State of


conviction, and there are varying definitions there. 


There's not the uniform definition that would include


review in this Court.


Second, it's possible that Congress might have


been concerned that the courts would assume that the time


limit in section 2244 starts to run the same time as the 

time limit in section 2263, which also concerns State


prisoners, State capital defendants and States subject to


expedited collateral review proceedings, and so


Congress --


QUESTION:  Do you --


MR. ROBERTS:  -- may have spelled it out here.


QUESTION:  Do you think it makes any difference


that in 2255 Congress used the phrase, judgment of


conviction, and in 2244(d)(1) it simply used the word,


judgment?

 MR. ROBERTS:  No, I -- I don't think that it


makes a difference.  There are variations in -- in


language like that.


QUESTION:  Well, usually variations in language


mean variations in meaning.


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, Your Honor, but it's


referring back to the judgment of the State court under


which the person is in custody.  The -- the provision


2244(d)(1) is reproduced in the gray brief on page 2 to 3.


So where it says the date on which the judgment


became final, it's -- it's referring back to a -- a person


who's in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State


court, and that would be the judgment of the district


court -- I mean, of the trial court in -- in that


situation, but fundamentally, our points are two. 

One, there's a background rule, and the


presumption is generally of -- of what -- when a judgment


becomes final in the collateral review context, and it's


generally presumed, with good reason, that Congress


legislates against that background rule and uses the terms


with their settled meaning in that context; and second, we


know Congress did that with respect to State prisoners in


section 2244 because they clarified it there; and it makes


sense that the time limitation should run at the same


time, because there's no persuasive reason for them to run

at a different time.


QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, refresh my recollection. 


Was 2255 and 22 -- and 2240(d)(1) enacted as part of the


same statute?


MR. ROBERTS:  They were enacted as part of


the -- the same statute, Your Honor, but the -- the


proposition that the same word has the same meaning, the


same word becomes final, has the same meaning throughout


the statute -- same statute would apply by virtue of that. 


So the -- so that we would expect that when Congress said,


becomes final in section 22 -- 2255, and when it said,


became final in 2244, both referring to a judgment of the


trial court convicting the defendant, that it -- it


intended those phrases to have the same meaning.


QUESTION:  I wouldn't think that.  I would -- I


would think that where you say, on the one hand, where it


becomes final by (a) or (b), and elsewhere you simply say,


where it becomes final --


MR. ROBERTS:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- I would think that the latter


means, even if it becomes final in some other fashion.


Now, that happens not -- that happens not to


help the respondent here.


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.


QUESTION:  But I -- but I do think that that's

the more natural --


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, that -- that would be one


possibility, that here it was restricted --


QUESTION:  Don't you think that's the more


natural --


MR. ROBERTS:  -- but it was broader.


QUESTION:  That's right, broader.


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, but it's hard for me to


conceive, frankly, what the broader --


QUESTION:  What the broader would be.


MR. ROBERTS:  -- understanding of finality is,


Your Honor.  I do think that -- that not every time


that -- that Congress uses the different language to --


that's more amplified and clarifying, does that -- that


mean that --


QUESTION:  Not necessarily.


MR. ROBERTS:  -- that the words -- and the Court


does not generally -- does not generally apply the


negative inference, the Russello presumption to draw the


conclusion that the -- that identical phrases have -- have


different meaning.


QUESTION:  Oh, if -- if you applied the Russello


presumption here, you -- you would be applying the


presumption that I just described, namely in -- in one


section, it limited it, in -- in the other section, it

didn't limit it at all.  You'd think the latter section


would be broader, not narrower.


MR. ROBERTS:  That -- that would be --


QUESTION:  That's -- that's what Russello said.


MR. ROBERTS:  That would be parallel to Russello


and parallel to some other cases where there's been


additional limiting language, and the Court has said


therefore, the -- we won't read that limit into the


earlier language, but in those cases also what bears note


is that the word that was limited later on, here the word


becomes -- the phrase becomes final, was by the Court, in


those cases, given its ordinary meaning, what you would


expect, apart from the Russello presumption.


QUESTION:  Yes, but what I --


MR. ROBERTS:  And here --


QUESTION:  That gets you into the argument of


whether there is an ordinary meaning of final.


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor, and there


isn't -- there isn't an ordinary meaning across the board


in every context, but here we have a -- a narrow context


in which Congress has acted in the collateral review


context, in particular in the commencement of collateral


review, and in this Court's cases, in the collateral


review context, particularly delineating when direct


review ends and collateral review begins, the Court has

used repeatedly, over 30 years before enactment of AEDPA,


the -- this established definition of finality, and


there's -- there's no reason why Congress would have


departed from that here.


If there are no further questions, we would


submit.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Roberts.


Mr. de Bruin, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. DE BRUIN,


AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW


MR. DE BRUIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


There are four points that are dispositive of


this case.  First, the most natural and logical inference


is that the textual language in section 2255 cannot mean 

exactly the same thing as the very different textual


language enacted at the same time in the same statute in


section 2244.  Second, the text of each provision has an


ordinary and accepted meaning that is not, in fact, the


same.  Third, there are at least three reasons why


Congress logically used a different trigger for the


limitation periods in section 2244 and 2255, and fourth,


no harmful or absurd consequences flow from a


determination that Congress did not intend these very


different provisions with their very different texts to

mean precisely the same thing, as the parties here


contend, and for these reasons, I submit the judgment of


the court of appeals in this case is correct, and it


should be affirmed.


The Russello presumption in this case is


particularly strong.  Congress, in fact, used three


different formulations in AEDPA in identifying triggers


for time limitations under the statute, 2244, 2255, as


we've talked about, and also 2263.  In each of those


formulations, enacted in the same statute at the same


time, Congress explicitly chose different words to


describe what the triggering event was and what the


consequences of subsequent events were.


QUESTION:  Let's -- let's review the Russello


presumption. 


Russello had an earlier section where the 

more general word was limited.  What -- what was the --


what was the -- the -- what was the general word involved


in that case?


MR. DE BRUIN:  I believe -- I have the exact


language, that in Russello, the -- the general was any


interest acquired.


QUESTION:  Any -- any interest acquired.  That's


what the later provision said, and the earlier provision


said, any interest in the enterprise acquired.


MR. DE BRUIN:  Correct, any interest in any

enterprise which the defendant has established.


QUESTION:  Okay, and -- and what Russello said


is, where you have a limitation in the earlier one, an


interest in any enterprise, and then the later one just


says, any interest, we assume that any interest is


broader.  It's not limited by, in any enterprise.


Now, if you apply -- and I think that's entirely


reasonable, but if you apply that same principle here,


what it comes to is that where in the early one it says


final by reason of (a) and (b), and in the later one, it


just says, becomes final, you would think the later one


would -- would include (a), (b), and maybe (c), (d), (e),


but it certainly wouldn't be narrower than the earlier


one, which is what you're insisting it is.


In other words, it seems to me Russello cuts 

exactly against your position, rather than for it.


MR. DE BRUIN:  Well, I think the -- the meaning


of becomes final in 2255 is, in a sense, broader, in that


there are different conditions that can trigger when a


judgment becomes final.  The -- the normal rule is that


judgments of courts become final when the court acts, not


upon the expiration of review.  That finality, however,


may be disrupted, or arrested by subsequent filings.


QUESTION:  But aren't you picking one of the two


means of finality that's set forth in the earlier

provision?  You're saying in the later provision it only


means one of those two.  That's not Russello at all. 


That's the opposite of Russello.


MR. DE BRUIN:  No --


QUESTION:  I -- I think what you'd have to say


is, it means those two perhaps plus some others.


MR. DE BRUIN:  No, for two reasons.  One,


Congress logically can include the first phrase, the


conclusion of direct review, as a means of clarifying and


contrasting its inclusion of the second or the expiration


of the time for seeking such review.


That is the unusual clause.  Typically,


judgments become final when the court acts.  They're not


dependent upon the expiration of the time for review for


finality to attach.


QUESTION:  Or on the issuance of a mandate.


MR. DE BRUIN:  But that is an action of the


court, Justice Ginsburg.  In other words, the point is,


and the parties agree that the word final does have


different meanings in different contexts.


QUESTION:  It surely does.


MR. DE BRUIN:  And -- and I don't dispute that,


but in this case, I think you have to look at final, and


it is guided by two things.  The meaning of final in 2255


is informed by the language in 2244, where Congress


26

provided a very specific definition there that it did not


employ in 2255.


QUESTION:  You seem to take only one part of the


definition, because 2244 says, on direct review, or the


expiration, but you seem to accept that 2255 does


encompass direct review.  That is, if someone actually


files a petition for cert, then the finality rule would


not kick in.


MR. DE BRUIN:  Justice Ginsburg, that is not


actually clear.  It is not clear that Congress in 2255


intended either formulation to be the defining point in


all cases.  Under Rule 33, there was very similar language


that triggered a time bar to -- to when the judgment


became final and, as interpreted by the courts there,


finality was not always coextensive with the conclusion of 

direct review.


The rule there, universally established, was


that if a court of appeals issued its mandate and a stay


of the mandate was not obtained, the 2-year clock under


Rule 33 began to run from the date of the mandate whether


or not the defendant, not having obtained a stay,


petitioned this Court for certiorari.  So although the


question is not presented in this case, it is not


automatically clear that Congress in 2255 meant either of


the triggers that appear in 2244, but, as this Court

recognized in Russello, these provisions do not need to be


mutually coextensive.  One can be a subset of the other.


In this instance, Congress could include the


words, the conclusion of direct review, simply to provide


clarity that it also wanted to include the unusual event,


which was the expiration of the time for seeking such


review.


QUESTION:  You would also -- what -- they --


they also -- the Government gave meaning to the -- gave


meaning to the difference by saying, even if you're right


about that, becomes final, becomes final includes


expiration of time.  That's their argument.


And as to the first thing, by direct review,


that includes expiration of time, too.  They just put it


in to make sure it was not the habeas route in the States, 

and then they put the second clause in really to save


Federal judges from being confused about what happens in


the California Court of Appeals, what happens in the lower


inter -- intermediate State courts to make sure that --


that this ordinary Federal situation was seen as applying


to cases as they wend their way up through the State court


system, too.


MR. DE BRUIN:  What is --


QUESTION:  I think that's -- that was -- I heard


that being given, in any case.  Are you following?  Was I

clear enough?


MR. DE BRUIN:  Yes, I believe.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. DE BRUIN:  But what is significant, Justice


Breyer, is that that argument essentially undercuts their


argument that Congress, in enacting 2255, was using an


established meaning of final, coming from this Court's


precedents in their retroactivity cases.


If Congress believed that the word final, as


used in 2255, standing alone, without clarification,


automatically conveyed the definition this Court has used


in the retroactivity cases, that definition, as this Court


knows, applies equally to State convictions as well as to


Federal convictions.  In fact, that rule in Linkletter was


originally developed in the context of review of a State 

conviction.  In Griffith, the Court applied that same


concept of finality both to a State conviction and to a


Federal conviction, so if Congress thought by using just


the word final, we mean, in essence, the retroactivity


definition --


QUESTION:  If you -- if you --


MR. DE BRUIN:  -- that would have applied to


both.


But conversely, if Congress was aware that that


word, final, might mean something different, then the

obvious differences in wording here make a meaningful


difference.  2244 means what Congress specified.


The point is, there is no greater reason to


believe that the Court's definition in the retroactivity


cases applies in 2255 but not 2244.


QUESTION:  Right.  If -- if, in fact, you could


read it, as Justice Scalia suggested, which I think maybe


you could, or as the way the SG suggested for the sake of


argument, is there any argument that you shouldn't? 


I mean, it sounds simple, clear, uniform; everybody'd


understand it.  Is there any reason not to read it that


way if the language permits it?


MR. DE BRUIN:  I think what you have done is,


you've rendered the words of section 2244, as Justice


Ginsburg pointed out, wholly superfluous. 

QUESTION:  All right, but then you're answering


my question, no.  You're saying, there is no reason not to


read it that way if you could, with the language, but the


language doesn't permit it.


MR. DE BRUIN:  I --


QUESTION:  That's your argument.


MR. DE BRUIN:  I believe that's correct.  I


believe --


QUESTION:  And I take it as a no, that if it did


permit it, there isn't any good reason.

 MR. DE BRUIN:  I think Congress certainly could


have enacted a statute that had the same trigger.  I think


there also are significant reasons why it made sense for


Congress not to use the same trigger.  There are --


QUESTION:  It wouldn't render that language


superfluous if you interpreted it the way I suggested,


which is that -- that finality in the second provision


includes not just the two specifications in the first, but


also some other unnamed aspects of finality, which we


don't have to decide upon in this case, but which doesn't


help your case.


QUESTION:  Well, I mean --


MR. DE BRUIN:  Justice Scalia, what --


QUESTION:  Go ahead.


MR. DE BRUIN: 


What I think defeats that is that 

there isn't anything else.  There isn't a broader universe


that --


QUESTION:  If -- if you're -- if you're going to


say that 2255, by contrast with 2244(d)(1) must mean


something broader, then -- though, the broader you define


finality, the more difficult it is for a petitioner to


make his case, it seems to me -- a habeas petitioner.  If


there are any number of different ways that a judgment can


become final, that -- that is bad for the person seeking


habeas relief.

 MR. DE BRUIN:  I think that's right.  As,


Mr. Chief Justice, you recognized, the habeas -- there --


there's an interest in setting the date and in a non-


capital case, as these cases will be, where certiorari has


not been sought, if claims are to be brought, have the


statute begin, the claims be filed, if relief is


appropriate, relief be granted; but what I think is


significant, Justice Scalia, is that there is no broader


meaning of final that anyone has ever articulated.


The -- the broadest definition that has been


identified is that which is set forth in 2244, the


conclusion of direct review, or, what is not normally


included for finality, the expiration of the time for


seeking the conclusion of direct review, as opposed --


QUESTION: 


But that makes sense --

QUESTION:  I suppose you could answer Justice


Scalia by saying that these are exceptions to the ordinary 


rule of finality, although the statute doesn't quite read


that way.  They're -- they -- or they are special


extensions --


MR. DE BRUIN:  They --


QUESTION:  -- of the ordinary rule of finality.


MR. DE BRUIN:  I -- I -- they're extensions, is


exactly right, but I think it is clear that finality


normally occurs when a court acts.  Here, when the court

of appeals issued its mandate, nothing else happened in


the case.  Mr. Clay did not --


QUESTION:  Mr. de Bruin, I'd like to take you


back to that word, mandate, because finality means


different things in different contexts.  The most basic


finality rule is when the district court disassociates


itself from the case, and then the case is lodged on


appeal.  It's final for, say, preclusion purposes at that


point.


This Court dates from, not from the mandate in


the court of appeals, but take, for example, our rule on


cert.  Doesn't it run from the entry of judgment in the


court of appeals, not from the later time when a mandate


is issued?


MR. DE BRUIN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  So where do you make up the mandate


rule as a general rule?


MR. DE BRUIN:  Well, two points.  One, I believe


2244 makes clear that whatever 2255 means, it can't mean


exactly the same thing as 2244, because Congress didn't


use those words.  That still leaves the question, well,


what, then, does becomes final mean in 2255?  Does it mean


when the court of appeals issues its judgment?  Does it


mean when it issues its mandate?  Those questions still

 QUESTION:  Am I right that our rules don't refer


to the mandate date at all, that it's always the entry of


judgment?


MR. DE BRUIN:  That is correct.  The 90-day


clock runs from the -- from the entry of judgment, not the


mandate, but in deciding that question, what did Congress


mean by final, assuming it's not what it said in 2244. 


Because it didn't say that here, the Court has to decide,


is it the judgment, is it the mandate, and there is, in


fact, a developed body of law under, I submit, a very


analogous situation.  Under Rule 33, the defendant had


2 years from final judgment to bring a claim, and the


courts had interpreted finality in that context to mean


when the court of appeals issued its mandate.


QUESTION: 


I think your case would be persuasive 

if, indeed, there was a generally understood meaning of


finality, and -- and that's the part of your brief I


focused on, and I just don't think you carry the day. 


I just think, as Justice Ginsburg points out, it means a


lot of different things.  So once that's the case, all you


have to rely upon is this principle that -- that where --


where a thing is said two different ways in a statute,


there must be a reason.  You have to give them different


meaning.  That isn't an absolute principle, and it -- it


has all sorts of exceptions.  I mean, it -- it just

depends.


For example, if you say, from the day of entry


of judgment in one section of the statute, and in another


section of the statute it reads, from the day judgment was


entered, do you really think you have to give different


meaning to those two formulations?  Of course not.  It all


depends on what -- what the other factors involved are,


and here --


MR. DE BRUIN:  I think --


QUESTION:  -- I don't see any other factor,


unless you show that finality has a normal meaning,


which -- so that the earlier provision is giving it some


peculiar meaning.  That -- that would be persuasive --


MR. DE BRUIN:  I agree with you --


QUESTION: 


-- but -- but I don't think you carry 

the day on that point.


MR. DE BRUIN:  I agree with you that Russello


sets a presumption, it's not an automatic rule, but what


is significant in this case is not just that there's a


formulation that appears essentially the same, but in


different words.  What you have is two provisions, 2244


and 2255, that are markedly parallel.  You cannot read


them, going along almost word-for-word, and then you get


to this difference -- which is not a minor difference, but


there's an entire qualifying clause added -- and not be

struck: "Congress must have meant something different or


they would not have diverged so significantly."


QUESTION:  But you admit that for one part of


that clause, Congress didn't mean any different.  The --


if there is a petition filed, if there is, in fact, a cert


petition filed, then State and Federal prisoners got


treated alike, so it's the -- the only place, as I


understand it, where you're saying there's a difference is


whether the time for filing a petition counts even when


the -- there -- no petition is filed.


MR. DE BRUIN:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I don't


concede that.  I don't concede that it is true that if a


petition is filed, that the clock is automatically


arrested so that automatically the conclusion of direct


review isn't counted. 


That's not really presented here 

because there was no petition, it may be Congress did not


mean for either of those clauses to be in all cases the


determinative fact under 2255.


QUESTION:  So under your reading, it might be


that the judgment becomes final, the court of appeals


judgment becomes final when the mandate comes down, even


though the petitioner has filed a cert petition.  It could


mean that.


MR. DE BRUIN:  It could mean that, and that was,


in fact, the established rule under Rule 33, which is a

very similar time mechanism, and I submit the most


appropriate context is, look at other congressional


enactments imposing time limits on the bringing of claims


after judgment, and the rule under Rule 33 was cert was


irrelevant unless a stay of the mandate was obtained under


Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41; and, of course,


under 41(c) you can obtain a stay of the mandate if a


substantial question exists for the presentation of a


petition for certiorari.


QUESTION:  Am I wrong in thinking that the


general understanding is that when you file a cert


petition, that the finality is suspended until that


petition is disposed of?


MR. DE BRUIN:  I don't believe that is a general


rule. 


The most analogous rule, as it existed both under 

the Speedy Trial Act and under Rule 33, was that simply


petitioning this Court for certiorari did not


automatically arrest the finality of a judgment for either


of those two statutes:  only if you got a stay of the


mandate.  That's the whole purpose under Rule 41(c) for


providing for a stay of the mandate; and, of course, it's


that rule that the simple filing of a petition, that's


what may engender meritorious petitions, which the


Government contends is a reason not to interpret 2255 the


way the court of appeals did below.

 It makes sense, I submit, not to have a rule


that the automatic filing arrests the finality of the


judgment, and that was, in fact, the rule under Rule 33,


and that's the way the Speedy Trial Act has been


interpreted, and other statutes of limitations, that the


filing for cert does not automatically trigger the -- or


disrupt the statute.


QUESTION:  Mr. de Bruin, I think I understand


your argument based on the different wording, but --


I think this question was asked before, too:  is there any


reason why Congress might want to give Federal


post-conviction petitioners less time than State


post-conviction petitioners?


MR. DE BRUIN:  Yes, but first I must correct


you. 


Under this overall statutory scheme, I submit 

Federal prisoners have more time, not less, and the reason


for that, it is wrong for the parties to argue, as they


do, that this construction of 2255 is necessary to ensure


parity.  There is no parity.


As the Court knows from its decision in Duncan


versus Walker, and just last term in Carey versus Saffold,


the 1-year statute under 2244 applies to the preparation


of two different things.  It applies to the preparation of


your State collateral petition, and then once that is


filed, but only after it's filed, there is tolling, as was

at issue in Duncan versus Walker and Carey versus Saffold;


and then after the State petition is resolved, but not


including certiorari, that's very clear, then you've got


to file your Federal 2254 petition.  So a State inmate has


one year to do both, prepare his State collateral claim,


assuming total exhaustion under Rose versus Lundy, and


then, after the State collateral petition is resolved, the


Federal collateral petition.


The Federal inmate, by contrast, has a full year


simply to bring his 2255 motion.  So it is not true that


only by forcing this different language in 2244 and 2255


to mean the same thing, will you achieve parity.  There


isn't parity.  Federal inmates have more time.  But there


are, in any event, reasons for that difference. 


Again, claims coming from State court by 

definition must be exhausted, previously litigated claims. 


By definition, 2255 claims cannot be the same claims that


were litigated on direct review.  I submit it makes


logical sense for Congress to allow the State claim,


previously litigated in State court, to run its full


course at least through cert on direct review before


starting the statute.


If this -- and I submit Teague here really


provides a reason.  Since this Court has recognized that


if it were to issue a new rule of constitutional procedure

before the time expired to file for cert, and if one of


the petitioner's State claims was litigated on direct


review, it is less an affront to the State system for this


Court to simply grant, vacate, and remand than for a lower


Federal court to take up that claim on habeas.  So


Congress logically could have said that the time to begin


the statute will not run until the expiration of time for


the conclusion of direct review.  There are reasons such


as that that could provide an explanation for why Congress


did what it did, which is to provide very different


triggers in these two statutes. 


Fourth, it's important that there are no harmful


consequences that follow from granting these two different


provisions, with their very different text, different


meanings. 


As I mentioned, Federal defendants will always 

have at least one full year from the issuance of the


mandate to bring their claim.  As this Court has


recognized, in a non-capital case, the defendant has no


interest in delaying the adjudication of any collateral


claims that may exist.  The construction of the court of


appeals in this case is clear and easy to administer.  The


Federal inmate has one year from the issuance of the


mandate if not --


QUESTION:  Well, it isn't clear on the point


that I asked you about, because I thought that the court

of appeals said yes, if you actually file your petition


for cert, then the time doesn't run until the petition is


disposed of.  I thought -- you -- you said that's


ambiguous,  but I don't think that that's what the court


of appeals said.


MR. DE BRUIN:  You are correct, Justice


Ginsburg.  The courts of appeals have held universally


that if you petition for cert, the 1-year period does not


begin to run until the petition is resolved, and that rule


is not presented here.  There is, in fact -- authority


goes both ways, that subsequent filings in a different


court at times do arrest the finality of a prior judgment,


and at times they do not.


My only point was, in looking at the language of


2244 and asking whether the language there, the conclusion 

of direct review defeats the Russello presumption, my


point simply is, it does not defeat it.  One


interpretation is that Congress didn't mean either to


apply here, and instead embraced a rule much like the


established practice under Rule 33, but even if -- the


Court does not need to accept that to affirm the court of


appeals here.


The rule logically could be that if the court of


appeals issues its mandate, the case is over in the court


of appeals.  Nothing else happens, no motion to stay, no

petition for cert.  The case is final.  That's -- that's


consistent with common understanding of the word.


QUESTION:  But in terms of confusing things, if


we were to take that view of it, it would, because


everybody assumes, well, you file your cert petition, then


it's on hold until --


MR. DE BRUIN:  No, but -- I'm sorry, but


continuing on my thought, if nothing happens, the case is


final when the court of appeals rules.  You have a year.


If, however, you petition for cert, then the


judgment, the finality of the judgment is arrested, and


the one year does not begin to run until the petition is


resolved.  That would be perfectly permissible.  In other


words -- and that is, in fact, the construction of the


Seventh Circuit, that --


QUESTION:  That's -- that's not quite tolling. 


If -- if you -- if you waited for, say, 40 days before you


filed, does the 40 days count again?  Do you tack, or do


you get a whole new period?


MR. DE BRUIN:  You would get a whole new period,


and that is consistent with --


QUESTION:  So -- so that's not quite like


tolling, I think. 


MR. DE BRUIN:  It's not tolling.  Now, Congress


has provided tolling under 2263.  It has provided tolling

under different aspects of the statute.  But no, this is


not tolling.  There -- there are established rules that a


judgment is final, but yet, if you file a motion for


reconsideration, for instance, the finality of the


judgment, even though it was final and the time bars were


running, finality is arrested; and then once the petition


for reconsideration is decided, you have a full period,


again, and so Justice Ginsburg, that would be a perfectly


permissible construction, and in fact, perhaps the most


logical construction, that if you petition for cert, the


finality of the judgment is arrested and you have a full


year.


The point is, finality will always be affected


by what the defendant does and does not do, and there will


always be a series of different rules, depending on 

whether a petition for cert was filed, whether an appeal


was filed, and there will be different rules from State as


well as Federal.


There's a whole series of different rules; but


the rule of the court of appeals in this case was, if


nothing happens after the court of appeals issues its


decision, the judgment is final within the meaning of


2255.  That's consistent with the fact that judgments


routinely are final without being dependent upon the


expiration of the time for review.

 The formulation in 2244 is, in fact, unusual. 


Congress provided for that in 2244, but did not provide


for that in 2255.


For all these reasons, I -- I urge the Court to


find that the decision of the court of appeals is correct,


the construction of the language affords the text its


natural meaning, does not work any harmful results, and


should be affirmed.


Thank you very much.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. de Bruin, and the


Court thanks you for your help to the Court with your

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 


If I could address first the question of whether or not


there is a background understanding of when a judgment of


conviction becomes final, because conceivably that would


give rise to the negative inference that Congress was


doing something special in 2244 that it didn't intend in


2255.


The amicus points the Court to the pre-amendment

Rule 33, and I think it's important to play out exactly


what finality means there, because in the pre-amendment


Rule 33, there wasn't agreement on whether or not finality


attaches upon the issuance of a mandate.


QUESTION:  Which set of Rule 33 are we talking


about?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Before the 1998 amendment,


Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  To what set, what --


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I apologize, to criminal


procedure.


QUESTION:  Criminal procedure.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I do apologize.


Under -- before it was amended, some courts said


it was the judgment. 


Some courts said it was the mandate. 

That's discussed in the advisory committee notes to the


amendment.


In addition, most things under Rule 33, those


other than newly discovered evidence, ran from the entry


of the judgment in the district court, and perhaps most


important of all, it's settled under Rule 33, and this is


the Cook case from the Ninth Circuit that's cited in the


amicus brief, that under Rule 33 if a cert petition was


filed, that didn't stop the time.


QUESTION:  Well, you say it's settled.  It's

settled in the Ninth Circuit?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, there were no


contrary cases, you're quite right.  This Court never


passed on it, and there's no contrary authority.


And so my point is this.  Even under Rule 33, it


could mean a lot of different things, and I do think it's


perfectly clear that among all the analogies, the closest


one is this Court's collateral review precedents.


I do want to pick up on Justice Breyer's and --


and the Chief Justice's question about, well, didn't they


explicate something in 2244 that they didn't in 2255, and


if I could give a contrary -- give a hypothetical where I


think that reasoning would apply, if 2255 said, when the


judgment of conviction becomes final by the expiration of


direct -- by the conclusion of direct review, it would be 

very difficult for a 2255 petitioner to say, "and that


includes the time for seeking cert," because then you


would have a real contrast with 2244.  You would have one


of the phrases in 55, but both in 44, and there you could


have a genuine inference.


Here we don't have anything, and my point is


that this silence is not pregnant.  You don't draw the


inference that Congress meant nothing at all, or that


Congress meant -- as Justice Scalia points out, an even


narrower universe.

 The final point I want to make is about --


QUESTION:  I thought his point was it was an


even broader universe.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, no, his --


the amicus's point would have to be that 2255 means some


subset, or some smaller interpretation, or some shorter


time.


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I thought you were talking


about Justice Scalia's --


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I apologize.  You're quite


right.  Justice Scalia's point is that look, if you use


the word by, it could either mean it's explicating things,


or more naturally it means, we've picked a subset, and so


you don't have the subset here.  That's Russello. 


Interest versus interest in an enterprise.  Interest in an


enterprise is a -- a smaller part of the bigger ball.


The final point is about policy reasons. 


There really is no reason Congress would have intended


this period of time, the time when you could have sought


cert but didn't, to be available to a State prisoner


versus a -- a Federal prisoner.  There's no explanation


given by amicus that makes any sense.  For example, GVRs


apply only when a cert petition is filed.


Thank you.
