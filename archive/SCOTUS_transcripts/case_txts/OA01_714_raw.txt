CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument now


in number 01-714, Utah vs. Donald L. Evans, Secretary of


Commerce.  Mr. Lee.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS R. LEE, ESQ.


ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS


MR. LEE:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it please


the Court:  for most of the history of the census of the


American population, that census has been conducted by


means of an actual count unaltered by any methods of


statistical estimation.  At the time of the first census


of 1790, James Madison noted that this was the way


required by the Constitution and ever since then, that


requirement has been implemented by Congress in the Census


Act.  The question presented in this case is whether the


Census Bureau acted unlawfully in departing from that


longstanding historical tradition by using the method of


estimation called hot-deck imputation in the 2000


apportionment count.  99.6 percent of the 2000


apportionment count was comprised of actual data compiled


by census enumerators in two phases.  First, a mailing


sent to all addresses on a master address file, and


second, as many as six follow-up visits.

 Imputation added an additional .4 percent to that


count, 1.2 million statistically generated persons were


added to the apportionment count by means of a statistical


estimate.  The basic essence of the estimate was to say


the 620,000 addresses that the Census Bureau was unable to


enumerate are assumed to have estimated to have the same


number of occupants as their next door neighbors. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Lee, I would like to ask you to


address early on whether this injury that Utah alleges to


have suffered is redressable in any fashion.  Things have


happened since the census was taken.  North Carolina


presumably has drawn districts and has gone quite far down


the road in reliance on the census.  The President has


turned over the numbers and so forth.  How can this be


redressed, do you think, now? 


MR. LEE:  I suppose, Justice O'Connor, that


there are two aspects of your question if I'm


understanding it.  One of them would be a redressability


standing question.  That's a question as the Solicitor


General notes that has already been decided by this Court


both in Franklin and in Montana with regard to --


QUESTION:  Well, there is jurisdiction,

but I don't know that we have really addressed the


redressability issue fully in prior cases.  When could


Utah have made its challenge? When is the earliest time


Utah could have challenged this imputation business? 


MR. LEE:  It would have been impossible, Justice


O'Connor, for Utah to have brought a challenge prior to


the census.  As North Carolina indicated --


QUESTION:  Well, why is that? I mean, you knew,


did you, that the Census Bureau planned to use it? 


MR. LEE:  Yes.  We certainly had constructive


knowledge. 


QUESTION:  But you wouldn't have had an injury. 


MR. LEE:  We wouldn't have had an injury, and in


fact as the Census Bureau itself indicates, there would


have been no way even to have anticipated that imputation


would have had this effect. 


QUESTION:  Well, you have no incentive to bring


a challenge until you know that you are losing a


congressional seat, I suppose. 


MR. LEE:  That's exactly right.  And that was


one of the problems.  It took us some time to get

the numbers from the Census Bureau, specific state by


state numbers, in order to be able to determine whether in


fact this was a method that impacted Utah, and as soon as


we got those numbers, we brought this suit within a few


days. 


QUESTION:  Well, was there a window of time


between completion of the census and the submission of the


numbers to the President where you could have sued? How


long was that period of time? 


MR. LEE:  That was, the time line is that the


Secretary must submit the numbers by the end of the


calendar year to the President, and then the President


must submit those numbers within seven days after the


first day of the Congress.  The problem, Justice Kennedy,


was that we didn't have those numbers at that time.  The


Census Bureau had not released again state by state


imputation numbers until well into March of 2001, and it


was within a few days after that that we brought this


suit. 


QUESTION:  Well, if you prevail, what's supposed


to happen? 


MR. LEE:  The remedy that we are asking for,


Justice Kennedy, is simply a declaration and an injunction


to the Secretary of Commerce directing the Secretary to


issue a new apportionment count free of

the statistical estimates that we believe are unlawful


under the Census Act and under the Census Clause of the


Constitution. 


QUESTION:  Well, what's supposed to happen under


the Act? I mean, I went back and read the Act last night. 


And that's geared to certain automatic apportionment, and


that in turn is geared to the delivery of the numbers by


the date specified.  So let's assume the Secretary and


then the President comes with different numbers.  The Act


doesn't have any provision in effect for self-adjustment,


does it? 


MR. LEE:  And I think, Justice Souter, that's


effectively North Carolina's argument.  That there are


time deadlines set forth in the Census Act that somehow


stand in the way of reviewability here.  That is an


argument that was raised and rejected in Franklin.  The


Franklin opinions, Justice O'Connor's opinion for a four


justice plurality on that point, says that if this Court


agrees with the Plaintiffs in this case, we may presume


that the President of the United States will conform to


our decision and will in fact issue a new apportionment


count that is consistent with the law as we clarify it. 


By the same token --


QUESTION:  I will presume that, too, but

that was four justices, and there wasn't a specific


discussion of what is supposed to happen under the


statute, even assuming the President sort of takes counsel


from our opinion. 


MR. LEE:  And the other opinion in that case,


Justice Souter, that also addresses this issue was Justice


Stevens' concurring opinion, for a separate four-justice


concurrence on this issue, and his analysis was in fact


that the statute would require the President to conform to


a revised count that the Secretary might present in


conformity to a decision of this Court. 


QUESTION:  Well, that's what he said and as you


know, I joined his opinion.  But that didn't have a


majority, either.  So isn't it incumbent upon you to tell


us whether in fact the position that some of us took that


first time is in fact correct? Why will they, I mean, it


seemed so to me at the time but it's a real issue in this


case, as to whether the statute which is geared to


delivery of information at certain times can in effect


reverse itself. 


MR. LEE:  The other point that Justice Stevens


made in his concurring opinion, Justice Souter, which I


think is critical on this issue, is that the time lines


under the statute can be

understood only to trigger, only with regard to the issue


of ripeness.  In other words, it makes no sense to think


that a time deadline for executive action under a statute


means that you, you must -- it makes no sense to think


that those deadlines are a bar to judicial review.  In


fact, what we usually think of when we look at a statute


that has deadlines is that once those deadlines have


passed, then executive action is at an end, there is a


ripe claim that may be brought and then it's appropriate


for the federal courts to step in. 


QUESTION:  But those are not cases where after,


after the deadline provisions, you have a, a basic change


in, in the court's role, that after the deadline in this


case, you are going to have to, the court is going to have


to issue an opinion that purports to bind the President. 


Which is, you know, a significant step. 


MR. LEE:  Yes.  I think that the opinion does


not need to purport to bind the President, and as the


Court indicated in Franklin, there is no need for the


order to go to that point. 


QUESTION:  Well, but I mean that's, that's even


worse.  You want us to decide something on the ground that


some good may come out of it.  But I just

don't know what your closest case is for the proposition


that this satisfies the redressability requirement. 


Let's assume that the President, were interested


in implementing our orders.  We send something to


Congress, and maybe that's the end of it there.  Can we


force the Congress to act? 


MR. LEE:  Well, the, the order would go to the


Secretary.  The Secretary would submit a new apportionment


count to the President that would be free of the


estimations and the question then is what would the


President do.  And the President under two alternative,


but not necessarily inconsistent theories, of eight


justices in the Franklin case would certainly conform and


would present those same numbers, that same revised


apportionment count. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Lee --


QUESTION:  Let me just -- what's your closest


case to show that a declaration of this kind satisfies the


requirement of redressability? 


MR. LEE:  Well, I believe it's Franklin, Justice


Kennedy. 


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  Other than Franklin. 


Because Franklin was a fractured opinion. 


MR. LEE:  Well, one understanding

consistent with Justice O'Connor's opinion in Franklin


would be that of a declaratory judgment.  It does not in


and of itself bind the parties.  It rather declares the


law.  It is not a, it is not a, a binding order in the


sense of ordering parties to do anything. 


QUESTION:  Well, it does bind the parties in a


certain extent.  It's just, there is no action required as


a result of it.  There is no mandate saying you must do


this. 


MR. LEE:  That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, and I


think that that's consistent again with Justice O'Connor's


plurality opinion in Franklin. 


QUESTION:  We have never held that a declaratory


judgment will issue where the Court has no power to compel


the action that the declaratory judgment describes.  I


mean, you cannot get jurisdiction by saying well, you


know, we have no power to, over this person to compel any


action, but we are just going to declare what the law is


because this person, you know, might follow it.  I don't


think that's a basis for jurisdiction. 


MR. LEE:  Well, Justice Scalia, but I think


there are two alternative theories.  One is Justice


O'Connor's approach and the other is Justice

Stevens' approach in Franklin, and Justice Stevens'


approach in Franklin in fact, is in fact that the


President is required to conform with revised numbers. 


But the Secretary might represent --


QUESTION:  But you are actually taking a


position also that whether or not the President would


respond, at least the Secretary would have a duty to do


something in response to our order. 


MR. LEE:  That's exactly right. 


QUESTION:  Is it quite common that in suits the


President is not named, and the Secretary is.  But I


wanted to go back to a question -- the President has


acted, but Congress has not.  Am I correct? Congress is


waiting on what this court does? 


MR. LEE:  The final step, Justice Ginsburg, in


this process, is for the clerk of the House of


Representatives to forward to the states a certificate


that shows how many seats in the House of Representatives


they are entitled to after clerk receives the revised


numbers from the President.  And this Court in Franklin


indicated clearly that that duty is a ministerial duty and


that we can absolutely expect that the clerk of the House


will follow suit.  So the only question is with regard to


the President,

and either under Justice O'Connor's approach or under


Justice Stevens' approach in the Franklin opinions, we can


and should expect that the President will in fact conform


to this Court's order. 


QUESTION:  You only have a certain amount of


time, Mr. Lee.  I want to ask you a question about the


merits of the case.  Are you saying in effect that there


has to be a specific, something more than just a little


bit of educated guesswork with respect to every house in


the country? 


MR. LEE:  Well, the actual enumeration clause of


the Constitution would require an actual count, and --


QUESTION:  Okay.  But what, supposing that the


census people have, they see a house, and they see a car


in the driveway, but they can never find anybody home, and


then someone sees lights on late at night.  They do their


best.  Do they have to say nobody lives there? 


MR. LEE:  Yes, they do, Mr. Chief Justice, and


one of the reasons is that the mere fact that there are


lights on and cars there doesn't tell us that this is


anyone's usual place of residence.  It may be a seasonal


vacation home. 


QUESTION:  It doesn't confirm it, but

isn't it a permissible inference for the census takers? 


MR. LEE:  Well, at some point a census taker may


make a conclusion, if it's based on information specific


to an individual household, may make a conclusion that a


household is in fact occupied.  Our position is that what


the Census Act requires, Section 195, is -- what the


Census Act prohibits, rather, is the use of information


specific not to that individual household but specific to


an entirely different household for the purpose of drawing


an inference. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  Would you, on that theory,


would you agree that although they may not impute a number


beyond one, it would be fair for them at least to count it


as one? Because they start out as I understand it with a,


in effect a report from the post office saying, you know,


this is a house at which somebody lives.  So isn't that


kind of hearsay just as good as, let's say, the next door


neighbor's hearsay at least to the extent of saying


somebody lives there and they can count one person?


MR. LEE:  Justice Souter, they don't start out


with the proposition that this is a house and somebody


lives there.  They start out with the

proposition that this is an address. 


QUESTION:  Well, doesn't an address usually mean


somebody lives there, at least if we can establish that


it's a residential neighborhood? 


MR. LEE:  Not necessarily, for a number of


reasons.  Number one, you have got the seasonal home


problem.  It may be no one's personal, no one's usual


place of residence. 


Number two, you have got the problem that some


things that look like homes and that are in residential


areas actually turn out to be businesses. 


QUESTION:  What percentage of homes in the


United States when they take the census turn out to be


vacation or second homes? 


MR. LEE:  I don't have that number handy off the


top of my head, Justice O'Connor.  I believe that it is in


the record, but I'm not aware of that.  The total number


of imputations was with regard to 620,000 unrelated --


QUESTION:  But the imputation techniques


apparently treat all the dwellings that are identified as


residences to be counted? They don't discount for a


percentage that are vacation homes? 


MR. LEE:  No.  They do not.  And that's part of


the problem.  Part of the problem here is

that imputation assigns occupancy not only to units,


Justice Souter, that are known to be houses. 


QUESTION:  That's saying that they are doing it


bad.  We have to assume they are doing it good.  I mean,


suppose they have learned with experience that an old age


home that has two bedrooms in each apartment and that has


a sign out in front that says "full," has two people.  One


in each bedroom.  And now they learn something about this


house.  It's an old age home.  It has two bedrooms.  And


the sign in front says full. 


Now, can they make the assumption that this too


has two people in it? 


MR. LEE:  I think not. 


QUESTION:  Not.  Now, why not? Can they make an


assumption that if the pizza man delivers pizza to the


place and people eat the pizza, i.e., at least it


disappears, that there is someone in the house? Can they


make that assumption? 


MR. LEE:  They cannot, Justice Breyer. 


QUESTION:  They cannot make the assumption about


the pizza man.  They deliver it to the door and the food


disappears and the lights are on and off.  They can't make


that assumption? 


MR. LEE:  No.  People in businesses eat

pizza and people who are living, staying temporarily in a


vacation home eat pizza. 


QUESTION:  And by the way, there is a sign in


front that says this is not a vacation home. 


(Laughter.)


MR. LEE:  Then I suppose -- I suppose under


those circumstances, then we'd have information.  But --


QUESTION:  Fine.  Once you are down, once you


are down that road, then you are then -- then I can easily


construct examples where the imputation is absolutely as


strong.  I mean, I just did that with my old age home.  So


you are not against imputations, you are against weak


imputations. 


MR. LEE:  No.  I'm against sampling because


that's what the statute prohibits. 


QUESTION:  You have to take that position. 


MR. LEE:  I think it's important, though, to


answer your question, Justice Breyer, to go back to the


baseline of the House of Representatives decision.  It


holds that a method proposed by the Census Bureau in 1997


is a method of sampling.  We know that much, and so there


is really a narrow statutory question presented here and


it is, is this particular method meaningfully different?

answer is that it is not. 


It is not under the statistical understanding of


the term sampling.  It also is not because the definition


that the appellees are proposing here is a definition that


would nullify this Court's decision in the House of


Representatives because the two methods simply are not


distinguishable.  Let me talk about the appelees'


definitions and explain why that's true. 


The definitions that they propose say that


sampling is limited to methods that are employed as a last


resort, only after an initial effort to enumerate the


whole population.  Under that definition, in fact, both,


neither one of the methods that's at issue here would


follow sampling, and so that effectively is an argument


that the Court got it wrong in House of Representatives


and that that case ought to effectively be nullified.  And


here's why. 


QUESTION:  Are you suggesting, Mr. Lee, that the


Census Bureau goes about this thing in a way, say,


supposing you have a lake in northern Wisconsin where the


temperatures get down to about 40 below in the winter.  So


you know it's not a year-round, you see a bunch of houses


around the lake.  The census people come along and do you


think

if they could find somebody there, they would just


automatically say yes, that person counts? Without


inquiring as to whether it's a vacation home or not? 


MR. LEE:  Well, if they know that there is


somebody who is living there, they have to find out


whether the somebody who is living there lives there as


his usual place of residence, or that person doesn't count


in the apportionment count. But what's going on --


QUESTION:  But under the imputation method as I


understand it, the assumption is made that if a house is


there, that it is a residence, and a second assumption is


made that the number of occupants will be that in a


general geographic area of other homes.  Is that right? 


MR. LEE:  That's right.  And that's exactly the


sense in which this particular method of imputation is a


method of sampling.  The Census Bureau took a sample of


620,000 addresses.  They called them donor housing units


in the 2000 census.  It used that sample of 620,000


addresses or housing units as a representative sample of


the 620,000 addresses that they never were able to count


on the theory that they were representative, knowing that


next door neighbors are not always the same, but that

generally across the board, if you take the 620,000 sample


or donor units and use them to estimate the 620,000


addresses about which we know nothing, generally across


the board it will average out and it will be


representative.  And that's sampling.  Sampling is taking


information about the parts to make an inference about the


whole. 


QUESTION:  I'm curious both in your argument


here this morning and in the brief, I think both parties


seem to assume that the key question is whether or not


this is sampling.  Do you take the position that other


statistical methods of adjustment are permitted just so


long as they are not called sampling? 


MR. LEE:  Our position is, Justice Kennedy, that


any method that takes information from a part of the


population to make an inference about the whole is a


method of sampling and is prohibited.  Now, there are


methods, statistical methods that the Bureau uses that


don't amount to sampling that are permitted.  Let me give


you one example. 


QUESTION:  Go ahead. 


MR. LEE:  It's called the method of quality


assurance, and the quality assurance phase, what the


Bureau does is to randomly send out

enumerators to given census tracts to try to find the


tracts where there are a large number of errors, where the


enumerators may have made a lot of mistakes. 


But the response to that is to send out an


additional army of enumerators to those problematic tracts


to sort out the problem to get the new information.  Now,


that's an actual count.  That's not sampling but it's a


statistical method.  And so that's an example. 


QUESTION:  What about a house where they have


not been able to find anybody to talk to, no returns sent


back, so they go to the people next door and they say is


there anybody living in that house and the person next


door says yes, there are two people.  Now, is that


permissible under your theory? 


MR. LEE:  That is permissible under our theory. 


That's the use of proxy data that the Bureau currently


engages in and Mr. Chief Justice, that would be


permissible. 


QUESTION:  But the Act refers both to sampling


and to other methods of statistical adjustment.  It seems


to me sampling is a way to gather the data, and what we


are talking about here are statistical assumptions made to


evaluate the

data, and I'm not sure why you have to concede that you


lose if we say this isn't sampling. 


MR. LEE:  Well, there may be another way to get


there, Justice Kennedy, but my understanding under the


statute is that Section 195 prohibits the statistical


method known as sampling.  That may suggest that there are


other statistical methods that are not, that don't amount


to sampling, and the quality assurance example that I gave


I think is one of those examples that would be permitted


under the statute. 


But all methods that take information from a


part, from these 620,000 addresses that are occupied, to


make an inference about the rest of the population, the


620,000 addresses that we don't know anything about, those


are methods of sampling and again you really cannot


distinguish this method in any meaningful way from the


method that was struck down in 1997.  The principal


difference is that instead of 620,000 addresses about


which we know nothing, under the 1997 plan, the Bureau


anticipated that there may be many more. 


QUESTION:  Yes.  But there is one significant


difference and that is in the technique that was struck


down before, a number of inferences

are being drawn from the so-called sample.  In this case,


only one inference is being drawn from a sample of one,


and that is at least a tremendous difference in degree,


and I suppose it's a difference in degree that would be


likely to have an effect on accuracy. 


MR. LEE:  In fact, Justice Souter, that is not a


distinction.  The fact that there is an imputation being


made one individual housing unit at a time, again, does


not distinguish this method from the method struck down in


the House of Representatives case. 


QUESTION:  Well, it wouldn't in a literal sense


if you were simply making one imputation at a time, but


you were making a long series of imputations from the one


sample, in this case, the one house.  But this is simply


one imputation made one time, and it involves not so much


a, a principle of selection, or let's put it this way. 


You can characterize it not only as based on a principle


of selection, but you can, you can characterize it on, on


a rule of probability, like birds of a feather flock


together.  People who live next door tend to be much


alike. 


So it seems to me that there is a qualitative


difference and a quantitative difference.

 MR. LEE:  But Justice Souter, once you pool all of


the individual housing units together, the 627 -- 620,000,


rather, of these housing units that were used to estimate


the 620,000 addresses that we know nothing about after six


follow-up visits, that's your sample.  That's your group. 


QUESTION:  No.  Your sample isn't 620 to tell


you about just any random 620.  It's, it's a selection of


one to tell you about one more which is right next to it. 


So it seems to me that it sort of masks the issue to talk


about 620 and 620 as opposed to one and one. 


MR. LEE:  Mathematically it seems to me, though,


Justice Souter, we get to the same end.  This is an


intermediate step, even though it happens on a household


by household basis.  It's an intermediate step for the


clear purpose of making an ultimate inference about the


population as a whole.  If, for example, there are three


-- 

QUESTION:  Yes, but that, I mean that would be


true about any inferential conclusion.  I mean, strictly


it would be true I suppose even if accepting the hearsay


conclusion is true.  And there is an awful lot of


inference that does not fall within anyone's notion of


what is a sample or what is

in a technical sense a statistical method. 


MR. LEE:  It is also true, however, Justice


Souter, of the method struck down by this Court in the


House of Representatives case.  And I probably didn't make


this clear enough the first time I mentioned it so let me


just make it one more quick time. 


Under the 1997 plan, it's clear that the Census


Bureau proposed to estimate the roughly 10 percent of the


population that it was not going to enumerate one


individual housing unit at a time.  As is indicated in the


administrative record in this case at page 1647, it was


precisely the nearest neighbor assumption that the Bureau


had in mind under the 1997 plan.  So that truly is not a


distinction between this particular method and the method


at issue in the House of Representatives case, and thus


the argument that's being proposed here really is an


argument that would effect an end run around the House of


Representatives decision. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Lee, as I understand it, the


imputation method that was actually used after the 2000


census has the effect of counting non-households as


households in some instances? 


MR. LEE:  That's correct, Justice

O'Connor. 


QUESTION:  And it counts one household several


times in some instances. 


MR. LEE:  That's correct, because some of these


are different --


QUESTION:  And, all right.  And the imputation


is not based on the nearest neighbor.  I mean, there is a


big block of homes, and the assumption about who lives on


it is not based on a nearest neighbor. 


MR. LEE:  Ordinarily, as I understand it, it is


the nearest neighbor address that's used to estimate or


impute the address about which we know nothing. 


QUESTION:  That's not my understanding, but we


can explore that with the other side.  But I was concerned


because it seems to be a method that does amount to what


we said couldn't be done, in House of Representatives, on


a much smaller scale. 


MR. LEE:  That's exactly right and of course the


scale of the practice is beside the point. 


QUESTION:  Well, they say it isn't beside the


point.  I take it that their argument is basically in


House of Representatives, what the census was trying to do


was to use a special kind of

inferential method to determine the population of an


entire area. 


Well, here they are using an inferential method


to determine the population of an individual house.  Now,


if you don't make that distinction, and you say that


distinction is irrelevant, we are left with your


distinction which seems as Justice Souter just pointed out


to be the same as all inference.  In other words, I infer


that when you deliver pizza and it disappears, someone is


in the house, because of the set of similar to pizza type


cases that I have seen in the past.  Or, you know, that's


I think what Justice Souter was bringing out, they have a


different distinction.  Now how do I deal with the


problem? 


MR. LEE:  Well, Justice Breyer, let me mention


two reasons why that distinction doesn't get them


anywhere.  It doesn't get them anywhere number one because


it simply isn't borne out in the statistical understanding


of methods of sampling, in two senses. 


Number one, the statistical understanding of


sampling says generally, what statisticians understand to


be encompassed within the general category of sampling is


taking information from a

part to make a statistical definition. 


QUESTION:  You have the statistical definition,


but my question was directed at a particular problem that,


if I take your approach I can't get myself out of.  That


is, that your definition applies to all inference.  Their


definition distinguishes among kinds of inference and they


have their statistical support. 


MR. LEE:  The problem with the distinction is,


another problem with the distinction is that it's clear


that it would permit the Census Bureau to replicate the


1997 plan.  If you buy that distinction, the Bureau can


get back exactly to where it wanted to go in 1997 merely


by scaling back its nonresponse follow-up efforts. 


QUESTION:  I don't understand the pizza man. 


Does the pizza man, does that inference consist of


imputing something from the part to the whole? I mean, I


would think that's your answer to the pizza man example. 


It is an inference. 


QUESTION:  No, no.  It goes from the whole to


the parts. 


QUESTION:  But it's not the same kind of


inference that is done by what you say is sampling,


mainly, imputing information that belongs to a part

to the whole.  That's not what's going on in the pizza man


case. 


MR. LEE:  Maybe, Justice Scalia and Justice


Breyer, maybe I missed the pizza man example, but that may


well, that may well be a distinction. 


QUESTION:  I didn't think the imputation


involved any actual things like looking at, when pizza was


delivered.  It involves looking at what houses returned,


take a big block in the district they are serving.  It


involves looking at the houses that returned the form,


looking at the houses where they reach people in a


follow-up visit, and there are some they may might still


be missing and so they impute the map. 


They don't go see if there is a car in the


garage or look at the pizza delivery.  They arbitrarily


say we are going to impute from the data we have that


there are X number of additional houses and that X number


of houses are occupied at a certain level of occupancy. 


That's what's going on. 


MR. LEE:  That's exactly right.  That's


precisely right, Justice O'Connor.  The pizza man knows


how many people live there.  He is a proxy and he can give


that information to a census enumerator.  But the end run


problem is illustrated by this

distinction; if the Census Bureau can use any methods that


fall within the definition that's now being proposed, the


Bureau can simply scale back slightly its nonresponse


follow-up effort and estimate increasing percentages of


the population, up to and even exceeding the 10 percent


that was proposed in 1997. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Lee, didn't it prove out that,


after, that in the majority of these cases, something like


75 percent, that they know for sure that these were houses


where people lived? 


MR. LEE:  Actually not, Justice Ginsburg.  The


75 percent figure is misleading and completely unhelpful. 


At page 445 of the joint appendix the memorandum that's at


issue there simply says that in 75 percent of the status


imputed cases, status imputation was done with regard to


enumerator returns or respondent returns.  In other words,


these were not mail-back returns. 


QUESTION:  But you don't have a negative


showing, either, that it wasn't accurate? And there was


something Justice O'Connor said, and I'm not sure whether


I fully understand it.  I thought that this imputation was


made for people who didn't respond to the mailing, that


the like comparison was with the

group of people that were eventually counted, but that


they were nonrespondents the first time around. 


MR. LEE:  That's right.  I think if understand


your question, Justice Ginsburg, I think that's right. 


They took information from initial nonresponding


households, used those as a sample of those who never


responded, and some of those may well not have been homes,


Justice O'Connor, some of those may well have been


duplicates, etc.  If there are no further questions, Mr.


Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my


time for rebuttal. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Lee.  Mr. Dellinger,


we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER E. DELLINGER


ON BEHALF OF THE NORTH CAROLINA APPELLEES.


MR. DELLINGER:  May it please the Court, because


North Carolina believes very strongly that the right time


to challenge the Census Bureau's planned use of a


statistical method is before rather than after the census


is completed, let me begin by --


QUESTION:  Well, how could the challenge have


been brought before Utah knew that the imputation figures


caused this problem?

House of Representatives, I think on page 332, you note


that citizens of Utah, you didn't specify the state, but


citizens who anticipate that the use of a method like


imputation, as suburbanites might, would dilute their in


intrastate districting representation, are specifically


said in House of Representatives to have authority to


bring that suit.  So I think that there would have been


parties able to litigate it.  In response --


QUESTION:  Well, you can't bring a suit before


you know about what's going on. 


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, you can, Mr. Chief Justice. 


It is true, as you noted, that there might not be a


special incentive on Utah's part, but they don't know they


are going to be the loser.  They might have come out


better or worse with or without imputation.  But every


governor, attorney general, states and cities are


carefully watching this.  Many as you know sued in 1997. 


So the suit could have been brought that, by any resident


of a suburb could have had an expert allege that they are


going to be diluted if you impute households because it's


rural areas where the files are often damaged or --


QUESTION:  But Mr. Dellinger, a state can't, you


suggest there are suburban people, city

people, a state can't, until it knows what the result is


going to be, and Congress used the words any aggrieved


person.  The state, you are saying is the state can never


bring such a suit, because it is not aggrieved before.  It


can't predict that it's going to be aggrieved.  It will


know only when the returns are in, so in effect, you are


saying this is not a question that the state has come too


late.  It's not sooner or later, it's a never question for


the state. You're saying Congress simply did not authorize


the states to bring this kind of case. 


MR. DELLINGER:  Justice Ginsburg, that is


correct, if a state is unable to show, does not have the


experts about a forthcoming census that is unable to


demonstrate that it will be aggrieved.  How much we should


worry about a nonaggrieved party not being able to obtain


judicial review is --


QUESTION:  They are aggrieved at the end of the


line. 


MR. DELLINGER:  They are now, but my point is


that if Utah had been watching this carefully, and as you


know, many states were involved in the '97 litigation as


amici and otherwise.  Surely the Governor could have found


many citizens of the State of Utah who, and this suit


itself includes individual

voters, some of whom may very well, the plaintiffs --


QUESTION:  The governor had no incentive to do


so. 


MR. DELLINGER:  I understand that. 


QUESTION:  He could have gotten a stalking horse


to, some suburbanite to bring the suit but he had no


notion that there was any reason to do that. 


MR. DELLINGER:  It seems to me that that is


exactly correct, but that it's exactly why any governor,


major city mayor or others, these citizens, those who


brought suit in 1997 and did not include this,


suburbanites are going to hurt, would want to sue, could


bring the suit, but in any event, they could also


participate in the Bureau's process.  Utah never made this


objection. 


Now, here's why that's so unfair.  It's simply


this.  The, it is, we don't know who would have gained


this seat if Utah had bought its objections to the Census


Bureau before the census was conducted. 


QUESTION:  Is there a statutory time period for


people to challenge the Census Bureau proposed techniques


before the census is taken? Is there some provision


whereby that challenge can be made?

 MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.  The public law which was the


basis for the suit in 1997 is a permanent law, and that


suit allows aggrieved parties to bring suit when the


census produces its plan.  So it's certainly at least --


QUESTION:  But is it a fact that somebody is


aggrieved when you are at the stage of the Census Bureau


just saying this is what I plan to do? 


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.  The law involved, the


public law, that was a basis of the '97 suit makes it


clear that if you could say if they do that plan, that's


exactly how it works in House of Representatives, if you


do that plan, we expect that our district will be diluted.


QUESTION:  Well, does the law provide for some


sort of administrative hearing before the Census Bureau,


some sort of an exhaustion requirement? I thought that's


what you were suggesting.  If Utah had just brought this


to the attention of the Census Bureau.  Is there some


structure for doing that? 


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.  The Census Bureau does


have a structure for doing this.  I'm not saying that they


are foreclosed because they didn't participate in the


administrative process, but the Bureau was open to hear


these objections and the

courts were open to hear them. 


QUESTION:  But, you say now the Bureau, is that


well publicized? Is there some person you can go to in the


Bureau and say I don't like what you are doing? 


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.  And that is the exact


process that is followed with every -- that's why they


publish the plan for the census.  Now, if --


QUESTION:  It seems unfair to Utah, though, to


say that they are supposed to bring a suit before they


know they have been hurt and why.  How -- what are they


supposed to do? Of course they wouldn't come in ahead of


time.  For all they know, the system would benefit them. 


MR. DELLINGER:  Justice Breyer, those who sued


in the House of Representatives litigation had a very thin


basis for knowing that they would be adversely affected. 


Indiana maybe wrong in thinking that --


QUESTION:  Well, of course, sometimes you could


guess in advance, but a lot of times you couldn't, and


it's important that there be a fair method that treats


states fairly.  So why, why would it be fair, any way, to


cut off those states that don't know they have been


treated unfairly and hurt,

until they find out later? 


MR. DELLINGER:  And here's why.  Here's why it's


not unfair.  Because the unfairness is so great for the


disruption on the other side. 


If it had been determined by the Bureau itself


or through litigation that imputation could not be used in


2000, the Census Bureau absolutely would have used some


means other than imputation to ascertain the enumeration


of those established residential addresses whose records


were damaged, missing or incomplete. 


There are in North Carolina approximately 16,000


households that are established residential addresses on


the carefully pruned master address list.  Those houses


often were visited by an enumerator in the, often the


houses were added where it was status imputation by a


field enumerator during the enumeration process.  But the


new form, because it wasn't on the master address list


before being added, never caught up with the master


address list.  So you have no residential addresses, and,


and the Bureau absolutely would have had another method. 


I mean, even now theoretically they could go


back and start again and say what are we going to do about


620,000 established residential addresses

for which we don't have input numbers, because at the end


of this massive process, now, this is a process that


involves 500,000 enumerators, 120 million households, one


and a half billion pieces of paper, imputation occurs at


the end of that process when all the records are


centralized.  It began in 1960, five censuses ago because


that's when computers were able to process these cards. 


Damaged cards, now forms, can't be read.  The


data is discrepant or missing.  It doesn't mean that these


are households that were visited six times. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Dellinger, you have recognized


that your argument is, as stated, that the position of


Utah that can't project what the returns will be, does not


have, does not qualify as an aggrieved person at the only


moment in time when it can say that it's aggrieved.  I


think you had another justiciability issue, did you not?


Because time is running and I think we grasp your position


that it's too bad they are not aggrieved because they have


to come in in the beginning and not at the end. 


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.  Justice Ginsburg, we are


not suggesting that these issues are immune from judicial


review.  I believe someone could challenge

imputation and would. 


QUESTION:  Are you sure they were not aggrieved


at the beginning? I'm surprised that you -- I mean, is it


not an aggrievement for the State of Utah or for any state


that its districts are distorted? Even if it doesn't lose,


you know, congressmen to another state, isn't the


distortation of the districts within that state a


grievance of that state? 


MR. DELLINGER:  That is a very helpful answer,


and that is not -- a very helpful suggestion.  And that


has not been by any means ruled out, nor has it been ruled


out in my view that a state could say we believe we are


entitled to have a fair process determine our


representation.  This process isn't fair.  We don't know


how it's going to come out.  But this process is loony. 


Now, you would also see there's just a matter on


the merits.  Congress has said in Title II, Section 2 that


the President's determination shall be final and the


states are entitled to that for the next period of time


until the next apportionment unless Congress itself acts,


which they specifically provide for.  That's surely


constitutional because the Constitution itself in


providing that the census

need be done only every 10 years puts a great stake in


permanency. 


Now, turning to the merits, it's striking the


extent to which the issues in this case are anticipated by


the Court's decision in the Wisconsin case.  At page 22 in


Wisconsin --


QUESTION:  Before you go on to the merits, you


have nothing else to say then about justiciability? I


mean, let's suppose they can file a suit.  What's the


remedy going to be at the end of the day at this stage? 


MR. DELLINGER:  Oh, at this stage? 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. DELLINGER:  Justice O'Connor, that is a very


good question.  Utah seems to assume that if the case went


back to the District Court, overturning the District


Court's ruling that imputation is satisfactory on the


statute and the Constitution, that you would simply take


out those occupancy figures for 620,000 households


nationwide. 


It seems to me that the, that what ought to be


done is you return that to the Bureau and say now there


may be time to match up the missing forms that were added


late in the enumeration process.  There may be other ways


to recover that data.  Ways

that certainly would have been done if it were brought


before the census might still be brought now.  So that we


don't, it seems utterly unfair to treat all of those as


zero when some of them are houses that, an enumerator


comes to 212 Elm Street, it's not on his list, he goes in,


interviews Ozzie, Harriet, the kids, sends in the form and


it was corrupted or it didn't get matched up at the time,


faced with that time deadline.  It may now be available. 


We don't know who would prevail on that. 


On the statutory issue I think if you look at


page 22, the Court itself creates statistical adjustments


as done in '70 and '80, and as they were done here --


QUESTION:  Page 22 of what?


MR. DELLINGER:  I'm sorry, Justice Rehnquist.  I


referred earlier to the decision of Wisconsin vs. the City


of New York, the unanimous opinion.  On the statutory


issue, the Court says that the statistical adjustments in


1970 and 1980 which were imputation, hot-deck imputation,


were an entirely different type than the adjustment


considered here, and they took place on a dramatically


smaller scale. 


The Court also treats actual enumeration

in the Wisconsin case and speaks of actual enumeration at


page 6 in the Wisconsin case as having been something that


the Bureau has never, or the country has never actually


achieved actual enumeration.  It's never been wholly


successful.  Treating it clearly as the end result of the


process, the right number and not as a method. 


Now, let me go right to one point.  We do not


believe that there are no constitutional limits on how


Congress can conduct the census.  Wisconsin says that


there is virtually unlimited deference to Congress, but


they also set a standard that the congressional goal must


be related to representation according to the respective


numbers. 


The way I read that is this.  A proposed census


as designed is not reasonably calculated to produce


distributive accuracy among the states is constitutionally


suspect, because it will not produce an apportionment


according to the respective numbers.  And that would be a


fatal flaw. 


Here, every imputed occupant and household is to


an established residential address with a precise


geographical location.  It was an effort to enumerate


every household in the country by using the best


information available on known household

addresses.  This is historically consistent with what we


did when the neighbors are asked for their opinion, the


postal worker is asked for his opinion.  You use proxy


information.  Here you take --


QUESTION:  Mr. Dellinger, this isn't really a


use of proxy information.  This isn't going to a neighbor


who lives next door, this is using a statistical method to


make assumptions, isn't it? 


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, it is. 


QUESTION:  I think you have to be realistic


about that. 


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, it is a statistical method


by which you take, when you have a known established


household address, the information from that, basically


the next door neighbor, somewhat refined, Justice


O'Connor, the next door neighbor that was a nonresponding


household of a similar type and they found over the years


that that information is more reliable than zero. 


Utah's position is that the Constitution


requires when you have an address known to be occupied, if


you put down that it's occupied by zero people, that's not


an actual enumeration, that is literally a counterfactual


enumeration from what one knows to be the case.  This is a


process where you

use one unit's characteristics to supply to another. 


QUESTION:  That's just part of it.  It also, it


also imputes nonhouseholds as households.  I mean, it does


a lot of things. 


MR. DELLINGER:  It imputes only to known


addresses.  Thank you. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Dellinger.  General


Olson, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


SOLICITOR GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE


ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL APPELLEES


GENERAL OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it


please the Court:  The Census Bureau has consistently


utilized the imputation technique for drawing inferences


about a tiny fraction of damaged, discrepant or missing


population data for the past five censuses. 


QUESTION:  Do you agree that that's a


statistical methodology or is it just a method of making


deductions from circumstantial evidence? 


GENERAL OLSON:  We agree that it is a


statistical methodology, Justice Kennedy, and it's very


important in that context to focus on the words of the


statute.  The words of the statute are that the


statistical method known as sampling is the one

that's prohibited with respect to the apportionment. 


That statement in the statute suggests that


other statistical methods are not prohibited by the


statuted, and that one particular statistical method, that


is the one that is known as sampling, which is in quotes


in the statute, which imports that it's a term of art that


was known by Congress to be a term of art.  It was a


phrase that was suggested by the Secretary himself in


1957, when that statute was added, that exact phrase came


from the Secretary.  The Secretary was presumed to know


what that phrase meant.  It is a term of art that


statisticians know what it is.  Furthermore --


QUESTION:  Well, I thought the statute also said


that statistical adjustments pose a risk. 


GENERAL OLSON:  It does not say that.  In fact,


the import of the statute, Justice Kennedy, is that


statistical adjustments, and I will refer to what my


colleague Mr. Dellinger just referred to, at page 22 in


the Wisconsin decision which was unanimous decision by


this Court just six years ago, distinguishing the sampling


method that the Court was talking about in that case from


statistical adjustments known as imputation, which is


described on pages 4 and 5 of the Respondent's brief,


referred

to on those pages of the Supreme Court, this Court's


unanimous decision just six years ago as being an entirely


different thing. 


We would go back also to the fact that this


Court unanimously held in that case that the Constitution


vests virtually unlimited discretion in Congress


respecting the manner in which the census shall be


conducted, and that Congress has delegated its broad


authority to the Secretary to take the census in such form


and content as he shall direct.  Now, the Congress has


exercised that discretion by passing it on to the


Secretary with the one limitation with respect, with


respect to one statistical method known as sampling. 


Now, at the same time, the Secretary was


proposing the prohibition of the sampling method; with


respect to the apportionment of the census in 1957, the


Secretary was planning the 1960 census, which was the


first computerized census and the first time that the


imputation method which we are talking about today was


used.  So it's obvious that the Secretary did not believe


that hot-deck imputation was sampling, because the very


next census three years later imputation was being used in


that census.  And it was used again in 1970, 1980, 1990,


and 2000.

And with respect to 1970, and 1980, it was actually


considered by this Court in connection with the Wisconsin


case. 


It is widely understood in the industry that


sampling is a collection of, a collection technique


whereby a sample, a fraction of the whole population is


used to deduct -- deduce the actual whole population. 


It seemed to me that a metaphor that might be


considered outside the context of population gathering


would be if the Court asked the library of this Court to


ascertain the number of books, to conduct the number of


books in the Court's library, and the, but sampling was


not permitted to do that, so that the librarian could not


go to every third shelf, multiply, count the books,


multiply by three and get the census.  But if the


librarian went to those shelves and counted every


particular volume and found that there was a space here on


that shelf, a space this big on the next shelf, and a


space this big on another shelf, for example, the


imputation would be saying well, all the books or the


books right next to this are this size, and therefore that


space a book is missing, so we know we have a book, and we


will impute one book to that space or two

books to this space.  So that the sampling technique is


completely discrete from the imputation technique. 


We know that because the Secretary has always


regarded it that way.  The Congress has given the


authority to this expert agency which has been conducting


the census for years and years and has drawn various


different types of inferences which is what imputations


are. 


QUESTION:  Why, just out of curiosity.  I mean,


I'd like to understand this better.  In the library, you


look and see that everything around the book is a history


book and so then you impute the characteristic of being a


history book to the one that's missing. 

That's your


analogy of what goes on here, is that right? 


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, yes, I think that's an


extension of it.  In the example that I was giving you


look at the space and impute the size of the space by the


book that is immediately next to it. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  Why is it called statistical?


Why isn't that just ordinary inference? Why -- you said we


do it statistically? What's statistical about it? 


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I'm not sure.  That's a


good question.  I don't know the answer to

why it should be called statistics, because in my thinking


of it, it is drawing logical inferences from the data


available.  Now Justice O'Connor, it is not creating


phantom homes.  Most of these cases in, the statistics


indicated that with respect to one of the forms of the


imputation, and this is in the record at the joint


appendix, the information may be found in pages 445


through 448 of the joint appendix, that 98 percent of the


household size imputation forms were enumerator forms with


the status of occupied homes.


Now, the problem is that with respect to any,


and the statistics are different, but in 93 percent with


respect to occupancy imputation, 75 percent with respect


to status imputation.  Each of these are attempting to


find actual people drawing from the closest comparable


unit and it's one unit for each inference.  It's not


extrapolating from one unit to the whole population. 


The problem with the census is that there are


billions of pieces of paper as Mr. Dellinger indicated. 


Some people refuse to return the forms and their known


addresses.  Some people fill out the forms incorrectly. 


They may say occupied but zero.  The enumerators might get


bad information. 


In 1850, a substantial portion of the

entire State of California the returns were actually


burned, and the Census Bureau in 1850 actually used a


process to replace the 70,000 people that were not there. 


And one of the questions indicated, neighbors have been


used as proxies.  Heads of households have been used as


proxies.  Postal service has been used as proxies.  These


are all means by which the postal, the Census Bureau


attempts to develop the most accurate count it possibly


can. 


QUESTION:  When you say heads of households have


been used as proxies.  Does that mean you go to the head


of the household who appears at the door and ask him how


many other people live in the house? 


GENERAL OLSON:  That's correct, Mr. Chief


Justice, and that was the way it was done in 1790. 


QUESTION:  That doesn't seem too statistical.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, it's not necessarily


statistical.  And I guess that, the fact is that as far as


the statute is concerned, there is only one technique


that's prohibited.  The technique of drawing inferences


through sampling is prohibited.  It's prohibited probably


because Congress feels that it might be subject to


manipulation.

 QUESTION:  Yes.  On the merits, I think we have to


know whether this so-called hot-deck imputation is a form


of sampling.  Which it appears that it might well be.  I


think that's the --


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, Justice O'Connor, the


expert agency to which Congress delegated this broad


authority doesn't believe so.  That seems to me that there


should be a substantial deference to the expertise of the


agency.  Not only that, but Congress with full awareness


that hot-deck imputation has been used over the past --


QUESTION:  Why do we call it hot-deck? 


GENERAL OLSON:  Hot-deck imputation is


distinguishable from cold-deck imputation in the sense


that information from the most current census and the


actual neighborhood, the most current available


information for the actual census that's being developed


is being used.  Now where that term came from, I don't


know.  But that's what it means.  But this methodology has


been used with the knowledge of Congress, with the full


knowledge of Congress, for the past five censuses. 


There was litigation over this matter, it's


referred to as the Orr case in the briefs, where a seat


may have been allocated to Indiana or Florida,

depending upon how the imputation process came out.  So


that litigation took place.  Congress actually changed the


terminology, Section 141, which provides the Secretary


with the authority to conduct the census in a manner that


the Secretary thinks appropriate, in 1976.  After


imputation had been used in two censuses already. 


QUESTION:  Of course, against all of that, and


I'm not sure why we should give deference to the agency


here.  They didn't conduct a rulemaking.  They didn't have


any adjudication on this subject.  That's just what they


happened to do, right?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, as a matter of fact, in


the unanimous decision of this Court in the Wisconsin case


six years ago, the court said substantial deference should


be owed to the agency. 


QUESTION:  There's a lot of water over the dam


since six years ago. 


GENERAL OLSON:  But the reasoning of the Court,


I would submit, is --


QUESTION:  I refer to Meade in particular. 


And, but wouldn't the deference to the agency, even if


there is to be some, potentially be outweighed by a


constitutional doubt? If we thought that even if this


isn't sampling, it may well be not enumeration

within the meaning of the constitutional requirement, and


given, given that constitutional doubt, we think the wise


course is to interpret the word sampling as including,


including this? 


GENERAL OLSON:  Justice Scalia, not only the


Wisconsin case, but the other decisions of this Court


which have considered census have suggested that the


framers of the Constitution by using the word enumeration


didn't mean a particular method by which the census would


be conducted, nor did it wish to constrain both the


Congress and whomever the Congress may delegate to --


QUESTION:  Even sampling, presumably. 


GENERAL OLSON:  Presumably.  Possibly. 


QUESTION:  Pretty accurate sampling, you know? 


GENERAL OLSON:  Possibly, Justice Scalia.  But


that's nowhere close to that and this is not remotely


sampling. 


QUESTION:  Is this remotely estimation? 


GENERAL OLSON:  This is not remotely estimation. 


This is drawing an inference with respect to one


particular piece of data.  We would agree that the gross


estimation --


QUESTION:  Why isn't it estimation? Why

isn't it estimation? You estimate that there are so many


people in this house because the house next door to it has


that many people.  You don't call that estimation? 


GENERAL OLSON:  In each of these cases, Justice


Scalia, the words can be changed and added to, but the


process by which the framers analyzed this in framing the


Constitution, the very first House of Representatives was


assigned according to an estimation, and the words actual


enumeration were used to compare an actual count, an


effort to find the actual number of people by indulging in


a process --


QUESTION:  That's why I asked about estimation. 


You say there is a difference in an estimation and a


deduction, I suppose. 


GENERAL OLSON:  What I think the Constitution


and courts with respect to the term actual enumeration, is


an effort to go out and find a count.  We, we pointed out


that the, the enumeration can mean listing by particular


items as used in the Ninth Amendment, the enumerated


powers.  It may be a process by which a count might be


taken or it might simply refer to a census, find the


population.  We submit that the Capitation Clause as we


have referred

to in our brief, which uses the word census and


enumeration indistinguishably as synonyms, and in fact the


Appellants in their brief, in their reply brief at page 15


acknowledge that the words enumeration and census are used


in the Constitution interchangeably. 


Justice Scalia, it didn't seem, it does not seem


that the framers of the Constitution actually specified a


method.  And in fact, what the Appellants were saying here


today and are saying in their briefs, every census


conducted by asking people who may have lived next door or


drawing inferences from other pieces of information would


not have been the individual by individual count that --


QUESTION:  You think sampling --


QUESTION:  Sampling would have been okay as far


as the Constitution is concerned? Real, real sampling? 


GENERAL OLSON:  I think --


QUESTION:  We are going to do two-thirds of the


state and just guess that the other third is pretty much


like that. 


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, we are not remotely close


to that here.  But with respect --


QUESTION:  I understand.  But your

argument is that since enumeration doesn't mean anything


except census, sampling would be okay. 


GENERAL OLSON:  From the standpoint of the


Constitution, I think a reasonably good argument could be


made and the Government has in the past made it, that


sampling if it is consistent with the process of an


attempt to find an actual count utilizing sophisticated


accurate and nonmanipulatable techniques --


QUESTION:  Surely the term actual, though,


before the word enumeration, narrows the idea that, what


might otherwise be an enumeration. 


GENERAL OLSON:  I believe it does and I think,


Chief Justice, the District Court in this case


distinguished actual enumeration from the conjectural


apportionment that actually occurred in the Constitution


itself with respect to the first House of Representatives. 


What we are talking about here today, though, is


an effort to, an effort to produce extremely conscientious


and meticulous, to count all of the households in the


United States starting with a meticulously prepared master


address list.  All of those people were submitted post


office forms which has been authorized by Congress for a


certain --

 QUESTION:  That's not the issue.  Can I ask you a


question about the standing issue? I know that you in your


brief do not, do not contest the standing.  You say that


Franklin has decided it, because four justices thought


that there was standing on one basis, and four thought


there was standing on another basis.  Which of those two


bases do you agree with? 


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, we --


QUESTION:  Do, do, do, is it your position that


the President will have to do whatever, whatever, accept


whatever revised census figures are submitted to him by,


by the Secretary? 


GENERAL OLSON:  If this Court is to, determines


that the process by which the 2000 census was conducted


was inconsistent with the statute or inconsistent with the


Constitution and orders the Secretary to take out the


imputed numbers --


QUESTION:  Right. 


GENERAL OLSON:  -- and deliver a different


piece of information to the President --


QUESTION:  Right. 


GENERAL OLSON:  -- the President will transmit


that certificate or that certified, those certified


results to Congress for the process.  In

other words, in answer to your question, the President


will do what this Court assumed in those cases that the


President would do. 


QUESTION:  He has told you that that's what he


will do? 


GENERAL OLSON:  The President will --


QUESTION:  You see, because, I sort of wouldn't


want to make the people of North Carolina mad by taking


away one of their representatives.  And were I President,


I might well say, look at this judgment of the Court,


doesn't run against me.  It runs against my Secretary,


everybody agrees, you know, that it's not binding upon me. 


It's sort of like a declaratory judgment.  And I just


think too much time has passed and it would upset things


too much and I don't want to take away a representative. 


GENERAL OLSON:  The President is willing to


accept the import, not only of the Franklin and the other


decision that we referred to, but also if this Court


decides that the process was unconstitutional or


inconsistent with the statute, the President will accept


that, this Court's judgment in that respect. 


QUESTION:  So if another, if the next President


comes along, we get another case like this,

and the next President tells his Solicitor General, I will


not accept it, then we come out differently. 


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, if, for that reason, if


Mr. Chief Justice, the Court decides that that is not the


kind of result that this Court can issue, because of that


possibility, we'll accept that result as well. 


(Laughter.)


GENERAL OLSON: 

But we think -- we think it


is very unlikely for that to occur, because it is quite


clear that the Constitution intended to give considerable


flexibility, did not want to freeze in a system the


ability of the Government. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Olson, you are saying we can


presume the President will obey the law? 


GENERAL OLSON:  Yes, Justice Stevens. 


QUESTION:  What happens after that? He transmits


to the Congress, I take it the clerk of the Congress says


not certified, the House has not certified the results


yet? 


GENERAL OLSON:  I'm not sure of the answer to


that question.  I guess the answer is that is correct.  Or


no.  That it has been certified and I would gather that it


would have to be a revised certification if that should


occur.

 QUESTION:  You say you assume the President will


obey the law.  So you are accepting the -- you are


accepting the position that the President must, even if he


didn't want to, that the law requires him to transmit


whatever the Secretary gives him, is that right? 


GENERAL OLSON:  What we are saying --


QUESTION:  Just answer that question yes or no. 


Do you take the position that the President must transmit


what the Secretary gives it to him, and he has no, no


objection? 


GENERAL OLSON:  I only can answer it this way,


Justice Scalia.  If this Court determines that the process


before was unconstitutional or in violation of the statute


and the Secretary must redo it and if that information is


transmitted to the Secretary, he will transmit that. 


QUESTION:  That is not the question I asked. 


GENERAL OLSON:  Then I misunderstood your


question. 


QUESTION:  The question I asked is whether, you


say the President will obey the law.  I take that to mean


that you feel the President is bound by law to transmit


whatever revised figures the

Secretary takes, is that correct? 


GENERAL OLSON:  If it is based upon a decision


by this Court that the Court has the power to issue --


QUESTION:  To tell the Secretary.  Let's assume


we have the power to tell the Secretary.  Does the


President acknowledge that he is bound by law to transmit


whatever figures the Secretary gives him? 


GENERAL OLSON:  I think that that would only


occur in the context of this Court's decision. 


QUESTION:  If not, he is not bound by law and I


don't think you are going to give that away. 


GENERAL OLSON:  I don't think we need to give


anything away, Justice Scalia.  We would be talking about


a context in which this Court came to the conclusion it


could render a jurisprudentially binding decision in a


case in which there was redressability in that context. 


QUESTION:  Fine.  But that's a far cry by saying


he is bound by law.


QUESTION:  You seem to be accepting Marbury and


Madison.

time is about up.  This Court's words

again, that the Constitution gave virtually unlimited


discretion to the Congress with respect to the manner in


which the census would be --


QUESTION:  Extend your time by two minutes. 


I'll extend Mr. Lee's time by two minutes. 


GENERAL OLSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 


There is no evidence that the framers of the Constitution


wanted to bind themselves to a particular method of


counting people.  All of the evidence suggested that what


the framers wanted to do was to have a reasonably reliable


accurate, reasonably accurate count of the citizens in the


manner that the, that Congress would determine.  Congress


in the words of this Court has delegated all of that broad


authority to the Census Bureau. 


The Census Bureau, conscientiously using a


technique that they have been using consistently for 50


years with the awareness of Congress, the General


Accounting Office, oversight committees and the actual


awareness of this Court, as reflected in this 1996


decision, has demonstrated, developed a method that is


reasonably accurate, uses statistical methods other than


those known as sampling to get an accurate court.  We urge


the Court to sustain that outcome. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, General Olson.

Mr. Lee, you have five minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS R. LEE


ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS.


MR. LEE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  I have


just two or three quick points.  The first is to clarify


briefly the record on an important issue.  With all due


respect to the Solicitor General, the record does not


indicate that the majority of the imputations here were in


units known to be occupied. 


The Bureau's memo at page 445 of the joint


appendix indicates that fully 69 percent of the units


subjected to imputation were the kinds of units that


Justice O'Connor's questions directed us to be concerned


about, units where after as many as six visits, census


enumerators were not able to determine whether the unit in


question was a valid occupied housing unit and not a


duplicate, not a seasonal home, not a home that happens


not to be occupied. 


Second, I would point the Court to another


unanimous decision that this Court has handed down with


regard to the census, and it's the Montana decision, and


I'd like to read a brief quote from Montana and explain


how important I think it is here.  This is from 503 U.S.


at 465. 


"To the extent that the potentially

divisive and complex issues associated with apportionment


can be narrowed by the adoption of both procedural and


substantive rules that are consistently applied year after


year, the public is well served." 


That is precisely the goal of both the Census


Act and the Census Clause.  To give us rules that can be


consistently applied year after year, not rules that will


ebb and flow with debates among statisticians, and that's


where the Census Bureau is heading us here.  The variable


standard that will be produced by a debate as to whether a


particular method of sampling is sufficiently premeditated


or follows a sufficiently premeditated intent to --


QUESTION:  What about what we said in the


Wisconsin vs. New York case by your opponent, Mr.


Dellinger, where we referred to this very kind of action,


this imputation, and indicated that that was vastly


different from the broader statistical?


MR. LEE:  I don't believe that was an issue in


that case, first of all, Justice O'Connor.  Secondly,


there isn't any reason to give either deference to the


Secretary here or much less to congressional inaction for


a very important reason.  Imputation simply has not been


on anyone's radar

screen.  It's been a nonentity because it's undisputed


that it impacted apportionment only once prior to this


case, in 1980.  In 1960, in 1970, in 1990, it had no


impact.  Congress reenacted the statute, amended the


statute in 1976. 


At that point in time, imputation had never


affected apportionment to any degree whatsoever.  There


was no reason for anyone even to be focusing on it and


therefore no reason to give any deference here. 


I'd like to just close by saying a few brief


words about the constitutional question here.  Mr. Chief


Justice, to go back to your question about the word


actual.  The word actual is important, and it's important


because it's not just that the word enumeration is defined


to mean an actual count and not an estimate.  It's that


this was a term of art.  This phrase actual enumeration


was used consistently in the founding era, both in


colonial assessments of population when they reported


their populations to boards of trade, and also in Great


Britain throughout the 18th century.  James Madison


himself referred to a distinction between an actual


enumeration and a mere estimate.  John Adams similarly


said there is a difference between an authentic


enumeration and a

mere estimate. 


Not only that, but the framers of the


Constitution thought they were giving us a permanent,


fixed standard.  That's what they said they were doing and


James Madison said not only is it permanent and fixed, it


is the way required by the Constitution and "which we are


obliged to perform."  It was a methodology; they


understood it as such; and they understood also that it


had its shortcomings.  They knew that it would result in


an undercount, that when you require a count, you are


going to leave some people out. 


George Washington himself said look, we


understand at the time of the first census that the real


numbers will exceed greatly the official returns.  Thomas


Jefferson similarly said we know that the omissions in the


census will be great.  If they understood those


limitations, then why did they do it? The answer is clear. 


They understood that that was a necessary price of a


permanent, fixed, precise standard that would not be


subject to manipulation, that would not be subject to the


vicissitudes of debates among not only politicians, but


statisticians from year to year.  And the impulse, the


proper impulse of this Court's unanimous
