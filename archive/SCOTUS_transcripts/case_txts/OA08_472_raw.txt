 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument first today in Case 08-472, Salazar v. Buono.

 (10:04 a.m.)

 General Kagan.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELENA KAGAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 The Establishment Clause does not prohibit 
the sensible action Congress took in enacting Section 
8121 and thereby divesting the Federal Government of the 
property at issue in this case.

 The district court gave Congress two basic 

options when it found the Sunrise Rock War Memorial 
unconstitutional.  First, Congress could accede to 
permanently removing the memorial, ending the dispute, 
but also doing away with a memorial that for 75 years 
had commemorated America's fallen soldiers and had 
acquired deep meaning for the veterans in the community.

 Or, second, Congress --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General Kagan, just as a 

factual matter, is there any other national memorial 
that consists of a solitary cross, just that one symbol 
and no other?

GENERAL KAGAN:  I don't believe that there 

is, Justice Ginsburg.  There are national memorials that 
have some religious content to them.  There is, for 
example, a statue of a Catholic priest holding a very 
large cross, but most national memorials are -- are not 
religious.  Some are.

 The -- the -- you know, I think that it 

would even be possible, for example, to make a church or 
a synagogue a national memorial.  If -- if Dr. King's 
church were selected as a national memorial because of 
-- in order to honor Dr. King, I think that would be 
permissible.  If --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, I was just curious 

as a factual matter whether this lone cross, if -- if 
there was any other memorial like that, and your answer 
is no, but there could be other religiously oriented 
memorials?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Yes, and there is at least 
one religiously oriented memorial that I know of, which 
is a priest holding a cross.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What are the practical 

consequences of something being designated as a national 
memorial?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Very little, Justice Alito. 

In fact, it has no consequences in terms of the

government's supervision of the land.  National 
memorials can be on private land or on public land.  If 
they are on private land, nothing goes along with the 
designation by way of more extensive regulation or 
supervision by the National Park Service.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is the -- is the private 
property owner who has this designation free to destroy 
it after it's been designated a national memorial?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  The 

Veterans of Foreign Wars here could in fact take down 
this memorial once it is transferred to them, if the 
Court allows that transfer.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could they then 
substitute whatever other memorial they chose?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  The --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Or would there have to be 

some government approval?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  No, no, no.  The 

reversionary clause which is at issue, which is a part 
of the transfer legislation, says that the VFW will have 
to put up a veterans memorial, but the content of that 
veterans memorial is entirely up to the VFW.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it wouldn't 

automatically require acquire a national memorial 
status, would it, when the government hasn't seen it,

hasn't -- I thought that to get national memorial 
status, the government has to approve what you put up.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Yes, that's correct.  If the 
VFW took down this memorial and substituted a different 
memorial, that memorial would not at that point have 
national memorial status.

 There is a little bit of a dispute as to 

whether the -- the VFW could in fact take down the 
memorial or whether it's designation as a national 
memorial would prevent them from doing that.  I think 
it's quite clear, if you look at the statute, that the 
Section 1369, which is what the Respondents point to, 
would not prevent the VFW from taking down this 
memorial, if it so wanted to, because 1369 applies only 
to national memorials which are on public property.  If 
the transfer were to take place, of course, it would not 
be on public property, or it would not be under the 
supervision, in any way, of the Federal Government. 
So --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  General Kagan, before you 
go -- go on with your argument, you presented it as --
as though the issue before us is the -- the conveying of 
the land.  But is it?

 What this was was simply an affirmation of 

the prior injunction.  The court of appeals said the

prior injunction had not been mooted by the -- by the 
transfer of the land.  So isn't really the issue whether 
that -- that prior injunction, when the land did indeed 
belong to the government, whether that prior injunction 
was valid?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, there is a question in 
this case whether the prior injunction was valid and was 
the display itself a violation of the Establishment 
Clause.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
 GENERAL KAGAN:  But the government argued 

below that that question had been mooted out because of 
the passage of the transfer legislation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But didn't the court of 

appeals say no?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  The court of appeals did say 

no, but it remands the government --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So -- so what we have 

before us is the court of appeals' affirmation of the 
prior injunction, which applied to a cross on public 
land.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, I think what you have 

before you, there were of course two stages in this 
litigation, and the first stage declared the display 
unconstitutional, and then the second stage declared the

transfer as well unconstitutional or at least a 
violation of the prior injunction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, if I -- if I 

thought the display wasn't unconstitutional, the 
transfer would a fortiori not --

GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, that is correct.  We 

do think that the issue before the Court now is the 
congressional legislation which has been passed, which 
is the transfer legislation, that that has essentially 
changed the situation on the ground, so that no longer 
is the question whether the display from the -- whether 
the display by the government would be constitutional, 
but only whether the government has the ability to 
transfer this property and -- and to give up all 
supervision, all control over it.
 So that the message --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't see why that's the 

issue before us.  Look, procedurally this is a little 
boring, but it seems pretty well established in the law. 
I read a case called Toledo Scale and then there are a 
bunch of cases on jurisdiction, which I'm not going to 
name them because I'm sure you looked at them, but 
Travelers Indemnity, et cetera.  And it seems to me they 
make absolutely clear that once a litigant, you and the 
others, have had an opportunity to raise a matter and

now the case is over, done, but for an injunction that 
stays in, all those issues that they previously raised 
or could have raised are gone; that the only question 
left is whether the government has complied with the 
injunction.

 So I read the injunction.  The injunction 

says the government is enjoined from permitting the 
display of the Latin cross, period.  Once this law takes 
effect and you follow it, you are violating that 
injunction.  You don't need nine proceedings to see 
that.  You are violating it.

 Now, if you don't like the injunction 
because you think the statute has so changed the 
circumstances there is no need for it, there is a 
remedy.  You go back to the district court and you say: 
Judge, change the injunction.  But you haven't done 
that.  And therefore, the only question before us is 
whether the Ninth Circuit is right in saying when you 
carry the statute into effect, you are violating this 
injunction, which I think no one could say you aren't.
 Now, now, that -- that's a very technical 

boring issue.  I don't know why we heard this issue, but 
I don't see how we could reach any other issue in this 
case.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Breyer, I think we

are in perfect compliance with the injunction and have 
been since the day it was issued.  Now, in fact there 
were two injunctions issued.  As I said, there were two 
stages of this litigation.  The first stage ended in an 
injunction that said do not display the war memorial. 
In compliance with that injunction, the next day the war 
memorial was covered.  So we were in compliance from 
the -- from the moment that the decision issued.

 Now then, Respondents went back to the 

district court and asked for additional relief, because 
what -- during the first court of appeals hearing, 
Congress had passed this transfer statute.  And so the 
Respondents went back and said:  In addition to the 
injunction that you previously gave us, we essentially 
need a new injunction and that injunction will be to 
stop the transfer.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But that's not what I'm 

talking about.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought the Respondents 

asked to have the injunction enforced.  It is typical, 
you get an injunction -- and I'm glad that the 
government has recognized that that was indeed a final 
decision because you appealed it to the Ninth Circuit 
under 1291 as a final decision.  Then the question is, 
are you complying with the injunction.  One side says,

the winner -- who by the way has unquestioned standing 
to enforce the injunction that is now final that that 
party obtained -- the winner says:  Court, please 
enforce the injunction.  They are not asking for a new 
injunction.  They say this injunction, as Justice Breyer 
just explained, says, do not permit the cross.  The 
party comes in and says:  Here's my injunction; court, 
all I want you to do is enforce it.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Ginsburg, this is 

much more than an enforcement action.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  We are talking about the 

first.  We are talking about the first injunction.  The 
first injunction says that the government may not permit 
display.  You've covered it up, so you are not 
permitting display.  You are in compliance.
 GENERAL KAGAN:  That is correct.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But what the plaintiff here 
said is that when you comply with this statute, you will 
not be in compliance, because you will turn it over to 
the VFW that will uncover it, so you will have permitted 
it to be displayed.  Now, that I can see is an issue 
before us.  But I don't see any other issue before us.
 GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Breyer, again, the 

Respondents had to go back to the district court in 
order not just to enforce the injunction, which said

don't display the statue, but to get additional relief, 
which was don't transfer the statue.  If the transfer 
had taken place, it would no longer have been the 
government's property, the government would not have 
permitted or not permitted the display because it wasn't 
the government's property to permit or not to permit the 
display.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me unreasonable 

to read the injunction to say the government shall not 
permit anybody to display a cross on that land no matter 
who owns the land.  I assume the injunctions meant you 
will not permit the cross to be displayed on this parcel 
of government land.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  And the Ninth Circuit 
specifically said -- when this came to the Ninth 
Circuit, the Ninth Circuit was asked by the Respondents. 
In order to rule on the transfer legislation, the Ninth 
Circuit specifically said:  We are not going to do that; 
that's a decision for another day, a separate decision. 
Because of that, the Respondents had to go back to the 
district court and had to get the district court 
essentially to modify the injunction and to provided 
additional relief.

 Now, there is some question as to whether 
the standing question here, just the standing question

is precluded, and our view is that it is not preclude, 
because the way the government views this is it's one 
entire litigation in which all issues are open.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you know, General 
Kagan, any case in which there has been a permanent 
injunction ordered, final, no more appeals are possible, 
where -- and standing was in question, raised, 
litigated, and decided, and then when the party who won 
the injunction comes to the court and says, court, 
please enforce the injunction, that you can say, now we 
can go back to square one and argue again about 
standing?  I don't see how you can revive what has been 
determined by a final judgment.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, either this is one 

litigation, in which all cases are before the Court, or 
it's too entirely separate litigations, in which case 
the Court has an obligation to independently consider 
the standing question.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, we know it isn't 

that because, as I think you pointed out, the same 
docket number.  This wasn't a new complaint.  This was a 
motion to enforce the judgment.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  It couldn't have been a 

motion to enforce the judgment because the government 
was in compliance with the judgment and because the

Ninth Circuit had said that the question that 
respondents were raising was an entirely separate issue 
for another day, according to the Ninth Circuit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would suppose -- I 
guess I don't agree with your dichotomy, either it's the 
same action or it's entirely separate.  I would suppose 
it could be some issues carry over and are the same, and 
perhaps standing is one of those.  Other issues are 
completely new, such as the effect of the legislation, 
which couldn't have been before the district court since 
it hadn't been passed.

 But standing is different.  I mean, once 

it's been determined that there is standing and that is 
reflected in a final judgment, then I think the later 
aspects are simply whether the person -- once it's 
embodied in a judgment, I think that is the basis for 
standing and not the earlier questions of whether he 
visited it enough or planned to visit enough.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, we could 

not have taken the standing question to this Court in 
the -- in the procedural posture that the case was at at 
that point.  It would have been really an irresponsible 
action on our part to ask this Court to address the 
standing issue after the first court of appeals judgment 
where -- where we knew that we were going to relitigate

the question of the validity of the transfer.  We 
couldn't have come to you, we wouldn't have come to you, 
as the Solicitor General's Office and asked you to 
adjudicate a decision that was as likely as not going to 
be irrelevant.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't understand -- I 
don't understand that point at all.  If you thought that 
he didn't have standing to challenge the cross at all 
and that the injunction itself directing you to cover up 
the cross was wrong, you should have come to the Court. 
It was a permanent injunction.  You were told you have 
interlocutory appeal rights, you have final judgment 
rights.  At any point you could have come and said:  The 
order for us to take that flag -- to take that cross off 
this land was just plain wrong.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I think, Justice Sotomayor, 
you are right that we could have, but I don't think that 
we would have used our discretion, in a sense knocking 
on this Court's door, the Solicitor General's Office 
discretion, in order to ask you to decide a question 
that was as likely or not going to be completely 
irrelevant depending on what happened with respect to 
the transfer statute.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But interlocutory appeal 

or finality doesn't matter what you are going to do to

get away from the injunction.  The issue is did you give 
up any rights to challenge any of the issues embodied in 
that injunction and you haven't answered why not.  You 
may have a right, and you do, to challenge a 
modification of that injunction.  That's what you are 
here to do, to say the Ninth Circuit erred in modifying 
the injunction and stopping the transfer.  Perfectly 
legitimate point, because the injunction has been 
changed.  But you can't go back and relitigate whether 
he had standing to challenge that -- the presence of 
that cross.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, I 
appreciate the distinction that you are making between 
the standing question and the merits question and I 
think you are exactly right as to that point.  But 
whatever the question as to whether we have given up the 
standing question, certainly there is no such question 
on the merits of this -- of the validity of this 
transfer.  But with respect, I think that the standing 
question is -- is not the way you described it.  And 
it's partly because we couldn't have come to this Court 
or we wouldn't have come, is a better way to say it.  We 
would have thought that it was not the right kind of 
position to ask the Court to take certiorari on a 
question that basically was very likely, we thought, was

very likely to go away.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but that -- that's 

because -- that's because you assume the act is going to 
be valid.  You could have come here and said:  This is 
such an important case Congress is taking action, and 
therefore, you should hear our standing argument to 
avoid the necessity of the Legislative Branch having to 
come in.  You could have said that.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, but we didn't, because 

we did think that Congress had acted appropriately and 
that the congressional act was valid, and continue to do 
so, continue to think that this --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but the standing 
issue was independently important to the government, 
because the government can face this kind of question 
again, and if you right -- if you were right on the 
standing point -- I mean, I don't understand why the 
government would not have had a strong incentive to say, 
we want to get rid of these cases on the standing 
ground, we think the Court was wrong on standing.

 But in any case, you didn't do that, and I 

think that you started your argument this morning in the 
right place when you said, let's talk about this law. 
Congress said, accepting arguendo that the Court was 
right, here's a law that cures the constitutional

defect.  And that's where you were -- that's where you 
started your argument.  Maybe you can pick up with that. 
But --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But just I want to just get 

this clear procedurally.  I'm sorry.  It'll take one 
more second.

 As I read this, there is no modification of 
any injunction.  What the -- what the Respondent asked 
for, he said:  Judge, either hold that the transfer 
violates the current injunction, or modify the 
injunction.  Then what the district court did do is he 
said the proposed transfer violates the permanent 
injunction.  The permanent injunction is in the, like, 
the third paragraph of the July 24th order, and it says, 
you are permanently enjoined from permitting the display 
of the Latin cross.  Therefore, he rejected the need to 
modify it, and held that --

GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Breyer.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- this violates the 

injunction as written, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed 
that.

 So is there any question in this case of 
modifying?  Is there any question other than the one 
that I think Justice Scalia was taking a good argument 
about, whether the proposed statute violates the

July 24th injunction?  That's what the case is about. 
Or why am I wrong?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  You -- you are incorrect, 

Justice Breyer, because in addition to saying this 
violates the previously given injunction, the district 
court said, you are enjoined from transferring this 
property in accordance with this statute.  And so there 
was additional relief, additional relief that the Ninth 
Circuit said was additional relief that it wasn't 
deciding in the first go-round, and that's -- and that 
places the question, the merits question of the validity 
of this transfer, directly before the Court.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Thank you.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Before we get --
before your time expires, we would like to spend a 
couple of minutes on the merits.

 (Laughter.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And I wonder if you 

could focus on a particular question.  What if the 
government sold simply one square foot, or whatever the 
area that the base of the cross is -- is resting on the 
ground?  Would your argument be the same?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, there are 

certainly limits to the way that the government can 
transfer property, and I would give you a few of them.

If -- if it was not a bona fide sale, so that there 
wasn't proper consideration; if -- if there was only 
religious purpose, so that there was no secular purpose 
involved; or if after the sale the property was 
indistinguishable from government property, so that 
everybody naturally thought that this was government 
property.  In those cases --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, why isn't that 

-- why isn't that the case here?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  In fact, it's not the case 
here.  And it's not the case for two reasons.  First, 
the preserve is riddled with private inholdings.  There 
are 1800 private landowners with -- excuse me, 1,000 
private landowners with 1800 plots of land.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But what percentage of the 

total area do they represent?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I'm sorry?
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  What percentage of the 

total area do they represent?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  It's about -- between the 

State and the private inholdings, it's about 10 percent 
of the total area.  But they are dotted all over the 
place.  So tomorrow, 1,000 crosses could go up and 
nobody would know whether they were on private land or 
on public land.  Moreover --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But do you concede there 

was a violation at the time the case was decided?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I'm sorry?
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do you concede that the 

Establishment Clause was violated at the time this case 
was decided?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  We do not, Justice Stevens. 
The government has argued -- argued below that there was 
no violation prior to the transfer statute, and that 
remains the government's position, although, as I said 
to Justice Scalia, we think that that position has been 
overtaken by events and that the only question before 
the Court is the transfer statute.

 I was going to go on to say to the Chief 

Justice that, in addition to the fact that private 
inholdings just riddle the preserve, the government is 
perfectly happy to put up signs which make clear that 
the -- the plot in question will not in fact be the 
government's, but will be the VFW's.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, isn't that an 

interference or it's singling out someone, private 
property owner, who's using his property in a particular 
way, a religious way?  You are going to be putting up 
signs only for people putting up religious symbols.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I don't think that that is

correct, Mr. Chief Justice.  I think that the preserve 
would put up signs for various historic or cultural or 
otherwise important --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it hasn't done 
anything like that.  It doesn't say for other property 
owners that have maybe something that -- you know, a 
ramshackle shack, that they want people to know this 
isn't the government's property.  They don't do anything 
like that.

 It's -- under your hypothetical, it would be 

only religious property that would have these special 
warning signs.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, I suspect that there 

are a great many identification signs throughout the 
preserve, although I don't know precisely what they are. 
And this would be one of those, saying essentially that 
there is this war memorial, that it was put up by the 
VFW, that it is maintained and owned by the VFW.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Who would see it, General 

Kagan?  Who would see it?  I mean, the Seventh Circuit 
case, it was -- it was on level ground, lots of people 
used the area, and I think the Seventh Circuit required 
a fence and a sign.  But here, this cross is high on a 
cliff in a desolate area.  And if you had a little sign, 
who would be -- you would have to climb up to it.

GENERAL KAGAN:  I actually think, Justice 

Ginsburg, that it would be easy to do.  I was out there 
three or four weeks ago.  The superintendent drove me to 
the site.  There is virtually nobody who could see this 
war memorial in any other way than by going in one of 
two directions on Cima Road.  And you could put signs up 
on Cima Road that said exactly what you were going to 
see, you know, in 100 yards or a mile or whatever it 
was.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How is the question 
of -- I don't want to get into your rebuttal time, but 
briefly, how is the question of whether signs are or 
aren't valid or required before us in this case?  There 
are no signs there, and you are asking us to consider 
whether the statute is valid or not.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I think, Mr. Chief Justice, 

that if we were not going to put up signs, it would 
still be valid.  So I should make that completely clear.
 And as I said, there are many, many private 

holdings within the preserve, people who could put up 
whatever religious symbols they wanted to.  One simply 
wouldn't know whether it was on private land or on other 
land.  But I will say, in addition to that, that the 
preserve's superintendent himself would like to put up a 
sign essentially telling preserve users what the war

memorial was and what its provenance was.  If some --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't there legislation 
that requires the original plaque to be reinstated, the 
plaque recognizing the donation and what it means?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  That's correct, Justice 

Sotomayor.  But I have to say that that's more of the 
kind of sign that maybe Justice Ginsburg had in mind, 
which is, it's smaller and you would have to go right up 
to the war memorial in order to see it.

 I think it would be very easy to put up 

signs just on the road to make clear that anybody who 
was in the area would know that this was land --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This would be on 

government land, that sign?  It wouldn't be on the acre 
that you transferred.  I'm a little confused.
 GENERAL KAGAN:  The small plaque.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You are talking about 

putting --

GENERAL KAGAN:  The small plaque --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Would go on the cross?
 GENERAL KAGAN:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The larger sign you're 
talking about that you are willing to do is a sign that 
you would put on government land.

said, it's something that the superintendent would like 
to do and I think would be consistent with signage in 
the area.  If I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Did you raise that 

alternative with the Ninth -- with the district court 
and the Ninth Circuit?

up, Justice Sotomayor.  We did talk about it in our 
merits brief to this Court, but I don't think that it 
ever came up below.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER J. ELIASBERG

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. ELIASBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Justice Breyer, I would like to direct my 
beginning remarks to you.  I believe you've correctly 
stated the procedural posture exactly right.  The only 
question, point that I would make, is that I don't 
believe we did -- there was a modification of the 
injunction here.  Any time a defendant passes a piece of 
legislation after an injunction is first entered, there

may be a question as to whether that new statute or 
legislation is consistent with the injunction.  But it's 
not new relief.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I see what the judge did. 

He said:  The motion to enforce the July 24th injunction 
is granted.  He said:  Buono's motion to amend it is 
denied.  Then he did two other things, which he listed 
some people and he said they are enjoined from 
implementing the law.

 Now, I take it that those paragraphs 3 and 4 
are an implementation of the July 24 injunction which he 
granted, not a new injunction.

 MR. ELIASBERG:  That's exactly correct.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So that's the issue here 
that we were just possibly debating.  The issue in the 
case is whether the district judge might lawfully 
enforce an old injunction in the manner he did, which 
was to add paragraphs 3 and 4.  That question you 
concede is here.

 MR. ELIASBERG:  I believe that's -- that is 
here and that is really the only question that is here.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So that under your 
approach that this is looking to see if the injunction 
is being enforced or violated, we would be reviewing an 
act of Congress under an abuse of discretion standard,

not -- not de novo?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  That's correct.  But for 

this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Have we ever done 

that before?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  I --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Have we ever said 
that an act of Congress is unconstitutional without a 
de novo review of the merits of the constitutionality?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  I am not aware of that, but 

I am also not aware of a situation where the act of 
Congress is being put forth as the response to an 
already adjudicated constitutional violation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Eliasberg, I thought 
that the Ninth Circuit the first time around had taken 
meticulous care to make certain that the issue of the 
validity of the statute would not be before the Court in 
the first round.  Judge Kozinski wrote:  "We express no 
view as to whether a transfer completed under Section 
8121 would pass constitutional muster, but leave this 
question for another day."

 That's on page 104a of the petition.
 And then the district judge said:  Yes, I 

recognize the Ninth Circuit didn't touch the validity of 
that statute, left it for another day.  The day has

come.  So it is for the first time that the Court is 
deciding the question of whether section 8121 passes 
constitutional muster.

 MR. ELIASBERG:  The only thing I would 

disagree with you on that point, Justice Ginsburg, is 
that the question is whether the act of Congress 
remedies the already adjudicated constitutional 
violation and is consistent with the injunction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So when you get to 
the consistent with the injunction part -- I thought it 
was your position that we should review this question 
solely under an abuse of discretion standard?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  It is our position --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Because while the 

Court did not decide the validity of the act in the 
first case, it certainly did in the second case, which 
is why we have the case before us.

 MR. ELIASBERG:  That is correct.  We 

believe -- but may I make two points, Mr. Chief Justice?
 First, we believe in the enforcement context 
where the question is, is this a violation of an already 
entered injunction that was part of a final judgment, 
that that is traditional equity principles that you 
review for an abuse of discretion.  Nonetheless, we 
believe that we win even under a de novo standard.

So -- and if I could set forth some of the reasons for 
that.

 I think, Justice Breyer, that you have it 

exactly correct, that what the government has done here 
by selecting a particular transferee who has been given 
preferential access to the land in the past to the 
exclusion of others who wanted to erect other symbols, 
that the government is taking affirmative steps to 
permit, through this transfer statute, the display of 
the cross that they are enjoined from doing.

 Now, Justice Scalia, I believe your point is 

at some point if this is on private land and the 
government is not making any efforts to further this 
display, that it couldn't possibly be that the 
injunction forbids that.  And that may well be correct, 
but that is not the case we have in front of it.

 The government in this transfer statute has 
made a significant number of affirmative steps to ensure 
that the cross remains up.  It has selected --

JUSTICE ALITO:  When this injunction was 
first entered the statute -- nobody contemplated that 
this statute was going to be enacted; isn't that 
correct?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  When the district court 

entered the injunction, that is correct.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.  So isn't the sensible 
interpretation of the injunction that it was prohibiting 
the government from permitting the display of the cross 
on government property, and not on private property that 
happens to be within the Mojave National Preserve?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  I don't believe so, Justice 

Scalia -- excuse me -- Justice Alito, for a couple of 
reasons.  One of the bases for the entry of the 
injunction in the first instance was the way that the 
government had favored one party to come on, contrary to 
the government's own regulations, and erect a permanent 
symbol, while not allowing others.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Wasn't your argument that 

this was a violation of the Establishment Clause because 
it was on government land?  Did you make the argument 
that even if this was on one of the ranches within the 
Mojave National Preserve, it would still be a violation 
of the Establishment Clause?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  We did not make that 
argument because it wasn't presented to the Court.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes, it was a totally -- so 
the situation completely changed and the district court 
either modified the injunction -- it seems to me 
modified the injunction by interpreting it to mean 
something quite different from what anybody contemplated

it meant when it was originally entered?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  Well, I think that, as is 

traditional equity principles, the district court is at 
some level the master of its injunction and that's why 
we give an abuse of discretion standard.  The district 
court very clearly said:  I see this as an attempt by 
the government not to abide by my injunction; they are 
favoring the same parties they favored when -- that was 
part of the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, of course, it was 

that, but the question is whether it was a permissible 
amendment by the government of the situation.  Of 
course, I will stipulate that the government was trying 
to arrange it so that the cross could remain there.  But 
that doesn't mean that it was -- it was evading the 
injunction.  I mean, that's --

MR. ELIASBERG:  Well, I think it is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Unless the injunction 

clearly applied to the erection of a cross on private 
land that the government had -- had transferred.

 MR. ELIASBERG:  Well, but it's not the 

erection of the cross.  It is the transfer of something 
where the government has a reversionary interest.  It 
very much directs the way the VFW is likely to use the 
land.  It selected a particular transferee who has been

favored from the beginning.  They didn't say:  We're 
going to neutrally sell the land in order to allow this 
constitutional violation to be --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I will -- I will concede 
that the obvious purpose of that was to avoid being in 
violation of the injunction.  But that doesn't mean that 
it's invalid.

 MR. ELIASBERG:  Well, I believe it's invalid 

because I think that the affirmative steps they are 
taking here really make them -- put them in a position 
where they are permitting --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can -- can -- what, 

what -- let's start from the beginning.  Can -- would it 
be proper for the government or would the government be 
alleged to have violated the Establishment Clause if on 
another ranch that cross -- a cross went up?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  No, they would not.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So really 

your argument is that the reason this Court -- this 
cross on private land, if it becomes private, is 
offensive to the Establishment Clause is because of the 
government's prior history with respect to that cross, 
correct?  That's -- that's your argument?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  That is one part of my 

argument.  But there is another part.  The government

has taken the step of designating this cross one of 49 
national memorials in the whole country and the only 
national memorial commemorating American service in 
World War I, even though it's clear in the record --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So are you alleging that 
doing that violates the Establishment Clause, passing or 
designating a religious symbol as a national memorial, 
that that violates the Establishment Clause?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  We are alleging that under 
the totality of the circumstances, which includes the 
national memorial designation, the government's asserted 
purpose to make sure that the cross remains up, the 
government's favoritism of the same parties that it has 
always favored in this case to the exclusion of others, 
and the maintaining of the property interest in the land 
in the form of a reversionary interest, all of those 
things --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does that apply to all 

lands in this preserve?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  I'm sorry, does what apply 

to all lands?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does the reversionary 

interest apply to all of lands on this preserve?  Maybe 
your adversary has to answer that instead of you, but 
all of the other private property owners.

government if --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no, no.  Are all of 
the private owners on this preserve required to give the 
land back to the U.S. if they put it to some different 
use?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  I don't believe that that 

is true.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, if -- if --
if the government sold this land to a private party, no 
cross in the picture at all, and they go to settlement 
and at settlement the private landowner who is going to 
buy it says, you know, I'm going to put a big cross up 
on this property once I get it, can the government still 
sell it to him?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  Yes, absolutely.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.
 MR. ELIASBERG:  If the basis for the 

government's decision to sell the -- sell the land was a 
neutral basis.  And that's what we are saying here.  If 
what the government has done --

before the sale, even though the government knows there 
is going to be a big cross on the land with the same

situation you have here in the middle of the preserve 
and all, that's perfectly okay?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  No, it's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought you said 

before the government sold the land if they find out the 
new owner is going to put a cross on it there is no 
problem.

 MR. ELIASBERG:  The difference between those 

two scenarios, Mr. Chief Justice, is one is a remedial 
context.  The government has been held to violate the 
Constitution.  They have to, under Milliken v. Bradley 
and U.S. v. Virginia, take all steps necessary to erase 
that constitutional violation.

 The situation in the first hypothetical you 

gave me, there has never been an adjudicated 
constitutional violation.  It's a very different 
situation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But isn't it also a very 
different case if a condition of the transfer is that 
the transferee will preserve a memorial that has been 
designated in the statute as a five-foot-tall white 
cross.

 MR. ELIASBERG:  I think that is --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  So it is a condition of 

the transfer.

separates this situation from the kind of hypotheticals

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you disagree with 

what she told us, which is that the private property 
owner can tear down the cross at any time?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  I think that there are very 
significant obstacles to their doing that.  One, I don't 
-- I disagree with the General's -- General Kagan's 
description of the criminal statute that prohibits the 
defacement of memorials on private land, because one of 
the provisions is that we will consider it a situation 
that is covered by the statute that the land be under 
the jurisdiction of the Federal Government.  Well, the 
land -- the statute that designated the Mojave Preserve 
very clearly says that the land is being transferred 
from the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management 
to the National Park Service and the Secretary of the 
Interior, so it is therefore clearly under the 
jurisdiction of the Federal Government.  So I think that 
there is -- there are possible criminal violations. 
There is also a significant question --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You say under the 

jurisdiction of the Federal Government.  Does that -- do

you just mean they have authority to regulate the land?
 MR. ELIASBERG:  That's correct.  But that's 

the way the statute is written, under Federal 
jurisdiction, so I believe that those two terms --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I suppose they 

have jurisdiction to regulate a lot of -- lot of land 
that they don't own.

 MR. ELIASBERG:  Well I think that in this 

case when the government is actually -- there's quite a 
bit of case law -- we set forth some in our brief --
where they talk about the government's power over land 
that's within a national preserve, so I do think that 
the criminal statutes may very well apply.

 It certainly would be a barrier to the VFW's 

thinking, well, no risk to us if we tear this cross 
down.  In addition, the government is required, as I 
believe one of the Justices and I don't remember 
which -- the government has been required to go back and 
put up a plaque that says:  This cross erected in honor 
of the foreign war dead.  It would be very odd indeed, I 
believe for the VFW --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What else -- what 

else does the plaque say.

 MR. ELIASBERG:  The plaque says:  "This 
cross" -- in big letters -- "erected in honor of the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And that's it? 

Nothing else?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  Nothing else.  I think it 

would be very odd indeed for the VFW to feel that it was 
free to take down the cross and put up, for example, a 
statues of a soldier which would honor all of the people 
who fought for America in World War I, not just 
Christians, and say:  Well, we were free to do that 
because even though there's the sign that says, this 
cross is designated to honor all the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The cross doesn't honor 
non-Christians who fought in the war?  Is that -- is 
that --

MR. ELIASBERG:  I believe that's actually 

correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where does it say that?
 MR. ELIASBERG:  It doesn't say that, but a 
cross is the predominant symbol of Christianity and it 
signifies that Jesus is the son of God and died to 
redeem mankind for our sins, and I believe that's why 
the Jewish war veterans --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's erected as a war 

memorial.  I assume it is erected in honor of all of the 
war dead.  It's the -- the cross is the -- is the most

common symbol of -- of -- of the resting place of the 
dead, and it doesn't seem to me -- what would you have 
them erect?  A cross -- some conglomerate of a cross, a 
Star of David, and you know, a Moslem half moon and 
star?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  Well, Justice Scalia, if I 

may go to your first point.  The cross is the most 
common symbol of the resting place of Christians.  I 
have been in Jewish cemeteries.  There is never a cross 
on a tombstone of a Jew.
 (Laughter.)
 MR. ELIASBERG:  So it is the most common 

symbol to honor Christians.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think you can leap 
from that to the conclusion that the only war dead that 
that cross honors are the Christian war dead.  I think 
that's an outrageous conclusion.

 MR. ELIASBERG:  Well, my -- the point of 
my -- point here is to say that there is a reason the 
Jewish war veterans came in and said we don't feel 
honored by this cross.  This cross can't honor us 
because it is a religious symbol of another religion.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can I get back to 

your plaque question?  Am I wrong?  I think the 
government told us the plaque reads:  "The cross erected

of Veterans of Foreign Wars, Death Valley Post 2884."

 MR. ELIASBERG:  That is correct, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and I apologize.  I forgot --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's a big 

difference.  I mean, the whole point is that the plaque 
tells you, this is not a government memorial, government 
structure.  It was put up by members of the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars, Death Valley Post 2884.

 MR. ELIASBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, the 

context of your question was would VFW feel constrained 
to keep the cross up?  And my point was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The context of my 

question was what does the plaque say?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  Well -- I -- I apologize for 

not giving the full text, that was not my intention to 
-- to mislead the Court or to you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All right.
 MR. ELIASBERG:  My only point is that in 
that scenario, because did I believe we were talking 
about, is the VFW free to do this, and I was pointing to 
the criminal statute that I said I believe said that 
they couldn't -- wouldn't feel free to take this down. 
But second of all, that it would be odd indeed for them

this cross erected.  With all of the --

JUSTICE ALITO:  When the Solicitor General 
represents to us that the VFW will be perfectly free to 
modify this memorial in any way it chooses if they 
obtain title to this land, do you think that there's any 
realistic fear that they will be required to maintain 
this cross, even if they wish to -- to change it in some 
way?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  Well, I think that there is 
a real -- well, but -- but I don't think that the cases 
turn on whether a prosecutor says well, I promise you 
that we are not going to enforce the statute.  I think 
we have to look at the words of the statute and the 
words of the reversionary interest, and I think they 
both create significant doubt as to whether the VFW 
would feel free to turn this -- to take it down, in the 
same way that in a context where you are talking about 
pre-enforcement --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I thought your 

argument was that although there was going to be a 
formal transfer of title, as a practical matter, the 
government was still involved with the maintenance of 
the cross on this land.  And when the government says 
that that's not the case, I don't know why that doesn't 
cure the practical problem.

MR. ELIASBERG:  Well, that -- the -- the 

question of government -- continued government 
involvement with the land, I believe, continues, because 
of the reversionary interest and because of the 
designation as a national memorial.  Whatever the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I think -- I think 

General Kagan agreed that they -- the Veterans couldn't 
substitute some other memorial, if it's going to be a 
national monument it has to have the government's 
approval.  And the only one that has the government's 
approval is the cross.

 MR. ELIASBERG:  That is correct, Justice 

Ginsburg.  I don't want to speak for General Kagan but 
with respect to the question --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I -- I thought the 

government's position was it had to be maintained as a 
national war -- as a war memorial, but not that it had 
to be maintained as a cross.

 MR. ELIASBERG:  That is the government's 

position.  But Justice Ginsburg, your question is would 
something else they put up be a national memorial, and 
the answer is no.  Only Congress has the power to 
designate a national memorial.  Congress has chosen to 
designate this particular stand-alone Latin cross as a 
government -- as a national memorial.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the 

government's argument that suppose the government took 
down the cross, gave it back to the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars, sold them the land in exchange for land of equal 
value, and then the Veterans said, fine, the cross was 
ours to begin with.  Now the land is ours, so we just 
put it back.  If that would be consistent with the 
injunction?

 The government now has nothing to do with 
the cross.  It's all the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and 
it can't be regarded a sham because it was originally 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars who put it up, the 
government didn't put it up.

 MR. ELIASBERG:  I believe that that --

obviously not the facts presented by our case, Justice 
Ginsburg, but that likely would be consistent with the 
injunction, that's correct.  But it is not the scenario 
we have here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then we are talking about 
something that is rather formal rather than substantial. 
If -- if all the government would have to do is say, 
Congress, you didn't get it right.  You should have just 
made the land swap.  And then the government would take 
down the cross in compliance with the injunction, and 
then it goes right back the next day.

MR. ELIASBERG:  Well, I think if there -- if 

there were -- I think it's not just formalism, Your 
Honor, because one, the reversionary -- I am assuming 
that in your hypothetical the reversionary interest is 
gone.  That is continuing government ownership, future 
ownership in property, and one of the government's 
principal arguments is when we sell to it a private 
owner everyone presumes that the private owner is the 
speaker.

 But when the government maintains a 

substantial future property interest, they haven't sold 
the land.  They've sold part of their interest in the 
land.  So if you take away the reversionary interest and 
you remove the national memorial designation and then 
the VFW independently does choose to put up the cross, 
it's more than formalism.  It is the --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But there is also the 
point that I don't think you stressed, that if the 
reversionary interest was activated -- say they 
abandoned or destroyed it, the property would come back 
to the government.  And if I read the -- the designation 
of the national memorial statute correctly, the 
Department of Interior would have to rebuild the old 
cross and put it up.  There's an affirmative duty to 
replace the cross if there is a reversion.

MR. ELIASBERG:  I believe that that is 

correct, Justice Stevens, and that's an important point 
that is intertwined with the fact that the reversionary 
interest also continues the government's ownership in 
the land, when their whole position is, if we privatize 
it, as Justice Scalia pointed out, if it's just a 
private owner, then we don't associate this cross with 
the government.  We associate it with the private owner.
 But the government hasn't done that.  It has 

maintained an important ownership interest in the land 
through that reversionary interest.  If there are no 
further questions, I will --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this question: 
Do you think the issues in this case would be -- stay 
the same or different, if this whole scenario occurred 
on the Mall in -- right out in front of the 
Washington -- the Lincoln Memorial?

 Would the -- the issues be any different if 

it were not an isolated memorial in the desert?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  Context has always mattered 

to this Court in Establishment Clause cases.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  And which way would it 

cut, if it is different?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  Well, I do think that 

Washington is, certainly, a seat of power, and there is,

obviously, a close tie between something that is put on 
the National Mall in the seat of government, but I do 
think that the designation of a national memorial is 
also significant.

 So, even though this may be an area that is 
not nearly as populated as Washington, D.C., it is very 
significant that Congress has taken the step with this 
particular symbol, one of only 49 in the country, 
grouping it with other iconic statues and memorials in 
this country and tied it.

 So I don't think that the distinction, 

although it might have some bearing in the Court, in 
thinking of the context, I don't think it would change 
the result.

 Justice Kennedy, I want to go back to -- to 

one question you had asked earlier about the posture, 
and I just want to reiterate.  You, very clearly, said, 
when the government was saying, well, we didn't have a 
good reason to bring this to the Court, and that's why 
we didn't, I think your question recognized that the 
government had very good reasons.

 But -- but in addition, it's not really 

important, when you have a final judgment, why a party 
chooses not to try to take the last step of appeal on a 
final judgment, and that's the United States v.

Munsingwear case.

 The government chose not to make that step. 

The judgment was final, and there, certainly, is no 
basis for this Court to reopen the issues about whether 
Mr. Buono had standing in the first instance.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, wasn't -- isn't this 

very different from the situation in Toledo 
Steel because -- Scale, I'm sorry -- because, if the 
merits issue that was before the Ninth Circuit was, if 
not technically moot, nearly moot, by the time they 
reached it, because of the passage of the new statute.

 This wasn't -- they said it's not moot 
because this is simply the voluntary cessation of 
conduct that's been held to be unlawful, but that is 
typically applied in the situation where there is a 
legitimate fear that the -- the party that has been held 
to be violating the Constitution may simply return to 
its bad old ways, once the litigation is over.

 But, here, you have the intervening 

enactment of a statute by the Constitution -- by the 
Congress of the United States, and I think it would be 
quite far-fetched to presume that Congress is simply 
going to repeal the statute and go back to the way 
things were, once the litigation is over.

 So you have a merits issue that's not -- if

technically moot, nearly moot.  The real merits issue in 
the case is -- is expressly not decided by the Ninth 
Circuit.  They say, take that back to the district 
court.  And you say that the standing issue goes away 
because the government didn't appeal the standing issue 
at a time when the real merits issue in the case had not 
been decided.

 MR. ELIASBERG:  Well, two points, if I may, 
Justice Alito.  First, the first reason that the Ninth 
Circuit gave for why the case wasn't moot was not 
voluntary cessation.  The government conceded the land 
transfer could take up to two years to effectuate, so in 
the Ninth Circuit, that this case is far from moot.

 Two years is more than enough time to file 
the government to file the petition for certiorari and 
had a ruling, both on the merits of the land on -- the 
cross on government property, but more important, as a 
number of Justices had pointed out, the question of 
standing to bring an Establishment Clause case, the 
government always have an interest in saying, this case 
should never have been brought.  We never should had 
have had a judgment entered against us.

 For the government to say, we didn't really 

care at that point because, two years from now, the 
transfer might be effectuated is not basis for them to

argue that there was no final judgment and no reason for 
us to appeal.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I think General Kagan 

recognized that there isn't an example of a final 
injunction, where, after it's final as it can be, you 
can come back and say, but, now, I want to reargue the 
standing question that's already been determined.

 But there was something that I did want to 

ask you about, Judge O'Scanlon's opinion.  He said, 
if -- if you prevail and you are right, what happens in 
Arlington Cemetery, where there's the Argonne Cross 
Memorial and the Canadian Cross of Sacrifice, both right 
here in Arlington, what happens to them?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  Going back, Justice 

Ginsburg, to the merits on the earlier question about a 
cross on government property, I believe that the Argonne 
Cross in the national -- in memorial cemetery is 
extremely different.

 There are, in the national cemeteries, 

the -- the VA offers, to veterans and their family, a 
choice of putting up 39 different emblems and beliefs on 
their tombstones.  In Arlington, there is a cross that 
is surrounded by a sea of tombstones with symbols of the 
faith of all of the different service members.

 In that context, I don't think anyone would

perceive that the government was favoring one particular 
religion because of the variety of choices and religious 
symbols expressed there.  That's very different from a 
stand-alone cross of one religious symbol that is not 
surrounded by any other context, other than --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Has the government ever 

turned down -- let's say the Jewish war veterans request 
to put up a war memorial on --

MR. ELIASBERG:  They did.  There was a 

request made for -- to put up a memorial on the site, 
and the government said no and said, our regulations 
forbid it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I am talking about -- on 

this site?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You know, well, I'm not 

talking about this site, where there already was a 
memorial, but suppose the -- what I'm getting at is I 
don't agree with you, that -- that every time the 
government allows any religious symbol to be erected, it 
has to allow all religious symbols to be erected at the 
same place, so long as it is -- it is not discriminatory 
in -- in accepting or rejecting requests to erect 
religious symbols in different places.

of being discriminatory.

 MR. ELIASBERG:  I think the context here is 

what has the government done with respect to national 
memorials.  The only two national memorials that are 
stand-alone religious symbols are of one particular 
religious denomination, and that's Christianity.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But -- but you don't --
and they -- were both of them proposed by a private 
group, such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  Well, it's Congress -- I 

don't know that the Veterans of Foreign Wars ever 
proposed that this be a national memorial.  Congress 
designated it as one.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but it was erected by 

the Veterans of Foreign Wars.  I mean, do you know of 
any instance in which Jewish war veterans or if there is 
an organization of Muslim war veterans, requested to 
erect a memorial on public land, it was turned down?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  As I said before --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I just don't see why they 

all have to be on the same piece of land, in -- in order 
for the government to be impartial.

 MR. ELIASBERG:  I'm not saying that in --

in -- that, in every circumstance, the government has to 
have lots of different symbols, but what the government

has done here --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I think you are 

saying that, and you are saying that this has to be a 
public forum.  In fact, I'm not even sure your -- your 
brief would limit it to religious symbols.  You say it 
has to be an open forum.  Right?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  Well, Justice Scalia, if I 

make one prefatory point, the government didn't bring to 
this Court the merits of the question of whether the 
cross was permissible on government property.

 There is a final judgment set in this 

circumstance.  In this context, it is not.  So that 
question is not properly before us, but context matters, 
and I do think, in other circumstances, there may be 
religious symbols.  There may be a myriad of religious 
symbols and the context of the situation will matter.

 But I think if, in Arlington, for example --

with respect to Justice Ginsburg's question.  If, for 
example, a foreign government -- let's take the Canadian 
Cross of Sacrifice, which the government has put in its 
brief, was donated by a foreign government to honor 
people -- Americans who fought for Canada and the 
British Empire, in I believe it was World War I, if the 
State of Israel made a similar request to the United 
States, we would like to honor the Jews who fought in

Operation Iraqi Freedom because we believe that that was 
an important defense of the State of Israel, and the 
United States said, no, we are not interested, I think 
that that would create a quite significant 
constitutional violation -- or constitutional question, 
but it's not the case in front of us.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask a different 

question, just based on your understanding of all these 
monuments?  Are there any other federal monuments that 
contained crosses, other than those associated with the 
cemeteries?

 MR. ELIASBERG:  The one national memorial 
that I am aware of that has a cross, it is of Father 
Marquette, who was a significant historical figure.  It 
is not a stand-alone cross.  It is Father Marquette 
surrounded by a number of various objects that show his 
role as a historical figure, exploring the middle west, 
and he is holding a cross.

 But, again, I think -- I agree with General 
Kagan that, if we honored Martin Luther King, who was a 
priest, or we honored -- we did something with the Old 
North Church which had significant historical 
significance, that would create a very different issue 
than simply a stand-alone cross, where, when the 
National Park Service asked its own historian to

determine whether it had historical value necessary to 
bring it within the National Register of Historic 
Places, the Park Service's own historian said, no, it 
did not.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, this 

probably doesn't have anything to do with anything, but 
I'm just kind of curious, why is this cross put up --
you know, in the middle of nowhere?

 (Laughter. )
 MR. ELIASBERG:  Because the man who 

originally put up the cross -- not this one, because it 
has been replaced a number of times, but the man who put 
up this particular cross, I believe was a homesteader in 
the area when the land was owned by the Bureau of Land 
Management, and I believe was a miner on the land.  I 
hope that is correct historically.  I believe it is.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you.
 General, you have 2 minutes.
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELENA KAGAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 To pick up right there, this stand-alone 

cross was erected as a World War I memorial by veterans 
of World War I who had gone to the desert in California

to recuperate and to restore their lives.

 And it was that situation that the -- that 

the Congress was presented with, was when the Ninth 
Circuit ruled and said that this memorial was 
unconstitutional, Congress had a choice.  And the choice 
was to take down that memorial, which meant an enormous 
amount to veterans in the community, or to completely 
dissociate the government from that memorial.  And what 
Congress did was to completely dissociate the government 
from that memorial while allowing some war memorial to 
stand.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  How can you say that when 
there's a reversionary interest?  How can you say it's 
completely dissociated?  There is a reversionary 
interest if they don't maintain the cross, which is the 
monument, it goes back to the government.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Stevens, with 

respect, the reversionary interest says that the holder, 
the VFW, has to maintain a war memorial.  It does not --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, but the particular 

memorial described by Congress was this cross.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  No, the reversionary 

interest simply says:  A war memorial.  It does not have 
to be this war memorial.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, but then it doesn't

-- I don't think it's fair to interpret Congress's 
interest to being and preserving this memorial.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  To the contrary, Justice 

Stevens.  When Congress wanted to say "this memorial," 
it knew to how to say it, because it said it in the 2002 
act.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right.
 GENERAL KAGAN:  In the 2004 act, it said 

something very different.  That was after the injunction 
had issued, so it was a completely different set of 
circumstances.  Congress understood that an injunction 
against this war memorial had issued.  Congress said: 
We are going to give this back to the VFW, but it's 
going to be the VFW's choice now as to what to do with 
it, consistent with it being some kind of war memorial. 
A reversionary interest of a kind that Congress often 
uses to -- when it transfers land.  Congress -- it's a 
completely --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do you think anyone 

thought there is the remotest possibility they would put 
up a different memorial?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I think it's left to the 

VFW, and it's entirely the VFW's choice.  So if tomorrow 
or ten years from now or 50 years from now the VFW 
decides, along with Respondents, that a cross is an

inappropriate war memorial, then they can take down that 
war memorial.  It's no longer the government's message.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  How can they say it's an 
inappropriate war memorial when Congress has designated 
the national memorial as, quote, "the five-foot-tall 
white cross" and so forth and so on?  That is what is 
the memorial.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  But there is no -- there is 
no prohibition on the VFW taking down this memorial.  We 
will just have one fewer national memorials.  And --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do you really think there 

is any possibility that would happen?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Again, I think it is 

entirely up to the VFW.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  That is not my question.
 GENERAL KAGAN:  I don't know, because I am 
not the VFW.  It is up to the VFW as to what happens to 
this war memorial.  That's also true of the plaque, that 
the plaque could -- the VFW could take down the plaque 
once the -- the VFW gains title to this property.

 So what the government has done here -- and 
Justice Stevens, I don't want to -- of course, you are 
right that Congress started out thinking they --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  They not only started it 
out, but they authorized the use of $10,000 in money in

order to replace the very cross they had designated as a 
memorial.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Stevens, you are, of 

course, right that Congress thought at the beginning, 
prior to the injunction, that this war memorial should 
not be taken down, that there was an attachment to it in 
the local community, and that it was -- that it should 
be retained.  Not an unnatural thing for Congress to 
want, to preserve war memorials.

 When the injunction issued and when the 

court found that the -- when the Congress found that the 
courts had declared this display of this memorial 
unconstitutional, Congress said:  How can we preserve 
this -- preserve a war memorial, very possibly this war 
memorial?  How can we preserve a war memorial but have 
it not be our choice?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

Counsel, counsel.

 The case is submitted.
