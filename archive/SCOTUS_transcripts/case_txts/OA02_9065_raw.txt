CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 90 -- it's 02-9065, Shakur Muhammad, also known


as John Mease v. Mark Close.


Ms. Beckwith.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF CORINNE BECKWITH


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. BECKWITH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The petitioner in this case, Shakur Muhammad, is


a state prisoner who has brought a civil rights action


alleging that a prison guard framed him on a false


disciplinary charge in retaliation for his having 

exercised his constitutional right to seek redress in the


courts for this same prison guard's previous misconduct. 


For three reasons, this Court should not engraft onto this


type of Section 1983 claim a favorable termination


requirement that would make this prisoner have to win his


claim in another forum before he can seek his remedy in


Federal court.


First, the favorable termination requirement is


a habeas protecting advice - device - that was borne of


this Court's recognition that Congress would not have


wanted a general civil rights action to be the vehicle for


3

undoing a state criminal judgment, particularly given the


more specific habeas exhaustion requirement.


Second, extending the favorable termination


requirement beyond this original rationale lacks any basis


in the statute's terms or history, and it's devoid of the


kind of common law pedigree that might suggest Congress


envisioned a broader application to cases that do not look


like habeas cases in that they don't involve a direct or


an indirect challenge to the fact or duration of custody.


And finally, any remaining qualms about


Congress' intent are resolved by the Prison Litigation


Reform Act, where, after carefully weighing the interests


of overburdened courts and of prison officials, Congress


imposed an administrative exhaustion requirement, not a 

favorable termination requirement.


QUESTION: But I don't understand this about this


case.  I'm having an awfully hard time understanding this


case, and - and it seemed to me what had happened was that


the - your client, who's certainly well represented, he is


sitting there at lunch and he makes some faces or gestures


and the prison guard then has him up for a couple of


charges and he basically is acquitted of the more serious


one and they punish him for the more - less serious,


threatening behavior, no, it's insolence or something like


that.

 He never says a word about retaliation, never


says a word about it.  He never appeals, which he could


have done, his conviction.  He never says to the prison


authorities, hey, throw this out.  The whole thing was


based on the guard's desire to retaliate.  And now


suddenly have his - not having done any of that, we're in


Federal court, and the Federal magistrate says, you know,


he has no evidence of retaliation, or at least not enough.


And now we're up here arguing about Heck v.


Humphrey, sort of like the Finnegan's Wake of the habeas


corpus law, and I - I can't really understand how we even


got here.  I - I don't understand why, if you're right,


this isn't an unexhausted claim, or at least the


magistrate said you don't - your client, unfortunately for 

him, has not enough evidence.  How do we get into this?


QUESTION: Well, I suppose one of the reasons you


got into it was that the Sixth Circuit said that you had -


had to comply with Heck against Humphrey, and you didn't


agree with it.


MS. BECKWITH: Well, that's right, and you know,


this is undoubtedly a valid First Amendment retaliation


claim.  The idea here is our - our client is saying, you


know, he - he made perfectly appropriate allegations in


the courts against this prison - this prison guard in


prior lawsuits, and the guard set out to get him -

 QUESTION: Can we reach this - I can't reach the


Sixth - the question that the circuit thought was here.  I


don't see what we're supposed to say.  What are we


supposed to say?  That - that this unexhausted claim,


nonetheless, in 1983 states a claim?


MS. BECKWITH: It's not - I don't believe it's an


-


QUESTION: If I said what I said, is that correct


what I've said?


MS. BECKWITH: I don't think so, because it's not


an unexhausted claim, and I believe the whole point of


this case is the - is the misstatement of the law by the


Sixth Circuit that would deem this a non-civil rights


claim, basically a habeas claim completely contrary to 

this Court's precedent in Preiser.  We have, you know,


Preiser v. Rodriguez, which set up the way, you know,


followed up on by Heck v. Humphrey, the way that we decide


which way these cases should go.  Is this a civil rights


claim?  It should go through 1983.  Or is it something


we're worried might swallow the habeas exhaustion


requirement?


QUESTION: Well, does the Heck Humphrey issue


that comes to us one that is affected by whether good-


time credits are lost?


MS. BECKWITH: The - whether good-time credits

are lost is a - is a consideration and whether this is a


fact or duration case.


QUESTION: Right.


MS. BECKWITH: And this case is nothing about -


QUESTION: So after all the briefing, the


additional briefing that's gone on, do we know now for


sure whether good-time credits are affected here?


MS. BECKWITH: I think we do.  The most important


point on that question, Justice O'Connor, is something


that I - a point I unfortunately made in a footnote


instead of in the text, footnote 6 on page 5 of the yellow


brief, which I wish had been the first sentence of my


issue in bold, and that point is that it doesn't matter,


because we're not - no part of our constitutional claim 

challenges the insolence conviction.


QUESTION: But is - is that really the point? 


It's not what you challenge, it's the implication of what


you want to be held.


MS. BECKWITH: It - that's right.


QUESTION: And those are quite different things. 


I mean, if in fact good-time credits are lost, even though


you are not asking for any adjudication on good-time


credits, then it necessarily follows that the length of


the sentence can be affected, and it necessarily follows


that at some point there could be a habeas claim because

the individual was not being released.


MS. BECKWITH: That's right, but there's nothing


about this claim that would ever, you know, ever lead to


the result, under the test necessarily imply the


invalidity of the deprivation of good-time credits, which,


by the way, I don't believe we were deprived of good-time


credits, because of the reasons I state in my brief.  Our


client is a habitual offender and this claim was not


raised in the lower court but -


QUESTION: Well, let - let's - could we just make


a short excursus there?  Assuming that no good-time


credits are lost with respect to the minimum sentence, the


point of - determining the earliest point at which he


could be paroled, isn't it the case under state law that 

good-time credits still would be applied to the maximum


sentence?


MS. BECKWITH: That - that is true.  I don't


believe that would ever -


QUESTION: Then - then isn't that the end of your


argument -


MS. BECKWITH: I don't think so.


QUESTION:  - because doesn't it - I mean, let me


just finish -


MS. BECKWITH: Sure.


QUESTION: - my - my question so you know where

I'm going.  If - if - if the good-time credits would apply


to the maximum sentence, then it seems to me that if he is


not released at the point at which he says he should be


entitled to good-time credits, he's got a habeas claim.


MS. BECKWITH: I don't think that - I think that


that aspect of the claim, you know, aside from waiver and


aside from not challenging the conviction that led to the


good-time credits, if they exist, is still not true, I


don't think.  It - it's too hypothetical.  Most of these


cases are like Preiser, where there would be immediate


release.  He has to serve his minimum sentence under


Michigan law, so he's not ever going to get out earlier


than his minimum.  He - those will not be shortened by


good-time credits.


After that, he's going to see the parole board


several times.  He's going to be 103 years old when he


hits his maximum sentence.  The likelihood that he would


actually not be dismissed until his maximum sentence, you


know, be discharged as opposed to paroled earlier than


that and have his sentence terminated long before his


maximum, you know, just makes it impossible that this


would be anything but hypothetical -


QUESTION: Well, but for ease of judicial


administration, do we really want to have to look at how


old he's going to be and all of these things?  Is it not

possible to say at the end of the day, good-time credits


still apply to the maximum, so you're out of here?


MS. BECKWITH: Well, that may be true in another


case, but it's not true in our case, because we're not


challenging, you know, nothing about our constitutional


claim would necessarily imply the invalidity of that


insolence conviction.


QUESTION: Well, sticking with Justice O'Connor's


question, suppose good-time credits were involved here,


but insofar as the prisoner is concerned, it was wholly


peripheral, and assume that the good-time credits would


not click into operation for another 20 years.  Would it


make sense for us to insist on Heck v. Humphrey in those


circumstances?


MS. BECKWITH: In - I mean, I think that - that


Preiser created a clean line, and this Court has decided


repeatedly that good-time - the loss of good-time credits


falls on the fact or duration side of that line, and I


think it makes sense to continue to maintain that clean


line, and it's the kind of thing where good-time credits


are the hard case.  There's -


QUESTION: So you think it does - so you think


that if good-time credits were unequivocally involved


here, that the Heck rule would apply?


MS. BECKWITH: I don't - I - I think that's what

this Court's precedents would suggest.  There might be


room for reconsideration of the good-time credits in the


future when it - when it starts to get real hypothetical


or when there - if there might be some abuses, such as


prison, you know, evidence that prisons were, you know,


had the perverse incentive of tacking on good-time credits


to -


QUESTION: Well, this is - this is very strange


when we - when the original idea, I thought, of Heck was


typing the kind of claim.  I think the Court said in that


case, this is not a prison condition case like my dietary


law is not observed, am I not getting medical treatment,


but it - it is like - there was an analogy to malicious


prosecution, and here this has the same flavor, that this 

is - the complaint is that this guard had it in for me,


and there were trumped up charges.


And the way you get around - would you say


you're not really attacking the insolence, what he - he


was convicted, so you're only concerned with the six days


pre-hearing detention, but I don't see how you can, in all


candor, chop up your complaint that way, because if the


officer hadn't been retaliatory, the officer wouldn't have


confronted him in the first place, he wouldn't have been


insolent, and nothing would happen.  So how you can say


is, well, we'll accept the insolence but really we don't

because this is a retaliation and there never would have


been any charge at all.


MS. BECKWITH: Well, I - that's - part - along


the lines of the argument the respondent makes in trying


to use a - sort of a but-for kind of take, or test, or a


relevance kind of test, but that is not the test.  The


test is whether the claim, the constitutional claim, would


necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction or


sentence -


QUESTION: I - I thought your response to that


was that provocation was no defense to the charge -


MS. BECKWITH: That's right.


QUESTION: - to the charge of insolence.


MS. BECKWITH: The respondent is - is arguing 

that - that it goes to credibility.  Credibility is not


enough.  That's about relevance or admissibility.


QUESTION: But is not your position, and I don't


know that the other side has contested it, that


provocation would not have been a defense to the charge of


insolence?


MS. BECKWITH: That's right.  There's no -


QUESTION: And therefore, your provocation claim


does not invalidate the insolence conviction.


MS. BECKWITH: There's - there's - that's


correct, Justice Scalia.  There's no way of litigating -

 QUESTION: How - how do I decide that, because


that, it seems to me, is why I kept thinking I'm having


trouble with this case? 


MS. BECKWITH: Well -


QUESTION: It is inconceivable to me that under


any law of any place that if a guard has gone and brought


this whole thing about as a way of retaliating against a


First Amendment right, I can't imagine a tribunal that


wouldn't throw out the whole thing.  I mean, I know you


say, oh no, that isn't what they would have done.  If he


had gone to that disciplinary body and it said, look, I


have proof here that this is total fake by the guard in


retaliation for my First Amendment right, what that body


would have said is, we convict you still of insolence but 

not of the greater charge.


That to me is inconceivable, but whether that's


so or not is a pure matter of state law, and - and it


seems to me that this case then turns on a pure matter of


state law, because I think if it is totally separate maybe


you're right.  If it isn't totally separate, I don't see


how you could be right.


MS. BECKWITH: And it is.  I have several answer


that.  It is totally separate.  You - you can't litigate


the retaliation claim in - in a - in a prison misconduct


hearing, just as Rodney King couldn't -

 QUESTION: You couldn't - you couldn't say,


hearing examiner in the prison, I want to tell you


something.  The guard's doing this because I filed some


earlier claims against him.  What - what would be so hard


about doing that?


MS. BECKWITH: In fact, we actually - the hearing


officer himself, in his deposition, which is at joint


appendix 102 to 103, indicates he - he - retaliation was


not a defense.  It might go to credibility, but he can't


consider that -


QUESTION: No, but that's a - that's an issue of


fact.  And the thing that's bothering Justice Breyer is


the same thing that's bothering me, and that is it seems a


- it seems like a very strange statement of law to say 

that there would be no retaliation defense, and if - and


yet it seems to me you've got to say that in order to


avoid Heck and Humphrey.  So what's your basis for saying


it?  Do you have -


MS. BECKWITH: It's -


QUESTION: - any state law authority for saying


that so that we could make that assumption that you are


correct in your statement when we decide this case?


MS. BECKWITH: To tell you the truth, I just


assumed it as - as a logical matter.  It's like, as I was


saying before, Rodney -

 QUESTION: You assumed that in - in the - in the

disciplinary proceeding for insolence, he would not be -


the prisoner would not have the opportunity of saying, he


got me into this situation in retaliation for filing these


actions?  You just assumed that?


MS. BECKWITH: Right.  It's just like assault on


a police officer.  If you're arrested because you're black


and then you assault that police officer, you - you know,


your - your 1983 claim on the illegal arrest is not, you


know, it's - it's separate and apart from -


QUESTION: But we're talking here about


insolence.  I mean, he gave him a dirty look or something


or other.


MS. BECKWITH: The - the hearing officer himself


said that -


QUESTION: Well, is there any state law authority


that we could look to?


MS. BECKWITH: I'm not aware of any and I'm sorry


that I -


QUESTION: Well, it doesn't seem unreasonable to


me.  A police officer who's charged with a civil rights


violation for - for whacking a demonstrator cannot please


- plead as a defense, I was provoked.  Doesn't matter if


you're provoked, you're not supposed to do - do the act,

and I don't know why it would be any different with - with

QUESTION: But he doesn't admit that.


QUESTION: - to resist the provocation. 


MS. BECKWITH: And in any event -


QUESTION: What's so unreasonable about that?


MS. BECKWITH: - I think that what - whether we


challenge the - the misconduct - the result of the


misconduct proceeding in this case is really not relevant


because -


QUESTION: Well, his - his complaint doesn't say


the kind of thing you just said.  I think his complaint


says, I'm sitting there, the officer made some faces,


lured me into this whole thing, and then what he charged 

me with was false.  So I - I didn't see - it's what


Justice Ginsburg, I think, was talking about at the


beginning.  I'm just - maybe you have nothing else to say


on it, but I saw this being chopped up.  I saw one


incident, it being chopped up as if there were several


things, one insolence, one threatening behavior, and then


separating that out, and I got totally confused about the


Heck v. Humphrey part, the exhaustion part -


MS. BECKWITH: The - the complaint is very clear. 


I mean, the gist - the most tangible part of - of the


complaint is that I was overcharged, you know, and I had

to do pre-hearing detention, six days in pre-hearing


detention that I would not otherwise have had to do


because this guard was retaliating against me for suing


him, for exercising -


QUESTION: This is the amended complaint.  It was


not his original complaint, and one of the many puzzling


features in this case is the Sixth Circuit is addressing


the original complaint, where this man says, I want the


whole thing expunged, not that, yes, I was insolent, but I


wasn't engaged in threatening behavior.  The initial


complaint said, this officer retaliated against me, the


whole thing is no good, court, expunge the discipline. 


And it was only in the amended complaint that they came up


with this theory, oh, insolence was all right, and the 

only thing that we're attacking is the threatening


behavior.


MS. BECKWITH: Well, the two complaints are


actually very similar, maybe identical, except for the -


removing the request for expungement.  And, of course, the


Sixth Circuit's -


QUESTION: Well, isn't that a rather significant


difference, because that says the whole thing is no good,


the insolence is no better than the threatening, the whole


thing is no good?


MS. BECKWITH: Mr. Muhammad was - was not

represented by counsel.  He was - he was working pro se,


and he amended his complaint.  The amended complaint was


accepted and that's - that's the complaint that's - that's


before -


QUESTION: But that's not what - that isn't the


complaint that was before the Sixth Circuit, so at a


minimum, shouldn't we send it back to the Sixth Circuit -


MS. BECKWITH: No.


QUESTION: - and say, look, you looked at the


wrong complaint?


MS. BECKWITH: Well, it was the complaint that


was before the Sixth Circuit.  They just made a factual


error, and I think both parties agree it was a factual 

error, but it's one that didn't matter.


QUESTION: Nonetheless, they ruled on a complaint


that is not the one he was complaining about.


MS. BECKWITH: But - but it doesn't matter,


because they relied on Huey v. Stine and the case law in


the Sixth Circuit.  It wouldn't matter whether you asked


for expungement or not if you are challenging the result,


which the Sixth Circuit thought -


QUESTION: Excuse me.  All of this is relevant


why?  Because of the issue of whether he's lost any good-


time credit, isn't that right?

 MS. BECKWITH: I don't -


QUESTION: Wasn't that issue waived by the other


side and wasn't - wasn't there a finding?  As I understand


it, there was a finding by a - by the magistrate that


plaintiff is no longer in the more restrictive custody of


toplock or administrative segregation, nor in the more


extended custody that would still faced him had he lost


any good-time credit, and an issue was never made by the


other side as I understand it, nor before the Sixth


Circuit, that he had lost any - any good-time credit.  Am


I wrong in that?


MS. BECKWITH: That's absolutely right.  The


issue wasn't presented -


QUESTION: So it's waived. 


Why should we get 

into that here?


MS. BECKWITH: Right.  And if - but if -


QUESTION: Especially having granted cert on a -


on - on a significant question, to which that - that is -


is preliminary.


MS. BECKWITH: That's correct, Justice Scalia,


and if good-time credits are not at issue, it doesn't


matter if we're challenging the insolence conviction,


because nothing about this claim is going to affect the


fact or duration of - of confinement, so that, you know -

 QUESTION: Though the state does dispute you on


the good-time credit, does it not?


MS. BECKWITH: The state does dispute.  You know,


I think they're wrong for four reasons.


QUESTION: But too late, but too late.  Isn't


that your point?  They dispute you, but too late.


MS. BECKWITH: That is my point.  I mean, that is


my best point.  My second best point -


QUESTION: Okay.  If you're right on that point,


then it's the easiest case ever, you're obviously right. 


If it has nothing to do with good-time credit -


MS. BECKWITH: Well -


QUESTION:  - if you can chop up the - the action


in that way, if all you're complaining about is six days 

that he spent in pre-trial detention and your winning on


that would have nothing to do with anything else, would


not set aside the rest of the - of the loss of good time


or anything else, then you're obviously right.


MS. BECKWITH: That's right.


QUESTION: That's what she says.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION: Why is it an issue for us?


MS. BECKWITH: I agree.  It's an issue because


the respondent is trying to push the test of, you know, of


Heck v. Humphrey into the context of misconduct

proceedings, regardless of the punishment imposed.  They


say even -


QUESTION: You don't - you don't say that Heck


against Humphrey should never apply to misconduct


proceedings, do you?


MS. BECKWITH: No.


QUESTION: You just say it shouldn't have -


MS. BECKWITH: As in Edwards, it should


definitely apply when good-time credits are lost or


something else happens, you know, in the proceeding.  I


can't imagine what besides good-time credits, but if fact


or duration is affected - in this case, fact or duration


was not affected.  This is a classic civil rights claim. 


We're talking about the First Amendment.  It could have


been about religion.  It could have been about race.


QUESTION: Know what is very strange about this


case is you've got these two threshold requirements.  If


it's a habeas line, then you can't skirt exhausting state


judicial remedies.  If it's a prison condition case, then


you have the PLRA, you have to exhaust the internal


remedies.  Here, you didn't do either.  I mean, if you


take it on your case, this is really in the prison


conditions line.  You didn't even appeal internally.


MS. BECKWITH: But that's - that's not at issue


in this case.  The - the respondent complained in the

courts below about exhaustion.  It was considered by the


lower court.  The respondent said, you didn't seek


rehearing, and the magistrate judge said, I disagree with


you, he didn't have to seek rehearing because he's not


complaining about the insolence -


QUESTION: But, nonetheless, you are saying that


this is a case that can go into court under 1983 even


though there was - it's not on the habeas side so you


don't have to exhaust the judicial remedies.  It's not on


the prison conditions side and you don't have to - you


don't have to exhaust internal administrative remedies.


MS. BECKWITH: Justice Ginsburg, I absolutely


disagree.  He did exhaust.  This was a question -


QUESTION: What did he exhaust?


MS. BECKWITH: He - he did everything he needed


to do.  The magistrate judge held that and the district


judge affirmed that and it wasn't appealed -


QUESTION: Where?  Because it seems to me that he


didn't.  He didn't ask for anything.


MS. BECKWITH: In -


QUESTION: He said - and he said, indeed, I'm not


challenging, I'm not challenging the insolence conviction.


MS. BECKWITH: Record 68, the district court


record in 68, unfortunately it's not in the joint appendix


at - at 8 to 9 - pages 8 to 9, the magistrate held that

Mr. Muhammad exhausted, without seeking rehearing he


exhausted.  And there was also a -


QUESTION: But can you tell me exactly what that


was, because I don't see how he - he had?


MS. BECKWITH: Well, the -


QUESTION: He might have said he didn't need to


exhaust.


MS. BECKWITH: No, the - the - the government


filed a brief, a motion to dismiss, saying, you know, many


things, but one of the things was he didn't exhaust his


administrative remedies and they said because he didn't


seek rehearing, respondent, or the - Mr. Muhammad


responded, I didn't have to seek rehearing because I'm not


complaining about the insolence. 


I agree I'm guilty of 

insolence.  And the magistrate agreed.  That's the end of


exhaustion.


QUESTION: Exactly.  But did he exhaust


administrative remedies for what he's complaining about


here, which is -


MS. BECKWITH: Right.  There was no -


QUESTION: - which is not the insolence


conviction, but rather the sixth - the six day lockdown or


whatever he had pending the hearing on the higher charge.


MS. BECKWITH: As far as we know, he exhausted


everything that he needed to exhaust.

 QUESTION:  Well, how - how could that be,


because -


MS. BECKWITH: The government -


QUESTION: I know they said that, and that's one


of the reasons I'm having difficulty.  You would have


thought that if he was retaliated against, he would have


said to the hearing examiner, I was retaliated against me,


the whole thing is no good, I had six days that I spent,


at least deduct the six days from the seven days


additional punishment you're giving me.  He didn't say


that.  Nobody knew a thing about it.  He didn't ask for a


rehearing.  He didn't ask a judge - I mean -


MS. BECKWITH: I -


QUESTION: - what I'm worried about is writing an 

opinion in this that says you're completely right, and in


the course of doing that by every assumption I have to


make, so mixing up the law that nobody can understand what


it is.


MS. BECKWITH: I understand.  There - there's no


doubt that the PLRA requires exhaustion of administrative


remedies.  It's not at issue in this case.  It's not


jurisdictional.  Every circuit court to consider the issue


has said it's not jurisdictional. The government raised


the - the question.  The lower court considered it.  They


- they ruled in our favor.  It's not a part of this case

anymore.


QUESTION: Was it raised on appeal?


MS. BECKWITH: It was not raised on appeal.


QUESTION: Was it raised in the brief in


opposition?


MS. BECKWITH: In - in cert?


QUESTION: To the petition for cert?


MS. BECKWITH: No.


QUESTION: Not the state, from the district court


or the court of appeals?


MS. BECKWITH: That's right, but it was not part


of - of the government's response, failure to exhaust.  It


was decided in the lower court.  It's - it's over.


QUESTION: Is - is it clear that the wrong of 

which he's complain - complains - is one of the wrongs set


forth in the Prison Litigation Reform Act, or is this - is


this some -


MS. BECKWITH: Yes.  And in fact, that - that's


one of our arguments that the Prison Litigation Reform Act


reaffirms the - the clean line that was created in


Preiser.  You have fact or duration claims and you have


conditions claims, Prison Litigation Reform Act, in - in


creating an exhaust - an administrative exhaustion


requirement for conditions claims, you know, indicates


that this is the kind of claim that needs to exhaust.

 QUESTION: If he had been charged initially just


with insolence instead of threatening behavior, that is


bondable, but that doesn't mean that he would have been


bonded, right?  That's a discretionary determination.


MS. BECKWITH: That's right.


QUESTION: So it might have been the very same


thing.  The officer might have said, this is a bad guy,


don't let him out until after the hearing.  So, in one


case, he can't get out because it's mandatory pre-trial


detention.  In the other - so this case is not about he


had a right to be free, or free in the prison population


those six days, but he could have argued that he should


have been not locked up.  Is that's what the - that's the


whole thing that this case is about, right?


MS. BECKWITH: I mean, his - his claim is a First


Amendment retaliation claim.  The damages are this, you


know, the chilling effect, the six days of pre-hearing


detention, but that's just a remedial question.  The claim


is a valid one.


QUESTION: I thought he's suing for damages and


that's the only thing he's suing for, not injunctive,


nothing else.  All he wants is money.


MS. BECKWITH: That's right.  That's right.


QUESTION: And what he wants money is for the six


days that he might have spent anyway.

 MS. BECKWITH: He wouldn't have spent it anyway,


and you can see from the joint appendix at page 58, credit


was not given -


QUESTION: No, I'm not talking about - it's


bondable.  There's nothing that shows that if the charge


had simply been insolence they wouldn't have held him for


the six days.  He wasn't entitled not to be held.


MS. BECKWITH: That's purely speculative and a


matter of remedy, not - not the right.  Mr. Chief Justice,


if I may reserve the balance of my time.


QUESTION: Very well, Ms. Beckwith.


Mr. Casey, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. CASEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


I agree this is a very confusing case.  We


believe there are several reasons why summary judgment


should be affirmed.  The first is that because Mr.


Muhammad did lose good-time credits, and because the


nature of his challenge necessarily implies the invalidity


of his misconduct determination, we think this case is


controlled by Edwards v. Balisok.


QUESTION: Why didn't you waive the question of


good-time credits?  I mean, why - you - you heard the

discussion before.


MR. CASEY: Yes.


QUESTION: Why - why is this something we should


consider?


MR. CASEY: First of all, we believe it's - it's


a matter of straightforward statutory - not even


interpretation, just reading the text of the Michigan


statutes on good time, so it's not some fact issue that -


that can be waived.  Secondly -


QUESTION: Excuse me?  Only fact issues can be -


legal issues can't be waived?


MR. CASEY: No, it's not a legal argument.  This


is a straightforward - a straightforward application of


the statutory language that says he did lose good time. 

QUESTION: You did not - did you make the point


below that the other side has to lose because he lost


good-time credit?


MR. CASEY: In our first motion for summary


judgment, which was in 1998, we argued that Heck and


Edwards controlled the case, that he was in effect


challenging his good - or his misconduct hearing


determination.  The magistrate of the district court


denied that motion, saying he is not challenging his


misconduct.  They agreed with his theory that this was a


stand-alone retaliation case.  So nobody - neither party

nor the district court nor the Sixth Circuit got into the


fine points of the argument about whether this was a


duration case or a conditions case.


QUESTION: Then why isn't it waived?


MR. CASEY: Well, we submit it's - it's a


straightforward matter.  It appears that the magistrate,


in his opinion or his recommendation denying our motion


for summary judgment, was under the impression he did not


lose good time.


QUESTION: Okay.  And let's assume the magistrate


was wrong.  As I understand it, you did not go to the


district court and say, the magistrate is wrong on this


point and this point can be dispositive under Heck.  Am I


correct?


MR. CASEY: We did not argue it in those terms. 


We argued, as I say, the broader application of Heck and


Edwards to the effect that he was - the nature of his


challenge necessarily implied that his -


QUESTION: But your position - your position as I


understand was that even if he did not lose any good-time


credits, that you - nevertheless, Heck controls.


MR. CASEY: Yes.


QUESTION: And that's the question -


QUESTION: And that's what -


QUESTION: - on which we granted certiorari.

That's the question we - whether a plaintiff who wishes to


bring a 1983 suit challenging only the conditions rather


than the fact or duration of his confinement must satisfy


Heck v. Humphrey.  Now, that question is not in the case,


if indeed the duration of his confinement is what is


affected.  And did you respond in the brief in opposition


by saying, actually, this question is not even in the


case?


MR. CASEY: Yes.  We -


QUESTION: But even if you did, it's not in the


case, none of it's in the case on the assumption your


colleague there was making, or your opponent.  Imagine


that Mr. Muhammad wins his claim in the 1983 action, which


the fact that they thought didn't have enough evidence 

suggests he wouldn't, but suppose he did.  Then he says,


what I've showed was illegal under the Constitution or


whatever, was, by being put in confinement for six days


before my hearing, and my being charged with threatening


behavior, that's it, that's all.  The rest of it is all


beside the point.  I don't complain about my insolence.  I


don't complain about the seven days.  I don't complain


about the loss of good time.  I don't complain about


anything except the six pre-hearing days and the later


dropped charge of threatening.


So, if he's right about that, if you can do

that, if in fact his winning on that in no way calls into


question the conviction or the loss of good time or the


seven later days for insolence, then under Heck, of course


he can bring it.


MR. CASEY: Yes, that - that's correct.  Heck -


the favorable termination requirement of Heck only applies


when the nature of the challenge necessarily implies -


QUESTION: Fine.  So now I've got to the point


that either she's obviously right or you're obviously


right, and what it depends upon is a matter of state law,


which is whether, as a matter of state law, should he win


this claim, it is true that his showing the retaliation in


respect to the six previous days and threatening in no way


calls into question the validity of the insolence 

conviction, the seven days, and the loss of good time.  So


I say, what is the answer to that question of state law? 


Or a sister concluded - it's fairly obvious under the law


that they are separate.  Now what do you conclude?


MR. CASEY: We argue that they are not separate,


that the nature of this challenge does in fact necessarily


imply the invalidity of his misconduct determination. 


What he's challenging in this Federal lawsuit is


retaliatory disciplinary action.  That - that's the


language that he used in his amended complaint.  What he's


saying is that the guard acted with an improper motive and

that these adverse consequences flowed from that.  The


only adverse consequences that he's alleging are involved


in the misconduct hearing.  So we don't think that the


fact that he was found guilty of insolence and not


threatening behavior has any bearing at all on this


question.  It was one incident, one charge that this


particular hearing officer felt should be reduced to a


lower charge, but the nature of his challenge, if - if Mr.


Muhammad is correct that this guard acted


unconstitutionally, there should not have been any


misconduct charges, should not have been a hearing, should


not have been any pre-hearing detention or post-hearing


punishment.


QUESTION: Is - is - is that so? 


You - you think 

it, as a matter of constitutional law, you - you could not


- you could not say that a prisoner has no right to


threaten a guard even if he - even if he claims to have


been provoked or has no right to insolent behavior even if


he claims to have been provoked?  As a matter of


constitutional law, the prison cannot have such rules?


MR. CASEY: The Heck v. Humphrey analysis says


that there were certain claims that are not cognizable on


a money damage action under 1983.  Our argument is this is


such a claim.  If a punishment imposed affects the


duration of confinement, the loss of good time, then under

Edwards v. Balisok, termination requires -


QUESTION: I'm saying it - it does not affect it


if he would have been convicted anyway, and the contention


of the other side is that he was guilty of the offense,


both the major offense, if he had been guilty of that, and


the minor offense, regardless of whether there was


provocation on the part of the guard.


MR. CASEY: Correct.  That - that's his claim. 


Our argument is that -


QUESTION: Well, why - why do you - why do you


assert the opposite?


MR. CASEY: Well, that - that implicates the


elements of the common law tort of malicious prosecution,


as discussed in Heck and Edwards, and those elements 

include favorable termination and probable cause.


QUESTION: But I think what you're not - it isn't


the issue of whether provocation is a defense to a charge


of insolence.  I thought what you were saying is that this


whole string never would have happened, nothing would have


happened.  If he - if he establishes the retaliation, then


none of this would have happened, and it's just one


episode.


MR. CASEY: Well, if - if he's correct that this


retaliation is independent of the hearing process, that's


- that's his argument.  Our argument is that the only

thing he's complaining about is the retaliatory action,


and the retaliatory action was charging him with


misconduct.  He -


QUESTION: Is not - not retaliation separate in


the hearing process.  You're saying, is his point that


when the guard looked at him from outside the cafeteria


and made faces at him, and then he came in, and then the


prisoner stands up and gives him some very dirty looks,


according to the guard.  Now, if you can separate out


there the retaliation, if you can separate out there what


the guard did by way of retaliation, making some very bad


faces through the window, and insolence under state law,


which would exist even if the guard were badly motivated


in making the bad faces, then you've got your two separate 

things.


MR. CASEY: Under Sixth Circuit law, to establish


a claim for retaliation, there has to be protective


conduct that the inmate engaged in and there has to be


adverse action taken against that plaintiff that would


deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to


engage -


QUESTION: Fine.  And the - and the conduct -


MR. CASEY: But that's -


QUESTION: - of the prisoner that's retaliation


is that - that - has to do with that -

 MR. CASEY: No, conduct of the guard.


QUESTION:  - would be his threatening look, but


not his insolent look.


MR. CASEY: If this situation had proceeded


exactly as petitioner alleges up to the point where they


were nose to nose for a few seconds and then they had both


walked away, there would be no retaliation claim, there


would be no constitutional violation at all.  The only


thing that gives rise to a constitutional right is the


adverse action of charging him with misconduct.  That's


why we say that this charge is necessarily implicated in


the hearing process.  It necessary - necessarily


implicates that his misconduct determination is invalid. 


If he's right that there should have been no 

charge at all, if he's right on that, then the Heck v.


Humphrey analysis doesn't even come into play.  We think


he's wrong on that.  The - the district court felt he was


right on that and - and ruled against us on our Heck v.


Humphrey motion.  The Sixth Circuit in effect said we were


right on that, that the nature of this challenge does


implicate the hearing process, and under Sixth Circuit


precedent, they said, therefore, it falls.


QUESTION: But the Sixth Circuit was addressing a


complaint that looked like it was attacking the whole


thing, because it asked for expungement of the

disciplinary - of the disciplinary action.  Why didn't you


call to the - or whoever was representing Michigan at that


stage - call to the attention of the Sixth Circuit that it


had addressed the wrong complaint?


MR. CASEY: The Sixth Circuit issued its order. 


The petitioner filed a motion for rehearing.  Under the


court rules, we're not permitted to respond to that, but


our argument is that even though the Sixth Circuit -


QUESTION: You could have made a motion to remand


or something.


MR. CASEY: We could have, but we did not.  In


retrospect, I wish many things had been done differently


in this case.


QUESTION: Well, do you aggrieve, looking at the 

Sixth Circuit opinion, that it was examining the original


complaint, not the amended complaint?


MR. CASEY: It referred to the original


complaint, but the - the holding of the Sixth Circuit on


page 106 of the joint appendix, they say in an earlier


Sixth Circuit case, and they quote it, in order to grant


the plaintiff in this case the release he - relief he


seeks, we would have to unwind the judgment of the state


agency.  That is the basis on which they affirmed the


judgment.


QUESTION: I thought you agreed that the Sixth

Circuit was looking at the initial, original complaint,


not the amended.


MR. CASEY: That they - they mentioned the


initial complaint and not the amended complaint.  That's


correct.


QUESTION: Yeah.


MR. CASEY: But we believe that the rationale


that they used, that his challenge did implicate the


validity of his misconduct hearing, is correct on both his


original complaint and his amended complaint.


QUESTION: May I ask you a hypothetical question? 


Assume we had the case with the same facts except the


remedy a different - if the, say the prison authorities


had said you can't use your television set for 30 days and 

that was the only remedy and otherwise everything else was


the same, and he said it was - they did that in


retaliation because I exercised my First Amendment rights. 


If that were the discipline, would Heck v. Humphrey


preclude relief in this case?


MR. CASEY: Yes, we believe - that's the question


the Court granted cert on.  If a punishment affects only


conditions -


QUESTION: And that's the one we probably ought


to hear some argument about.


MR. CASEY: That's - that's correct.  I - I

agree, Your Honor.  We argue that -


QUESTION: And why would it preclude relief in


that case?  That's what I'd be interested in hearing.


MR. CASEY: Because as in the Edwards v. Balisok


and - and Heck v. Humphrey, the proper method of analysis


is to look to the most closely analogous common law tort,


look to traditions of common law, public policy


considerations in light of the purposes of Section 1983. 


In Heck v. Humphrey and Edwards v. Balisok, the Court


said, in the prison context - prison disciplinary context,


the favorable termination requirement applies.  On the


facts of those cases, there was good time involved, so


duration -


QUESTION: More than the facts of the case, we -

the reason we - we - we adopted that common law rule was


to prevent a collision between 1983 and habeas corpus law


and prevent 1983 from being used as an end-run around


habeas corpus limitations.


MR. CASEY: Again, on - on the facts of the case,


that's - that was the situation presented, because in that


case there was a collision between the habeas statutes and


the 1983 -


QUESTION: And that collision was - was in the


reasoning of the Court.  It isn't -


MR. CASEY: Yes, it was.  But additional

reasoning was based on common law traditions and we argue


that that same rationale applies even if good time is not


involved, even if it's just conditions of confinement as


punishment.


QUESTION: So that even if setting a - a ruling


in favor of the plaintiff would not in any way call into


question the prison disciplinary proceeding, it still


should - Heck should still apply?


MR. CASEY: No.  If - if the nature of the


challenge does not imply that the misconduct determination


is invalid, then the Heck v. Humphrey analysis doesn't


apply.  It's not analogous to the common law tort of


malicious prosecution.  We don't assert that the favorable


termination requirement applies to all conditions cases. 

We say it only applies when a claim for money damages is


attempted which - the nature of which necessarily implies


that the misconduct hearing is invalid.


QUESTION: Well, it looked like the Sixth Circuit


is on the short side of a five-to-one split among the


courts of appeals on how Heck v. Humphrey is to be


applied, that the Sixth Circuit views it differently than


the other circuits that have addressed it.


MR. CASEY: I believe that's correct.


QUESTION: Do you agree?


MR. CASEY: I believe that's correct.

 QUESTION: Yeah, based on -


QUESTION: How - how is -


QUESTION: - its own Huey decision, and I really


thought very likely that was why this Court granted cert


here, to see whether the Sixth Circuit rule is out of step


with what we said in Heck v. Humphrey.


MR. CASEY: The Sixth Circuit, and all of the


court of appeals' decisions that have attempted to apply


the Heck v. Humphrey analysis to conditions cases, are


necessarily involved in - in extension of the Heck


rationale to this other factual context, because Heck and


Edwards involved good-time losses.  I agree that's - we


assume that's why the Court took the case.  When we filed


our brief in opposition, we suggested that there are these 

alternative reasons why the Court should not grant cert. 


One of them was the loss - that he did in fact lose good


time, but -


QUESTION: But, of course, that conceivably was


waived, because you didn't get into it below.  If we - if


we disregard that and think that you waived this issue of


good-time credits, and if we reach the merits on which I


assumed we granted the case, then what justifies the Sixth


Circuit rule?  Do you say just because damages potentially


are at issue that the 1983 claim can't go forward?


MR. CASEY: A - a claim for damages cannot go

forward unless there's favorable termination.  If his


claim was for an injunction changing the hearing


procedures somehow, as in Edwards, that type of claim


could go forward.


QUESTION: I don't see the difference in the


Sixth Circuit rule anymore.  What - in what respect is it


in the minority?  I thought you were reading now, as I


heard you, the last or the next to last sentence in the


opinion -


MR. CASEY: That's - that's correct.


QUESTION: - that the Sixth Circuit simply


thought that if this individual wins, if Mr. Muhammad


wins, they would have to unwind the entire judgment of the


hearing, which would include the judgment having to do 

with insolence.


MR. CASEY: That's correct.


QUESTION: And so if that's what they base it on


-


MR. CASEY: That's correct.


QUESTION: - is their rule different from that of


any other circuit?


MR. CASEY: The way the Sixth Circuit is


different from most of the other circuits is that they


apply the Heck v. Humphrey analysis to punishments of


conditions and not just to punishments affecting the

duration of confinement.


QUESTION: What is the condition -


QUESTION: They meaning the Sixth Circuit?


MR. CASEY: The Sixth Circuit applies it to


conditions, punishments, and duration punishments.


MR. CASEY: What do you mean by a conditions


punishment?


QUESTION: The - the punishments that Mr.


Muhammad received were the loss of good time, confinement


to administrative segregation, essentially remaining in


his cell, plus loss of privileges for 30 days. So only the


loss of good time affects the duration of his sentence -


QUESTION: Thus, only the loss of good time could


have been challenged in habeas?


MR. CASEY: Correct.


QUESTION: And the conditions couldn't have been


challenged in habeas?


MR. CASEY: Correct.


QUESTION: And that's the distinction -


MR. CASEY: The distinction in this case -


QUESTION: - that the other circuits think is


crucial?


MR. CASEY: Correct.  In - in conditions


challenges, habeas corpus relief is not available, so


there will be no other Federal court remedy if a Federal

civil rights action is not available.


QUESTION: And it - it's your position that there


should be no remedy whatever for this person?


MR. CASEY: It's our position that if he is -


QUESTION: If - if - we're disregarding the good-


time credits.  That's waived, that's out of here.  Let's


just make that assumption.  And you say that he's out of


luck on pursuing any remedy for anything else?


MR. CASEY: Prisoners who seek to challenge the


nature of their complaint seeks to challenge or call into


- whose challenges necessarily imply that a prison


misconduct is invalid, do not have a Federal Civil Rights


Act cause of action, whether it - whether the punishment -


QUESTION: And other circuits disagree.  They say


that in this case it would relate to conditions, and


therefore, the 1983 suit could go forward.


MR. CASEY: Correct.


QUESTION: That's the difference?


MR. CASEY: Correct.  And the difference was


created because the majority in Heck based much of its


decision on a rationale of the common law.  A concurring


opinion in that case, signed by four justices, said, no,


we're not going to base it on that rationale because that


might mean that there would be no Civil Rights Act remedy

in any such case.  Subsequently, in the Spencer v. Kemna,


one of the judges who - or justices - who had been in the


majority changed her mind and is now agreeing with the


rationale of the concurring opinion in Heck.  So that's


why the Sixth Circuit, or that's why the courts of appeals


are split on this.  On the facts of Edwards and Heck it


involved just duration claims, but depending on the


rationale for the rule, it may or may not apply to


conditions cases. We say it does apply to conditions cases


because -


QUESTION: And the condition here - and one thing


is the abstract level on which you're speaking, the other


is concretely what this case is about.  This case is about


six days spent in pre-hearing detention. 


It's the only 

thing that money is sought for.  Now, we're told that


insolence is bondable, threatening behavior is not.  Does


bondable mean it will be bond?  What is the incidence? 


What practically is the effect?


MR. CASEY: Some - some major misconducts are


mandatory non-bondable.  Threatening behavior, the


original charge, was mandatory -


QUESTION: So insolence is not mandatory. What is


the practice in the prison? Is it common to let people -


MR. CASEY: On - on page 14 of the joint appendix


we've quoted from the policy directive, and the standard

is, if there is a reasonable showing that failure to do so


would constitute a threat to the security or good order of


the facility, so on a case-by-case basis, a prisoner


charged with a bondable major misconduct could be placed


in pre-hearing detention.


QUESTION: Well, when you say bondable, I mean,


you don't mean if a person posts a bond they're out on the


street?


MR. CASEY: No, no.  That - that's the phrase


used in these prison directives.


QUESTION: But that's what this case is about,


those six days when he was in administrative detention.


MR. CASEY: Those are the six days for which he


is seeking damages.


QUESTION: And - and do you have, rather than


being in the general prison population, do you have any


statistical indication of - on charges of insolence, are


people more often than not, or is it rare that they would


be in administrative detention awaiting the hearing?


MR. CASEY: I - I don't have the statistics of -


the Department of Corrections probably could compile


that, but I don't know.  I do know that there were last


year more than 72,000 major misconduct hearings of all


kinds, bondable and non-bondable.  I do not know how many


of those 72,000 resulted in pre-hearing detention.

 QUESTION: But was - was this argument raised


below that there's no cause of action because there's no


assurance that he wouldn't have been kept for six days


anyway, even if it was bondable?  You - you didn't defend


on that ground, did you?


MR. CASEY: It was not argued in those terms, no. 


As I said, the case was argued -


QUESTION: Why do we want to get into that?  I -


I don't understand.


MR. CASEY: No.  We did not argue the - the terms


of the bond versus non-bondable, because it simply didn't


come up.


QUESTION: So suppose now - I think Justice


O'Connor may be causing the light to dawn in my head -

suppose you're right, suppose that there is just one ball


of wax.  Suppose the - this is all a waste of time trying


to separate those two things.  There's just one thing. 


There's a conviction, all right?


MR. CASEY: Correct.


QUESTION: Now, we look to see what happens if he


wins.  If he wins, we set aside the whole conviction, but


good time is out of it.  And since good time is out of it,


of course he can bring a 1983 action, because this wasn't


the kind of thing that habeas was designed for.  Habeas


was about duration of - of staying in prison, and with

good time out of it, it doesn't matter whether it's one


ball of wax or two.  He can go in on 1983 since there's no


conflict with the habeas statute.  What's your response to


that?


MR. CASEY: Our response to that in - in - in


response to the question that the Court granted certiorari


on is that even if good time was not at issue in the case,


if the only punishment he received affected the conditions


of confinement, our argument is, it's still appropriate to


look to the traditions of the common law and public policy


considerations to determine whether a cause of action in


those circumstances is cognizable in 1983.  We've argued


that it is not cognizable.  If he is challenging the


validity of his misconduct determination, that's analogous 

to the common law tort of malicious prosecution.


The elements of that tort require favorable


termination before it can succeed.  We believe that - that


same element applies in a 1983 case.  So if he does not


get favorable termination of his prison misconduct, he


cannot bring a suit for damages under 1983.


QUESTION: It is essential to your argument, is


it not, that provocation would be a defense?


MR. CASEY: No.


QUESTION: No?


MR. CASEY: Whatever - whatever charge -

 QUESTION: If provocation would - would not be a


defense, then even if he establishes provocation, for


which he can get damages, he would not be impairing the


judgment against him.


MR. CASEY: One of the elements of the


constitutional cause of action for retaliation is adverse


action against the prisoner because of his protected


conduct.  The adverse action in this case is not the


staring down and the nose-to-nose confrontation.  The


adverse action is charging misconduct, and we say, if he's


right in his complaint that there would not have been a


misconduct charge but for this action, that necessarily


implies that the misconduct proceeding is invalid, and


that triggers the analogy to malicious prosecution and its 

element of favorable termination.


QUESTION: So that you say basically, the


importance of Heck and Humphrey here is the way it says


you ought to refer to common law analogies in analyzing


whether there ought to be a 1983 action, and that has


nothing to do in the final analysis with whether there's a


collision between habeas corpus and 1983.  That is an -


that is an independent requirement of the way you go about


analyzing 1983 actions.


MR. CASEY: Yes, that's correct.


QUESTION: So that even though there isn't a

habeas corpus problem, you still go through the same


methodology?


MR. CASEY: Correct.  You say the same


methodology applies whether it's just conditions or


duration of confinement.  If it's a -


QUESTION: Are you essentially making an


exhaustion of - of state remedies then?  It seems to me -


are you - you're not saying that this person would have


no complaint, no Federal complaint, not in habeas, not in


1983?  Are you saying that -


MR. CASEY: Yes.


QUESTION: - or are you saying 1983 is premature?


MR. CASEY: If he gets favorable termination.  We


say -


QUESTION: Where does he get the favorable


determination?


MR. CASEY: The - if he got favorable termination


by review of the misconduct - if he - if he had won at the


misconduct or if he had appealed and won on appeal, that


would be favorable termination.


QUESTION: So you're saying essentially he hasn't


exhausted his internal administrative remedies, and that's


why the 1983 is improper?


MR. CASEY: We say the - his failure to exhaust


is another independent reason why he does not have -

 QUESTION: You're saying he has to both exhaust


and prevail?


MR. CASEY: That's correct.  They're independent


requirements.


QUESTION: And that seems somewhat inconsistent


with at least the negative implication of the Federal


statute, which says all he has to do is exhaust.


MR. CASEY: Well, the - the Court addressed that


question in Heck v. Humphrey, and it said that even if a


person exhausts his remedies, if he has not favorably


terminated, he cannot bring the lawsuit unless and until


he gets favorable termination.  They're - they're


independent.  The exhaustion requirement -


QUESTION: Well, that's the Heck v. Humphrey's 

gloss, but that's an additional requirement.  Usually


exhaustion does not require prevailing.


MR. CASEY: Well, that's correct.  That's


correct.  The - the reason he has to get favorable


termination in this case is because of the analogy to -


QUESTION: Yes.


MR. CASEY: - malicious prosecution. 


QUESTION: Right.  It - it usually does not


require prevailing, but it does require prevailing when -


when your cause of action is that - that you have been


subjected to the law improperly.

 MR. CASEY: That's correct.  That's our argument.


QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Casey.


MR. CASEY: Thank you very much.


QUESTION: Ms. Beckwith, you have 3 minutes

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CORINNE BECKWITH


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. BECKWITH: Turning to the actual question


presented in this case, there is no justification for the


Sixth Circuit's rule extending the Heck favorable


termination requirement to prison hearings that don't


involve the fact or duration of custody.  Congress could


have amended 1983 to say that, but we know from the PLRA


they looked at the same considerations, they did something 

different.  The Sixth Circuit is an outlier here, as


Justice O'Connor said, because there's no - there's no


conflict with habeas in a - in a matter like this. 


As to all of the other questions that have come


up during this argument, this case came to this Court in


the posture where there were no good-time credits and


there was no exhaustion question.  Now, we think we can


overcome those problems, but I don't think this Court


needs to.


And the - the government has never cited any law


that says the guard's retaliatory conduct violating Mr.

Muhammad's First Amendment rights would have been a


defense, and we know of none.  They argued that it was -


it was relevant to credibility.  They argued that that was


some kind of a but-for relationship, but victory in the


1983 suit does not affect the adjudication for insolence


in this claim.  All of this only matters if good-time


credits are at issue.


And putting all of that aside, we just agree


with Justice Breyer that then this is an easy case in our


favor.  If there are no further questions from the Court,


we'd ask that you reverse the Sixth Circuit.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.


Beckwith.  The case is -


(Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
