 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear, first, 

this morning, Case 08-769, United States v. Stevens.

 (10:03 a.m.)

 Mr. Katyal.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 Ten years ago, in Section 48 of Title 18, 

Congress crafted a narrowly targeted restriction against 
certain depictions of actual animal cruelty.  Yet the 
Third Circuit struck the statute down on its face 
without even attempting to apply substantial overbreadth 
analysis.  The statute has four critical features and, 
just as the Court last year in United States v. Williams 
began with statutory construction, analysis should begin 
there.

 First, like the statute at issue in the 
United States v. Ferber, this statute only reaches 
depictions of cruelty to actual living beings --
animals, not simulated ones or the written word.
 Second, the statute only applies to 

commercial messages, ones that Congress found drove the 
market for animal cruelty.

Third, the statute examines the work as a 

whole --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What record do you have 

of that fact?

 MR. KATYAL:  Before Congress?
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes.
 MR. KATYAL:  Before Congress -- Congress had 

a bunch of testimony that showed that there were 
extensive -- there was a robust market in animal cruelty 
videos, largely focusing on crush videos -- 2 to 3,000 
crush videos that were in -- that were -- that were 
being sold at the time.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That I understand, but 
crush videos is only one species of cruelty to animals. 
What evidence was there that, for example, dog fighting 
had as large and robust a market or that hunting videos 
in those States in which hunting was illegal had a 
robust market, et cetera?

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, hunting we think is 

excluded, and I could talk about that in a moment, from 
the reach of the act.  Congress spoke in general terms, 
and I don't think that Mr. Stevens's statement at page 
13 of his merits brief, which is to the effect that 
Congress repeatedly disavowed any attempt to regulate 
animal fighting -- dog fighting -- I don't think that is

correct and the record does not support that.

 Congress spoke in general terms.  They had a 

for-profit commercial market about animal cruelty, and 
the statute dealt with it in general terms.  And they 
reasoned that by -- by punishing the sale of these 
videotapes, they would get at the underlying clandestine 
market --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What do you mean by a 

"for-profit commercial market"?  You mean anything that 
is sold, right?

 MR. KATYAL:  That is -- that is correct.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.
 MR. KATYAL:  Yes.
 And the Third Circuit's decision in this 

case struck down the statute with respect to crush 
videos, with respect to the sale of video -- the 
creation of dog fighting videotapes, because, remember, 
the statute, Section 48, doesn't just encompass the --
the sale of videotapes.  It also encompasses the 
creation of dog fighting videotapes.  And, yet, the --
the Third Circuit struck that down as well.  That, I 
think, was a fundamental error under this Court's 
principles, most particularly, United States v. 
Williams, which says that the statute should only be 
struck down if there is a substantial -- if there is

substantial overbreadth and only if it is a last resort 
of the Court, not the first.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What would you -- if 

you could do it in one sentence, what is your test for 
determining which categories of speech are unprotected 
by the First Amendment?

 MR. KATYAL:  In one sentence, if -- if -- if 

Congress sees a compelling interest in regulating the 
means of production and does not target the underlying 
content, they can -- they can regulate a depiction, so 
long as it leaves alternative mechanisms for that 
expression in -- in place, and that is I think what 
Ferber --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Okay.  And what case --

what case do you have for that proposition?

 MR. KATYAL:  United States v. Ferber -- New 

York v. Ferber.  In Ferber, the Court -- the Court 
dealt, as modified or as glossed by your decision in 
Free Speech Coalition, because what Ferber and Free 
Speech Coalition together say is that Congress was 
not -- or the legislature, was not targeting the 
contents of a depiction; rather, it was trying to get at 
and dry up the underlying market, child exploitation in 
that case.

summarily dealt with a case some years ago, American 
Booksellers v. Hudnut, where cities attempted to make 
not even a criminal offense, but the subject of a civil 
suit, a violent depiction -- depictions of women as 
sexual objects enjoying pain and humiliation and 
degradation.

 The Seventh Circuit said that that was a 
blatant violation of the First Amendment, to go after 
purveyors who show these women in the shocking, 
degrading photographs, and I believe we summarily 
affirmed.

 MR. KATYAL:  And this case is fundamentally 
different from all of those because here Congress is not 
aiming at the underlying communicative impact.  It's not 
saying, as it was in the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, of course it is.  I 

mean, you can't separate the means from the end and say, 
since its end is simply to prevent the -- the activity, 
the means, which is to prevent the communication, is 
okay.  It is targeting the communication of videos that 
depict this conduct.

 MR. KATYAL:  Quite to the contrary, Justice 

Scalia.  The bona fides of this statute are evident 
right on its face, because the very same depictions that 
Mr. Stevens or anyone else swept up under the statute

wants to portray, they can -- they can do it, so long as 
they use simulated or images.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but to say 
that they are not concerned with the content, I -- I 
think is contradicted by the exceptions.  You have to 
look at the content and make a decision, is this bona 
fide scientific, journalistic, educational, historical? 
So you have to look at the content to determine whether 
or not the speech is prohibited.

 MR. KATYAL:  I don't think so, for two 

reasons.  I think what Congress is dealing with with the 
exemptions clause in this statute was just reflecting 
the underlying nature of the market that they saw in 
1999, a for-profit commercial market in cruelty.

 And so they exempted educational depictions, 

religious, and so on, because that wasn't what was 
driving the underlying market for crush videos --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How can you tell 

these aren't political videos?  You do have, with 
organizations, PETA and others, depictions of the same 
sort of animal cruelty that is used to generate support 
for efforts to prohibit it.  Why aren't these videos the 
exact opposite, you know, efforts to legalize it, and, 
in each case, it would fall under the political 
exemption?

MR. KATYAL:  And often they will fall under 

that exemption.  My point is that Congress carved a 
broad exemption in Section 48 precisely to make sure 
that expressive messages aren't swept up.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you -- could you 
tell me what the difference is between these video and 
David Roma's documentary on pit bulls?  I mean, David 
Roma's documentary had much, much more footage on the 
actual animal cruelty than the films at issue here, 
greater sections of the film, and more explicit.

 In this film, the -- the Respondent didn't 

let the video show the actual tearing of the jaw.  David 
Roma's did much more than that, showed much more than 
that.  So isn't -- doesn't there have to be a judgment 
inherent in this statute?

 MR. KATYAL:  The line will sometimes be 
difficult to draw, just as its difficult to draw in 
child pornography --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But it's not in child 

pornography because, there, Congress says the very 
act -- it doesn't matter how artistic it is.  That very 
act of child pornography is illegal.

 MR. KATYAL:  Quite to the contrary, Justice 
Sotomayor.  In this -- this Court approved, in Osborne 
v. Ohio, a statute that's on child pornography, that had

the following exemption:  For a, quote, "bona fide 
artistic, educational, religious, governmental, 
judicial, or other purpose by or to a physician, 
psychologist, sociologist, persons pursuing bona fide 
research studies, a judge or other persons having a 
proper interest in the material or performance."

 And this Court pointed to that exemptions 
clause to make the statute constitutional at two -- at 
two pages in that opinion.  And so this Court has 
already gone down the path of saying these decisions are 
tough to make on a case-by-case basis, but nonetheless 
the legislature should have a freer hand to act when it 
is regulating, not the expressive message, but targeting 
the underlying content, the -- targeting the underlying 
production, not the content.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Child -- child pornography 
is obscenity as far as I am concerned, and it has been 
treated as part of that same traditional classification 
which there has always been permission for the 
government to prohibit.  This is something quite 
different.

 I mean, you know, what if -- what if I -- I 
am an aficionado of bullfights and I think, contrary to 
the animal cruelty people, I think it -- they enoble 
both beast and man, and I want to persuade people that

bullfights are terrific and we should have them.

 I would -- I would not be able to -- to 

market videos showing people how exciting a bullfight 
is.  Right?  I would be able to talk and say, oh, you 
should really allow bullfights, but I cannot make the 
most significant point that I want to make, get people 
to watch it.

 MR. KATYAL:  I want to answer your 

hypothetical, but if I could just have 20 seconds or so 
to -- to respond more generally to all of these 
hypotheticals which I think are going to reoccur in the 
course of our conversation.

 We believe that Section 48 will have 
as-applied constitutional challenges that will be 
inferred from case to case.  But what this Court has 
said is that, in your decision, Justice Scalia, in 
United States v. Williams, is that we should be careful 
about that endless stream of fanciful hypotheticals 
precisely because the test under substantial 
overbreadth, which knocks an entire act of Congress out 
on its face, is that there must be a realistic danger 
that the statute will be applied in -- in the manner the 
hypothetical suggests.

 With respect to your bullfighting 

hypothetical, there is no realistic danger.

We have had ten years of experience under the statute. 
Congress itself said -- the legislative history, which I 
know will not be of relevance to you but may to others 
on the Court -- they explicitly exempted Spanish 
bullfighting and said that is the paradigmatic case of 
what is educational and artistic and the like.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  What if I made --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, wait.  Wait.  I don't 

understand that.  Any depiction of bullfighting is 
educational?

 MR. KATYAL:  Spanish depictions of 

bullfighting --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that is true because 

Congress said so?

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, that is true because it 
is educational, and -- and a prosecutor would bear the 
burden of proof.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I guess a dogfight is 

educational, too.

 MR. KATYAL:  And some dogfights certainly 

are, which is my answer to Justice Sotomayor's question.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, look what you have 

done, and this is what is bothering me.  You take these 
words, which are a little vague, some of them, "serious 
religious, political, scientific, educational,

journalistic, historical, or artistic value," and you 
say that's a standard that a judge or prosecutor will 
apply.  And people have to understand it because they 
have to know what to do to avoid the risk of being 
prosecuted.

 Now, as I have gotten out of these briefs, 

you then require people to apply that standard, not 
simply to the crush videos or to the dogfighting, but 
also to, as Justice Scalia pointed out, bullfighting, 
sheep hunting, bear hunting, deer hunting, fox hunting, 
humane slaughter, and for, I think somewhere I found, 
the stuffing geese for pate de fois gras.

 All right, so there is a whole long -- quail 

hunting.  There's a whole long list in here of things 
that people might want to do.  They won't know if it 
falls within this exemption.  Nobody in every State 
wants to forbid these things.  Sometimes they are, 
sometimes they are not.  They won't know whether or not 
they can make this particular film, picture, or other. 
That's the overbreadth argument.  And I would like to 
hear your response.

 MR. KATYAL:  We have had ten years of 

experience, Justice Breyer, under the statute, and we 
haven't seen those things being chilled.  Indeed,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you give me an example 
of a case where we said a statute which might otherwise 
be overbroad is not overbroad because prosecutors have 
been restrained?  Can you give me one case where we've 
said that?

 MR. KATYAL:  Last year in United States v. 

Williams, an opinion that virtually every member of this 
Court joined, including you, Justice Kennedy, this Court 
said that it would look to the experience, the 
post-Ferber experience, in prosecuting cases to decide 
whether or not a -- two terms in the statute, "promotes" 
and "presents," were vague and would raise the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that was a case where 

we knew what the content was.  The content was not 
subject to an -- to an overbreadth challenge.  The 
content was not.

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, actually, Justice 

Kennedy, the reason that came up in the case is because 
there were hypotheticals being advanced such as 
police -- a man who wants to call the police that says 
that child pornography arrived in my -- in the mail and 
so on.  And what the Court said is that even though the 
words in the statute, just as the words in this statute, 
could be read broadly or narrowly --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but that -- that

went to intent.  It seems to me that -- let me tell you 
what I think your framework is and if it is wrong, tell 
me that it is wrong.  This statute without the 
exceptions clause would be wildly overbroad.  So you say 
it's not overly broad because of the exception or the 
savings clause.  I will call it the exceptions.  But it 
seems to me that the exceptions must be then tested as 
to whether or not they are vague.

 MR. KATYAL:  We do think that the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you have you to show 

that they are not vague.

 MR. KATYAL:  We do think that the exceptions 

clause does some of the constitutional work to exclude 
some of the hypotheticals like bullfighting and the 
like.  We do think the statute itself has a number of 
restrictions built into it on its face to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what is a -- what is 

"and the like"?  How about cockfighting?  What is the 
difference between -- perhaps I missed something a few 
moments ago -- between bullfighting, cockfighting, 
dogfighting?  You say dogfighting is included, but 
bullfighting -- and I don't know where you put 
cockfighting.

 MR. KATYAL:  Dogfighting and cockfighting 

are illegal in all 50 States and therefore would be

swept up.  Some certain depictions of dogfighting and 
cockfighting would be swept up, not all.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what about 

bullfighting?  Isn't that illegal in --

MR. KATYAL:  It may or may not be.  There 
aren't, at least, specific statutes generally dealing 
with it, but --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  What about hunting with a 

bow -- What about hunting with a bow and arrow out of 
season?

 MR. KATYAL:  Okay.  So --
(Laughter.)
 MR. KATYAL:  In hunting, as well as --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can we -- have we 

finished with the category of fights?

 MR. KATYAL:  So let me just, to Justice 
Ginsburg's question.  Not all dogfighting videos are 
swept up by Section 48.  There may be educational 
videos, along the lines that Justice Sotomayor said, 
raised which are not swept up.  Bullfighting is the same 
basic thing.  It's not that there is a categorical -- a 
categorical exemption on bullfighting; it is rather that 
there are certain ones that are educational and not, 
just like in child pornography.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So noneducational 

bullfighting would be prohibited?  If I market this just 
because I think, boy, bullfighting is really exciting?

 MR. KATYAL:  If it meets the other terms in 
the statute, right.  So commercial and things like that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  It is covered.
 MR. KATYAL:  Now, with respect to hunting, 

hunting is generally not considered animal cruelty.  And 
it doesn't --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, but hunting with a bow 

and arrow, and some depictions of hunting are pretty --
are pretty gruesome.

 MR. KATYAL:  That's correct.  And to the 

extent that it is something that resembles the terms of 
the statute, the language of which is "maimed, 
mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed" --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  "Or killed."  How do you 
limit "killed" to cruel -- you say in your brief that 
it's noscitur ex sociis.  But that's a doctrine that 
says when you have a string of words, one of which has 
various meanings, which meaning it has depends upon the 
words with which it is associated.  So if you speak of 
staples, staples -- what, thumb tacks, nails, and other 
fasteners, "nails" obviously doesn't mean toenails.  It 
means a nail that is a fastener, the word "nail" having

various meanings.

 "Kill" has one meaning, which is kill.  And 
you can -- you cannot limit that meaning just because in 
addition to killing you also prohibit torturing and 
other things.  Do you have a single case where -- where 
that doctrine is used not to give meaning to an 
ambiguous word, but to limit the meaning of a word which 
on its face is absolutely clear?

 MR. KATYAL:  Yes, sir, Your Honor.  I do.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is that?
 MR. KATYAL:  That is the decision you wrote 
last year in United States v. Williams, which interprets 
the words "promotes and presents," which you yourself in 
the opinion said are capable of a wide variety of 
meanings.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Exactly.
 MR. KATYAL:  And -- and here the word "kill" 

in context is a term that the statute --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, it's not susceptible to 

a wide -- that's my whole point.  It means kill.

 MR. KATYAL:  It means killed in the context 

of a statute that is defining the words "animal 
cruelty," and this Court has consistently said that the 
definition that is being defined by the legislature --

animal is animal cruelty.  These people don't eat meat 
because it is the product of killing animals.

 MR. KATYAL:  And the legislature under no 

way, shape, or form was targeting that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it shouldn't have 

said that, then.

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think that it basically 
did say that by using the words "animal cruelty" in the 
statute.  Now, if there's a disagreement about that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't have a single 

case in which a -- an absolutely clear word like "kill" 
is given a more narrow meaning because of other words 
that are different from that word.

 MR. KATYAL:  Justice Scalia, in Leocal, this 

Court defined the term "crime of violence," which the 
INA had -- that the INA interpreted wrongly.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So you want to say "cruelly 

kill"?

 MR. KATYAL:  That's --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, "cruelly kill" is not 

exactly crystal clear.  And therefore my question is 
why, given the need for you to save this statute to read 
so many words that are so general, those contained here 
that I've read, cruelly kill, cruelly wound as opposed 
to just wound or kill.  You are doing that in order to

prevent chilling people who are engaging in activities 
that aren't intended to be covered by this statute.

 Why not do a simpler thing?  Rather than let 

the public guess as to what these words mean, ask 
Congress to write a statute that actually aims at those 
frightful things that it was trying to prohibit.  Now, 
that can be done.  I don't know why they couldn't do it.
 MR. KATYAL:  And it could have been done in 

Williams.  It could have been done in the child 
pornography cases, which also have vague terms.  But 
what this Court has said is that using the substantial 
overbreadth doctrine to do that leaves gaping holes in 
place.  If we followed your invitation, Justice Breyer, 
we would leave crush videos unprotected.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  Why?  You say a crush 
video, my description that I read of it, you would have 
a strong case.  I'm not saying you would win, I don't 
have to decide that.  But you have a very strong case. 
So you say to Congress, write a statute that focuses on 
that.  You are worried about dog fighting, write a 
statute that focuses on that, and moreover, talks about 
something unlawful in every state.  I am not giving 
Congress advice, though I seem to be.

 (Laughter.)

can't you here write a statute that does not force the 
courts into the work of interpreting these very vague 
words to prevent the statute from being held 
unconstitutional?

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, here I think we should 

give Congress some credit, because what it actually did 
in the exemption clause was borrow this Court's own 
jurisprudence from the obscenity context on exceptions 
like literary, artistic, political and scientific.  It 
had found that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, would 

this -- would a statute like this apply to humans be 
constitutional?  You can't depict videos of, say, 
violent muggings or things of that sort?

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think it would be 

complicated because Congress would have to find that by 
targeting the underlying videos but leaving alternative 
simulated mugging videos in place, somehow it would have 
reduced the market for muggings or something like that. 
I think that's very hard.  And it goes to Justice 
Ginsburg's question about whether this statute is aimed 
at the communicative of impact, which we don't think it 
is, or it is aimed at just reducing the first order 
problem which is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the first order problem

occurs in states where it is not illegal.  These videos 
are taken in states where bullfighting or dog fighting 
or cock fighting is entirely legal.  So, I don't know 
how you distinguish a -- a movie which many people think 
that violence in movie brutalizes people and causes 
violence in people's action.

 Why couldn't Congress, persuaded by these 
people say, you know, you can't have -- cannot depict 
torture?  You know, these horror films that come out 
around Halloween, you can't depict that anymore.  What 
is the difference between that and what you have done 
here?

 MR. KATYAL:  So dog fighting is illegal in 
all 50 states along with crush videos.  I don't think 
that -- there may be --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it isn't -- it 

isn't -- illegal in Japan, and part of the video here 
were dog fights in Japan; legal where it occurred, no 
different from bull fighting.

 MR. KATYAL:  Right.  This Court has dealt 

with that in footnote 19 of Ferber in which it said that 
just because something is legal somewhere else, it's 
often very hard to figure out where the underlying 
material is made.  It doesn't have a GPS component.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Justice Scalia spoke about 
the aficionada of Spanish bullfighting.  Suppose that I 
am an aficionado of the sort gladiatorial contests that 
used to take place in ancient Rome, and suppose that 
some -- Rome or some other place decides that it wants 
to make money by staging these things and selling videos 
of them or broadcasting them live around the world.  Do 
you have any doubt that that could be prohibitive?

 MR. KATYAL:  This is -- I'm sorry if I'm not 

following the hypothetical.  This is historical --

JUSTICE ALITO:  A gladiatorial contests 

where the gladiators fight to the death.

 MR. KATYAL:  Right.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you have any doubt that 

that could be prohibited?

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, it sounds like it would 

fall under the historical exemption, at least in the 
hypothetical as you have raised it.  So, it wouldn't be 
prohibited by section 48 --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Who knows.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  No, no, not under this 

statute, under a different statute.

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think that -- I think 
that there again, it would raise some First Amendment 
interest in suppressing historical -- historical

information.

 Now, Justice Scalia, you said who knows.  I 
think the answer to that is that this statute places the 
burden of proof on the government in order to -- in 
order to prove that there is no historical or 
educational value.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  If you dress up like an 

ancient Roman, the whole thing is of historical 
interest?

 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that it?
 MR. KATYAL:  Justice Scalia, I do think that 

is the Court's own jurisprudence with respect to, for 
example, obscenity and child pornography, both of which 
this Court has accepted precisely those types of 
exceptions.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  A different category.  That 
is traditional First Amendment law that obscenity is not 
protected.  And child pornography, as far as I am 
concerned, and I think as far as the Court is concerned 
is obscenity.

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, I don't believe the Court 

has actually read child pornography to be obscenity. 
The rationale of Ferber --

something quite different between Ferber, because the 
abuse of a child is occurring at the very time.  As I 
understand it, Mr. Stevens was not a promoter of dog 
fights.  He was just filming them.  And so the -- the --
the simultaneous abuse of the child, it occurs only 
because the picture is being taken.  The dog fight goes 
on whether Mr. Stevens is there with his camera or not.

 MR. KATYAL:  Let me say two things about 

that.  First Mr. Stevens, of course, even in the Japan 
videos you mentioned, he sent his dogs to Japan to -- to 
fight.  And this statute encompasses real time 
transmissions of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where it was legal for 

him to do that.

 MR. KATYAL:  It was, just -- again, like 

child pornography and the like.  The second --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It even -- what I would 

like you to confront is that the very taking of the 
picture is the offense.  That's the abuse of the child. 
The abuse of the dog and the promotion of the fight is 
separate from the filming of it.

 MR. KATYAL:  I agree with that.  And I don't 

think that's what underlay either this Court's Ferber 
decision or the free speech coalition.  The move that 
Ferber makes is to say that the legislature can target

the underlying loaded production, so long as it leaves 
alternative mechanisms for that same exact message to be 
spoken.  And this statute does that.  Mr. Stevens can 
produce the exact same message, just as long as he 
doesn't involve the torture or mutilation to an actual 
living animal.  And to compare this --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  His message is that getting 

animals to fight is fun.  That's his message.

 MR. KATYAL:  And Congress hasn't stamped 

that out.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  To say he -- you know, he 

can convey that message in some other way, how else does 
he do it?

 MR. KATYAL:  With simulated messages, the 

written word.  He has written an entire book about that. 
He has a whole variety --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Simulated dog fights would 

be okay under this statute?

 MR. KATYAL:  Simulate -- absolutely.  This 
statute leaves that in place, Justice Scalia.  That's 
the key to understanding why this statute is not like 
the traditional statutes that come before this Court in 
which the government asserts some paternalistic interest 
and says viewers can't see this because of the offense 
of the message.

This statute has nothing to do with the 

offense of the message.  It has to do with trying to dry 
up an underlying market for animal cruelty.

 If the there are no questions, I would like 

to reserve the balance of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Ms. Millett.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. MILLETT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 It is not the exact same message, if you are 

forced in a popular debate that is going around this 
country now about the treatment of animals.  To require 
one side to engage -- to use simulated images, which is 
exactly what the government's reply brief at page 3 
insists upon, while those who want to ban conduct are 
allowed to use real images.  That puts the government's 
censorial thumb on the scale of public debate.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What about crush videos, 

which apparently were the focus of Congress's attention 
when it drafted these?  Now, I suppose by an analogy to 
what Justice Scalia just said about the message of dog 
fighting videos, the people who produce crush videos 
think they have a message, and the message is that this

is -- this is sexually exciting or it's exciting in some 
way to see a woman in high heeled shoes crushing a 
little animal to death.

 Do you think that is constitutionally 

protected?

 MS. MILLETT:  I think -- I think there's 

a -- that a properly drawn law could very well, at least 
in my humble opinion, this Court would have to decide, 
survive strict scrutiny.

 There is also, I suppose, some argument 

whether it would fit into -- you wouldn't need strict 
scrutiny, you would fit it into an unprotected category 
of speech like obscenity or it would be the production 
issue that would -- like you have in Ferber.

 But what -- beyond that I do think we need 

to keep in mind a couple of things --

JUSTICE ALITO:  You are not -- you are not 

even willing to say that that could be prohibited?

 MS. MILLETT:  No, no.  I think -- I'm saying 
that there are three alternative ways in which to get to 
it.  My first if one is that not this statute, but under 
a properly drawn statute --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Under a properly drawn 

statute --

scrutiny.  I'm not sure you would --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Might.  I would really like 
you to tell me whether it would; whether you are willing 
to concede.  Because we are trying to determine whether 
this is overly broad.  And this is the category of 
activity that Congress particularly targeted.  So to me 
at least it's important to know whether at least as 
applied to what Congress principally had in mind, the 
statute could -- could pass constitutional muster.  If 
it were, you know, as applied.

 MS. MILLETT:  I don't -- I don't want to, 
say this statute, because I don't think this statute --
but if the statute said, this -- I think this Court 
disagree -- it disagrees with me sometimes -- but I 
think this could pass constitutional muster.  A statute 
that says the patently offensive intentional torture and 
killing of an animal for -- designed to appeal to the 
prurient interest for the purpose of producing the 
image, I think that would satisfy -- I think it would 
satisfy strict scrutiny.  The Court might also decide 
that it's close enough to obscenity or it's like the 
Ferber production rationale.  That's my position; there 
are sort of three ways it could be analyzed, a statute 
like that.

 That's not this statute and I don't think we

can say that this statute, because Congress has the 
authority to reach something, that when it throws a 
blanket net as wide as this one has that this means this 
statute is the mechanism, a lawful mechanism for getting 
--

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I have one more -- one 

more question along the lines of Justice Alito.  Forget 
this statute.  Under a properly drawn statute, suppose 
that bull-fighting or pitbull-fighting is unlawful in 
every State.  Could a theater have a live broadcast of a 
pitbull fight in Japan and charge ten dollars?  And 
let's add the hypothetical fact that a lot of the 
revenue goes back to Japan and promotes more 
bull-fighting.  Could a properly drawn statute prohibit 
that?  And then perhaps Justice Scalia, Alito, has a 
follow-up question on his own hypothetical.  Could a 
properly drawn statute prohibit that, that speech?

 MS. MILLETT:  A properly drawn statute with 
the requisite congressional findings or record of a need 
to attack -- it sound to me like this is a need to 
attack production.  As in child pornography, the fact 
that the image taking is legal overseas does not mean 
that it can't be prohibited here.  And if you had the 
type of record of a statute that says we want to stop 
the production; it's not the content, it is the

production, as this Court explained in Free Speech 
Coalition for Child Pornography.

 But that is a statute that then wouldn't 

have -- either you would have to decide which things are 
in and out -- if you started saying animal cruelty 
production, but we we'll let the bullfights in but the 
pitbull fights out and the cock fights, then you'd have 
problems.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We are asking whether or 
not that specific instance could be prohibited under a 
properly drawn statute, just like Justice Alito's 
hypothetical was under a properly drawn statute you 
could prohibit the conduct, the speech broadcast in that 
conduct.

 MS. MILLETT:  The theory -- I mean, 

ultimately this Court would have to decide whether 
Ferber is limited to an obscenity that's historically 
unprotected by the First Amendment.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So your answer to my 
hypothetical is yes it could be prohibited under a 
properly drawn statute?

 MS. MILLETT:  If this Court -- two things. 

It would have to be a very, very narrowly drawn statute, 
I think going to the production theory like Ferber; and 
the question I think before this Court would be, given

the nature of the harm that presumably would be found, 
the nature of the market, the synergistic effect, where 
the -- I am assuming the findings here would be that the 
crime and the image are one and the same, inextricably 
intertwined -- then maybe, although I still think it 
would be a bit harder because we are dealing with the 
First Amendment here.  We don't make it up as we go 
along.  At the time that the First Amendment was written 
dog-fighting was legal in this country.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But the point -- the point 

I guess is when you say yes to this, what you are 
thinking is that, just as real obscenity when depicted 
does nothing communicative but rather appeals to the 
instinct of lust, so Congress could find a category of 
things that do not communicate, but appeal to the 
instinct of sadism; and that is true when other 
creatures are killed for the pleasure of the people who 
want to see them killed.

 Now, that's what you are saying.  Now -- and 

I think maybe that's true.  We don't have to decide 
that, perhaps.  But the government says that is this 
statute, that is this statute read in light of its basic 
intent, and it is up to the Court to interpret it so as 
it achieves that objective.  And you say that's not 
possible.  Why not?

MS. MILLETT:  Two things.  First of all, 

there is interpreting and then there is alchemy, and I 
think this statute requires alchemy.  This is Reno 
versus --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Requires?
 MS. MILLETT:  Alchemy, alchemy.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh.
 MS. MILLETT:  There's construction of --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's such an unusual word. 

I haven't heard it in a legal argument in a long time.
 MS. MILLETT:  We don't often get statutes 

that are so far off base that we're going, I think in my 
opinion, so far beyond construing ambiguity and doing 
instead what was asked of this Court and the Court 
declined in Reno v. ACLU, and that is to write the 
statute for Congress.

 The ambiguity, as, Justice Scalia, you 

explained -- you would have to excise this statute in 
and out, sever so many things.  I don't know what you'd 
have left unless it's the statute I posited to Justice 
Alito, which might have a couple of words that overlap 
with this statute.  But that is not statutory 
construction.  This Court's job is not to write the 
statute for Congress.

Court consistently under the First Amendment has 
required, not just the right words, but a record from 
Congress.  In the First Amendment area we can't just 
posit the problems; we have to really have confidence 
that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does this -- would this 

record support any ban?  I mean, there was a real 
concentration on crush videos.  So there is that.  Is 
there anything else in the current record other than the 
crush videos?

 MS. MILLETT:  No, there is not.  And in fact 

they spent their time, as we said in our brief -- and 
this is perfectly accurate.  Members of Congress, to the 
extent they discussed other things, kept saying in the 
floor debates:  That's not in; bull-fighting's not in; 
dog-fighting's not in; hunting's not in; these things 
are not in.  So they mentioned them in the context of 
saying these are not in.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I think --
I think Ferber analytically is the hard case for you, 
because the Court in Ferber did said -- and I am quoting 
from page 763:  "The evil to be restricted so 
overwhelmingly outweighs the expressive interest at 
stake."  That was their articulation of the test.  Now, 
why shouldn't we apply that test to this statute?

MS. MILLETT:  I don't think that is a legal 
test that is adopted under the First Amendment.  I think 
that is a description of the types of categories that by 
history and tradition had been outside the First 
Amendment and the rationale for why Ferber came in, 
which was, yes, there's overlap, but I think it actually 
bridges the world of obscenity and virtual incitement 
because you have the crime and the image one and the 
same wrapped up together.

 There is in this instance -- there are about 

five different ways that this is different from child 
pornography.  The first is that there has never been any 
finding, any assertion, even by the government, that 
creating the image is the primary or sole motive for 
creating these images.  It's not if you lock Mr. Stevens 
up -- if you throw away every dog-fighting video in the 
country tomorrow, dog-fighting will continue.  It -- no 
one thinks that it will go away.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I think the government 

does.  It says that is how you dry up the market.

 MS. MILLETT:  But you don't dry up the 

market by having a sweeping value exception like they 
have here.  If Congress wants to dry up the market, what 
Ferber says is there's two things that have to happen: 
One, you've got to prove causation.  You can't simply

say, we got a problem, let's go first to the speech and 
cut that off as our first prosecutorial tool when we are 
not even ready to make the crime itself a felony, but we 
will make the speech a felony.

 You've got to prove causation, that these 
images cause the harm, they are one and the same with 
the harm as they are with child pornography.  You also 
have got to prove that Congress is acting in an 
evenhanded way.  It is not leaving, as Justice Scalia 
said, appreciable damage to the interests that its 
asserting uncovered by its many, many exceptions.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask you a question 

about your view of the breadth of the statute.  I didn't 
yet really get an answer out of your opponent.  Do you 
think the statute would prohibited depictions of hunting 
if it involved killing in the District of Columbia, 
because hunting as I understand it is not allowed in the 
District of Columbia, it's prohibited.  Does that mean 
that any depictions of hunting that show the killing and 
cruelty are prohibited by this statute?

 MS. MILLETT:  Well, they are prohibited 

subject to the value police and the value trial like we 
had here, which I think is antithetical to the First 
Amendment.  It's a very different rule under the 
obscenity statute.  So it would all depend on whether a

jury decided that that had serious value, which was 
defined as significant and great import in this 
particular case.  That would decide whether --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's just not significant 
value; significant artistic, educational.  What are the 
others?  Scientific?

 MS. MILLETT:  Scientific, social, artistic, 

journalistic --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Strictly entertainment 

value doesn't count, does it?

 MS. MILLETT:  No, it does not.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And most of the hunting 

videos I have seen people watch for the entertainment. 
They like to see a hunt.

 MS. MILLETT:  I think that's exactly right 
and that's what the Safari Club and the NRA have told 
us.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I mean, but 

this definition or these exceptions are not drawn out of 
thin air.  They are drawn from Miller, and the Court in 
Miller recognized that they were significant in causing 
the restriction of obscenity to pass constitutional 
muster.

 MS. MILLETT:  First of all, this is about 
-- this is Miller doubled -- there's a lot more here

-- categories here.  But it's a very different role 
that value plays under Miller in obscenity.  First of 
all, this Court made quite clear again in Reno v. ACLU 
that Miller only works if you have all three prongs. 
You can't just use the serious value prong to take 
care of your constitutional problem.  Second, you were 
dealing in an area that by history and tradition is 
unprotected speech.  Milller --

JUSTICE ALITO:  But in determining whether 

this is over -- overly broad, do we -- do we think of all 
of the hypotheticals that we possibly can think of that 
might fall within this statute:  somebody hunting in the 
District of Columbia, somebody producing fois gras with 
a goose and say, "Well, we've thought of a lot of 
hypothetical situations where this statute might apply 
and therefore it's overly broad"?  Or do we look at 
what's going on in the real world?

 MS. MILLETT:  I think what you do is you 

look at text of the statute, and then you ask yourself, 
how much of a strain is it to come up with a factual 
pattern that will fit into it?  In Williams you had to 
first of all read the --

JUSTICE ALITO:  So we really think of all 
the hypotheticals.  That's how you think we determine 
the constitutionality of this under the overbreadth

doctrine?

 MS. MILLETT:  I think at some level Congress 
has a job to write with a scalpel and not a buzz saw in 
the First Amendment area, and the only way to ensure 
that happens is to look at the text and say, does this 
text fit the purpose, does it fit what the Constitution 
will allow?  And when the --

JUSTICE ALITO:  If it's the fact that during 
the ten years when this statute has been in effect there 
has been no decrease in hunting videos and hunting shows 
on TV, and all of the rest -- the only perceptible 
change in the real world is that these -- is that the 
market for crush videos dried up, at least until the 
Third Circuit's decision, does that have any relevance?
 MS. MILLETT:  I don't -- I don't think it 

does for this reason.  People -- and this gets a little 
bit to Justice Kennedy's vagueness concern.  People have 
a right to know how to -- outside the courtroom how to 
conform their conduct to the law.  If I got a call from 
the general counsel of Outdoor Channel or someone making 
hunting videos and they said, "Does this fall within 
this statute," I wouldn't have to come up with a 
strained factual scenario.  I would say yeah, it falls 
squarely in, subject to a prosecutor or jury anywhere 
where you market in this country, deciding that it has

serious -- one of the adjectives -- value.  I would have 
to say that to that person, and that would be accurate 
legal advice.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It could be that the reason 
hunting videos are still out there is that the producers 
were quite confident that this Court would not allow 
them to be prohibited on the base of a statute such as 
this.

 MS. MILLETT:  One would hope, and I think 

quite frankly the NRA has been quite honest when it 
recently said you know, this -- this is not an actively 
enforced statute.  People were shocked to learn -- to 
become aware of it.

 Now maybe everyone's supposed to know the 

existence of laws, but I think the reality is that once 
people looked at what this said, they became very, very, 
very concerned, and I think when you're talking about a 
criminal prohibition here -- this is not a civil suit, 
this is criminal prohibition with severe penalties.  The 
penalties for speech are higher than most animal cruelty 
statutes.  And the whole point of the criminal law is to 
deter conduct and to make people stay wide of the 
margins here, wide of the borders.

Amendment.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understood your 

answers to Justice Alito to acknowledge that there would 
be situations where this statute could be 
constitutionally applied, or as you put it, you could 
draft a statute.

 MS. MILLETT:  Not this statute.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not this statute. 

But --

MS. MILLETT:  That's different.  I think 

that's very different.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But if in fact there 

were situations where we thought a narrowly drafted 
statute could be applied to particular instances, 
perhaps the crush videos, perhaps others, why isn't that 
enough to say that this statute is valid on its face and 
then we will consider as-applied challenges?

 MS. MILLETT:  I think in the First 

Amendment -- I'm not talking -- if I heard you right we 
were not talking about this statute.  If you have 
another statute --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess I am just 
trying to get at what your understanding of what the 
test is for overbreadth in this area.  How much of an 
area of constitutional application is necessary before

you decide that a statute is not unconstitutional on its 
face, but will consider as-applied challenges?

 MS. MILLETT:  Right.  And this Court has 

been clear that the overbreadth has to be both 
quantitative and qualitative.  It hasn't set a 
particular ratio.  I think this one is easy.  We are 
talking about 2,000 crush videos and tens if not 
hundreds of thousands of other images that are captured 
by this statute.  I think normally when this Court says 
it wants to -- to apply overbreadth, it has been dealing 
with situations for the most part in two contexts.  One 
where Congress has already regulated in an area that is 
unprotected under the First Amendment, unprotected in 
the sense that they are allowed to ban, regulate 
heavily.  They are already there, and the question is 
did they draw the margins too broad?

 That is not this case.  We are dealing in an 

area that was never until December 1999 barred by 
anybody, never considered to be outside the conception 
of the First Amendment's freedom of speech.  The other 
scenario where we see substantial overbreadth is when 
Congress is regulating conduct.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, isn't that -- isn't 

that due to changes in technology?  Before people could 
show -- could watch videos at home, this sort of thing

would -- would be very difficult.

 MS. MILLETT:  This covers photographs, so 

this would go back as far as photographs.  I'm not sure 
it wouldn't cover a sketch artist or a hieroglyphic, for 
all I know.  All it requires is that it be a depiction 
in some form.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And is there -- in the real 

world is there a market for sketches of dog fights?
 MS. MILLETT:  I don't know if there's a 

market --

JUSTICE ALITO:  People get a thrill from 

seeing that?

 MS. MILLETT:  With respect, I can't answer 
that.  I'm not -- I don't know if there is a market for 
dog fighting videos.  There is a few, but it depends on 
what you mean by a market.  Will somebody buy something? 
I guess somebody in this world will buy anything.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there any indication 

that there has been any dry-up of the market for dog 
fights as a result of this statute?
 MS. MILLETT:  There --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Justice Alito suggested 

that until the Third Circuit's decision, that there were 
fewer crush videos produced.  But with respect to dog 
fights, animal fights, is there any indication that

there has been -- there have been fewer animal fights as 
a result of this statute?

 MS. MILLETT:  None whatsoever, and in fact 
what we've seen is robust enforcement, and we cite the 
article in our case, we have seen robust enforcement; 
there was just an arrest a few weeks ago for I think a 
couple hundred people involved in dog fighting rings. 
So the dog fighting rings are going on unabated and they 
are getting found and discovered and prosecuted 
successfully, and in fact the images sometimes help with 
the prosecution.

 This is a place, when we start talking we 

are going to take something outside the First Amendment, 
one of the other things that unifies the categories of 
speech outside the First Amendment is a judgment that 
more speech doesn't work.  This is an area where we know 
speech works powerfully.  Speech about these ugly images 
produced this statute.  It informed people.  Unlike 
children and child pornography, people need to see 
images to understand what's going on with animals, and 
to make these important decisions and engage in these 
important debates that our society is having.

Court in Ferber, that, you know, it's really good for 
people to see molestation of children because then they 
will be outraged and they will enforce the statute more. 
I just can't see the Court accepting that argument for a 
single -- for a minute.

 MS. MILLETT:  I -- I agree.  I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's the argument 

you are making.

 MS. MILLETT:  No, no, I think it's -- I 

think it's -- I'm trying to point out that this is in 
fact a contrast.

 First of all -- a contrast between the two 

situations between dealing with the subject, a very 
topical subject that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it seems to me that 

we ought -- if there is a significant chance that 
Congress can affect an illegal market, an illegal 
activity by a statutory regulation we ought to defer to 
Congress on that ground.  I think you still have speech 
arguments.

 MS. MILLETT:  I --

causation, I think we have to defer to Congress largely.

people hate bull fighting and things, but on quite the 
opposite, it seems to me.  On the right under the First 
Amendment of people who like bull fighting, who like dog 
fighting, who like cock fighting, to present their side 
of -- of the debate.

 And unless it's a subject like obscenity, 

which from the beginning has not been considered 
protected speech, it seems to me that side of the debate 
is entitled to make its point as -- as forcefully as 
possible.  That's it seems to me what the problem is 
here.  Not --

MS. MILLETT:  I think that is 100 percent 

right.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if that's 100 percent, 

then what about people who --who like to see human 
sacrifices?  Suppose that is legally taking place 
someplace in the world.  I mean, people here would 
probably love to see it.  Live, pay per view, you know, 
on the human sacrifice channel.

 (Laughter. )
 JUSTICE ALITO:  They have a point of view 

they want to express.  That's okay?

 MS. MILLETT:  The problem with this statute 
is that presumably that statute would be even-handed and 
would it not say if the sacrifices were religious, or

journalistic, or historic.  Or --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You can create a lot of 

First Amendment horribles.  What about -- what about a 
new Adolf Hitler?  Can we censor any depiction of that 
new Adolf Hitler and the horrible things that he is 
proposing, including extermination of a race?  Is that 
proscribable under the First Amendment?  Is that any 
less horrible than the human sacrifice contemplation?

 MS. MILLETT:  No, Justice Scalia.  Again, I 

agree, because what the First Amendment says is we 
allow --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry; you agree 

you can prohibit it, or not?

 MS. MILLETT:  I agree that, just because 
something is repulsive, incredibly offensive or maybe 
even involves some harm to people does not mean that --
depictions of it that do not cause that harm, that are 
not integrally tied to it, that are not the purpose and 
animating motivation for that harm cannot be proscribed.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What was your answer to 

Justice Alito's hypothetical about human sacrifice?

 MS. MILLETT:  The -- if -- at a minimum, 

Congress has got to be evenhanded.  The point there is 
that you are trying to say we are concerned about the 
creation for purposes of the image.  We are concerned

about what the government calls the "snuff video 
situation."

 This whole reason that this is created is 
for purposes of creating the image.  If you establish 
the causation -- and I don't think we -- the Court does 
just defer to Congress on these things.

 It looks carefully at factual records in --
as it has in the child pornography are under the First 
Amendment, Justice Kennedy.  If Congress proves the 
causation and shows that it is -- it's the least 
restrictive means -- compelling and least restrictive 
means, the strict scrutiny that Congress -- the 
government never wanted this statute to march through.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And what if there is no 

chance of drawing up the activity?  Suppose you have the 
ethnic cleansing channel on cable TV, and there is no --
this is taking place in a country that's beyond our 
power to influence.  Congress couldn't prohibit that?

 MS. MILLETT:  The -- the fact that conduct 

is repulsive or offensive does not mean we automatically 
ban the speech.  You would have to have -- it would have 
to follow this Court's patterns, either it would be an 
even-handed ban on production, under the Ferber theory, 
or you would have to establish if those images were 
never within the constraints.

JUSTICE BREYER:  I think what -- I think 
what's going on is -- is not -- your conflating two 
things.  One is you are trying to produce education 
about something that has no communicative value.

 In so far as you are trying to make an 

argument or educate, of course, it is protected, but the 
government, here, is saying I think the statute is 
intended to forbid a different thing entirely, and it's 
hard to draw a line.

 Maybe it's impossible; but promoting a thing 

which communicates nothing, but appeals to people's 
worst instinct, that is not to advocate it or not to 
advocate it.

 It is to try to make money out of it, and 

that's what they think, I believe, the statute is aimed 
at.

 MS. MILLETT:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So that's why they have the 

journalistic exception.

 MS. MILLETT:  The -- when it comes to 

promoting illegal conduct, we have the Brandenburg Test, 
and, if you are close enough to be inciting it, to be 
causing it -- which I think is where Ferber, largely, 
is.  They are just intertwined.  That's one thing.  But

disgusting, despicable channel doesn't mean that we 
automatically ban it.  Maybe it will be educational. 
Maybe we will learn from it.

 I think Congress is going to have to show, 

before it goes to speech as its first tool of repression 
to attack conduct with, very specialized, narrow 
circumstances.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  We are going to advertise a 

drug that is known to kill people.

 MS. MILLETT:  That is commercial --
JUSTICE BREYER:  We are advertising --
MS. MILLETT:  That is commercial speech. 

The fact that you want to get paid for speaking does not 
make it commercial speech.

 Samuel Johnson, himself, said that no one 
but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money.  I don't 
necessarily agree with that, but it is -- it would be a 
shock to him, to Thomas Payne, who sold his tracks of 
"Common Sense," that the First Amendment would go all --
leap all the way from commercial speech and say, just 
because you are doing it for money, you need to make a

the government to decide what are people's worst 
instincts.

 If -- if the First Amendment means anything, 

that's what it means.

 MS. MILLETT:  Well, it means --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not up to the 

government to tell us what our worst instincts are --

have traditionally been outside the area of -- of 
protected speech, and -- and once you allow this one, 
what other -- what other base instincts do people have,

 One can contemplate a lot of other areas, 

where government could say, You are appealing to 
people's worst instincts, and, therefore, the -- the 
movies cannot be made.

theories --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Adolf Hitler, can we keep

 MS. MILLETT:  It's a dangerous proposition. 
That's what the First Amendment says we won't do.  There 
is -- so if it's just that we don't like the content, 
outside obscenity, we -- Congress doesn't get to ban it. 
The answer is more speech.

 If you have got --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So we don't like --
we don't like human sacrifice, and so Congress passes a 
law saying you cannot have a channel that shows human 
sacrifice -- real human sacrifice.  You think that is 
unconstitutional?

 MS. MILLETT:  I think, if the point is that 
we don't like the could content, we don't -- we want to 
protect people from these images, the First Amendment 
says a lot about that.

 If it's a different -- snuff video, because, 

like child pornography, like I said, it's not the 
content that we are concerned about, where obscenity is

a pure content baseline.

 It is -- we got to stop -- we can't stop the 

conduct.  The conduct and the speech are inextricably 
intertwined.  The only way we can stop human sacrifice 
is to stop the image because the sacrifice is solely 
for the image.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, right, but, I 
mean, the hypothetical is we can't do anything about it. 
It is beyond our reach to stop the human sacrifice 
taking place wherever in the world, so that that 
argument -- the Ferber argument is off the table.

 In that situation, you think it's 

unconstitutional for Congress to pass a law saying there 
can be no human sacrifice channel.

 MS. MILLETT:  I -- I think the fact that --

I think it would be a lot harder under the First 
Amendment to say why Congress is doing that.

 If it's not something -- if it's not conduct 

it has any authority to regulate, I don't -- then the 
only compelling interest is -- I'm trying -- I mean, I 
don't want to watch this channel, and people should 
fight with their wallets and their votes and not support 
these things, but -- I'm sorry.

 May I finish?
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  Go ahead.

MS. MILLETT:  But, under the First 

Amendment, if the only rationale Congress is giving is 
we are here to shield your eyes for you, we will make 
this censorial decision, it has got to find some basis 
to think that was never freedom of the speech under the 
First Amendment, in the way that obscenity was.

 You don't get to make it up as you go along. 

We are interpreting a constitution.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.
 Mr. Katyal, you have three minutes 

remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. KATYAL:  There is one analytic move 

Congress made in Section 48, which is simple and 
obvious, and it explains why both the human sacrifice 
channel is constitutional, as well as Section 48 itself.
 That is the logic of Ferber.  When Congress 

tries to dry up a market for underlying cruelty by 
targeting depictions and leaves alternative mechanisms 
for that expression in place, the legislature has 
latitude.

 When the statute is not aimed at the 

communicative impact of the message, like the Hitler 
video, but, rather, is aimed at reducing underlying acts

of exploitation, that is an area which Congress has 
great leeway.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand.  Are 
you saying, since there is no human sacrifice in this 
country and no market to be dried up, the videos would 
be okay?

 MR. KATYAL:  I'm saying that, if Congress 

identified a market and if a video -- if the snuff video 
market was driving, somehow, people to get killed, 
Congress would be fully within its power to regulate it.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yeah; but we don't have any 

human sacrifice.  Nobody's doing that stuff.  So you 
could not proscribe the human sacrifice channel.

 MR. KATYAL:  That's precisely correct, but, 
here, Congress did find an overwhelming market in animal 
cruelty, and the State attorney's general that filed a 
brief before you saying that Section 48 is a success 
story, that it dried up 3,000 crush videos, that it has 
reduced the market for animal --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How many prosecutions 

have there been for crush videos?

 MR. KATYAL:  There -- there haven't been any 
prosecutions for crush videos, and I think the reason is 
because the market dried up very quickly after the 
enactment of Section 48.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Did I just 

understand you to agree with your colleague on the other 
side, that Congress could not ban the human sacrifice 
channel because there would be no connection between 
drying up the underlying activity?

 MR. KATYAL:  Oh, no.  If there is an 

underlying argument --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No. I'm saying there 
is no connection.  We can't reach the activity where it 
is taking place.

 MR. KATYAL:  I think that does start to 
reach into questions about obscenity and expressive 
impact on viewers, which is not before this Court. 
Congress is not resting its judgment here on something 
saying these images are repulsive and can't be seen.

 Rather, it is saying --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if Congress is --

and we will give you sufficient rebuttal time.

 So, if Congress is saying, Look, we just 

don't like what -- is being shown on the human sacrifice 
channel, we don't want people to see it, they can't do 
that?

 MR. KATYAL:  Again, that raises a whole 

different set of questions under obscenity and 
expressive impact that isn't before the Court here.

Now, if I could return to, Justice Stevens, 
you had he wasn't clear on the position on hunting.  I 
want to be very clear on this.

 Hunting, like the other hypotheticals, is 
not covered by section 48 for two reasons:  First, the 
statute -- the statute's term "animal cruelty" should be 
defined to encompass torture, mutilation and the like, 
and not simple acts of ordinary hunting, most of which, 
by the way, are legal anyway under animal cruelty.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  How about the statute's 

term, "kill" --

MR. KATAYAL:  And again --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- what should that be 

interpreted to mean?

 MR. KATYAL:  And again, Justice Scalia, as I 

said before, I think that comes within a definition of 
animal cruelty.  That's the term being defined.  And 
just as this Court has defined, for example, crimes of 
violence to exclude certain things that otherwise would 
be within the statute, such as drunk driving offenses in 
the context of the IMA, a similar result is possible 
here, particularly because of the doctrine of 
constitutional avoidance.

 And, so, we are saying that if this Court 

were to write an opinion that made clear that these

things are outside of the purview of section 48, there 
would be no chilling effect, and you wouldn't have to --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Wait, I want to just be 

sure I understand you.  Even if the hunting depiction is 
very offensive and cruel and all the rest, and that the 
cruelty to the animal using bow and arrows or knives or 
something, you say it's not -- and even if it's illegal 
in this particular jurisdiction, you say the statute 
still does not apply at all?

 MR. KATYAL:  It would have to be for a 
reason of animal cruelty or something like torture, 
mutilation and the like.  So there may be certain 
hunting examples that fall within it --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But the hunting would 

never qualify, because the hunter's motive is benign; is 
that what you are saying?

 MR. KATYAL:  No, it has nothing to do with 

the motive, it has to do with what happens to the 
animal.  And, so, there could be images of hunting which 
are not really hunting, like the images in this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  If you shoot a little low 
and wound the animal, that is cruelty even though you 
didn't intend that.

 MR. KATYAL:  Justice Scalia, with all due 

respect, I think the images in this case and what

Congress was getting at was not shooting a little low. 
These are the most horrific images that you can imagine 
of cruelty to living animals.  And that's what 
Congress --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But what about your 

response to Justice Stevens on the hunting matter?  I 
understand Congress wasn't directed at --

MR. KATYAL:  And my point if those -- if 

there are those cases at the area -- at the gray areas, 
that is perfect for as applied challenge, but it's not 
what this Court -- this Court shouldn't be blessing the 
Third Circuit's decision to in toto invalidate an entire 
statute which has produced -- which has produced 3,000 
crush videos and the like.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel, 
both counsel, for very able presentation.  The case is 
submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
