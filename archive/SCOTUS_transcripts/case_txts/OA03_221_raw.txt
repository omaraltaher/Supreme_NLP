 CHIEF JUSTICE  REHNQUIST:  We'll hear  argument 

 (10:01 a.m.) 

4  first this morning in No. 03-221, Cheryl Pliler v. Richard 

5  Herman Ford.

 Mr. Roadarmel. 

Am  I  pronouncing  your  name

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. ROADARMEL, JR. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. ROADARMEL:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. 

 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

 In 1996  the Antiterrorism  and Effective  Death 

13  Penalty Act,  or AEDPA,  was enacted, which  imposed a  1­

14  year limitation period  upon the filing of  Federal habeas 

15  petitions  following  the  finality of  a  State  criminal 

16  conviction. 

17

 In Duncan v. Walker, this Court held that the 1­

18  year limitation period  may be tolled during  the pendency 

19  of  a  properly  filed  State  post-conviction  or  other 

20  collateral application, but  not during the pendency  of a 

21  Federal habeas application. 

22

 Despite that holding, the  Ninth Circuit in this 

23  case  concluded that  the  district  court's dismissal  of 

24  admittedly mixed Federal habeas petitions was improper and 

25  prejudicial because  the  district court  did not  provide 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

3 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  certain  advisements  designed  to  effectuate  the  Ninth 

2  Circuit's practice of stay and abeyance. 

3

 QUESTION:  Is  there some peculiar virtue  about 

4  the word advisements as opposed to advice? 

5

 MR.  ROADARMEL: 

No,  not  in  this particular 

6  situation, Your Honor. 

7

 We  believe stay  and  abeyance is  incompatible 

8  with this  Court's precedent, as  well as AEDPA,  for four 

9  reasons. 

10

 QUESTION:  Before we get  to that, do you  agree 

11  that some  kind of remedy is required here, warnings or no 

12  warnings, as  a result of the fact that what the judge did 

13  tell the -- the defendant in  this case seems to have been 

14  just affirmatively misleading.  He said you -- dismiss and 

15  then you can come back  when it was perfectly clear,  that 

16  -- that he  could never come back  that the time in  -- in 

17  all practical terms would have run.  Haven't we got to  do 

18  something  or hasn't  the courts  got to  do  something to 

19  correct that? 

20

 MR. ROADARMEL:  We don't believe that the advice 

21  was misleading or erroneous in this case. 

22

23

 QUESTION:  Well, is -- is there any chance -­

 QUESTION:  Well, is that  issue still open?  I 

24  mean, even  if you're correct on your premise that a court 

25  doesn't  have to  inform  a defendant  of  the statute  of 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

4 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  limitations, is -- is the issue of  possible misleading of 

2  the  defendant  open  on  the  remand  even  if  you  were 

3  successful? 

4

 MR. ROADARMEL:  No, we  don't believe it  would 

5  be. 

6

 QUESTION:  Well, shouldn't it be?  I mean, if -­

7  if we think that the  record shows there is some  evidence 

8  of misleading where the  defendant expressed concern about 

9  a statute of  limitations problem and was told it wouldn't 

10  present a problem,  when in fact it did -- it had already 

11  run -- you don't think that should be open on remand? 

12

 MR. ROADARMEL:  If that were the  case, perhaps 

13  that would be the situation  or perhaps that would be  the 

14  remedy.  That wasn't the case  here.  The  district court 

15  told Ford  that he  could refile  his petitions  following 

16  exhaustion  and  dismissed  the  mixed  petitions  without 

17  prejudice. 

18

 QUESTION:  But it wasn't without prejudice.  For 

19  all intents and purposes, he could never come back because 

20  the statute of limitations, as I understand the facts, had 

21  already  run  before the  case was  even dismissed  in the 

22  district court.  So he could never come back.  Therefore, 

23  without prejudice was surely misleading. 

24

 MR. ROADARMEL:  No.  Dismissal without prejudice 

25  merely means that the petitioner can refile.  It will be a 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

5 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  separate  issue as to  whether the claims  of the petition 

2  that he refiles will be considered on its merits. 

3

 QUESTION: 

Do  you  think  any person  in  the 

4  prisoner's position would  conceivably have understood the 

5  statement  as  you  have just  defined  the  term, without 

6  prejudice? 

7

8

 MR. ROADARMEL:  Yes.  I -­

 QUESTION:  I mean, maybe somebody who -- who had 

9  three  law degrees could figure  that out, but a defendant 

10  standing here certainly isn't going to understand that. 

11

 MR. ROADARMEL:  Well, that  -- that has  always 

12  been  the  procedure  when  courts  have  addressed  mixed 

13  petitions. 

They  have  always  dismissed  them  without 

14  prejudice. 

15

 QUESTION:  And they have always made a statement 

16  that was affirmatively misleading? 

17

 MR. ROADARMEL:  There is no statement  here, we 

18  believe, that was affirmatively misleading. 

19

 QUESTION:  I mean, we  -- we may agree with  you 

20  that  the court does not have to give warnings.  That's -­

21  that's a -- that's an open question.  But surely the court 

22  is -- is not free to make misleading statements. 

23

24

 MR. ROADARMEL:  Well, the court -­

 QUESTION:  We need to -- let me put it this way. 

25  Wouldn't any  defendant in his right mind, if he had known 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

6 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  that he could not come  back into court, that the  statute 

2  had run, at  least have said, well, judge, get  rid of the 

3  unexhausted claims so  that I  can at  least litigate  the 

4  ones which I have filed  in time and which are  exhausted? 

5  Wouldn't that have been the only sensible thing for him to 

6  do if -- if he had understood what you understand? 

7

 MR.  ROADARMEL: 

Not necessarily. 

A Federal 

8  habeas petitioner may believe, in fact, that his exhausted 

9  claims are  unmeritorious or  frivolous compared  with the 

10  claims that he wishes to exhaust in State court.  So there 

11  may be  circumstances  where a  Federal habeas  petitioner 

12  will  not, in fact,  object to  the dismissal of  even his 

13  exhausted claims or to the  -- the dismissal of an  entire 

14  petition. 

15

 QUESTION:  May  I ask you about  the unexhausted 

16  claims that have  to go first  to the  State court?  When 

17  Rose v.  Lundy was decided,  this problem  of time  didn't 

18  exist  because  there  was no  statute  of  limitations on 

19  Federal habeas.  Now that there is this bind, why isn't it 

20  appropriate  to  say  the stay  and  abeyance  applies not 

21  simply to the Federal  claim but to the  entire complaint, 

22  which is -- is the ordinary rule when there's a -- a prior 

23  action pending  or abstention?  Usually the -- the whole 

24  complaint just sits in Federal court till the State  court 

25  is through.  Why shouldn't  this, now with the statute  of 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

7 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  limitations,  the 12 months,  in the picture,  be the same 

2  way? 

3

 MR. ROADARMEL:  I think  there are two responses 

4  to  that.  The  first  is that  Congress  would not  have 

5  contemplated  that  procedure  because  Congress,  in 

6  incorporating section  2254(b)(1)  in virtually  unaltered 

7  form, would  have contemplated Rose v. Lundy's application 

8  in the way it had always been applied by this Court. 

9

 The  second  response  is  that  a stay  of  the 

10  proceeding under those circumstances would make sense only 

11  if the  claims that are being dismissed as unexhausted can 

12  be added back and would, in fact, be -­

13

 QUESTION:  So not added  back.  I mean, this  is 

14  the Third Circuit's solution, and I'm asking you why isn't 

15  that the simplest way to deal with this.  Nothing is added 

16  back.  Everything,  the entire  complaint sits in  Federal 

17  court while  the petitioner goes  over to  State court  to 

18  exhaust the  State  claims  and then  comes  back  to  the 

19  Federal court with  nothing to supplement.  The complaint 

20  is already there. 

21

 MR.  ROADARMEL: 

That procedure  guts  Rose v. 

22  Lundy and AEDPA.  Rose  v. Lundy would have absolutely  no 

23  meaning under that  procedure because Rose v.  Lundy never 

24  contemplated that procedure.  It contemplated the complete 

25  dismissal of a  mixed petition or, at  most, the dismissal 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

8 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  of unexhausted claims from a mixed petition. 

2

 QUESTION:  But coming  -- with  the ability  to 

3  come back,  which was not a problem then because there was 

4  no statute of limitations. 

5

 MR.  ROADARMEL: 

Well,  even  prior  to  the 

6  enactment  of  AEDPA,  refiled  petitions  would  not 

7  necessarily be considered  on their merits.  Claims could 

8  be  procedurally  defaulted,  for  instance,  and  if  the 

9  default was based  upon an adequate and  independent State 

10  ground,  the  claims  would  not  be considered  on  their 

11  merits, but would be summarily  denied.  So even prior  to 

12  the  enactment  of  AEDPA,  this  Court  contemplated that 

13  refiled petitions would  not necessarily be  considered on 

14  their merits. 

15

16

 But --

 QUESTION:  I mean, just  to elaborate on Justice 

17  Ginsburg's question,  what is  your answer  to her  point? 

18  Why  -- imagine  the imaginary  author of  Rose  v. Lundy. 

19  When I read this, I think they're worried about exhausting 

20  the State claim so the State will have a chance to pass on 

21  it.  All right.  Now,  what Justice  Ginsburg just  said 

22  gives  the State the chance to pass  on it.  What is it in 

23  Rose v.  Lundy that  cares whether  the way  you give  the 

24  State to pass on it is to  dismiss the whole thing and let 

25  them pass on it or hold it on the docket and let them pass 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

9 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  on it or call them  into your office, any other  thing you 

2  can think of?  I mean, what is  it in Rose v.  Lundy that 

3  cares how you give the State the opportunity to pass on it 

4  as long as they pass on it? 

5

 MR.  ROADARMEL: 

Because  Rose  v.  Lundy 

6  contemplates the unexhausted  claims will be  presented in 

7  State  court  first,  and  it  enforces or  promotes  that 

8  through what this Court has  referred to in Rose v.  Lundy 

9  as  a  rigorously enforced  total  exhaustion requirement. 

10  Now, if the petitioner can simply file a mixed petition in 

11  Federal  court without any  consequences either under Rose 

12  v. Lundy  or under AEDPA, what we will have is a situation 

13  where  petitioners  have  an  incentive  to  file  mixed 

14  petitions  in Federal  court instead  of  presenting their 

15  unexhausted claims in State court first. 

16

 Contrary to  this Court's  holding in  Duncan v. 

17  Walker that  AEDPA is  not indifferent  between State  and 

18  Federal filings, but promotes and encourages the filing of 

19  unexhausted claims in State court first -­

20

 QUESTION:  I guess  Rose v. Lundy could have 

--

21  could have  said  what is  now being  proposed  if it  had 

22  wanted  to.  I  mean, Rose  v. Lundy  could have  said -­

23  instead of you have to dismiss the whole thing, they could 

24  have simply said, you know, hold it in abeyance. 

25

 MR. ROADARMEL:  Yes.  And in fact,  this Court 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

10 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  has always disapproved of stays of -- of mixed petitions. 

2

3

 QUESTION:  So -- so you think -­

 QUESTION:  So,  of course, there was  no statute 

4  of  limitations in  place when  Rose  was decided.  There 

5  would have been no  point to put that in the  opinion when 

6  there was no statute of limitations in place. 

7

8

 MR. ROADARMEL:  That's correct, but -­

 QUESTION:  Well, presumably Congress knew  about 

9  Rose v. Lundy  when it enacted  AEDPA and didn't  indicate 

10  any change in Rose v. Lundy. 

11

 MR. ROADARMEL:  No.  And Congress certainly, if 

12  it  had  desired  a  stay  or  contemplated  a  stay  of 

13  proceedings pending  exhaustion, could have  put something 

14  into AEDPA that -­

15

 QUESTION:  Is  -- is there any  indications when 

16  they passed AEDPA, that the Congress was aware of the fact 

17  that  like  two-thirds  of  all  petitions  are  filed 

18  incorrectly in the Federal courts  because they don't know 

19  where to  go?  I mean,  these are not  legally represented 

20  people.  Is  -- I mean,  I'd be  interested in that.  Is 

21  there information  there that suggests Congress focused on 

22  that  and said, we don't want to  -- we -- we just want to 

23  -- is there or not? 

24

 MR.  ROADARMEL: 

There's  nothing  in  the 

25  congressional  record  to  indicate  that  as  to  what 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

11 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  individual Members of Congress had before them in terms of 

2  studies or other data at the  time AEDPA was crafted.  I'm 

3  not aware.  But the congressional  record doesn't speak to 

4  that. 

5

6

 But certainly Congress -­

 QUESTION:  Counsel, you're  asking  us in  this 

7  case to say that  the stay and abeyance procedure is -- is 

8  not a valid procedure. 

9

10

 MR. ROADARMEL:  Yes. 

 QUESTION: 

And yet,  it  didn't occur  in this 

11  case.  Here  Mr. Ford  chose dismissal without  prejudice. 

12  There was not a stay  and abeyance used here.  Why should 

13  we rule on that? 

14

15

 MR. ROADARMEL:  Because it's -­

 QUESTION:  I mean, it's just you're asking us to 

16  reach beyond the confines of this case in doing that. 

17

 MR. ROADARMEL:  Because the correctness of  the 

18  Ninth  Circuit's  advisement  requirements  can't  be 

19  adequately addressed  or  intelligently addressed  without 

20  understanding  what  it  is  they  promote  and  without 

21  understanding what the practice is of the Ninth Circuit. 

22

 QUESTION:  I would think it  would.  We  have a 

23  question  here  of  whether  some  particular  advice  was 

24  required, yes or no, and I don't  see how we get into stay 

25  and abeyance in this case properly. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

12

1

2

 MR. ROADARMEL:  Well, because -­

 QUESTION:  Six of the seven circuits allow it I 

3  know, but I don't see how we -- we get into it here. 

4

 MR.  ROADARMEL: 

Because  the  Ninth  Circuit 

5  majority  concluded  that  the failure  to  advise  in the 

6  manner in which they thought  was appropriate was improper 

7  and  prejudicial  because  they  assumed  that  had  the 

8  advisement  been  given with  regard  to the  dismissal of 

9  unexhausted claims as a  precondition to the consideration 

10  of a  motion to stay, that  Ford would have  dismissed his 

11  unexhausted claims.  And  in doing so, the district  court 

12  would have  been required to grant the motion to stay.  In 

13  fact, the majority  concludes it would have been  abuse of 

14  discretion not  to do so.  So it's inextricably  bound in 

15  the advisement requirement in this case. 

16

 QUESTION:  But  we could  rule, I suppose,  that 

17  the advice was unnecessary when  leaving open the question 

18  of whether the  stay and abey proceeding is permissible or 

19  desirable, whatever. 

20

21

 MR. ROADARMEL:  Yes, I believe that's true. 

 QUESTION:  And there's  also a second  question 

22  presented  about the relation  back.  I -- I  hope you'll 

23  take an opportunity to state your point of view on that. 

24

 MR. ROADARMEL:  Yes.  The Ninth  Circuit, after 

25  concluding that the  advisements that  were given in  this 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

13 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  case were  inadequate and  misleading, fashioned  a remedy 

2  for that particular  error which  it believed occurred  by 

3  way of applying rule 15(c)  of the Federal Rules of  Civil 

4  Procedure in a manner that no other circuit court has ever 

5  applied before.  In fact, three prior panels of the Ninth 

6  Circuit  itself  concluded that  relation  back would  not 

7  apply under these circumstances because there's nothing to 

8  which the subsequent proceeding can relate back. 

9

 QUESTION:  But  the Ninth Circuit did  that only 

10  because their  own precedents said all you can stay is the 

11  Federal claim.  You can't stay the entire petition.  That 

12  was the preliminary to doing this fancy 15(c) application. 

13

 MR. ROADARMEL:  Yes, but in doing so,  what the 

14  Ninth  Circuit  majority  did  was  have  a  subsequent 

15  proceeding relate back to a prior proceeding that had been 

16  dismissed and was no longer pending. 

17

 QUESTION:  If the Ninth Circuit decided or if we 

18  decided that  equitable  tolling is  permissible  in  this 

19  case, what -- what procedure should be  adopted to reflect 

20  that  rule?  I know that's maybe not -- not your position, 

21  but if that -- if that were  the holding, how -- how would 

22  that work?  And -- and how  is that  any different  than 

23  relation back? 

24

 MR. ROADARMEL:  Well, it's  -- it's difficult to 

25  say because equitable tolling has been applied differently 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

14 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  in different situations.  The Ninth Circuit itself applies 

2  it in a very different fashion than it was applied in this 

3  case.  I  suppose equitable  tolling could  be applied  to 

4  toll  the  limitation period  during  the pendency  of the 

5  first set of proceedings, the  1997 proceedings, up to the 

6  time  that  the  claims  were 

--  

or  the  petitions were 

7  dismissed as  unexhausted.  That  would leave Ford  with 5 

8  days  to  file  his  unexhausted  claims in  State  court, 

9  exhaust,  and  -- and  then  return with  those  claims to 

10  Federal court. 

11

 QUESTION:  Let -- let me ask you this  somewhat 

12  related  question.  You  look at  the records that  the -­

13  that's presented -- the petitions  that are presented  to 

14  the district courts through their magistrates, and they're 

15  bewildering.  The  petitioner really  restates a claim  in 

16  three  or  four different  ways  to  make sure  he's  left 

17  nothing out.  And  the -- the  district courts are -- are 

18  very busy. 

19

 Suppose you  have a sort  of Johnny-on-the-spot, 

20  prompt  attorney at -- at the  habeas level in  a Federal 

21  court and  he files on day one.  He  has got a year but he 

22  files  on day one.  The  district court just  doesn't get 

23  around to it until, say, the 10th month, and then it says, 

24  oh,  well, this  has -- this  has some  unexhausted claim. 

25  Any relief  for the  -- or even  on day  360.  Any relief 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

15 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  available there for the petitioner? 

2

 MR. ROADARMEL:  It  certainly wouldn't appear to 

3  be the case  under AEDPA  because AEDPA  doesn't toll  the 

4  limitation  period during pendency  of the  Federal habeas 

5  proceeding, and that's  very clear,  we believe, from  the 

6  statute  itself.  So an individual  filing a  petition in 

7  Federal court is  well advised, of course,  to ensure that 

8  all the claims are fully exhausted. 

9

 The Eighth Circuit in  Akins v. Kenney suggested 

10  that where  a  petitioner is  concerned  that any  of  his 

11  claims may be  unexhausted, he's well advised  under AEDPA 

12  to  present  those  claims  in  State  court  first  and 

13  accomplish two goals  simultaneously.  First,  he exhausts 

14  beyond  any  doubt, and  second,  he tolls  the limitation 

15  period during the pendency of that proceeding. 

16

 QUESTION: 

But 

--  

but  in  my  hypothetical 

17  district judge number one rules in a week.  District judge 

18  number two waits 300  days.  The petitioner is in the same 

19  position in either case in your view. 

20

 MR.  ROADARMEL: 

Yes,  because  I  think  the 

21  petitioner has to contemplate the vagaries  of any kind of 

22  judicial interpretation or ruling on his matters, and that 

23  may depend  upon the particular court.  It may depend upon 

24  the caseload.  It may depend  upon the particular  matter 

25  that's put  before the  court, the  number of  claims, the 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

16 

Alderson Reporting Company

1  complexity, and so on.  That's always going to vary in any 

2  case.  A petitioner who  files a one-claim  petition will 

3  most assuredly receive  a quicker resolution of  that than 

4  the  petitioner who files  a 200-page  petition containing 

5  hundreds of claims.  That's just in the nature of any kind 

6  of adjudication in any kind of court. 

7

 And that  has to be contemplated and anticipated 

8  by any would-be Federal habeas  petitioner because if that 

9  petitioner files a  mixed petition under AEDPA,  the clock 

10  keeps ticking during  the pendency of that  Federal habeas 

11  proceeding no  matter how long or  how short.  So, again, 

12  he's well advised,  as the Eighth  Circuit noted, to  file 

13  any  claims that he's  unsure about in  State court first. 

14  And  that's  what  AEDPA  contemplates,  as  this  Court 

15  concluded in Duncan v. Walker. 

16

 To allow petitioners to  file mixed petitions in 

17  Federal court without any consequences and -- and to do so 

18  in  the manner in which  the Ninth Circuit contemplates it 

19  here  and  in  other  cases  would  eviscerate  AEDPA's 

20  limitation  period  because,  as  we  point  out  in  our 

21  briefing, a petitioner  could well  file a mixed  petition 

22  containing only one exhausted claim, confident that all of 

23  his unexhausted claims  will be purged from  the petition, 

24  the remaining exhausted  claims stayed,  and those  purged 

25  claims, following exhaustion,  will be  added back to  the 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

17 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  State petition, no matter that they were  pursued in State 

2  court after the  expiration of the limitation  period, and 

3  they will be deemed timely by the Ninth Circuit. 

4

 QUESTION:  Well,  of course, that -- that would 

5  -- that may well be the Ninth  Circuit rule, but you could 

6  also have a stay and abey rule in which in order to -- to 

7  grant the petitioner time to  go back and -- and  litigate 

8  the State claims, he has to make a -- a showing first that 

9  there is  some reason to excuse his delay, in other words, 

10  a 

--  

a kind  of  an equitable  tolling  argument at  the 

11  threshold.  And -- and if -- if that were the requirement, 

12  then the  -- the scenario that  you just -- just outlined 

13  would -- would not be an objection. 

14

 MR. ROADARMEL:  Well, I think the  problem with 

15  that  approach,  first  of  all,  with  regard  to  the 

16  application of equitable  tolling to AEDPA, is  that AEDPA 

17  itself  doesn't  contemplate  the  application  of  such 

18  tolling. 

19

 QUESTION:  So  you're -- you're saying that 

--

20  that there cannot be equitable tolling under AEDPA? 

21

 MR. ROADARMEL:  It certainly seems foreclosed by 

22  this Court's holdings in United States v. Beggerly, United 

23  States v.  Brockamp, and Lampf v.  Gilbertson.  In  all of 

24  those cases, this  Court concluded,  in reviewing  Federal 

25  limitation  periods,  that  because the  statutes  contain 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

18 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  tolling provisions within them,  it would be inconsistent, 

2  incompatible  with  those  statutes  to  apply  equitable 

3  tolling. 

Congress had  spoken  as to  the circumstances 

4  under which tolling could be applied. 

5

 In Beggerly, in particular, this Court concluded 

6  that under the Federal Quiet  Title Act, equitable tolling 

7  would be inapplicable because there was already an accrual 

8  or  tolling  provision  built in  that  provided  that the 

9  limitation period did not begin to run until the plaintiff 

10  knew or reasonably should have  known of the claim of  the 

11  United States. 

12

 AEDPA  contains  a  very  similar  provision  in 

13  section  2244(d)(1), subsection  (D), which  provides that 

14  the  limitation period  does not  begin to  run until  the 

15  petitioner was aware of the factual predicate of the claim 

16  or claims through the exercise of due diligence. 

17

 In  Brockamp,  this  Court  commented  upon  the 

18  tolling provisions in the IRS tax refund statute and noted 

19  that  because  they  were  numerous  and  very  specific, 

20  equitable  tolling likewise would be incompatible with the 

21  statute. 

22

 AEDPA  also  contains  very  specific  tolling 

23  provisions, beyond the one that  I just described, tolling 

24  where there is  a properly filed State  post-conviction or 

25  other collateral application, tolling where, for instance, 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

19 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  unconstitutional State  action leads  to an  impediment to 

2  filing,  tolling where  this Court  issues a ruling  on an 

3  issue  of  Federal  constitutional  law  that's  made 

4  retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. 

5

 QUESTION: 

Leaving  aside  tolling,  you  said 

6  something I didn't  quite grasp; that  is, if you  allowed 

7  the Federal petition to sit while you went to State court, 

8  all this  is well within the  12-month period.  You're in 

9  State court, you exhaust everything there.  The statute is 

10  tolled during  that time.  Then  you come back  to Federal 

11  court and  you -- as  long as you're  still within  the 12 

12  months,  you're  okay.  It  doesn't  gut  the statute  of 

13  limitations.  It  just recognizes  that it's tolled  while 

14  you're in State court. 

15

 MR. ROADARMEL:  I'm sorry.  I misunderstood your 

16  hypothetical,  Your  Honor.  If  claims are  presented in 

17  State court,  prior to  the expiration  of the  limitation 

18  period, yes, they  will toll the  limitation period.  The 

19  problem  with  stay  and  abeyance  under  that situation, 

20  however, is that it actually  gives the petitioner greater 

21  benefits  under  AEDPA  than  he  received  prior  to  the 

22  enactment of AEDPA. 

23

 Prior to the enactment of AEDPA, mixed petitions 

24  in -- in certain circuits would actually, instead of being 

25  dismissed,  have their unexhausted  claims purged, and the 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

20 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  petitioner would go back to State court  and exhaust those 

2  claims. 

But  the purged  petition,  the  purged Federal 

3  habeas  petition,  would  go  forward  and  be  resolved 

4  expeditiously.  It would not be stayed. 

5

 And  that  I  think  was  the  basis  of  the 

6  plurality's  warning  in  Rose  v.  Lundy  that  where  a 

7  petitioner  chooses  that  course of  action,  he  will be 

8  barred from having  his refiled  claims considered on  the 

9  merits because they will consist of a second or successive 

10  application.  They will consist of a  second or successive 

11  application only  if  the purged  Federal habeas  petition 

12  goes forward. 

If it's  stayed, there  will  never be  a 

13  second or successive application relating to those claims. 

14  And that would, I think, vitiate not only rule 9(b) of the 

15  rules governing -­

16

 QUESTION:  Are you now questioning the propriety 

17  of -- let's just stick with  the Rose v. Lundy the way  it 

18  was.  You have  the Federal  claim and the  State claims. 

19  You lop off the State claims.  Are  you saying the Federal 

20  court can't say, well, I'm going to let this Federal claim 

21  sit until the State is  through?  Why should I  adjudicate 

22  it?  Maybe he'll prevail on some claim in the State court. 

23

 MR.  ROADARMEL: 

Well, this  Court  has  never 

24  intimated that that wouldn't be  an appropriate procedure. 

25  In fact, under Rose v. Lundy, in -­

21 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

2

 QUESTION:  That it would or wouldn't? 

 MR.  ROADARMEL: 

It  would  not. 

In 

--  

in 

3  McCleskey v. Zant, when this Court  talked about second or 

4  successive  applications  and  abuse  of  the  writ,  it 

5  contemplated or  presumed that that  procedure if followed 

6  under  Rose v.  Lundy would lead  to those  refiled claims 

7  constituting second or successive applications. 

8

 QUESTION:  So  are you  saying that the  Federal 

9  court  would have no  choice under  the -- we'll  keep the 

10  Federal claim in Federal court,  no choice but to go  full 

11  steam ahead on that claim? 

12

 MR.  ROADARMEL: 

I  think  so  because  to  do 

13  otherwise would be  inconsistent with Rose v.  Lundy, rule 

14  9(b), but it would also be inconsistent with AEDPA because 

15  AEDPA contains a provision in  section 2244(b)(1) of title 

16  28 of the United States Code that requires claims that are 

17  dismissed  from  an initial  petition  and submitted  as a 

18  second or successive application to be dismissed. 

19

 If we're  always going to  stay mixed petitions, 

20  pending  the  exhaustion  of  even  timely  presented 

21  unexhausted claims, it certainly leads  one to wonder what 

22  the purpose  of section  2244(b)(1) would be.  That  also 

23  appears  to contemplate  what the  plurality suggested  in 

24  Rose  v. Lundy,  which is that  the purged  Federal habeas 

25  petition goes  full speed  ahead, to  use your  words, and 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

22 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  that it's not, in fact, stayed. 

2

 To stay the Federal  habeas petition under those 

3  circumstances  would  also  result  in  delay,  which  is 

4  something that is inimical to AEDPA.  As a number of lower 

5  courts have  pointed out, one  of the primary  purposes of 

6  AEDPA is to tighten the Federal habeas process. 

7

 QUESTION:  Am  I wrong in thinking  some Federal 

8  courts did  that and after  exhaustion was over,  the case 

9  came back and -- with now the State claims added in? 

10

 MR. ROADARMEL:  No, you're not wrong in thinking 

11  that.  In fact, the Third Circuit in Crews v. Horn follows 

12  that particular procedure. 

13

 QUESTION:  The Third Circuit follows what I -- I 

14  suggested  to  you  might, in  this  post-AEDPA  world, be 

15  appropriate, that  is, to say we're going to stay -- we're 

16  going to let the whole complaint sit here. 

17

18

 MR. ROADARMEL:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  Not -- we're not going to lop off the 

19  State  claims.  We  just won't turn  to it  till the State 

20  gets finished. 

21

22

 MR. ROADARMEL:  Yes, that's correct. 

 Unless the Court has  any further questions, I'd 

23  like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal. 

24

 QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Roadarmel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA M. BASSIS 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 MS. BASSIS:  Yes, you are, Mr. Chief Justice. 

 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

 When  this  Court adopted  the  total exhaustion 

7  rule in  Rose, there was no statute of limitations for the 

8  filing of Federal habeas petitions, and a prisoner seeking 

9  to file a second Federal  petition, after fully exhausting 

10  State remedies, faced no time bar.  But AEDPA added to the 

11  mix a  1-year statute of limitations, which in many cases, 

12  such as Mr. Ford's, converts the choices under Rose into a 

13  complete bar on Federal habeas corpus review. 

14

 QUESTION:  Well,  isn't it  reasonable to -- at 

15  least  one  view,  to  think  that  Congress 

--  

we think 

16  Congress  legislates  in  the  light  of existing  law  or 

17  existing rules from  this Court, that that's  exactly what 

18  Congress intended? 

19

 MS. BASSIS:  No, I  disagree, Your Honor.  What 

20  Rose  said is that  a prisoner  be afforded a  choice, and 

21  that choice involves either proceeding on exhausted claims 

22  and deleting  the unexhausted  or dismissing  the petition 

23  without prejudice to a right to return. 

24

 No  one  ever  suggested  in  Rose  that  the 

25  petitioner would lose the right to have even his exhausted 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

24 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  claims  heard  on  the  merits.  In  order  to  avoid the 

2  exhaustion  requirement  from  becoming  what  would,  in 

3  effect, be  a trap for the unwary pro se prisoner requires 

4  nothing more than  adding a sentence to what  Rose already 

5  requires, a  sentence made  critical by  AEDPA, which  was 

6  nonexistent at the time of Rose. 

7

 There is no  need for  warning, however, if  the 

8  court issues a stay.  The lower courts  almost unanimously 

9  do so and endorse State procedures where the failure to do 

10  so would  result in a forfeiture  of the right  to Federal 

11  habeas review. 

12

 QUESTION:  Well,  if -- if you  say there's  no 

13  need for  a warning, then do  you think the  Ninth Circuit 

14  was mistaken here to require a warning? 

15

 MS.  BASSIS: 

No,  I  don't,  not  under  the 

16  circumstances  of this  case.  First  of  all, the  Ninth 

17  Circuit's stay procedure is somewhat unusual.  It makes it 

18  incumbent  upon  the  prisoner  litigant  to withdraw  his 

19  unexhausted claims  and then renew a  motion to stay.  So 

20  the  motion  to  stay  is  at  the  defendant's  or  the 

21  petitioner's election. 

22

 But  without  being  apprised of  that  peculiar 

23  procedure, Mr. Ford was not  informed as to his choice  of 

24  options with regard to amendment.  The only choices he was 

25  given  were  the  two  choices under  Rose: 

delete  the 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

25 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  unexhausted  claims  and  proceed  on  the  exhausted  or 

2  dismissal  of the  entire petition  without prejudice,  an 

3  option which was illusory at the time it was given  to him 

4  because of the running of the limitations period. 

5

 57  percent of  the  habeas petitions  filed are 

6  dismissed for want of exhaustion. 

7

 QUESTION: 

Were  there 

--  

were  there  any 

8  potential equitable  tolling arguments  open to  him other 

9  than based on the so-called misleading advice? 

10

11

 MS. BASSIS:  Well, I believe that there were. 

 QUESTION:  In  other words,  was it  absolutely 

12  clear at the time that he could not come back? 

13

14

 MS. BASSIS:  Well --

 QUESTION:  Do you agree he had no -- no basis to 

15  argue that he could come back? 

16

 MS. BASSIS:  Well, the issue  is that he  had a 

17  potential argument, but I don't know what Mr. Ford knew at 

18  that  time  in  terms  of  the availability  of  equitable 

19  tolling.  He certainly didn't  know about the availability 

20  of filing a  contemporaneous writ petition in  State court 

21  in order to toll the limitations  period.  Had he done so, 

22  most assuredly  he would  not have pursued  the option  of 

23  motions to stay, which he filed contemporaneously with his 

24  writ.  I doubt that he also knew about equitable tolling, 

25  statutory  tolling, or really  the statute  of limitations 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

26 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  and how  that was calculated.  All he knew  is that there 

2  was 1 year, and he filed in time. 

3

 But he also  did so  by simultaneously filing  a 

4  motion  to stay.  However, without -- or without knowledge 

5  at the time the court  made a judicial disposition of  Mr. 

6  Ford's petitions, that  he could  elect a stay  procedure, 

7  the  court -- he -- he merely  went with  the  option of 

8  dismissal  without  prejudice. 

That  decision  was  not 

9  informed absent further information about the availability 

10  of the stay. 

11

 QUESTION:  What should be the rule if the habeas 

12  petitioner files in  -- in Federal  habeas on claims  one, 

13  two and three, and those have already been exhausted?  But 

14  then a  week after he files in  the Federal court, makes a 

15  timely filing, he  says, my heavens,  I have claim  number 

16  four, and he  files that in  the State  court.  Does  that 

17  stay claims one, two, and three in the Federal court? 

18

 MS. BASSIS:  Well,  if it's  filed untimely,  I 

19  don't  know how it  would absent  a stay unless  the court 

20  granted a stay -­

21

 QUESTION:  So the court -- so the Federal court 

22  always has  to file a  stay when it knows  that claim four 

23  has just been filed in the State court? 

24

 MS. BASSIS:  No.  I believe that a court,  when 

25  it determines that  a petition is unexhausted,  may on its 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

27 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  own 

--  

has  the  discretionary  authority,  taking  many 

2  factors into consideration, to grant a stay on its own and 

3  delete the unexhausted claims. 

4

 QUESTION:  But the -- the Ninth Circuit opinion 

5  suggests  that  a  district  court  really  doesn't  have 

6  discretion.  It's -- to me it suggested that the district 

7  court had to do this. 

8

 MS. BASSIS:  Under  Ninth Circuit precedent, the 

9  -- the Ninth  Circuit believed that a district court lacks 

10  discretion to stay a mixed  petition.  I actually  believe 

11  that courts  have broader  authority than  what the  Ninth 

12  Circuit held.  The discretionary authority to stay is part 

13  of  the inherent power of the courts, and courts routinely 

14  stay  matters  pending  before  them  while  there 

--  

a 

15  determination of independent matters  relating to the case 

16  are being made. 

17

 QUESTION:  So if district  judge had advised the 

18  petitioner of the  Ninth Circuit  law, the district  judge 

19  would have been wrong. 

20

21

 MS. BASSIS:  I'm sorry.  Pardon? 

 QUESTION:  If the  district court  -- based  on 

22  what  you  say, if  the  district  court  had advised  the 

23  petitioner of what the Ninth Circuit law was, the district 

24  court  would have  been wrong, because  you say  the Ninth 

25  Circuit is wrong.

 MS. BASSIS: 

I'm not  -- I'm  saying that  the 

2  Ninth Circuit followed  its own precedent, but  I'm saying 

3  that the  power to  stay is  broader than  what the  Ninth 

4  Circuit  precedent  currently allows. 

I do  believe the 

5  courts -­

6

 QUESTION:  Well, all this -- all  this seems to 

7  me a  good argument that the  -- that the  district courts 

8  shouldn't have  to advise clients  of their rights.  It's 

9  the -- the job of the client to figure that out. 

10

 MS. BASSIS:  I believe  that that's  impossible 

11  without further  information regarding  the choices  under 

12  Rose.  The reason the Court ruled as it did is because pro 

13  se  -- 93 percent of the habeas petitioners are proceeding 

14  in  pro se.  Mindful of  the fact  that pro  se litigants 

15  require certain procedural protections,  the Court stepped 

16  in and said that ceratin advisements are required in -- in 

17  order  to 

--  

to  assure  that  there  is no  unwarranted 

18  forfeiture of the right to Federal -­

19

 QUESTION: 

But  it's 

--  

it  can  be  a  very 

20  complicated question to know what  time is left to make  a 

21  State  claim.  The  court is  often  not in  a -- a good 

22  position  to even know that information as required by the 

23  Ninth Circuit. 

24

 MS. BASSIS:  Justice O'Connor, I agree with you, 

25  but  I'm  not  advocating  that  the court  calculate  the 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

29 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  limitations period.  What I'm requesting is not -­

2

 QUESTION:  Well, the -- the Ninth Circuit ruling 

3  seems  very broad.  Are -- are you suggesting  that some 

4  lesser notification would be adequate? 

5

 MS. BASSIS:  I'm -- I'm requesting a  specific 

6  notification,  not  an advisement,  but  a warning,  and I 

7  believe that there is a  distinction.  But what I  propose 

8  that the circuit courts be required to give, where a mixed 

9  petition is filed,  is after the Rose options are afforded 

10  to  the prisoner, they  also be  told prisoners have  a 1­

11  year period,  generally  starting  when  their  conviction 

12  becomes final and  excluding the time  when a State  post­

13  conviction  application  is pending,  in  which to  file a 

14  Federal habeas corpus petition, absent cause for equitable 

15  tolling. 

Before deciding  to  dismiss your  petition to 

16  exhaust claims,  you should determine whether  your 1-year 

17  period has expired and, if not, how much time remains. 

18

 It  requires  no  additional  burden  for  the 

19  district  court to give  this kind  of admonition  or this 

20  kind of warning.  The  court is not required to  calculate 

21  the limitations period, and I  agree with Your Honor.  At 

22  the  time that this  decision is made,  the court probably 

23  doesn't have a sufficient record to make -- to undergo the 

24  complex  task  of  computing  the limitations  period  and 

25  making that decision.

 QUESTION:  If that's so -­

 QUESTION:  That's the problem -­

 QUESTION:  If -- if that's so, Ms.  Bassis, why 

4  do  you not  agree that  the  Third Circuit's  approach in 

5  Crews v. Horn is  the right one?  It's the  simplest, just 

6  to say you  don't have to tell the  -- the petitioner, you 

7  don't have  to read any particular  litany.  You  just say 

8  we'll put the Federal complaint  on ice while he goes  off 

9  to -- to the State court. 

10

 MS.  BASSIS: 

Well, I  agree  with  Your Honor 

11  completely.  And in fact,  I don't believe  that warnings 

12  are necessary if stays are  permitted.  In fact, it  would 

13  make the stays essentially superfluous, but a stay is -- a 

14  warning is necessary if there is no stay. 

15

 Now, one of  the cases  cited by the  petitioner 

16  Slayton was cited for the proposition that the court lacks 

17  authority  to  stay  a  mixed  petition. 

Slayton  is 

18  distinguishable in that, first of all, it didn't involve a 

19  mixed petition.  It involved a  singular claim.  And the 

20  State in  that case argued that the claim, the senility of 

21  the trial court judge,  was a matter, a  sensitive matter, 

22  exclusively of State  court concern.  So for  that reason, 

23  this Court  held that a stay  was inappropriate.  Yet, at 

24  the same time, it acknowledged --

1  the -- into the stay alternative, I -- I'd like to finish 

2  up  the -- the  advisement alternative.  This is  not the 

3  only situation in which pro se litigants would profit from 

4  some good  advice from  the court.  We  generally do  not 

5  require  the  courts  to  -- to  act  as  counsel  for the 

6  litigants, if only for the reason that they may give wrong 

7  advice, in which case you will -- you -- you will  have an 

8  equitable 

--  

an  equitable  claim. 

What 

--  

what  is 

9  distinctive  about  -- about  this  area that 

--  

that we 

10  should depart from that rule? 

11

 MS. BASSIS:  Because  of the  right of  Federal 

12  habeas corpus review.  This is  a very, very  significant 

13  right,  one  of the  last  equitable bastions  that remain 

14  available to  a litigant  to challenge  their State  court 

15  conviction. 

16

 QUESTION: 

Well,  there  are  a lot  of  other 

17  significant rights  that -- that pro  se litigants  bring 

18  before courts, and -- and I'm -- I'm just resistant to the 

19  idea  that,  in  addition  to  the requirements  that  the 

20  Constitution imposes to  give counsel to -- to litigants, 

21  we're -- we're going to add on  that a -- a requirement in 

22  some  situations that  the court  act  as counsel  for the 

23  litigants. 

24

 MS. BASSIS:  I understand.  However, this Court 

25  already requires advisements  in certain limited instances 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

32 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  in recognition of the fact  that pro se litigants'  rights 

2  require careful protection. 

3

 QUESTION:  Well, what is that?  I -- I  think we 

4  -- we do it where  it's necessary to assure, for  example, 

5  the -- the constitutional validity of a confession. 

6

7

 MS. BASSIS:  That's true, but this Court -­

 QUESTION:  But that's -- that's not a matter of, 

8  you know, legal advice as  to how you should proceed  with 

9  your litigation. 

10

 MS. BASSIS:  That's true, and that  constitutes 

11  an advisement as  distinguished from a warning.  However, 

12  in United States v. Castro, this Court did require certain 

13  limited  advisements when  recharacterizing  a motion  for 

14  relief. 

15

 QUESTION:  But  that was -- that was  when the 

16  court was doing something on its own. 

17

 MS. BASSIS:  True, and this  is -- this  -- the 

18  advisement  or the warning that  I'm requesting is done in 

19  order to effectuate the choices under Rose. 

20

21

22

 QUESTION:  Those are two different things. 

 QUESTION:  I  think it's  really  a -- a major 

23  departure from  -- from the -- the position that the Court 

24  in -- in common law jurisprudence has occupied.  It would 

25  be the  first time  that I know  of where,  not on  -- not

2  has to provide legal advice to  a -- to -- to an  indigent 

3  prisoner. 

4

 MS. BASSIS:  Well, in light of Rose v. Lundy, I 

5  believe that  the options  afforded are  misleading.  And 

6  this Court  never -- never intended that  those options be 

7  exercised  in a  manner that  would forfeit  the right 

--

8  result in a forfeiture of the right to Federal review. 

9

 QUESTION: 

How  do  you  know what  the  Court 

10  intended in Rose v. Lundy, other than reading the opinion? 

11

 MS.  BASSIS: 

Well, it  appears  that  -- that 

12  beginning with  the line of cases,  Rose starts a  line of 

13  cases. 

Two  other  significant  ones are  this  Court's 

14  opinions in Slack  and in Martinez which  affirmed a right 

15  of  return following  exhaustion.  And  it said  that that 

16  right  of  return,  where  the  first petition  was  filed 

17  without a determination on the merits because either -­

18

 QUESTION: 

But  that  was  an 

--  

was  an 

19  interpretation of AEDPA. 

20

 MS. BASSIS:  Yes, exactly.  But they were not -­

21  but the ensuing application was not deemed to be second or 

22  successive and it approved a right of return. 

23

 In  this 

--  

in  this  particular  case,  the 

24  operation of 

--  

the impact  of AEDPA  on  Rose v.  Lundy 

25  operates as a bar to the right of return in the  event the

Alderson Reporting Company

1  defendant files a mixed petition. 

2

 QUESTION:  Well, but it -- it certainly makes it 

3  more difficult for the defendant.  But, you know, Congress 

4  wasn't trying to make things easy for defendants in AEDPA. 

5

 MS.  BASSIS:  That's  true, but  Congress  also 

6  never prohibited the choices that have been afforded under 

7  Rose.  And in order to implement those choices, I believe 

8  an additional sentence  is necessary and is  made critical 

9  by the adoption for the first time of a 1-year limitations 

10  period in  order to ensure that prisoners do not lose this 

11  very important right to Federal writ relief. 

12

 As far  as the  operation of  the relation  back 

13  doctrine under  rule  15(c), I  believe  that that  was  a 

14  remedial device that  was adopted by the  Ninth Circuit in 

15  order to restore Mr. Ford -­

16

 QUESTION:  But there  wasn't a  second petition 

17  there to which it could relate  back.  I don't see how  we 

18  could possibly sustain that -­

20

 MS. BASSIS:  That's true. 

 QUESTION:  -- order of the Ninth Circuit.  That 

21  just came out of no place.  There wasn't anything to which 

22  it could relate back. 

23

 MS. BASSIS:  Unless, of  course, one follows the 

24  rationale  of  the opinion,  which  is that  the petitions 

25  should have been  stayed not  dismissed, and therefore  to

2

 QUESTION:  But  there wasn't  a stay order.  I 

3  mean, that  -- that's  just manufacturing  something.  In 

4  this case the petitions were dismissed. 

5

 MS. BASSIS:  That's true,  and other cases faced 

6  with  that  kind  of  situation  have  either  used  their 

7  equitable authority to  reinstate the improperly dismissed 

8  petitions  or have  used  the doctrine  of nunc  pro tunc, 

9  either of which would be available. 

10

11

 In any event, the Ninth Circuit -­

 QUESTION:  Well, why would  -- I mean,  have we 

12  sanctioned the use of, quote, nunc pro tunc, closed quote, 

13  in similar situations to this? 

14

 MS. BASSIS:  In Anthony v. Cambra,  that's what 

15  the Ninth Circuit used. 

16

17

 QUESTION:  I said have we. 

 MS. BASSIS:  No, I  don't believe it  has, Your 

18  Honor, and I believe the  reason for that is because  this 

19  is a relatively -- this case -- this is the first  case to 

20  have gone this far. 

21

 QUESTION:  But in any case, your client would be 

22  in  exactly the same position that the Ninth Circuit tried 

23  to put your client in if the Ninth Circuit had simply said 

24  a 

--  

a  mistake  was  made,  either  because  there  was 

25  misleading advice or  because there was a  failure to give 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1  the advice that we say  should have been given, and  we're

3  have been  in had there not  been that mistake,  i.e., put 

4  him back with a petition before the district court just as 

5  there was within the -- the 1-year period. 

6

7

 MS. BASSIS:  Yes, taking -­

 QUESTION:  So -- so  the relation back is simply 

8 

--  

well,  it's -- I  guess it's  one  way of  explaining 

9  something that the  court, on your  view simply under  its 

10  power to correct an error, could have done. 

11

12

 MS. BASSIS:  Exactly, Your Honor. 

 QUESTION:  On your view, Ms. Bassis, would there 

13  be  any  disincentive for  a  litigant  to  bring a  mixed 

14  petition, to come  to the Federal court  first rather than 

15  to go to the State courts, which is certainly what -- what 

16  AEDPA contemplates?  What -- what disincentive is there? 

17

18

 MS. BASSIS:  Well -­

 QUESTION:  What does he -- what does he have to 

19  lose by  just marching off to  Federal court with  all his 

20  claims? 

21

 MS.  BASSIS: 

Well,  first  of all,  he  loses 

22  precious  time. 

Most of  these  litigants  believe that 

23  they're 

--  

they've been  unfairly  convicted.  Many are 

24  serving  life  terms, and  they  want to  have  -- they're 

25  interested  in an expeditious  resolution of  their claim. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

37 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  They want  to do it right.  They  want to have their claim 

2  heard on the merits as  quickly as possible.  They're  not 

3  interested in  delay.  And so,  they would  not choose  a 

4  procedure  that would cause them to return to State court. 

5  It's not in their interest to do so. 

6

 QUESTION: 

Well, it  isn't  there -- in their 

7  interest, but they're not lawyers. 

8

9

 MS. BASSIS:  That's -­

 QUESTION:  And  they say, you know, I don't know 

10  which ones need exhaustion and which ones don't.  I'm just 

11  going to dump the whole  thing onto Federal court.  Won't 

12  that happen  in every situation?  And is that  -- is that 

13  what AEDPA contemplated? 

14

 MS. BASSIS:  I  don't think AEDPA  contemplated 

15  that -- well, in  fact,  I believe  AEDPA recognized  the 

16  possibility that mixed petitions would be filed. 

17

 And  indeed, the  exhaustion  requirement is  an 

18  extremely  difficult  one  both  for  lawyers and  pro  se 

19  litigants alike.  By the time a judicial determination has 

20  been made,  on average 263 days  go by after  that Federal 

21  writ petition  has been filed.  So you can easily  have a 

22  situation  where  your  pro  se  litigant  filed  well  in 

23  advance,  maybe  3  months after  the  limitations  period 

24  started, only the  -- to  find that  by the time  he -- a 

25  judicial  determination  is  made,  that  he's  failed  to

 QUESTION:  Would -- would you have a reason  to 

3  object to  a -- a modification  of what the  Ninth Circuit 

4  was  talking about?  And instead  simply of this  kind of 

5  automatic stay and  -- and abeyance procedure,  there were 

6  engrafted on it a further condition, and the condition  be 

7  that before  the -- the stay  be granted  and -- and  the 

8  petition kept in abeyance, the -- the defendant would have 

9  to  show that there was some good reason for or excuse for 

10  his  failure  to exhaust  the  -- the  unexhausted claims. 

11  That would  accommodate -- the reason  I raise it  is that 

12  would accommodate the -- the issue, at least in part, that 

13  Justice  Scalia is raising  and it would  address the case 

14  that your answer didn't address, and that is, of -- of the 

15  prisoner  under a  death sentence who  does not  want fast 

16  action  at all.  He  wants the  slowest action  possible. 

17  Would  there be  an  objection to 

--  

to engrafting  that 

18  further condition of  a defendant  must excuse failure  to 

19  the Ninth Circuit's procedure? 

20

 MS.  BASSIS:  No.  In -- in fact, I believe that 

21  that  condition  is  inherent in  a  court's discretionary 

22  authority to stay.  It can take into consideration  a -- a 

23  variety  of  factors,  including  whether  or  not  the 

24  petitioner has been diligent in exhausting.  The reason -­

 QUESTION:  Justice Souter is suggesting  that it 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

39 

Alderson Reporting Company

2

 MS. BASSIS:  I believe it already does, but I -­

3  I would have no problem with that. 

4

 QUESTION:  What -- what would be a good excuse? 

5  That I -- I didn't know enough?

7

 MS. BASSIS:  No. 

 QUESTION:  Would it  -- would  it be  an excuse 

8  that I'm  not  a lawyer  and  I didn't  realize I  had  to 

9  exhaust? 

10

 MS. BASSIS:  No.  I believe one of them would be 

11  that  I  didn't  receive  my  transcripts  from  my  State 

12  appellate attorney,  and I  didn't know  what claims  were 

13  there because I didn't receive the information.  The other 

14  -- one of the other reasons -­

15

 QUESTION:  He's bringing  the claim  in Federal 

16  court. 

17

18

 MS. BASSIS:  Yes. 

 QUESTION: 

How could  he  not know  the claim? 

19  He's  bringing  it  in  Federal  court,  and 

--  

and  the 

20  objection  is you  should have  brought it in  State court 

21  first.  What  possible excuse could he have?  I mean, the 

22  normal excuse  is going to  be, you know, I'm  just -- I'm 

23  just a simple prisoner.  I'm not a lawyer.  I -- I had  no 

24  idea I had to exhaust. 

25

 MS. BASSIS:  Well, for  example, a defendant may 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

40 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  have had a direct appeal,  but it doesn't mean that  other 

2  claims such  as ineffective assistance of  counsel claims, 

3  which normally must be raised in a writ, have been pursued 

4  at all.  This requires reliance on extrajudicial evidence. 

5  Normally  counsel,  at  least  in  California,  appointed 

6  counsel  in some  districts, is not  authorized to  file a 

7  writ petition without  express permission of the  court of 

8  appeal.  Very often those counsel  don't pursue that, and 

9  therefore  the  writable  issues,  the  -- which  rely  on 

10  extrajudicial evidence, have not been  developed, and they 

11  have -- those claims have,  therefore, not been exhausted. 

12  So  there are  a number of  reasons why a  pro se prisoner 

13  litigant  may find that certain viable claims, meritorious 

14  claims, have not been exhausted -­

15

 QUESTION:  Well,  I don't  -- I don't  certainly 

16  see that condition in -- in the procedure that the  Ninth 

17  Circuit has  adopted,  that it  -- there  has  to be  some 

18  justification for not having exhausted.  Is -- is that set 

19  forth in -- in the Ninth Circuit's procedure? 

20

21

22

 MS. BASSIS:  No, it isn't, but Your Honor -­

 QUESTION:  That's new to me. 

 MS.  BASSIS:  -- a stay is discretionary, and in 

23  deciding whether or  not a stay is  appropriate, the court 

24  takes into factors  such as  a petitioner's  dilatoriness, 

25  whether  or  not  they're  attempting  to  evade  a  time 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

41 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  limitation,  whether  or  not their  efforts  are  in good 

2  faith.  I believe  that these  are all  factors that  the 

3  district courts already are mindful of. 

4

 QUESTION:  But you -- and you disagree then with 

5  the Ninth Circuit which said, in effect, that it is -- the 

6  district courts don't have discretion.  They must grant  a 

7  stay. 

8

 MS. BASSIS:  No.  I -- I disagree with the Ninth 

9  Circuit's opinion that  it lacks authority to stay a mixed 

10  opinion.  I  believe that  all district  courts have  the 

11  inherent authority  to stay a mixed opinion.  And in fact, 

12  there's  considerable authority  for  it based  upon  this 

13  Court's own precedent. 

14

 QUESTION:  But perhaps you  and I don't read the 

15  Ninth Circuit's opinion the same way insofar as the -- the 

16  authority of a district court  to -- in its discretion  to 

17  turn down a stay application.  I thought the Ninth Circuit 

18  said that there was no discretion. 

19

 MS. BASSIS:  No.  I believe that what the court 

20  said, in a circumstance -- it  -- it -- I agree with  Your 

21  Honor.  On one  hand, it  appears to  speak in  mandatory 

22  terms.  On the other hand,  I believe that the issue that 

23  there  may potentially  be a  forfeiture of  the right  to 

24  Federal review  is a factor which the  district court must 

25  also take into consideration in deciding whether or not to 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

42 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  enter a  stay.  So it's just one additional factor.  While 

2  it did  appear that the  Ninth Circuit spoke  in mandatory 

3  terms, I don't believe it's mandated,  the -- the decision 

4  of  whether or not  a district  court should stay  a mixed 

5  petition. 

6

 And I believe  it also has authority  under this 

7  Court's decisions in Nelson and in Wade to stay an unmixed 

8  petition,  which I know  is not  the issue before  us with 

9  regard to this case. 

10

 QUESTION:  Can you  give us  any idea,  perhaps 

11  anecdotally, about the number of -- of times we have mixed 

12  petition arguments or questions about mixed petitions?  Is 

13  it 10 percent of the time, do you think, or 90  percent of 

14  the time?  I see them all the time. 

15

 The reason  I ask is you say  the district judge 

16  has discretion to stay and abey in every case.  This  is a 

17  -- a huge undertaking by the judicial system to make AEDPA 

18  work, and AEDPA was supposed to simplify things. 

19

 MS.  BASSIS: 

Well,  AEDPA  was  supposed  to 

20  simplify things,  but it was adopted 8 years ago and we're 

21  still litigating nearly  every sentence  of AEDPA.  So  I 

22  wish it had  simplified things,  but unfortunately, it  is 

23  not a simple statute to understand. 

24

 QUESTION:  Do -- do you  have any idea of the -­

25  the number of instances in  which there's an allegation of 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

43 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  a mixed petition? 

2

 MS. BASSIS:  I know that 57 percent of the -- of 

3  cases are dismissed for failure to exhaust. 

4

5

6

 QUESTION:  About 5 -- 7? 

 MS. BASSIS:  5 -- 7. 

 QUESTION:  And  is this in the  Central District 

7  or the California or all over? 

8

 MS. BASSIS:  I think it's all over, and in fact, 

9  the statistics comes from this  Court's opinion in Duncan, 

10  and I believe it's Justice Breyer's opinion where he cites 

11  to the statistics. 

12

 QUESTION:  I  think it was  something like -- I 

13  got it  from some official source -- said there were about 

14  two-thirds were actually filed in  the wrong court, namely 

15  the Federal court.  And I think it was 57 percent of those 

16  that were dismissed. 

17

18

19  what -­

 MS. BASSIS:  Right, for failure to exhaust. 

 QUESTION:  That's  where it  came from.  That's 

20

 MS. BASSIS:  So what I am proposing is that the 

21  Court permit  -- approve a stay of mixed petitions, but if 

22  not, that it gives a warning to pro se litigants about how 

23  the Rose choices  are effectuated, that it  gives the Rose 

24  choices and  then it  continues to  apprise the  defendant 

25  about the running  of the  1-year limitations period,  and 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

 QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Bassis. 

 Mr. Roadarmel, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. ROADARMEL, JR. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. ROADARMEL:  With the Court's permission, I'd 

9  like to make four brief points. 

10

 The proof is  in the pudding regarding  stay and 

11  abeyance and what we're experiencing in California.  We're 

12  experiencing greater  delays since the  enactment of AEDPA 

13  than  we  ever  experienced  before  because of  stay  and 

14  abeyance  and  relation  back,  particularly  in  capital 

15  Federal habeas cases. 

16

 We make mention in footnote 1 of our reply brief 

17  of a  capital Federal habeas  case pending in  the Central 

18  District Court of  California called Reno v. Woodford.  In 

19  that case,  the district court issued a stay of the purged 

20  petition on  May 7th, 1999  for the ostensible  purpose of 

21  allowing  the  petitioner  to  exhaust  his  State  court 

22  remedies.  To date, no State court exhaustion petition has 

23  been filed.  None is on  the horizon.  But under stay  and 

24  abeyance and relation back, whenever one is filed and  the 

25  claims  are  exhausted  and  added  back  into  the  State 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

45 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  petition,  those  claims  will  be  deemed timely  by  the 

2  district  court, notwithstanding  the  fact  that at  this 

3  point  in  time,  at  best,  they will  be  presented  for 

4  exhaustion  in State  court more  than  5 years  after the 

5  expiration of AEDPA's limitation period. 

6

 The second point is that Ford in this case  knew 

7  that  the 1997  petitions he  filed  contained unexhausted 

8  claims.  He admitted  as much  to the  district court  in 

9  connection  with our  motion to  dismiss those  petitions. 

10  That's found at pages  56 to 57 and 75 to 78  of the joint 

11  appendix.  Ford purposely filed mixed petitions.  He knew 

12  of the limitation period  as well because he  indicated in 

13  filings to  the district court that  he was in a  hurry to 

14  get his 1997  petitions in in  time so that he  would have 

15  them  before  the court  prior  to the  expiration  of the 

16  limitation period. 

17

 What  stay  and  abeyance  does  is  reward 

18  petitioners like Ford who file admittedly  mixed petitions 

19  knowing full well  the identity of the  unexhausted claims 

20  that  they're  asserting. 

If  they're  aware  of  those 

21  unexhausted  claims,  there's  no  reason  why  those 

22  petitioners should not  have and could not  have presented 

23  those claims  in State  court first,  and they  would have 

24  received a proper benefit under  AEDPA by doing so.  They 

25  would have exhausted the claims so the Federal court could

1  consider them on  the merits  conceivably if there  wasn't 

2  some kind of default  that was applicable, and they  would 

3  also toll  the limitation  period during  the pendency  of 

4  that State proceeding. 

5

 Ford was  under  the  misapprehension  that  his 

6  Federal filing tolled  the limitation  period in much  the 

7  same  way that  the  petitioner in  Duncan  was under  the 

8  misapprehension that  his first mixed petition  tolled the 

9  limitation period  in that  case as  well.  We know  from 

10  Duncan v. Walker that it does not. 

11

 Finally,  advice  regarding  AEDPA's  limitation 

12  period, to  be meaningful at all,  to be more  than just a 

13  meaningless gesture, has to rely on specific documents and 

14  has to provide specific information  that a district court 

15  is simply in  no position to provide  at the time  a mixed 

16  petition  is  dismissed.  The  only documents  a district 

17  court  typically has before it at  that time are documents 

18  relating to filings by the petitioner in the State supreme 

19  court.  The  allegations contained in those  documents are 

20  then compared  against  the  allegations  in  the  Federal 

21  habeas proceeding for the  purpose of determining  whether 

22  the claims  are exhausted.  The court does not have before 

23  it the entire record of proceedings. 

24

 And  even  if  it  did,  there  are  certain 

25  circumstances that would warrant tolling that would not be

2  able to make  any kind of a reasoned decision  or give any


3  kind of reason or  correct advice regarding the  impact of


4  the limitation period on any unexhausted claims.


5

 Stay and  abeyance we believe  vitiates AEDPA by


6  rendering  largely  irrelevant  the  limitation  period,


7  rendering  the  State  court  tolling  provision  near


8  surplusage, and in effect, encouraging petitioners to file


9  mixed  petitions in  Federal court  instead of  presenting


10  their unexhausted claims in State court first.
