 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 
this afternoon in Case 08-969, Hemi Group v. The City of 
New York.

 Mr. Barnhouse.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDOLPH H. BARNHOUSE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 Possessory and use taxes are extremely 

difficult to collect, even under the best of 
circumstances.  Indeed, here the city alleges in its 
second amended complaint that it only collected 40 cents 
on the dollar, and its response claims a collection rate 
of 55 cents on the dollar.  Yet it wants to collect 300 
cents on the dollar from my clients, who never owed 
these taxes in the first place.

 The Respondent City of New York alleged two 

RICO claims and pendent State law violations that the 
city said resulted in a lost sovereign opportunity to 
collect cigarette possessory taxes from its city 
residents.  The alleged lost opportunity to tax was 
based on claims that my clients and 50 other defendants 
in four consolidated cases did not send names of

customers to the State of New York and had statements on 
their website saying sales were tax-free and no tobacco 
taxes applied.

 The Federal district court dismissed all 

claims.  The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated 
one of the city's RICO claims against the Petitioners, 
the Hemi Group and its sole owner, Kai Gachupin, and 
affirmed dismissal of the city's other RICO and its 
common law fraud claims.

 Yet reinstating the one RICO claim was 

improper because the city does not have standing to sue, 
based on the injuries that it has alleged.  It does not 
have standing because the city's claim that it lost the 
sovereign opportunity to tax is not an injury to -- to 
business, and it's not an injury to property.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why -- why isn't the 

money property?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Money in the bank would be 
property, Mr. Chief Justice Roberts, but an opportunity 
to collect money is an inchoate interest, and so it 
would not be property at that point.  It would be the 
opportunity to collect it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, isn't a 

lawsuit with a potential recovery regarded as property 
of an individual?

MR. BARNHOUSE:  The lawsuit would be -- the 

lawsuit itself would be property, but the -- but any 
recovery would not be property until it became choate, 
until there was an amount of money assigned to it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  There is no such 

adjective -- I know we have used it, but there is no 
such adjective as "choate."  There is "inchoate," but 
the opposite of "inchoate" is not "choate."

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  All right.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Any more than the -- I 

don't know.

 (Laughter.)
 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Well, I'm wrong on the -- on 

the --

"gruntled."

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Exactly.  Yes.  It's like 

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  But I think I am right on 

the law, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Exactly.  "Disgruntled" and 

the opposite of "disgruntled" is "gruntled."

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Is "gruntled."
 (Laughter.)
 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Well, it would -- it would 

be inchoate at the time the -- the city was just 
exercising its opportunity to tax, but had not -- or

exercising its sovereign right to tax, but had not yet 
assessed the tax --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought the status of 

taxes owing for wire fraud purposes was settled in 
Pasquantino.  There it was a question of alcohol taxes 
owed to Canada.

 There were taxes due, but not paid.  So why 

doesn't Pasquantino settle at least the property 
question that taxes owed to a sovereign qualify as 
property?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Justice Ginsburg, 

Pasquantino, the holding there was -- it was a criminal 
prosecution by the U.S. Government, and it dealt with 
the term "property" in the -- in the Mail and Wire Fraud 
Statute, not the overlying 1964(c) requirement of injury 
to business or property.

 Moreover, it was the taxpayer who was being 
prosecuted, the person who actually had taken the liquor 
into Canada, not some third party that said, let me sell 
you the liquor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, there are certainly 

differences from this case, and it wasn't a RICO case, 
either.  But why would the determination of what --
whether an amount owed to a government qualifies as 
property, why wouldn't -- why would that answer differ?

MR. BARNHOUSE:  Justice Ginsburg, once the 

amount owed is assessed, once there's a determination of 
the amount owed --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There was no assessment 

by Canada in the Pasquantino case.

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  There was --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They said the -- the 

defendant was smuggling liquor into Canada and getting 
it there without paying the Canadians' exorbitant taxes.
 MR. BARNHOUSE:  The prosecution on the mail 
and wire fraud criminal -- well, criminal standing was 
not an issue there.  It was the U.S. Government --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we're talking 

about -- only about property, not standing or anything 
else.  And in Pasquantino, the Court said that a scheme 
aimed -- aimed at depriving Canada of money to which it 
was entitled by law qualifies as property for wire fraud 
purposes.

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Yes, Your Honor, for wire 
fraud purposes.  and the Court took a very expansive 
view of property in Pasquantino.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So why is this different? 
I mean, it's clear that "property" can mean that.  You 
acknowledge that it can mean the government's 
entitlement to money from taxes?

MR. BARNHOUSE:  For purposes of the -- of 
the Mail and Wire Fraud Statute, this Court has held 
that property can be for purposes of --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it can mean that.  Now 

why -- why should we say it doesn't mean that here?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  At the time, because of the 
overlying standing requirement Congress placed in RICO 
of injury to a person's business or property, and 
because of Congress's reliance at that time on the 
antitrust laws and the general understanding at that 
time that business or property did not include the type 
of sovereign interest in an opportunity to collect tax, 
as confirmed by the Ninth Circuit and this Court in 
Hawaii v. Standard Oil of California that this Court 
affirmed, where the sovereign opportunity to tax is much 
difference -- different from the actual collection of a 
-- of a set amount of tax that the government knows it 
has coming.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is the word "property" used 

in the antitrust laws?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Yes, Your Honor.  In fact, 

the -- I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What does it say?
 MR. BARNHOUSE:  The standing for purposes of 
the antitrust laws is injury.  A person has standing who

has been injured in his business or property.  It's 
exactly the same as in RICO.  In fact, Congress took the 
language from the antitrust laws, Justice Scalia, and 
placed it into RICO unchanged.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it -- and it's clear 
that for purposes of the antitrust laws, property does 
not include the government's entitlement to income from 
taxes?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Yes, Your Honor.  In Hawaii, 

this Court made it clear that --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  The Hawaii case didn't 

involve a claim to taxes.

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Justice Stevens, it was a 
claim of injury to the general economy, which included 
--

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right, and parens patriae 

for the community at large.

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Yes, Your Honor.  The State 
of Hawaii brought three claims.  One was its injury to 
itself; one was the potential class action; and then the 
parens patriae claim.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But none of them involved 

a claim to taxes.

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  It was my understanding that 
the injury to the general economy, the underlying claim

was that by losing that economic engine, that the State 
itself would be injured because of the loss to the 
economy and in its governmental functions.  The actual 
--

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but that -- that's 

something different.  This isn't just the general, you 
know, you hurt the economy and therefore you hurt the 
State.  Here, what they're saying is:  You caused people 
who owed me taxes not to pay taxes, an identified sum of 
money.

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Justice Scalia, it's not an 
identified sum of money.  They don't know -- they can't 
tell who owed the taxes, in what amount, whether any of 
those people were eligible for the exemption under the 
law.  It was inchoate.  It was not known.  It was not 
known who owed it or --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it might have been 

inchoate but still -- they would have to be prove that, 
I assume, in the litigation here, wouldn't they?  I 
mean, let's assume we let the litigation go forward. 
Wouldn't they have to prove what taxes were not paid?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  They would have to -- they 

would absolutely have to prove that for purposes of 
damages.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So worry about that later.

I mean, just because some of them might be difficult to 
prove or not provable doesn't mean that the rest that 
are very clear do not constitute property.

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  The -- the -- what they've 

alleged here is not that they've lost the taxes, but 
that they've lost the opportunity to tax.  Moreover, 
they should not be able to reach that point because the 
allegations themselves are that the injury is not 
proximate.  It is the city itself --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a different issue.
 MR. BARNHOUSE:  It is a different issue.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're going to talk about 

that one, aren't you?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  I was hoping for a smooth 

transition, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You've got it.
 MR. BARNHOUSE:  The -- the injury to the 

city is much like the injury in Holmes, where the city 
claims to be at the tail end of the chain of causation. 
They allege two injuries, sources of their injury.  One 
was that statements made on an Internet website somehow 
caused people who purchased cigarettes in New York City 
not to pay.  The district court described that source of 
injury as farfetched.  Those were Judge Batts' words.

that by not reporting to the State of New York, the city 
then did not receive information about which city 
residents purchased cigarettes, and the city could then 
not go to those residents who had not self-assessed, and 
--

JUSTICE ALITO:  Putting aside the fact that 
the Jenkins Act information would be sent to the State 
rather than the city, why -- how can you -- how can it 
be said that at this stage of the litigation that it's 
farfetched that having a statement on the website "No 
taxes due" is -- doesn't cause people to purchase those 
cigarettes for the very purpose of avoiding the taxes?
 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Well, Justice Alito, the 

allegations here are not that there were no taxes due. 
There wasn't someone waving a tea bag and saying, "Don't 
pay your taxes."  What the website's allegations are is 
that the sales are tax-free, and the sales were 
tax-free.  As the city points out, they -- it was beyond 
the power of the city to impose any sales tax on these 
transactions which occurred on the Jemez Pueblo in New 
Mexico.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is it, a user tax once 

it gets into the city?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Exactly, Justice Scalia. 

It's a possessory tax --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Like automobiles.
 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Pardon me?
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just like automobiles.  If 

you buy a car out of the State, you haven't paid the 
State sales tax, but if you bring it into the State, you 
have to pay a use tax.

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  That's right.  That's right, 
Justice Scalia, and the obligation to pay that tax is on 
the person who brings the car into the State.  The 
obligation to pay the possessory use tax is on the 
citizens of the city of New York.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's all it was 

alleged that these websites said, "tax-free"?  They said 
"tax-free"?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  "Sales are tax-free."
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  "Sales are tax-free." 

That's very clever.

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  And "no tobacco tax."  Those 

are the two allegations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No -- "no tobacco tax"?
 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But there is a tobacco tax, 

isn't there?  Don't you -- wouldn't you call that use 
tax a tax on tobacco?

specifically not a tax on tobacco.  It's a tax on the 
possession of cigarettes and there are exemptions to it.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why isn't that just a 

question -- a substantive fraud question, rather than a 
proximate cause question?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  The --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Is it -- is it fraudulent to 
say "sales are tax-free" as opposed to, you know, saying 
no taxes are due?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Well, it has to do with the 

intervening, Justice Alito, with -- with intervening 
causes of the city's failure to collect these taxes.

 The -- RICO requires someone who has been 
injured in their business or property by reason of the 
alleged proximate act, and the fact is the city here was 
injured in its -- was injured, if at all, by reason of 
its citizens' failure to self-assess and pay their 
taxes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It was injured because it 

couldn't find its citizens because it didn't know who 
they were.  And that was the whole idea of the Jenkins 
Act, was to help States find the people who were evading 
the payment of the use tax on the cigarettes.

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  The 

Jenkins Act was -- was focused on allowing States to

help find those, and the city is therefore outside the 
zone of interest.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, suppose -- suppose 
you had a case in which an individual that lives in New 
York goes to a person with a supply of cigarettes 
outside the State and says:  I want to buy a lot of 
cigarettes and I don't want to pay taxes; can you help 
me?  And they agree on an arrangement to ship, to ship 
the cigarettes.

 Is there proximate cause?  Is it there if 

the city sues for injury in that hypothetical case? 
Would you say there's no proximate cause?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  I would say that there is no 

proximate cause for a lawsuit under RICO against the 
seller who the person went to and said:  My goal here is 
not to pay taxes; can you help me figure out a way to 
get them into the city in a way that I don't have to?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you think the city --
and you think the city cannot show proximate cause in a 
suit for its injury against the seller of the 
cigarettes?  You think there's no proximate cause in 
that hypothetical case?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Yes, Your Honor, I would say 

that there would be an intervening, Justice Kennedy, 
there would be the intervening cause of the person's

decision.  It's -- it's beyond the first step.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Even though those are the 
only two people that have made the arrangement, and that 
was the whole purpose and intent of the arrangement? 
And you still say there's no proximate cause?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Your Honor, the intent to 

injure, even if specific, as the Court held in 
Associated General Contractors, is not itself sufficient 
to change -- to give someone standing under RICO.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does your answer to 
Justice Kennedy depend upon a notion that the causation 
standard as -- in RICO is different than general 
proximate cause standards in tort law?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  No, Your Honor, because I 

believe that the proximate cause standard that the Court 
has adopted rests at its core in proximate cause 
analysis in tort law.  When the Court first started 
applying proximate cause requirements in the antitrust 
law and in RICO, it was looking at, as I understand it, 
the -- the common law analysis of proximate cause, 
and -- and it really discussed the elements of that 
quite clearly in the Associated General Contractors case 
where it talks about five or six factors that the Court 
has to look at, those factors being the nature of the 
plaintiff's alleged injury, is it -- whether it was the

type that the antitrust laws were intended to forestall, 
or here the RICO laws.  We would submit that it is not. 
It's an injury to a sovereign interest.

 The directness of the injury.  Here the 

injury is indirect.  It either comes -- flows through 
the citizens who didn't pay their taxes or through the 
State that didn't get the reports of customers in the 
city.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you go back to the 
question I had asked you and was not finished getting 
your position on.  Jenkins requires report to the State. 
You say the city was not within the zone of interest. 
But from the point of view of the sellers, the 
out-of-state sellers of cigarettes, my goodness, would 
they really want not only to have the burden of sending 
a list of names to the State, but to every county and 
municipality?  Isn't it the -- just as it is in New 
York, there is a working relationship.  The State gets 
all the names, and then it sends the names to the 
cities.

 You -- you -- I -- you're suggesting that it 

would be okay if the Jenkins Act had made it even more 
burdensome to the cigarette sellers by saying not only 
do you have to disclose to the State but also to any 
municipality that independently taxes cigarettes?

MR. BARNHOUSE:  Justice Ginsburg, Congress 
could have given the States power to share those lists, 
but it did not under the Jenkins Act.  And it's not 
clear that -- that -- even the agreement --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it -- we're told that 
New York City and New York State have a tax information-
sharing agreement pursuant to which the State does share 
this information with the city.

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  The -- the agreement, and 
it's quoted on page 6 of the response -- and I want to 
get this right -- says, Justice Ginsburg in paragraph 1 
of the quote, in footnote 6:  "Provided, that the 
disclosure of that information is permissible under 
existing laws and agreements."  And this is proprietary 
information.  These are customer lists.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, what do you do 

with -- what do you do with Justice Ginsburg's 
hypothetical?  I mean, she can pursue her own question, 
but I'm interested in the answer.

 Her question is, suppose the statute were 
amended so that the information had to be given to the 
city as well as to the State; would the case then be 
different, hypothetical case?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Yes, it would be different, 

because in that instance the city would be the --

would -- would as -- would -- would be the direct 
victim, would be within the zone of interest of the 
statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are there any sanctions for 
failing to comply with the Jenkins Act, just on its own, 
without having to go through RICO?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Justice Scalia, it's a 

misdemeanor violation and it has to be prosecuted by the 
U.S. Government.  Those -- that's the extent of the 
Jenkins Act.  And -- and the -- and what the city has 
done here, as Judge Winter noted in his dissent, is take 
the misdemeanor Federal criminal law and bootstrap it 
into RICO, seeking 300 cents on the dollar through mail 
and wire fraud.

 These sales occurred on the Jemez Pueblo in 
New Mexico.  And it's my client's position, and it's no 
secret, he says on his websites that he doesn't -- that 
the Jenkins Act, the scope of the Jenkins Act does not 
include his sales.  There -- there's a dispute with the 
city on that, but it's not even clear that the State had 
a right to get these names, much less the city.

 Yet the city is claiming because it didn't 

get the names -- and if it had the names it claims a 
recovery rate between 40 cents and 55 cents on the 
dollar -- it should be able to collect 300 cents on the

dollar from a business that didn't owe them in the first 
place.

 Because the civil RICO has a separate 

standing requirement separate from mail and wire fraud, 
as Justice O'Connor discussed in Holmes that it's not 
just the predicate act's standing requirement, but --
but the person injured in his business or property by 
reason of -- because Congress took this "business or 
property" language right out of the antitrust laws 
unchanged, the court in Hawaii interpreted that 
language.  The court drew a bright line.  It was a 
pragmatic line, a workable line, an important line, that 
that business or property did not include injury to a 
sovereign interest.

 The opportunity to collect taxes is a 

sovereign interest.  The taxes themselves, once 
collected or assessed, could be property, but not the 
opportunity.  The injury flows either through the States 
or consumers and, therefore, is not proximate.  These 
websites were not State-specific, much less 
city-specific.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you don't -- you 
don't think that proximate cause is satisfied only with 
respect to the person who is supposed to be paying the 
taxes?  If there's some way in which someone else

contributes or makes it feasible or makes it more likely 
that the person is not going to pay his taxes, that's 
not automatically outside the scope of proximate cause, 
is it?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  It wouldn't automatically be 

outside the scope of proximate cause, but if -- if it 
was action that made it more or less feasible.  But it 
would be unreasonable under this Court's decision in 
U.S. v. Boyle, where you -- where the Court held that 
you cannot rely even on an agent for purposes of not 
filing taxes -- it would be unreasonable for anyone to 
rely on language on a vendor's Internet -- commercial 
language on a vendor's Internet website to -- to -- to 
decide that for some reason they didn't have an 
obligation to pay.

 And these websites had language that said --

the city attached the -- the pages from the websites 
themselves to the -- they were part of the record, the 
RICO record.  I had those just a second ago and I can't 
seem to find them.

 But the -- the website pages for my client 

specifically had languages noted in the briefs that said 
these are not city-specific or State-specific, that --
that you need to contact -- you should contact your 
State officials for purposes of determining what your

individual obligations are regarding possession and tax.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How many people who buy 
cigarettes out of State come back to their home State 
and voluntarily pay the use tax?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  In the response to the 

petition, the city said it's a fraction, I believe, of 
the people.  They've also --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't there some exemption, 

anyway, for a couple of cartons?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  There is an exemption, yes, 

Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  For what, two cartons?
 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Two cartons of cigarettes. 

And -- but -- but it's clear that possessory and use 
taxes are a bear to collect for any government.  And the 
city here, as I -- as stated in the record, says even 
under the best of circumstances, Justice Ginsburg, it 
collects only 40 cents on the dollar, perhaps as much as 
55 --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it needs the names so 
it can collect anything.  Otherwise, how is it -- how --
how would it ever know?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  It would rely on its 

citizens to step forward and pay it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And they don't.

MR. BARNHOUSE:  And they don't.  And that's 

the intervening cause of the -- that's --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It would probably cost them 
more to collect than -- than it's worth the money, don't 
you think, to sue individual citizens after they get the 
names?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  It's a very expensive 

process, Your Honor, Justice Scalia, and it -- it's 
tedious.  You get the names.  You have to go through the 
names and write.  There's a cost involved in all that. 
There's a lot of friction in that entire process. 
There -- there are lots of reasons that, even when the 
city gets the names and even under its allegations of 
collection rates, Justice Ginsburg, very small, 40 cents 
to 55 cents on the dollar.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do we know if these 

Jenkins Act lists -- are they in fact maintained by the 
State?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  It -- it's my understanding, 

Justice Ginsburg, that the State would receive Jenkins 
Act reports from some vendors.  Those can come in all 
sorts of different formats, some of it just stacks of 
paper perhaps.  And it would be the State's 
responsibility then to go through those, select which 
ones were residents of the city of New York, and then

decide whether under existing laws it was even permitted 
to share this proprietary information with the city, 
before giving those to the city.

 It would then be the city's responsibility 

to take the list given to it by the State and decide who 
hasn't paid.  Then there's the exemption issue that 
comes on top of that.  And then go out and try to 
collect these amounts, which they allege to have done in 
at least two instances.

 Finally, the policy -- I'm sorry.  The 
policy that this Court adopted in Hawaii makes a --
makes very much sense, as recognized by courts who have 
looked at issues such as additional fire protection, 
payment of -- of public benefits, other instances where 
governments have come forward and under RICO tried to 
bring a claim to recover actual out-of-pocket expenses, 
overtime that was paid to police that had to monitor 
protests against abortion clinics, public benefits paid 
to people who were not legally in the country and 
working in agriculture.

 Governments have brought those and the 

circuit courts of appeals in both of those instances 
said those are injury to sovereign interests, citing 
Hawaii, and not the kind of injury to business or 
property that Congress intended when it adopted RICO.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Mr. Koerner.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD J. KOERNER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. KOERNER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 With respect to the definition of property, 

this goes back to Wyoming v. Oklahoma, where in an 
original jurisdiction case Wyoming sued the State of 
Oklahoma on the ground that the State's regulation which 
attempted to require Oklahoma coal-fired generation 
plants to use 10 percent of Oklahoma coal, and prior to 
the legislation all of Wyoming coal was used in the 
generation plant.

 Wyoming sued in this Court and the defense 

was that Wyoming didn't have an interest because it lost 
the opportunity to collect taxes.  This Court found 
standing and allowed them to sue and successfully 
challenge under the interstate commerce rule.  That was 
before we get to Pasquantino.  Justice Ginsburg is quite 
right --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  Did -- was 

there some statute at issue in that case which required

not just an interest, but an interest in property?

 MR. KOERNER:  No.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well --
MR. KOERNER:  The -- it was just -- I was 
just going to -- yes, it was just a discussion of what 
was the nature of Wyoming's interest.  Was it 
substantial enough to allow them to sue, challenging the 
Oklahoma statute.

 In Pasquantino, though, the issue was 
foreclosed.  In that particular case the issue of 
definition of property was the exact same issue that you 
have in the RICO case.  Indeed, mail and wire fraud is a 
predicate for RICO.  In that case there was, as Justice 
Ginsburg noted, a criminal prosecution based on the 
importation of alcohol into Canada from Maryland.  The 
charge was wire fraud.

 And first, there were two issues:  One, the 
revenue rule, which is not relevant here.  But the first 
issue was whether or not the opportunity to collect 
taxes which Canada lost, whether that was an injury to 
property.  And there was a long discussion by this Court 
equating the lost opportunity with embezzlement from the 
Canadian treasury and pointing out in the definition of 
Black's and the Webster's definition that property 
includes not only that which you actually have, but that

which you were denied the opportunity.

 In this particular case, the reason we don't 

have the taxes is because of the act of fraud as we 
allege of the defendant.  It's a little tough --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, because 

of -- because of what?

 MR. KOERNER:  The fraud of the defendant. 

It's a little hard to argue when you've created the 
situation so we can't collect that an inability to 
collect then becomes no property.  After Pasquantino 
this Court decided the Anza case, which I'll discuss for 
both issues.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Before you get to Anza, 

this might be a good time to ask because I don't think 
we focused on this in Pasquantino.  But if in fact the 
failure of a State to collect a tax is property, then 
why isn't every corporation that files an income tax 
return and makes two false statements automatically 
liable for RICO?  I mean --

MR. KOERNER:  As long as they meet the 

definition of --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that would mean the 
States have a new method, which I don't think they use, 
a new method of collecting treble taxes from anyone who 
makes two false statements or a false statement in two

income tax returns, and it would seem to me that would 
have vast repercussions.  I mean, it might be very 
beneficial; the States are having a deficit crisis; 
but --

MR. KOERNER:  If people --
JUSTICE BREYER:  How, how -- why would it 

not be --

MR. KOERNER:  Why would --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But they left -- they don't 

have the RICO predicate, not paying your State taxes. 
But in effect you would read into the RICO 
predicate protecting States.

 MR. KOERNER:  This is precisely what 

happened in Anza.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That may be, but nobody 

focused on this issue.  So -- so that's what's bothering 
me.  What is the -- what is the stopping place?

 MR. KOERNER:  If you're --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Or is there one?  And if 

there is none, how do we reconcile this view of --
they're suggesting a stopping place, Anza and 
Pasquantino to the contrary.  Right.  But they're 
suggesting a stopping place on a matter that hasn't come 
up.

 MR. KOERNER:  But they're suggesting a 

stopping place which is inconsistent with the actual 
language of the RICO --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So in your view 

California --

MR. KOERNER:  Well, may I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- which has a $10 billion 
deficit, could go through, find every instance where a 
corporation made two false statements in two tax 
returns, one in each, and collect treble what they're 
owed.

 MR. KOERNER:  If there is a systematic 
understatement under the statute, that's exactly --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It doesn't say systematic 

understatement.

 MR. KOERNER:  It says --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It says two --
MR. KOERNER:  Correct.

what Congress intended.  If you look --

JUSTICE BREYER:  If they did, then why 

didn't they put in not paying your State tax returns as 
a predicate act?

 MR. KOERNER:  Well, in fact what they put in 

in 1978 was the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, well, that cuts against 

you.

 MR. KOERNER:  No.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Because if they put in one, 

your theory -- they don't even need, whether they need 
that or not.  Your theory applies to every tax, every 
tax.

 MR. KOERNER:  Well, the reason they put it 

in was to increase the criminal penalties as well as 
recognize the civil penalties.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but go back to my 

question.

 MR. KOERNER:  The importation -- yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  My question is, forget the 
cigarette taxes.  If I accept your argument, am I then 
saying that California, New York, and every other State 
that's owed money by corporations in their taxes can go 
through, look for two tax returns that have a false 
statement in them that were mailed in, and thereby

collect RICO damages?

 MR. KOERNER:  Yes, that's correct.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that's a pretty 

far-reaching --

MR. KOERNER:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you know anybody, any 

court that has ever said that?

 MR. KOERNER:  Well, the issue hasn't been 

raised.  But the -- but the -- RICO has been 
consistently interpreted by this Court in an 
expansionist mode, and despite that Congress has not 
truncated it except in the one area of securities 
violation and only because they found that there were 
ample remedies in securities law, and because they 
thought it was inappropriate to use exclusively mail and 
wire fraud.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why would --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why should that help?
 JUSTICE BREYER:  If Congress wanted that 
result, why didn't they put in as a predicate act not 
paying your income tax or not paying your State tax?

 MR. KOERNER:  Because they had a more 
general definition, and they wanted the broadest 
possible interpretation.  But the Cigarette Contraband 
Trafficking Act was put into RICO as a predicate crime.

The sole economic injury in that act is lost taxes to 
the State and the city.  It's the only economic injury. 
It's hard to say that Congress didn't contemplate this 
when, in addition to the general definition, they put 
this in.

 In addition, the Jenkins Act was passed in 

1949 precisely for this problem, so it was on 
congressional minds.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but Congress said --

we were just told by counsel for the Petitioner, 
Congress said you can only -- only the Federal 
prosecutor can sue for violations of Jenkins --

MR. KOERNER:  Correct.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- not New York City, not 

New York State --

MR. KOERNER:  Correct.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- and it's a 

misdemeanor.

 MR. KOERNER:  Correct.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And now you -- you are 
saying the Jenkins Act gives you a basis to go after 
what are basically aiders and abettors of use tax 
violations?

 MR. KOERNER:  No.  What we're saying is the 
Jenkins Act is some evidence of the state of mind of the

defendant when he commits this fraud.  What we are 
saying is he is aware that he has an obligation to file 
reports with the State indicating both the identity of 
the seller and the identity of the purchaser.  Our 
predicate act is not Jenkins.  Our predicate act is wire 
and mail fraud.  Even if Jenkins did not exist, we would 
still have a wire and mail fraud cause of action based 
on the representations of the seller, which is that all 
the sales are tax-free.

 What Jenkins does through the cooperation 

agreement is it gives us the mechanism to collect these 
taxes when they're complied with.  If the defendant by 
active intervention does not file and instead advertises 
no sales tax required, he is preventing us from --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But do you know -- do we 

know that?  Do we know whether the Petitioner has in 
fact filed the Jenkins Act report with New York State?

 MR. KOERNER:  No.  We have -- we have 

alleged that he has not -- not filed one report with New 
York State.  Indeed, he has actively represented in the 
website that he has no obligation to file the report, 
and that any information that he obtains from the 
purchaser is confidential.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So I think that 

their response to the mail and fraud is, you're right,

it is all mail -- it is all mail fraud.  All these tax 
violations, in fact every one, you mail in your tax 
return normally.

 MR. KOERNER:  Correct.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So all of these would be 

mail fraud.  But mail fraud is not a treble damages 
statute.  And therefore the question is who will 
prosecute, State or Federal?  So normally it's State if 
it's a State tax.  But it's one thing to say Congress 
didn't care about that and quite another thing to say 
that Congress didn't care if the States were going to 
use this in order to collect three times what the taxes 
are owed.  And so they're looking for a way to cut off 
this tax liability for ordinary, simpleminded tax --
failure to pay your State taxes.  And that's why they've 
hit on this idea of the antitrust.  I don't know if 
that's a satisfactory idea.  I don't see the solution. 
I think I see the problem.

 MR. KOERNER:  But in the antitrust case in 

the State of Hawaii, the reason there that the State was 
not allowed to sue was not because of the injury.  It 
was not -- it was the directness of the injury.  This 
Court pointed out the fact that there was the 
possibility of duplicative recoveries, and the State of 
Hawaii was acting on behalf of the consumers.

Here, we have a direct injury.  The city was 

the only one injured as a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it was injured 

by the consumer's failure -- it was injured by the 
consumer's failure to pay the taxes.  That is an 
intervening cause.

 MR. KOERNER:  Correct.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, why shouldn't 

that be the end of the causation chain?

 MR. KOERNER:  Because it's -- while the 

consumer has failed, we are suing the seller because he 
set up the ambiance, the environment for the consumer 
not to pay.  It is his --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You're suing him for 

setting up the ambiance?

 MR. KOERNER:  Yes.  He is the one who 

created the fraud, by leading the consumer to believe 
they didn't have an obligation to pay.  We are suing 
based on impedence with the opportunity to collect 
taxes, where there are three parties to this 
transaction --

JUSTICE ALITO:  In order to -- in order

 MR. KOERNER:  Yes, and that's something we 

could establish at trial, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And you think you could 

prove that?

 MR. KOERNER:  Absolutely, because the 
response rate of individuals on their own when the 
Jenkins report is not filed is extremely low.  Yet when 
the Jenkins report is filed they do --

JUSTICE ALITO:  What -- what percentage of 
the -- of the residents of New York State or New York 
City voluntarily pay a use tax on their income tax 
returns for items that they purchase on the Internet?
 MR. KOERNER:  I don't know the answer to 

that.  I know with respect to --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Would you make a guess?
 MR. KOERNER:  Probably very low.  But in 

this particular --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So how can you call it -- I 

mean, part of the problem with calling it property is 
there -- there is such a low chance of recovery of the 
amount owed here.

made, you still have to -- have to assume that this --
number one, you have to assume that the State would turn 
the list over to the city, which the State isn't 
required to do.

 MR. KOERNER:  But we do have a cooperation 

agreement.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that may be, but the 

State isn't required to, and the State can terminate 
that agreement whenever it likes.

 But, secondly, after you get the information 

we have to assume that you're going to move against 
these people.

 MR. KOERNER:  If you look in footnote 8 of 
our brief, we point out, even in this case, when we've 
settled with parties and they've turned over the 
information we have been able to recover significant 
amounts of the taxes owed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does it -- does it 

affect your ambiance theory that the website has the 
language that your friend told us is on it, that you 
have to -- you know, this is -- viability varies from 
State to State or whatever the exact language is?

 MR. KOERNER:  No.  No.

MR. KOERNER:  When you look at the website 

and you have flashing lights that say "No taxes 
required," indeed we allege in the complaint that the 
entire business model is predicated on the fact that 
they don't have to pay State and city taxes.

 The wide difference allows for the profit 
for the seller and a savings for the buyer.  That is 
what we allege and, given the opportunity, we can prove 
that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could you satisfy Justice 

Breyer's concern -- and maybe the answer is not -- by 
saying that if there were a corporation that went around 
to California taxpayers and said, we have a way to avoid 
taxes, that then there would be a RICO violation, and 
that would be closer to your case?

 MR. KOERNER:  It would be -- it would be 
easier to prove, but I can't dispute Justice Breyer's 
fact pattern, that if you had an underpayment through a 
fraudulent return that it may be a predicate for RICO, 
and indeed --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well -- well, you're 
certainly consistent and persistent on that point.

 MR. KOERNER:  Yes.  That would be a better 

factor --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it -- it would seem to 

me -- it would seem to me that I gave you a way to 
differentiate this case.  And isn't that consistent with 
RICO because we have a very specific enterprise here?

 MR. KOERNER:  Well, I do want to reiterate 
the fact that, apart from the general language in this 
case, we do have this Contraband Cigarette Trafficking 
Act, which I alluded to earlier.  That -- that Act 
precisely deals with the problem of underpayment of 
taxes for cigarettes.  It was passed in 1978 and then 
amended in 2006 to include localities.  It has very 
severe penalties under RICO criminally.  It allows for 
fines and forfeitures.  But more important, you can use 
RICO civilly, and the only economic injury in that 
entire legislation is the lost opportunity to collect 
taxes.  So it's difficult to say that Congress was not 
aware of this problem, aware of its potential scope.

 And while I understand this Court's 

frustration, it seems to me, as this Court has said in 
many cases, including the last one, Boyle, it resides 
with Congress to change it.  If they feel there is a 
misuse of this legislation and suits are exploding out 
of context in terms of what they contemplated, then they 
should change it.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but the 

definition and giving scope and meaning to the concept 
of proximate cause is one that's in our bailiwick.

 MR. KOERNER:  It is, but if you look at --

Chief Judge, if you look at how you've applied proximate 
cause in the past in Anza, in Holmes, what you said is 
that there are other factors that are not associated 
with the unlawful act, and therefore you didn't want 
courts or juries to have to parse -- parse out 
legitimate business problems and illegitimate business 
problems because they become too complex.

 You don't have that here.  Here, you have 

direct injury to the city, and it's an easy calculation.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do we know -- you gave an 

instance in your brief or two instances of successful 
attempts to recoup from the taxpayer, that is the 
cigarette buyer.  Did those come about because the city 
received the Jenkins Act list from the State?  How did 
the city get --

MR. KOERNER:  In the particular cases that 

we mentioned in footnote 8, they were parts of 
settlements for the people who had, similar to this 
particular defendant, had advertised as tax-free, and we 
had settled with those people to get the reports, and 
then, based on the reports, we were able to track them

down.

 Where we get the Jenkins -- where people 
voluntarily disclose the Jenkins Act reports, we do 
follow up aggressively, but the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you follow up by 

writing them a letter and what your footnote 8 says is, 
when you wrote them a letter, about half of them 
coughed -- coughed up the tax.

 MR. KOERNER:  Correct.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They may have been the 

foolish half.  Did --

(Laughter.)
 MR. KOERNER:  No.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Were the other -- were the 

other half pursued by the city?

 MR. KOERNER:  Not yet, no.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not yet.  I don't --
MR. KOERNER:  But that -- but --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It can't be worth it.  It 

can't possibly be worth it.

 MR. KOERNER:  Here's what would be worth it: 

If we can stop the fraudulent practices that these 
sellers represent through the treble damages.  The only 
benefit that these Internet sellers have is the cost 
saving as a consequence of the tax saving.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why is what they're doing 

any different from what out-of-State mail order houses 
have done in -- they set -- they set up in States 
without a sales tax, they ship into a State that has a 
compensating use tax, that, apart from automobiles, I 
don't know is ever collected.

 MR. KOERNER:  Well, I would like to think 

that those out-of-State sales entities don't exist 
solely to try to deprive receiving States of tax.  The 
difference here is the entire business plan is based on 
not paying tax.

 Now, RICO has been in business since 1970. 
Your decisions have expanded its use.  As I indicated, 
there has been no attempt to restrict it in any way, 
and, indeed, despite --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that's 

because in every one of those cases, or at least in many 
of them, we kind of wring our hands and say, well, we 
don't have any choice, this is what Congress did, and 
we're faithful to that intent.

 But I guess, as I tried to point out 

earlier, this is a different question.  This is the 
usual judicial application of concepts of proximate 
cause, and I would have thought concern about how broad 
RICO was written and how broadly it has been interpreted

would cause us to look very carefully to the proximate 
cause question.

 MR. KOERNER:  But in the proximate cause 

equation, as you yourself have defined it, meaning the 
Court, you've talked about unlawful issues and lawful 
issues.  And as I indicated, where there's a combination 
you don't want a Court to weigh what's lawful and 
unlawful.

 But here our injury -- injury is solely the 

result of an unlawful use.  There are no intervening 
factors.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No -- I don't 

understand that.  The injury is directly caused by the 
consumers who don't pay the taxes.

 MR. KOERNER:  And I -- that's -- that's the 

way you frame it, I understand, but it can be equally 
framed by saying the injury is caused by the seller's 
misrepresentation, which encourages the purchasers not 
to pay taxes.

 And if you look at the websites, there is no 

doubt about what this --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So do you say then that 
proximate cause is in part established because of the 
specific intent?  Is that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'm glad -- I'm glad 

you said that, because the Associated Contractors said 
specific intent is not --

MR. KOERNER:  I know.  What I am saying is 
that, given the opportunity to prove this, we can show 
that the entire business model was intended never to 
have any taxes paid on these transactions.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But in -- in the world and 

in the lexicon of proximate cause, why is there 
proximate cause because this was the business model? 
How do I explain that in terms of proximate cause? 
There's not specific intent.

 MR. KOERNER:  There are no other intervening 
causes between the fraud and the injury to the city.  It 
is -- we lost an opportunity.  Look --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I know.  But there is no 
other -- take a case which was put to you as the seller 
who has many reasons for selling from out of State. 
They have a good catalog business, it's a 
well-established name, and so it's not just to avoid 
taxes.  How is that different from what happened here?
 MR. KOERNER:  Because in this case, they 

don't have any other reason --

proximate cause, how do you explain that?  It's not 
specific intent.

 MR. KOERNER:  The law of proximate cause in 
the case you described, you would have to consider all 
of the issues, some related to the transaction that 
you're suing on, some not.  If the mail order catalog 
could show there were other reasons for their sales, not 
attributable to the unlawful RICO definition, then it's 
the type of injury you don't want to make an inquiry to. 
But if you have --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Reason on whose part?  Some 

reason on whose part?  On the seller's part or on the 
New York buyers' part?  They will be -- the New York 
buyer is doing it because it's cheaper because he is not 
going to pay taxes on it.  But it seems to me the seller 
couldn't care less whether the buyer pays taxes on it or 
not.  So long as he pays the money for the cigarettes, 
the seller has gotten what the seller wanted.

 MR. KOERNER:  Except that the buyer -- the 

seller is advertising it as tax-free.  He's not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it's a mail order 

house and they put a little line on it, says:  By the 
way, if you live out of State, no taxes, no sales taxes. 
Then they're also subject to RICO prosecution?

because there may be other reasons why that mail order 
house is -- is successful, just like you said in Anza, 
just like you said in Holmes.  But in this case there's 
only -- it's the whole model.  There's only one reason 
why they're successful.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, maybe that isn't 

completely true.  Maybe it's a matter of convenience, at 
least theoretically.  You buy stuff over the Internet, 
you buy these advertised cigarettes, the price seems all 
right, and you don't -- whether you pay the tax or not 
is your decision.

 MR. KOERNER:  Except that the seller --

that's not the facts in this case.  The seller 
affirmatively represented that there are no taxes.  He 
told the consumer, and then kept the consumer's identity 
unknown --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, we were --
MR. KOERNER:  -- by deliberately not filing 
as required by Federal statute, and places us in a -- in 
the position in the circle of having no knowledge of who 
the buyer is, having affirmative misrepresentation, and 
we are the only one in this transaction who are directly 
injured.

MR. KOERNER:  The customers.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Usually you're not liable 
for misrepresentation unless it causes -- it's relied 
on.  You really think that the -- that a large 
percentage of the people who were getting this stuff 
really, really were gulled into believing that New York 
State was somehow being done out of taxes?

 MR. KOERNER:  Yes, because of the 

representation that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Really?
 MR. KOERNER:  -- they would never contact 

the State with any information concerning the 
transaction.  That's exactly what they did.  Everybody 
understands in the nature of these purchasing exactly 
what it's about.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I am sure the purchaser 
knows:  I'm not going to pay taxes, even though I should 
pay taxes.  But you're -- you're telling me that the 
only reason the purchaser doesn't pay taxes is because 
of this misrepresentation that you don't have to 
purchase -- you don't have to pay taxes.  I've known a 
lot of New Yorkers, and not many of them are that 
gullible.

 MR. KOERNER:  What I'm telling you, that 

it's probably easier to go to the corner store and

obtain a package of cigarettes than order it over the 
Internet.  What I'm saying, you have to look at the 
context of the facts.  The facts were affirmative 
misstatements by the seller.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But what if the seller 
didn't make those misstatements but just says -- the 
whole operation is set up exactly as this one is, but 
they don't have that statement in there; they just say: 
Get advice from your lawyer about whether you need to 
pay taxes or not.

 And what if that was the -- that was exactly 
the -- and then they all got the advice, and the lawyer 
says:  They'll never catch you if you don't pay it.

 MR. KOERNER:  I think it's a question of 

proof, and if we're able to show that these individuals 
thought it was tax-free, then we should be able to 
pursue -- let me just say, forget the Jenkins Act.  You 
have the Cigarette Trafficking Act.  That is within 
RICO.  That sole economic injury is loss of revenue to 
the State and the city.

 So if we allege the Cigarette Trafficking 
Act -- it was not applicable at the time of this case; 
it was amended to apply to localities slightly after, 
but if we predicated the case on that, would you still 
say there's a proximate cause issue when you have

Congress's express intent to allow that to be a 
predicate to the RICO count?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't want silence 

to be interpreted as acquiescence, but --

MR. KOERNER:  No, no, no.  It was 

rhetorical.  I wasn't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.
 MR. KOERNER:  I'm just trying to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just to get back at 
maybe the same point Justice Kennedy was raising, which 
is you're focusing on -- you keep saying:  The whole 
purpose of this, look at their website.

 But the issue is proximate cause, and if 

you've got to go through the individual consumer, it's 
either proximate cause or not.  And if the -- if the 
indirect nature of what they're doing because the direct 
cause is the consumer's failure to pay, it doesn't seem 
to me that their intent is pertinent.

 MR. KOERNER:  But we're seeking -- the 

injury is the opportunity to collect, which we've been 
denied, which is the Cigarette Traffic Act contemplates. 
Indeed, if you look at the legislative history of that 
Act, the sole purpose was to make it a very, very 
serious felony, and with civil undertones, in order to 
discourage the act as a disincentive, so that this

trafficking, which is a major problem, started to be 
reduced.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I'm -- I'm not sure. 
Let's talk about the contraband cigarette trafficking. 
I'm not sure that these people would be in violation of 
it.  It makes it unlawful for any person knowingly to 
ship or transport, also receive, possess, sell, 
distribute, or purchase, cigarettes which bear no 
evidence of payment of applicable State or local 
cigarette taxes.

 MR. KOERNER:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But there is no applicable 
State or local cigarette tax upon the shipment of these 
cigarettes.

 MR. KOERNER:  But if the shipment is done 

with the intent of avoiding taxes, which was 
contemplated by this statute --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not what it says. 

It makes it unlawful to knowingly ship it when they bear 
no evidence of payment of applicable taxes, and --

MR. KOERNER:  That's correct.  There's a 

question of proof.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- there is no applicable 

taxes at the time that they ship it.

legislative history, it was directly --

 (Laughter.)
 MR. KOERNER:  May I address the rest of you?
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why is it that you 

haven't argued -- why haven't you --

JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't see a difference --

would appreciate if you would tell me the difference 
between your argument as to this situation and the 
typical Internet site where I think a lot of people buy 
goods on the Internet, because they're convenient and 
also because they know that they're not going to have to 
pay State sales tax when they make those purchases.
 MR. KOERNER:  In those cases, you have 

established companies and you may have to look behind to 
see what is the reason; why are they at -- I assume they 
have other businesses that are legitimate.  This 
particular enterprise has no legitimate aspect.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why is that relevant as far 

as cause is concerned?

selling televisions, cameras, whatever over the Internet

you, "sales tax due," and if they have no outlet in the 
State, it says "sales taxes due:  Zero."  What is the 
difference between that situation and this situation?

 MR. KOERNER:  Well, first of all, in time, 
the Internet has raised many issues.  It's unclear how 
Congress feels about this.  We have legitimate 
enterprise.

 But cigarettes have been a particular focus, 

and I think, in effect, you cannot use the general 
argument as to the Internet, when you have congressional 
legislation which, one, under the Jenkins Act, was 
specifically passed in 1949 because of transactions like 
this, where States were -- were being deprived of the 
revenues through the interstate shipments.

 And you have the traffic -- the Cigarette 

Trafficking Act which is, again, an expression by 
Congress that they want these individuals to be put out 
of business.  That's exactly what RICO is about.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Judge Winter in the 

Second Circuit said the State appears uninterested in 
enforcing the Jenkins Act and may not collate or 
maintain accurate records of reports from out-of-State 
vendors.  What -- what was the basis for his statement 
that the State appears uninterested?

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RANDOLPH H. BARNHOUSE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 Justice Stevens, the city brought exactly 
that case, where one of the 50 defendants here was a 
defendant that didn't say sales are tax-free, and that 
case was similarly dismissed by the district court, and 
that dismissal was affirmed by the Second Circuit.

 Justice Breyer, in Illinois v. Fawaz, the 

States was going after $14,500 in back sales and 
gasoline taxes.  After having prosecuted the individual, 
they were seeking civil RICO damages, in that Seventh 
Circuit case, when the Seventh Circuit became the first 
circuit to say, we -- we hesitantly believe that the 
case could go forward beyond a motion to dismiss.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  On cause, why isn't it a 
causal connection for them to say, look, your clients 
don't tell them who's bought it.  They're supposed to, 
but they don't.  And if we got the information, we go

write a letter to the people, and half of them would 
pay.

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  That would be but for; But 

for your failure to give us the names --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.
 MR. BARNHOUSE:  -- we would have collected.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But why isn't that a direct 

applicant action, but for foreseeable?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  This Court said, in Holmes, 

that but for is insufficient.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  I know, but there is 

more here.  It is also foreseeable proximate cause.  I 
mean, it is absolutely foreseeable, not just but for.

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  This was an Internet 

website, Justice Breyer, that --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Forget the website.  What 

if there had been no website?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Was it foreseeable --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it foreseeable that, 

when they don't know who owes the money, that the people 
won't pay, but when they know who owes the money, they 
can write them a letter, and half pay?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  And is it foreseeable that 
no one will pay or that some will pay?  Some will pay.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Some pay.  Some don't.

They have the numbers there.  They get more than half.
 MR. BARNHOUSE:  It's -- it's foreseeable 

that some won't pay.  That's foreseeable, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you get half-treble 

damages.  What is that?  One-and-a-half damages.

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  But, at that point, it 

becomes speculative, Justice Scalia, and it's -- it's 
foreseeable that some won't pay, but it's also 
foreseeable that some people won't pay --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And, if you put people in 

front of railroad trains and half survive, then it's 
speculative?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  I'm sorry?  I didn't --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, if you put somebody 

in front of a railroad train and half survive because 
they jumped, does that make it a speculative cause?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  No, Your Honor, but, in that 
instance, I would be the one pushing the person, and not 
the one -- I would be the person, as in Pasquantino, who 
did not --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And you say it's 

foreseeable that they won't get a lot of money.  And 
that's what they're arguing?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Yes.

that?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  That it's foreseeable that 

they won't get a lot of money?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  The reason is because of 
what your clients did, so it's but for and foreseeable.

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  It's but for, and it is 

foreseeable that some -- some taxpayers in New York will 
not pay.  Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  End of case.  Now, we go to 

the damage section.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But for -- no, no, your 

response is, but for, plus foreseeable, is not a 
definition of proximate cause.

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  But it's not a definition of 

proximate cause.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You need more than that.
 MR. BARNHOUSE:  That, itself is not --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I took torts a long time 

ago.  I thought that was part of it.

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  What -- what the Court said 
in Associated General Contractors is, even if it's not 
only foreseeable, but that's your intent, but that--

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  There can be other 
things that cut it off.  Proximate cause.  Foreseeable. 
No kind of an event that would cut the causal chain,

like some odd fluke or something.
 MR. BARNHOUSE:  But --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No policy reason or others 

for cutting the chain.  I mean, it's Torts 1 in 1962, 
okay?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Isn't it -- well, I 

don't know, maybe it's more -- but isn't it a 
proposition that you don't rely on illegal conduct, that 
the -- the assumption of illegal conduct cuts the chain?
 In other words, there's only proximate cause 

if you assume people are going to not pay taxes that 
they're due, contrary to law, and that that breaks the 
proximate cause chain?

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  It -- if we assume that --

that the assumption that they will pay their taxes 
breaks the proximate cause?  I'm not -- I'm sorry --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, that you have 

to -- in order to maintain -- this is a helpful 
question.

 In order --
MR. BARNHOUSE:  Yes, sir.  That's why --

that's why I'm trying to understand.

 (Laughter.)

the chain of connection, I thought you cannot rely, for

one of those links in the chain, that a party is going 
to commit illegal action.

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's wrong.  I 

mean, at least for civil torts, you can -- there are a 
lot of cases where the landlord leaves out the bulb 
in the -- in the stairway and one of the residents gets 
mugged and he sues the landlord and wins, even though 
there is an intervening criminal act.

 Now, maybe what you want to argue is that 

that -- that has never been applied, to my knowledge, to 
either criminal liability or -- or penal provisions, and 
that maybe the -- an intervening criminal act does cut 
off causality, for purposes of penal statute, such as --
such as RICO.  That would be a reasonable argument.

 MR. BARNHOUSE:  That's a great argument, 

Justice Scalia.

 (Laughter.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And a good place to 

end.

 Thank you, counsel.
 The case is submitted.
