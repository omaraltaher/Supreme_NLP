 ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

12  remarkable.  They reflect the reality that the district 
13  court below lost sight of first principles.  The court 
14  repeatedly invoked the principle that these were only 
interim maps and not remedial maps, but that obscures 
15
16  the reality that a court has the authority to draw an 
17  election map, surely one of the most powerful judicial 
18  tools in the judicial arsenal, only if it is identifying 
19  specific statutory or constitutional violations or a 
20
21
22  says you can't draw new maps unless they've been 
23  precleared.  You can't put them into effect.

 MR. CLEMENT:  But --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, the only thing that 

substantial likelihood thereof. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Clement, section 5 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, 

when having to impose a remedial map to address what all 
concede is a one-person, one-vote problem with the 
benchmark maps, can look to the new maps which also 
remedy that same one-person, one-vote problem, for 
guidance.  And this Court in its --

1  exists is old maps until you get the preclearance. 
2
 I don't see how we can give deference to an 
3  enacted new map, if section 5 says don't give it effect 
4  until it's been precleared.
5
6  obviously, section 5 is clear that the new map drawn by 
7  the Texas legislature, the new maps drawn by the Texas 
8  legislature, cannot take effect of their own force.  But 
9  that doesn't answer the question of whether a judge,

 MR. CLEMENT:  Right.  We are -- in fairness, 
we're asking for it to be used as the starting point for 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Instead of starting, as 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you're asking for 
more than for guidance.  You're asking for deference. 
You're saying they have to start with the new map even 
though that map hasn't been approved. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  That's right, Your Honor.  We 

think they --

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Doesn't that turn
 

 MR. CLEMENT:  No, I don't think so, Your
 

Honor, for a number of reasons.  One is that the 

1  drawing the new map, but that's because --
2
3  section 5 on its head?
 
4
5
6  obligation to go to the preclearance court or to go to 
7  the Attorney General remains fully in place.  So, the 
8  only question is, what is going to inform the district 
9  court in Texas's exercise of remedial authority to 
10
11  remedial plans -- with the benchmark plans, rather? 
12
13  its reapportionment cases has emphasized the need to 
14  look for legislative guidance in order to inform the 
15
16  problem.  And the need to look to the new maps I think 
17  is most acute, of course, with the congressional maps 
18  because the benchmark is -- is a fine map, but it's a 
19  map for 32 seats.  And Congress here -- the legislature 
20
21  the new 36-seat allocation up.  And it seems to be quite 
22  odd that the court would simply ignore that judgment 
23  when it could look to that as the starting point. 
24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It didn't -- it didn't 
ignore it.  It took it into account along with other 

of Texas has spoken as to how it would like to divide 

remedy the one-person, one-vote problem with the 

 Now, this Court from the very beginning of 

judicial exercise of solving that reapportionment 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, as a 

 Now, I think, since the premise for the 

this proceeding.  And then the three-judge district 

1  plans.  My -- Mr. Clement, suppose the D.C. court that 
2  has exclusive authority over preclearance in 
3  mid-February denies preclearance.  And suppose --
4  suppose we accept your position.  You prevail in -- in 
5
6  court says this -- this plan -- these plans do not meet 
7  the section 5 requirement; we deny preclearance.  What 
8  happens if we use the Texas plan that has not been 
9  precleared as the interim plan?
10
11  practical matter, I suppose at that point Appellees 
12  would go to the court in Texas and say you need to 
13  revise your interim maps once again. 
14
court drawing its interim maps is that time is of the 
15
16  essence, it can't wait any longer, the Texas court may 
17  deny that motion or it may grant that motion.  I mean, I 
18  don't -- I don't really have a crystal ball to take that 
19  into account.
20
21  anomalous is let's suppose that the D.C. court does deny 
22  preclearance.  At that point, it's common ground that 
23  the plan, the legislatively enacted plan, even though 
24  it's denied preclearance, would be something that the 
Texas court would have to defer to.  That's basically 
25

 But what I do think is particularly 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 So, it's the oddity of the other side's 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I mean 

it's true that the Justice Department does raise a

basically Upham.  That was a plan -- there were two

3  position --
4
5
6  contiguous districts.  There was a problem with them. 
7  The Attorney General said the rest of it was okay.  Here 
8  the entire plan -- the plans are -- are opposed. 
9
10
11  purpose objection to the plans as a whole, but of course 
12  even that takes its force from the way particular 
13  districts are being drawn.  It seems to me quite likely 
14  that -- you know, obviously, our position is that the 
15
16  they were to deny it, it seems quite likely that they 
17  would deny it as to particular districts.  And then 
18  Upham would make clear that you would give -- that the 
19  Texas court would give deference to the legislative 
20
21
22  is you give less deference to a plan when preclearance 
23  is pending than you do when preclearance is denied. 
24
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I ask you a question 
25

D.C. court is most likely to grant preclearance.  But if 

plan. 

 And the anomaly of the other side's position 

about timing?  Let's suppose that the district court in 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

the district court in Washington has ruled? 

wouldn't that eliminate a lot of the problems that we 
are grappling with in this case? 

1  Washington moves expeditiously and issues a decision in 
2  mid-February.  Are there insuperable problems with 
3  postponing the Texas primary so that the plan that is to 
4  be used can -- doesn't have to be formulated until after 
5
6
 Texas has a very early primary.  Some States 
7  have them for congressional races in -- in the fall, and 
8  the latest presidential primary I think is at the end of 
9  June.  So, why can't this all be pushed back, and 
10
11 
12
13  two answers:  One is, as a practical matter, all of the 
14  affected, you know, entities in Texas have gotten 
together, and they've agreed on the ability to move the 
15
16  primary back to April, given -- on the assumption that a 
17  map could be in place by February 1st. 
18
19  from March to April already.  So, I can't tell you that 
it's impossible to move it again, but it's also quite, 
20
21  you know, in a sense -- I mean, the question becomes --
22  I mean, Texas has made its own determination that it 
23  wants to have a relatively early primary.  That's not 
24  something it cocked up for this set of elections.  It's 
25

had that in place since at least 1988.  And so, the 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Alito, two --

 Now, you know, the primary has been moved 

Official 

then wouldn't -- would you just prefer to limit us to 
those two possibilities or would Texas entertain the 
possibility of moving the primary back? 

1  question is how much do you want to interfere with that 
2  judgment? 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if we have a binary 
3
4  choice, if it's either the plan enacted by the Texas 
legislature or the plan that's already been drawn up by 
5
6  the court, yes, that could be presumably resolved rather 
7  quickly.  But what if neither of those is fully 
8  acceptable?  Then is it -- is it practicable to have the 
9  primary on the date that's been agreed on?  And if not, 
10
11 
12 
13
 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, look, Texas wants the 
14  Court to have the opportunity to get this right.  We 
think the decision below is profoundly wrong.  We think 
15
16  it's important for this Court to send a clear signal to 
17  the courts that would provide relief not just in this 
18  case but to future situations where this arose. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just one more question.
19
 MR. CLEMENT:  Sure. 
20
21
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Background question about 
22  preclearance.  Assume that the court of appeals -- that 
23  the three-judge district court in Columbia in the 
24  preclearance proceeding finds some problems with two or 
three of the districts, say, in the congressional plan. 
25

Alderson Reporting Company

words, does it give you a road map?  How do these 

One is that when the D.C. authority, be it the Attorney 
General or the court, denies preclearance, it denies 
preclearance.  The plan is not precleared.  There's no 
such thing as preclearance in part or partial 
preclearance.  As the Justice Department puts it, it 
doesn't work like a line item veto. 

1  Does it just say we -- there are problems with these 
2  districts, we therefore deny preclearance; or does it 
3  then give guidance and say we would give preclearance if 
4  you made the following changes?  Does it -- in other 
5
6  decisions work?  That's what I'm asking. 
7
 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I don't think there's a 
8  road map for the extent to which they give a road map. 
9  I think there are two things that are crystal clear. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  point.  That's not to say that the court doesn't provide 
18  reasoning for its decision, or the Attorney General. 
19  And that's why in Upham, for example, that the Court --
20
21  particular districts, even though the effect in Upham 
22  was to not preclear the whole plan.  And it seems to me 
23  the mistake of the district court is it effectively 
24  treats the un-precleared plan as a nullity.  And that's 
25

the exact word that Judge Johnson used in the lower 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 Now, that's not to say -- and here's the second 

this Court knew that the objections were to two 

Official 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But we've said over and 

the district court in D.C. that have exclusive 
jurisdiction over this set of questions and that we 
don't want courts in other part of the country to try to 
mimic what those -- what that court and the Attorney 
General are supposed to do.

1  court opinion in Upham. 
2
 And this Court reversed because it said no, 
3  you don't ignore that, but on the other hand, what you 
4  do is you take into account the judgment of the Attorney 
General in that case; but other than that, you take the 
5
6  plan into account notwithstanding the fact that it 
7  hasn't been precleared. 
8
9  over, Mr. Clement, that it's the Attorney General and 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  district court in the State of Texas to try to predict 
17  what they're going to do and to mimic what they're going 
18  to do.  And that's why Justice Alito suggests, well, 
19  look, if we've said that only the district court in D.C. 
20
21  until they do it and go from there. 
22
23  why we're -- we're not asking the regional court to 
24  mimic the D.C. court's function.  We're asking it to 
25

perform correctly the one -- one of the roles that this 

 And you're essentially asking for the 

and the Attorney General should do this, let's wait 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Kagan, here's 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 If you look at this Court's decisions that 

 Now, our position is quite simple.  If we're 

in a situation where the regional court has to provide 

1  Court has always made clear the regional court retains. 
2  And that's to provide temporary relief. 
3
4  essentially warn off a regional court from arrogating to 
itself the final preclearance decision -- I'm thinking, 
5
6  for example, of Connor v. Waller -- those same decisions 
7  say:  But this is not with prejudice to your ability to 
8  provide temporary relief. 
9
10
11  temporary relief, then it should apply the same 
12  standards that always apply everywhere to courts issuing 
13  temporary relief. 
14
15
16  section 5 itself operates as an injunction.  And it's an 
17  injunction against the use of an un-precleared plan. 
 MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Kagan, I think we are 
18
19  taking that into account.  I mean -- and I think that's 
at the heart of what's going on here.  You have to ask 
20
21  yourself the question:  What is the remedy that the 
22  Texas court in this case was trying -- what is the 
23  violation, rather, that the Texas court was trying to 
24  remedy?  The Appellees proceed and I think your question 
25

proceeds on the assumption as if the violation is a 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you're not taking into 

account the fact that, as Justice Sotomayor said,

violation with the old plans.  And so, the --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what they said 

1  section 5 violation.  But that's not what motivated the 
2  court's opinion, and you can -- I mean, look at page 96 
3  of the Joint Appendix, where the court specifically 
4  says:  Look, Texas has always been clear.  They need to 
get preclearance.  So, this is not about enjoining them 
5
6  from implementing the plan. 
7
 The constitutional violation that's being 
8  remedied here and the only thing that gave the Texas 
9  court any authority is the one person, one vote 
10
11
12  they're doing.  I mean, I count in the -- about eight 
13  times in the house plan, the State house plan, and 
14  several times in the senate plan where it's clear, and I 
think it's fairly clear in the U.S. House plan, they say 
15
16  things like:  "The court began by considering the 
17  uncontested districts from the enacted plan that 
18  embraced neutral districting principles, although it 
19  wasn't required to give any deference."  And you say 
20
21  embrace as many of the uncontested districts as 
22  possible." 
23
24  opinions, I thought, well, there may be a difference 
25

between what you say and they say, but I'm not sure that 

they're wrong about that.  "The court attempted to

1  there is a difference that's reflected in the maps. 
2
 And so, it's now January 9th.  We have to 
3  have something in effect by February 1st.  They said 
4  that they're paying attention to what the legislature 
did.  And when I looked at the maps, as far as I can 
5
6  tell, they include -- some more, some less, most in the 
7  State senate -- but they include a lot of the State's 
8  changes. 
9
can't tell whether you're right or wrong without looking 
10
11  district by district by district by district.  What am I 
12  supposed to do on January 9th? 
13
 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think on January 9th, 
14  Justice Breyer, you should take another look at El Paso 
15
16  County --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  In which -- in which --

1  district 16 or 17.  And that's -- those maps start on 
2  page 1. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  El Paso County in 
3
4  the original plan I guess was -- like number 16.  I've 
got it in front of me.  And they split it, and it was

20

22  does answer your premise, which is that all the court 
23  was doing was remedying one person, one vote. 
24

 MR. CLEMENT:  And in the court's plan --

I said, in their way of thinking, they are taking the

you point to district 16, and I say, very well, tell me 

1  map into account.  Now, to sit -- the enacted one.  If I 
2  disagree with that, I can't disagree at the level of 
3  principle; I have to disagree at the level of particular 
4  districts.  That's why I asked you the question.  So, 
5
6  what they did wrong and why?  Because, remember, they 
7  are facing a challenge that's based on section 5, part 
8  purpose. 
 And the district court there said, in the 
9
D.C., you don't survive -- I can't give you a summary 
10
11  judgment on that; purpose here may have been violated. 
12
 All right.  Now, you tell me what's wrong 
13  with district 16, which I guess is your strongest case. 
14  That would be helpful.
 MR. CLEMENT:  No, what I'm -- I'm not saying

11  and said we're going to solve a one person, one vote 
12  problem, nor did they start with the new legislative

14  change that plan?  They instead, as they told you, said 
that they were on their own drawing an independent map.

24  not to defer to the legislative enactment because it 
hadn't been precleared.  And the oddity of this -- I

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I'm not sure 

 The district court went back to the 

benchmark and said this is the benchmark district; now 

how I understand that, okay?  As I looked at one of the 

1  mean, look, you're right.  In certain places, they then 
2  turn around and say:  But we deferred where we could. 
3
 But the oddity of their position is their 
4  first premise, which is the one thing we can't do in 
drawing these maps, is look at that -- look at that 
5
6  un-precleared map.  There's no explanation for why -- if 
7  that premise was right, why would it be even a good 
8  thing that they were pointing to the other map. 
9
10
11  El Paso maps, the enacted map created a antler-type 
12  district, a head and two unconnected antlers on top, 
13  nothing tying them together. 
14
15
16  I'm going to draw the districts around it that fall 
17  naturally, trying to stay within neutral principles of 
18  not dividing up the city more than I have to.  And it 
19  came out with another district.
20
21  legal principle, the district court was violating that 
22  makes what it did with that particular county wrong. 
23  You're saying they should have given deference to an 
24  oddly shaped district that changed a prior benchmark 
25

that's been challenged as having been created 

 I don't understand what principle, what

principle they violated, other than the deference 

 MR. CLEMENT:  The basic principle they 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's your second --
 MR. CLEMENT:  You may be right.  You may be 

1  specifically to minimize the Latino vote. 
2
3  are very significant.  The district court has already 
4  denied summary judgment on that.  Tell me what legal 
5
6  principle that you're relying upon? 
7
8  violated is they drew an interim order that they thought 
9  wasn't a remedial order without it being based on any 
10
11
12
13  right.  There may be a problem with those maps in El 
14  Paso.  I don't think so, and I'd like to talk about 
15
16
17  know, there's a problem with this because the two - the 
18  two antler -- the deer with two antlers, that violates 
19  -- that's a substantial likelihood of violating the 
20
21  what they did, this would be a very different case. 
 Now, I do want to talk about the deer with 
22
23  two antlers, because what that ignores is that in the 
24  benchmark plan, the deer had one antler and an antenna. 
And so, the district court -- the map the district court

 But if the district court had said, you

 And so, I think that just shows that what
 
was going on here by the district court was something 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I had thought, Mr. Clement, 
that -- that one of your objections was that in deciding 

1  drew doesn't look anything like the benchmark, and
 
2  actually the map that the legislature drew looks very
 
3  much like the benchmark.
 
4
5
6  very different from either remedying a one-person, 
7  one-vote problem with the benchmark or from correcting 
8  specific identified problems with the legislative map. 
9
10
11  whether they're using the benchmark or the -- the 
12  legislature's proposed new plan, whichever one they're 
13  using, they -- in drawing up their own plan, they 
14  assumed the validity of all of the challenges.
15
16
17  Honor, and that is one of the many problems with the way 
18  that the court proceeded here.  Because once you lose 
19  sight of the fact that, look, we only have remedial 
authority if we're remedying substantial likelihood of 
20
21  violations that are identifiable and particular, well, 
22  then what are you going to do? 
 What this district court did, after he 
23
24  started where Justice Breyer suggested, is that the 
25

 Is -- is that not the case? 
 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, that is the case, Your 

district court judges then said, look, we want to avoid

 MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely no problem at 

1  the challenges that are brought by the plaintiffs.  And 
2  what they mean by "avoid" is they basically take all the 
3  allegations at face value and then redraw the district 
4  to avoid this.
5
6  don't have any problem -- if I'm a district judge and I 
7  think there is a substantial likelihood that a 
8  particular challenge will succeed, you don't have any 
9  problem with my drawing an interim plan to avoid that 
10
11
12  all --
13
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Thank you. 
14
 MR. CLEMENT:  -- Justice Kennedy.  And the 
great thing about that is that gives the district court 
15
16  a familiar role to play applying familiar standards, and 
17  it gives this Court something to review. 
18
19  that -- in that scenario is projecting what the D.C. 
20
21  that's why I find your -- your position troublesome. 
22  You're asking one court to make its best guess at what 
23  another court is likely to do, and that other court has 
24  exclusive jurisdiction.
25

court that has exclusive authority is going to do.  And 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the district court in 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Can I -- can I respond to

it's ultimately going to confront. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But haven't we also said 

General clearing a plan? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Section 2. 
 MR. CLEMENT:  -- or an equal protection 

1  that, Justice Ginsburg, as follows?  Which is, I had 
2  assumed that Justice Kennedy's question was not specific 
3  to section 5 and could just as well be a section 2 
4  problem --
5
6
7  under the Constitution problem.  And in this case, there 
8  is no problem.  All the court is doing is making a 
9  substantial likelihood determination of an issue that 
10
11
12  that, with respect to section 2 and constitutional 
13  violations, that those allegations would be unripe in 
14  the -- prior to the district court or the Attorney 
15
16
 MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely, Justice Kagan. 
17  But I think it's important to understand that to the 
18  extent that the district court in this remedial phase 
19  should take section 5 into account, it's just in 
considering whether or not the remedial plan is 
20
21  consistent with section 5 principles.  And that's what 
22  the judges did in this case with respect to their own 
23  plan.  So, we're not asking them to do something with 
24  section 5 that they otherwise wouldn't do.
25

 And, again, I think if you come back to the 

23
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 I mean, keep in mind, this Court has
 

legislative policy judgments reflected in the
 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, just because section 5 
says that there's no presumption of regularity attached 
to that plan and, indeed, that it's unlawful to put that 
plan into effect without the proper approvals. 

1  particular question of what are they trying to remedy --
2  I mean, they're trying to remedy the one person, one 
3  vote problem.  So, if that's what they're trying to 
4  remedy, why wouldn't they take into account the 
5
6  un-precleared plan if that's -- if that's the state
 
7  we're in, if that's the snapshot we're in.
 
8
9  throughout --
10
11 
12 
13 
14
One, I would beg to differ that what section 5 says is 
15
16  that there's no presumption of regularity.  And I think 
17  that's -- it's not just a quibble because I think if 
18  what section 5 says is that there's no presumption of 
19  regularity or no presumption of good faith, then section 
5 I think is closer to the constitutional edge than this 
20
21  Court said in Northwest Austin.  I think all it says --
22
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Section 5 says somebody has 
23  to clear it before it can go into effect. 
24
25

 MR. CLEMENT:  Two things, Justice Kagan: 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely.  But I don't think 

that means that the assumption is that the legislature

Here, it wasn't cleared. 

person, one vote violation in the remedial district? 

 If I could add my second point, which is the 

1  didn't act in good faith in enacting the provision.  And 
2  that brings me to my second point --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Nobody said the opposite. 
3
4  The question just is, does somebody have to clear it? 
5
6
 MR. CLEMENT:  Okay.  I agree, but then the 
7  question is, if there's not a presumption of bad faith, 
8  then why wouldn't the court take that legislative 
9  judgment into account in drawing its remedy for the one 
10
11
12  other thing to keep in mind is the preclearance 
13  obligation is not driven by congressional judgment that 
14  these covered jurisdictions are particularly bad at 
15
16
 Obviously, section 5 is driven by concerns 
17  about racial discrimination.  So, in that sense, it's 
18  particularly odd, given that what's at issue here is a 
19  remedy for a one person, one vote problem, that you 
20
21  the legislature's judgment as reflected in an 
22  un-precleared plan. 
23
24  that's --
25

would assume that you're not going to take into account 

remedying one person, one vote problems. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, I don't think that 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I think 

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 But, on the other hand, it can't presume it 

 So, how do we decide between those two --

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think you try to split 

or presume what the district court here in D.C. is going 

1  there -- I see two different problems, and I'm not quite 
2  sure how to come out.  One, you cannot assume that the 
3  legislature's plan should be treated as if it were 
4  precleared.  The district court in Texas cannot assume 
5
6  to do. 
7
8  the other way.  In other words, it can't draw its 
9  interim plan assuming that there are going to be these 
section 5 violations because that's presuming what the 
10
11 
court's going to do the other way. 
12
13  you have two wrong choices.  How do we end up? 
14
15
16  injunction standards.  And I think if you do that, then 
17  what you're going to do is that you're going to ensure 
18  that the remedy that the district court draws for -- as 
19  an interim matter for the one person, one vote problem, 
which is not the same thing as preclearance, that remedy 
20
21  is both consistent with the legislative policy judgments 
22  but also with section 2, with the Equal Protection 
23  Clause. 
24

the difference by trying to apply the preliminary

say that for purposes of interim temporary relief, the

 MR. CLEMENT:  I -- I don't think Judge 

districts, did Judge Smith defer or use the -- the Texas 
legislature's 2011 plan as a benchmark to some extent? 

1  Court can look at section 5 directly.  I would think the 
2  better answer is, no, you just focus it on section 2, 
3  the Equal Protection Clause, and then you ensure that 
4  the judicial plan is consistent with section 5

14  does:  I don't think Judge Smith did this the way that 
we think he should or focused on the benchmark.  If you

18  bipartisan proposal, so-called C216.

22  standard.  And I would ask you to look at Joint Appendix

Rights Act, maybe some State law restrictions to the 
extent they're not inconsistent with Federal law.  Once 
you've gotten beyond that point, all you have left is 
districting policy. 

1  what this Court typically has said the district court

8  preliminary observations on what a district court is 
9  supposed to do in this regard, and then I'll try to walk 
10
11
12  district court is not supposed to do, and what a 
13  district court is not supposed to do is to take the 
14  un-precleared plan as a given, because section 5 
15
16
 Now, what's a district court supposed to do? 
17  It's not at sea, contrary to the underpinning of some of 
18  the arguments made today, because the district court 
19  starts with the last legally enforceable plan, which 
after all is the last manifestation of State policies 
20
21  and priorities.  So, you have that as a starting point. 
22  And then it has to modify that plan, of course, to deal 
23  with malapportionment issues and to comply with section

It's political discretion.  That's what's troublesome 
about it.  And you -- it seems to me the Government 
makes -- takes an absolutist approach to the proposition 
that you cannot use an un-precleared plan for any 
purpose.  All the law says is that you cannot apply a 
precleared plan.  The plan being applied here is not the 
Texas legislature's plan; it's the plan -- a remedial 
plan adopted by Federal judges.

up that plan the legislature's last political decisions

14  But that's not what Texas -- the approach that Texas 
15

17  from a standard preliminary injunction context as well. 
18  And one is what Justice Ginsburg alluded to, which is 
19  here you don't have a situation in which the same court 
20
21  the merits is also deciding what it's going to do at the 
22  preliminary injunction stage. 
23
24  right, but you see it only on one side of the problem.

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's right. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- because that 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't know how you

4  would be prejudging what the court in D.C. is going to 
5
6  assuming that there are going to be these section 5
 
7  violations and drawing additional majority-minority
 
8  districts, which is just assuming on the other -- the
 
9  other way what the court here in D.C. is going to do.

10
11
12  -- you lean one way and say, well, it's horrible, you 
13  can't use it because it hasn't been precleared; but it's 
14  all right in drawing the interim plan to treat it as 
15
16
17  about that, because I think what a district court is 
18  supposed to do when preclearance is pending is not 
19  accept all the challenges.  What it's supposed to do is 
20
21  benchmark.  So, I guess --
22
23  that this district court did essentially accept the 
24  challenges, did sort of say, well, look, there are these 
25

there -- as if preclearance has been denied. 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  No, I don't -- I don't know

2
3  language in the opinions to -- to that effect,
 
4  Justice Kennedy.  I have to say the district court
 
opinions here are not a model of clarity.  In some 
5
6  respects, they seem to outline the right inquiry.  If 
7  you look at Joint Appendix 137 to 138, I think what the 
8  district court said it was doing was starting with the 
9  status quo, which is the benchmark, and then modifying 
10
11
12  and if you look at Joint Appendix 146 --

18  district court in D.C. is going to come out.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You do. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Isn't it odd that this is 
a section 2 suit, and yet section 5 seems to be driving 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's right. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- to 147, it looks 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, that's -- that's 

right, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think we point to that 

the exact opposite.  It looks like they're drawing

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I think section 5
 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And section 5 applies only 

1  that -- driving it.  That's the problem with this
 
2  litigation, it seems to me.
 
3
4  can't help but drive --
5
6  to -- to some States and not others.  Texas is at a 
7  tremendous disadvantage here in defending the section 2 
8  suit and in drawing -- and in having -- and the 
9  judiciary is at a disadvantage in -- in framing a remedy 
for a likely -- a likely section 2 violation in some of 
10
11 
the districts. 
12
 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, of course, Your 
13  Honor, Texas is in a different position precisely 
14  because it's a covered jurisdiction.  And when you have 
a section 5 case, section 5 can't help but take 
15
16  precedence in some respects, precisely because a 
17  proposed change can't go into effect unless and until 
18  the covered jurisdiction shows that it's 
19  nondiscriminatory in purpose and effect.  But I do think 
20
21
22  should take precedence in a section 2 suit.  That's all 
23  this court -- this is the primary obligation of the 
24  Texas district court, is to address section 2 
25

it's important --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We -- we'll let you 

effect to the un-precleared plan, because that's 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  That -- that may be, Your 
1
2  Honor, but I think then if -- if it can't address the 
3  section 5 issue at all, then the one thing that 
4  shouldn't happen is that the section 2 court gives 
5
6  something that the D.C. district court is supposed to 
7  do. 
8
9  effect to the uncleared plan.  It's giving effect to a 
legislative judgment as to what is workable for all the 
10
11 
factors and criteria that Justice Alito referred to, 
12 
county lines, et cetera. 
13
14  go on for a little longer.  We may have a few more 
15
16
17  Mr. Chief Justice.  I appreciate that. 
 I guess what I would say, Justice Kennedy, 
18
19  is, if you use the un-precleared plan as the starting 
20
21  effect to that, notwithstanding the preclearance 
22  requirement of section 5.  And with a covered 
23  jurisdiction, that's something that section 5 doesn't 
24  allow.
25

point, which is what Texas proposes, you are giving 

questions. 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Okay.  Thank you, 

 Now, I do think it's important to consider 

39
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

administrative preclearance.  In all 20 cases, the 

1  Texas's preclearance submission in the context of the 
2  other statewide preclearance submissions that have been 
3  submitted in this election cycle.  If you look at the 
4  Government's brief at pages 1a to 3a, I think what that 
bears out is that there's not a fundamental problem with 
5
6  section 5 or the way section 5 operates.  The problem, 
7  insofar as it -- as it exists, is with respect to the 
8  particular submissions that Texas has made, because 
9  there were 20 submissions of statewide plans for 
10
11  Attorney General precleared them.  In 19 of the 
12  20 cases, the Attorney General precleared it within the 
13  initial 60-day window.  Now --
14
15
16  position.  That's why you're sitting in the back rather 
17  than the front row between the two parties.  But it's a 
18  little unsatisfying because what you say we should do 
19  when we are all under the gun of very strict time 
20
21  court so it can give a greater explanation of what it's 
22  done. 
23
24  mean, it's kind of an odd order from this Court to send

to a district court saying, you know, tell us more.

 First -- and this goes to a question that 

Justice Alito asked earlier.  What is this Court 

what the Texas district court is supposed to do. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you have an idea of 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I don't know that it 
1
2  is, Your Honor, and I have two -- two responses in that 
3  respect. 
4
5
6  supposed to do in this situation?  And I think one thing 
7  that could absolutely happen is if there were a remand, 
8  the D.C. district court could complete its preclearance 
9  proceeding, which would be very illuminating for the 
10
11
12  when? 
13
14  that, what I would --
15
16 
17
 MR. SRINIVASAN:  What I would say is this: 
18  The D.C. district court has scheduled trial to begin on 
19  January 17th.  It's supposed to last 8 days.  Closing 
20
21  happened at the summary judgment stage, Justice Breyer, 
22  they had summary judgment arguments on one day; 6 
23  days later, they --
24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, I read -- I read -- I 
read the opinion and what she said on the phone and so 

argument is on February 3rd.  If you look at what 

 MR. SRINIVASAN.  And by way of guidance on 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you have -- what is that 

based on?

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, of course, if 

1  forth. 
 MR. SRINIVASAN:  No, not that. 
2
 JUSTICE BREYER:  It seems to me that it's a 
3
4  complicated case.  Let's suppose you're completely right 
on your time schedule.  Then they'll decide something. 
5
6  How could any human being redraw maps in 5 days or 10 
7  days where you'll have different -- six different 
8  positions?  I mean, I think it's impossible.  How can 
9  you -- I don't see how you could do it.
10
11  preclearance is granted, we -- we won't have an issue 
12  with drawing maps. 
13
14  seemed to me from reading it, I -- I didn't think that 
15
16
17
18  sending it back, I read the brief, and then I read the 
19  opinions.  I don't think I have -- I'm not being too 
20
21  saying throughout is we didn't try to draw extra 
22  coalition or extra opportunity districts; they emerged. 
23  They say "emerged" about seven times.  They emerged as 
24  we tried to apply equal vote principles.  And it's

 So, they didn't seem to me -- now, why do 

that seems to be the explanation, and to me at first 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Yes.  Sure.  I think it's 
if -- insofar as the coalition districts and ability-to 

1  population growth is primarily due to the minority 
2  expansion.

3  Washington, D.C., and that at this point, a 
4  court-ordered plan must be implemented on an interim 
5
6
7  I'm not sure that -- that I've gone along on that, as 
8  you phrased it.  The way you phrase it, you say they 
9  cannot even make the kind of preliminary inquiry that --
10
11
 MR. GARZA:  I think we're dealing with a 
12  matter of semantics, Your Honor, because the question 
13  is, did the court give the -- the State's plan 
14  deference?  But it itself said that it began, as it 
15
16  historical or benchmark configurations and then 
17  respected the State's plan. 
18
19  understand about your briefs, Mr. Garza, is if the State 
can't -- if the plan has not been precleared, you should 
20
21  be saying the State can't look at the plan.  But on the 
22  one hand, you're saying, well, isn't it great because

2  looked at the Texas plan.  And then you say the court 
3  can't look at the Texas plan. 
4
5
6  -- the court can't implement the Texas plan, and it 
7  certainly can't implement the Texas plan if there is any 
8  suspect of discrimination.  And what it did was exactly 
9  the right measure.

17  theory that those frivolous claims are valid?  And if 
18  you say no, it shouldn't assume that, then what level of 
19  inquiry should the court engage in before it accepts or 
20

23  State's plan.  It should look at where there have been

 MR. GARZA:  What it --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And rely on the 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But could it -- could it 
1
2  look at the district and say, well, it respects county 
3  lines; it follows a river; it's got urban and rural. 
4  Could it look at it for that reason?
5
6
7  legislative judgment as making a sound judgment that the 
8  river runs through here, and the county line is there 
9  and so forth?  That's -- that's what seems to me the 
difficulty with saying, oh, you can't look at the plan. 
10
11
 MR. GARZA:  I think the problem with that, 
12  Your Honor, is that then it would be assuming that the 
13  State is correct, that it doesn't violate section 5. 
14  That is -- that is an inquiry that's reserved to the 
15
16
17  but -- but it goes the other way when you say they can't 
18  approve something that's been challenged.  Aren't you 
19  assuming that the plaintiffs are right?
 MR. GARZA:  No. 
20
21
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And that's an 
22  inquiry that belongs to the district court in D.C. 
23
24  is it didn't accept as a remedy what the plaintiffs 
25

proposed there.  It reverted to State policy, which is 

district court in the District of Columbia.  And --

 MR. GARZA:  That policy cannot be deferred 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that is not the current 

1  what it's directed to do by this Court.  It -- it went 
2  back to State policy, and it looked at the benchmark 
3  plan, and it started with the benchmark plan.  Even with 
4  the congressional plan, where there are four new 
districts, and there is no comparable district in the 
5
6  benchmark, it looked to the legislatively enacted plan 
7  to determine where it would place those districts. 
8
9  State policy.  The benchmark plan is gone.  It's old. 
The Texas legislature now has a different policy, and 
10
11 
that, you say, should be ignored. 
12
13  to.  It is incorporated in the court's plan by -- in the 
14  manner in which it did review the plans.  That is --
15
16 
17 
18
19  the court did is --
20
21 
22
23  presuming it is invalid.  You're -- you're suggesting 
24  that -- you're reverting to the next State policy. 
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, what's -- there's a 
presumption of its invalidity.  You can't presume it 
valid, but you can presume it invalid. 

You're not incorporating it, but you're not -- you're

 They draw up a plan that embodies that 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let's say -- let's say 

a legislature says we have a new policy, and that is 

1  not making any decisions.  And the way you sort of walk 
2  that tightrope is you go to what the State policy was 
3  before the enacted plan. 
4
5
6  that once we've satisfied our constitutional obligations 
7  and our obligations under the Voting Rights Act, the 
8  only thing we're going to do is try to draw the 
9  districts that are the most compact possible, 
10
11
12  policy, and it's challenged under section 5.  Now, can 
13  the district court just say, well, that's -- the State's 
14  policy is compactness over everything else, but we don't 
15
16  principles that advance the interest of the collective 
17  public good, which is the term that this -- the words 
18  that this court used.  Can they do that? 
19
20
21
22  then you're saying that they are constrained by State 
23  policy, except to the extent the Constitution or the 
24  Voting Rights Act requires otherwise.
25

agree with that, because we have other neutral 

 MR. GARZA:  I don't believe they can, and 

this court didn't.  The court, in fact --

 MR. GARZA:  They denied summary judgment,

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They denied summary

2  in those districts where there have been challenges --
3  and by the way the district court has -- in the District 
4  of Columbia has determined that those challenges are

11  judgment. 
12
13  but they went even further.  They -- they said Texas has 
14  not disputed many of the intervenors' specific 
allegations of discriminatory intent.  So, it's -- it's

17  find that the challenges that are being made are

22  plan, the benchmark plan, to begin its process on how it 
23  was drawing those districts. 
24
25

 And there's a good reason why Texas is 
covered under the Voting Rights Act.  As this Court

6  issue here, right? 
7
8
9  could turn for a moment to the issue that I see on Joint 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18
19  to say that this group votes as a bloc and has been 
20
21  representatives of its choice.  It's another thing to 
22  say that two different minority groups are put together 
23  because they share some particular view so that one 
24  candidate is going to be each of theirs candidate --
25

Appendix 146 and 147.  They don't say a minority 
coalition opportunity district just happened to emerge. 
It said that district 33 was drawn as a minority 
coalition opportunity district.  And we've never held 
that it is appropriate or even permissible to draw a 
district where you're putting in together two 
minorities, two different minority groups.  And it seems 
to me that that raises all sorts of different concerns. 
 It's one thing under the Voting Rights Act 

discriminated against in its ability to elect 

candidates of choice.  That goes quite a step further

4  that type of -- of district.
5
6  statement that the court made is a correct statement.

17  drawn as a minority coalition opportunity district.  I

this one as a minority coalition opportunity district.

3  because they said something else somewhere else, that's 
4  not responsive.
 MR. GARZA:  What I'm -- what I'm suggesting 
5
6  is what he's saying is that this is the result of what 
7  they've done.  That sentence can also be interpreted as 
8  saying this is the result of what we -- we've done.  We 
9  have created a minority opportunity --

population grows; you have to have one person, one vote;

 MR. GARZA:  Precisely.  And there's no 

gerrymanders?  Split-voting precincts where you go out 
and carve and bring in minority voters.  This district 
maintains voting precincts intact.  It is entirely 
within one county.  It is a compact district, especially 
when you compare it to the district in that part of the 
State --

1  the legislature itself in the new plan did create a 
2  minority, whatever you -- the opportunity district here; 
3  so, we're following what they did; we're taking into 
4  account population, and it turns out to be, and we do 
create it as -- in which case there is some ambiguity

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  One of -- one of the basic 
18  rules that -- that was followed in drawing up the court 
19  plan was not to divide any voting districts, right?
 MR. GARZA:  That's one of the principles. 
20
21
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?  Why did the -- that 
22  certainly is not a principle that the Texas legislature 
23  agrees with. 
24
25

 MR. GARZA:  I believe that the plan that was 
drawn by the court is fair.  Is it the optimum plan that 

 MR. GARZA:  There's two reasons, Your Honor. 

One is --

55
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, the court just made it 

 MR. GARZA:  No.  There are two reasons why 

implement without -- without interference a legitimate 
election process, to have whole precincts because whole 
precincts makes a big difference in terms of how the 
election is -- is administrated. 

1
2  up? 
3
4  the court saw maintaining voting precincts as important. 
One is because that is what it's been directed by this 
5
6  Court in Bush v. Vera.  In Bush v. Vera, the Court said 
7  we have an interim election or a -- or an impending 
8  election, and it's important for elections 
9  administrators in -- in order to be able to -- to 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  and proposals from the parties.  It was very deliberate. 
17  It was very cautious, and it was very open.  We had 3 
18  days of hearings on what these plans should look like 
19  and what the standards ought to be, including testimony 
20
21  Secretary of State. 
 And in every instance, those administrators 
22
23  and that representative from the Secretary of State said 
24  the most important thing that the court should consider, 
if it's going to order us to start conducting elections 
25

 The second reason is that this court didn't 
adopt this plan without any inquiry into the standards 

from elections administrators and from the Texas 

56
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  under a different plan, is maintain voting precincts 
2  because that is the most cumbersome part. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if Texas says we don't 
3
4  care about maintaining voting precincts; this is -- this 
is a matter of -- of administrative burden and expense, 
5
6  and we're willing to bear that, so disregard that, the 
7  district court can say, well, we think -- we disagree 
8  with you; in order to make it more convenient to hold 
9  the election and less expensive for Texas, we're going 
10
11
12  instance, number one. 
13
14
15
16 
17
 MR. GARZA:  It -- yes, I think they could 
18  because there's still the authority of this Court in 
19  Bush v. Vera that directs courts, in drawing interim 
plans for impending elections, to -- to be cautious 
20
21  about that, number one.  And, number two, if in fact in 
22  order to get an appropriate map, you must split a number 
23  of precincts, which means then that you can't conduct 
24  the election on April 3rd, we still have time.  As -- as 
25

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But could they do that? 
 MR. GARZA:  And --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Could the district court do 

the Government's attorney indicated, the -- there are 

to respect voting districts.  They can do that? 

 MR. GARZA:  The State didn't do that in this 

that?  That's my question.

 So, if this Court disagrees with our

3
4  position and is determined to send this back to the 
district court, then it should consider this:  The 
5
6  district court in the District of Columbia is about 
7  30 days away from rendering a complete decision in the 
8  section 5 case.  That would place the court in Texas in 
9  exactly the Upham circumstance.  In that circumstance --
and the court is poised to move.  It can move with all 
10
11 
due diligence.  It had 2 weeks of trial in which it 
heard testimony on the plaintiffs' claims.  It's -- it 
12 
13 
is -- it is ready. 
14
15
16  State's plan, the court in Texas is primed to make its 
17  decision on the plaintiffs' claims under section 2 and 
18  the Constitution.  In that circumstance --
19
real drop-dead date?  It's not November 6th because 
20
21  that's the day of the general election.  What's the 
22  latest election -- primary election that any State has? 
23  June 26th? 
24
25

 MR. GARZA:  June 26th, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So, working 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Garza, what's the 

 Once the district court in the District of 

Columbia tells us these are the problems with the 

58
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

presidential primary rather than congressional? 

the State's primary and the presidential.  There are in 
-- in fact, States that conduct primaries as late as 
September that have no presidential primary at all. 

1  backwards, what's the last --
2
3  presidential primaries, isn't it?  I don't want to
 
4  interrupt, but isn't that the date of the last
 
5
 MR. GARZA:  That's correct. 
6
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes. 
7
 MR. GARZA:  So, Utah is the last -- is the 
8

14  that election do -- does the voting mechanism or 
15
16
17  45 days from the election in order to ensure -- sending 
18  out a ballot to overseas voters, including the military. 
19  So, if you -- if you go back 45 days and then you give 
the jurisdiction sufficient time to develop a ballot, 
20
21  because you need a ballot to send to the -- to the 
22  soldiers, then that's about what they've -- what the 
23  testimony was, is that takes about 90 days, I believe, 
24  is what they testified.  So, 45 days plus 90 days, and 
25

substantial claims with regard to retrogression and

5
6  component of section 2.  Yes, Your Honor. 
7
 And it -- and I think it's important to note 
8  that Judge Smith in Texas used, in a manner of speaking, 
9  the preliminary injunction standard that's being

21  house and congressional districts? 
 MR. GARZA:  Yes, Your Honor.  We believe 
22
23  that there are section 5 claims with regard to Harris 
24  County.  Judge Smith addressed the constitutional --
25

advocated by the State, and they would not be able to 
meet that standard because, generally, Judge Smith 
determined that the plaintiffs had presented colorable 
claims of statutory or constitutional infirmity, ruled 
that the plan was an extreme gerrymander, ruled that 
elimination of district 149 presented section 5 
problems, ruled that the legislature dismantled a 
minority district in Nueces County that presented 
section 5 --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you have substantive 

objections to the plans suggested by Judge Smith in the 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Oh -- no, do you have some 

62
 

Alderson Reporting Company

the failure of the State to justify the sorts of 

1  section 2 objections?  Well, that doesn't quite work. 
2  You have to talk about retrogression, I suppose. 
 MR. GARZA:  Right.  And in -- in district --
3
4  in Harris County, the court did equalize population per 
5
6  deviations that are contained in that district but 
7  didn't provide, in our opinion, additional remedies. 
 But Judge Smith's proposed plan for the 
8
9  State house is in fact very similar to the plan that was 
proposed by the majority.  It -- it differs by only one 
10
11 
minority district.  That is, one additional minority 
district is contained in the interim plan than is 
12 
13 
contained in Judge Smith's plan. 
14
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Garza, what would you 
think of a system in which the court could start with 
15
16  the Texas plan and say -- the new Texas plan and say 
17  anything that's consistent with statutes and the 
18  Constitution can go forward, but it's Texas that has to 
19  show that consistency?  So, flipping the burden of proof 
in the way that Mr. Srinivasan was suggesting?  In a way 
20
21  that makes it more consistent --
22
23
24
25

 MR. GARZA:  Right.  Right. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- with section 5's burden. 
 MR. GARZA:  Well, I -- I think that our 
position is that section 5 is clear that this court 

63
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

implement any portion of its newly adopted but 

1  should not start with the interim plan, but if the Court 
2  disagrees with me, I think that that's a much more 
3  reasonable approach than the one offered by the State, 
4  for the same reason argued by the United States.  That 
is, that in the State's argument, you really turn 
5
6  section 5 on its head because one of the principal 
7  benefits for the minority community in having section 5 
8  is it alters of the burden of proof.  And if you 
9  maintain the burden of proof on the State before it can 
10
11  un-precleared plan, that's far more preferable than 
12  shifting the burden, which would be inconsistent with 
13  section 5 in its intent.

could. 

1  particularly unique is there's literally an infinite 
2  number of ways to solve the problem.  And for that 
3  reason, this Court has always looked wherever it could 
4  to legislative guidance, so much so that in White v. 
Weiser, this Court looked for legislative guidance to a 
5
6  plan that had been declared unconstitutional for failing 
7  to accommodate one person, one vote problems, but yet 
8  this Court still said that the district court erred in 
9  not taking that into account to the extent that it 
10
11
 As to the hard choice, if it comes to that, 
12  of using either the legislative plan that reflects the 
13  legislative will or the judicial plan that even the 
14  United States concedes is flawed, I think this Court has 
faced even more difficult choices in the past:  Bullock 
15
16  v. Weiser and in Whitcomb.  And in both of those cases, 
17  this Court chose between an adjudicatedly 
18  unconstitutional State plan and a judicial remedy that 
19  it determined was flawed.  And in both cases, it ordered 
the election to take place under the flawed 
20
21  constitutionally adjudicated imperfect plan. 
22
23  election should go forward under a plan that hasn't been 
24  precleared is a far less serious step.
25

 Now, there was a reference made to the 3 

 Compared to that, simply saying that an 

65
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I'll join everybody in 

saying that that's -- that's better than the -- than the 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why shouldn't it be 

that's familiar to everybody, everybody understands, and 

1  days of hearings.  But the problem is, 3 days of 
2  hearings with an unadministrable standard is worse than 
3  1 day of hearing with an unadministrable standard.  And 
4  what we ask is for a preliminary injunction standard 
5
6  everybody can apply. 
7
8  inverted the way your friend suggests? 
9
10
11  worst alternative I face, which is to say it's better 
12  than the district court's opinion. 
13
 But here's why it shouldn't:  That actually 
14  further intrudes on the D.C. court because the question 
that the remedial court should not be asking is, geez, 
15
16  do I really think -- you know, what are the odds that 
17  the D.C. court is going to preclear?  It shouldn't ask 
18  that question at all.  It should ask the questions that 
19  are before it.  Is there a section 2 violation?  Is 
there an equal protection violation?  If there aren't 
20
21  those and I use the State's plan, does that create a 
22  section 5 violation? 
23
24  question.  And on that section 5 question, the burden is 
not logically on the State.  And that's the same section 
25

 That's different from the preclearance 

66

5 because Texas still understands it needs to get 

question, what if we take section 5 out of this, what 

1  5 question that the court considered on its own motion, 
2  because it understands that even when it takes a plan, 
3  it has to be consistent with section 5 principles. 
 Now, Justice Kennedy, you've asked the 
4
5
6  happens?  Then it's an easy case.  Then it's the 
7  preliminary injunction standard.  Now, the objection to 
8  that, of course, is, well, but how can you take section 
9  5 out of it?  But there's not interference with section 
10
11  preclearance.  Before its changes can take permanent 
12  effect, it absolutely, positively needs preclearance. 
13  It's never wavered from that recognition.  So, you go 
14  back -- I'll --
15
16
17  going to say if you go back, the default problem here is 
18  that there's an infinite number of solutions.  It's 
19  particularly a problem with respect to the congressional 
map, where there's now four new seats.  There's nothing 
20
21  else to defer to than the judgment of the legislature 
22  reflected in this plan, notwithstanding that it hasn't 
23  been precleared.
