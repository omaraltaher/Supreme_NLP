 The government here agrees that the lack of

outside the Guidelines.  This is the correct result.

problem, I assume you would have prepared for that. 

1  rules 32(f), (h), (i), and a decision of this Court in 
2  United States versus Burns.  That law controls the 
3  decision in this case. 
4
5
6  notice of the issue of whether or not an alternative 
7  procedure and medication audit would help, but you 
8  certainly knew that future dangerousness was going to be 
9  on the table.  And if you had a response to that, which 
10
11 
12
13  suggested -- the Guidelines departure which is suggested 
14  in the last paragraph of the pre-sentence report, is 
15
16  departure.  The concerns raised by that are completely 
17  different than the grounds on which the court departed. 
18  So, no, that wasn't adequate notice. 
19
in terms of what issues might suggest themselves to a 
20
21  judge sentencing this particularly defendant, I would 
22  have thought future dangerousness.  I mean, you have an 
23  individual who has leveled particular threats with some 
24  degree of certainty that he intends to pursue them, I

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, yeah, I -- but

would have thought that would have been one of the first

 MR. MADDEN:  Well, it was looked at in the 

of acceptance of responsibility.  But both look at

4  carry out the threat, and it did come up in the context 
5
6  different issues than the ground that the sentence was 
7  ultimately -- the -- the upward non-Guideline sentence 
8  was ultimately imposed on. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you know this -- this 
9
provision 32(h), really doesn't -- does simply not work 
10
11  with post-Booker guidelines.  You either have to say it 
12  was designed for a different regime, and therefore, has 
13  no effect now after Booker, or else you have to expand 
14  it beyond what it says, because may depart from the 
15
16  under the mandatory guidelines, they were identified 
17  grounds for departure. 
 And you had some -- the court could look at 
18
19  those and say, gee, am I going to pick one of these, if 
so I'll let him know.  But you can depart now simply on 
20
21  the ground that you don't agree with the -- with what 
22  the Guidelines say as -- is that what you would call a 
23  ground of departure?

 It's simply a ground of disagreement, I 
would suppose.  Why shouldn't we hold 32(h) simply.

 MR. MADDEN:  Yes, sir.  I think first it 

counter-intuitive.  But --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think it is 

1  Simply has no -- no application under the new system? 
2  Or at least hold that all it applies to are departures 
3  within the meaning of the old mandatory guidelines 
4  system?  Which is a much narrower category of 
5
6
7  would seem to make -- it would not make sense to demand 
8  notice for a finite range of factors, but no notice for 
9  a potentially broader one.  That seems 
10
11
12  counter-intuitive to provide -- to -- to require notice 
13  when the number of grounds is finite.  But if the number 
14  of grounds is infinite, I'm much less inclined to read 
15
16
 MR. MADDEN:  But the -- the decision of --
17  in Burns, I think, answers the question because unless 
18  there's -- if a party is not focused -- and generally 
19  the parties' papers and the PSR will focus the issues. 
20
21  sentencing consideration that's important enough to 
22  drive the sentence up or down is raised, in order to 
23  have adversarial testing of that important issue, there 
24  has to be some kind of notice.  And it's not -- variance

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Post-Booker the guidelines 
are advisory, and the district judge has discretion as 

1  sentence is not a pure exercise in policy even in

 That was a policy disagreement but it was
 
3
4  driven by facts, and the defendant in that case, the

7  presentation.  So the record was in the right shape to

12
 Now, in the bad old days, when the statute

14  didn't have to give you notice of why he was giving you

22
23  it -- it's important -- the requirement is essential for 
24  purposes of advocacy on the issues.  Burns -- Burns

 I think the -- the answer is that -- that

 And now that we've returned to a system that 

reflects the Court's understanding again of what

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose the district court

 To say if there is nothing other than

 JUSTICE ALITO:  You seem to be requiring a 
very specific kind of notice, almost as if the district

4  a danger in the future, if that was the issue, if the 
5

8  the table.

12  considering, and these are the exact reasons that I'm

 MR. MADDEN:  -- content -- it needs to be 
18  specific -- it needs to be specific enough so that the 
19  facts that get litigated are the ones that are

 What notice is the defendant lacking? 
10
11
 MR. MADDEN:  I think if -- if she would have 
12  said something to the effect that -- and this sometimes 
13  happens during the course of a sentencing, that's a 
14  different issue -- but here's what's on my mind.  I'm 
concerned that only extra prison time, incapacitation 
15
16  for as long as I can give him, will do the job of 
17  protecting society.  What do you have to say about that? 
 If that was the -- now isn't the written, 
18
19  formal, this is during the context of the sentencing --
20
21  something like, "Judge, there's -- there is psychiatric 
22  evidence or psychological evidence that's developed that 
23  I'd like to put on bearing on that issue in light of the

the way it comes out, then the response would be

should have played out.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is she supposed to do?

MR. MADDEN:  Usually.

4  practically, there are not that many that are actually

parties have a duty to interject issues that they think

22  way. 
 And the bar is actually getting better at

departure --

1  phenomenon where rule 32(h) comes into play.  The rule 
2  as written doesn't demand any changes.  It is a matter 
3  of interpretation.  And the Sentencing Commission itself 
4  defines a departure as any non-Guidelines sentence.
 That fits within the literal language of 
5
6  rule 32(h).  This Court doesn't have to decide this 
7  case. 
8
9  32(h) was promulgated.
10
11  was after Booker, discussed in fact, the sentencing 
12  court, applying the Guidelines in individual cases, may 
13  depart either pursuant to the Guidelines or since Booker 
14  by imposing a non-Guidelines sentence.  The word

16
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You could apply departure 
17  to post-Booker; but at the time this rule was adopted, 
18  departure did not consist of that; it consisted of 
19  something much more narrow.
 MR. MADDEN:  It -- it had a narrower meaning 
20
21  but -- but the rule 32(h) was to implement the structure

2  32(d)(2)(F); so they made a change there and they said 
3  the judge could ask to have these things included in the

 MR. MADDEN:  Well, I don't think that that

9  answers the question, because under the prior structure 
of the rule, the pre-sentencing was supposed to set out 
10
11 
all of the factors and (h) was just -- just a stopgap. 
12
 The provision that came in in December of 
13  '07 that says that the court can request other factors, 
14  I think is just that an authorization to the probation 
officer to look at -- to look at other factors and to

 So when must this notice be given and how
 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, it's -- it's a

2  much does it have to say?
 
3

notice reasonable, which means it has to give the

3  potential adjustment to the Guidelines' range.  So, his 
4  future dangerousness was --
5
6  -- that all goes to the harmless error question.  Is 
7  that the only time in which notice at the sentencing 
8  hearing is going to be adequate? 
9
in this circumstance, for example, there would be --
10
11  another example would be often if the victim impact 
12  testimony -- there hadn't been identified as a potential 
13  ground for departure on it, but the judge heard victim 
14  impact testimony, but the defendant knew the victim was 
going to testify, had the general sense it and the judge 
15
16  when it heard -- when she heard it decided, wow, you 
17  know, this really makes me think I should take it out of 
18  the sentence, I think that because the -- because the 
19  defendant knew that the testimony was going to be there, 
20
21  would probably be sufficient to give notice at that time 
22  then.

24  in allocution -- lack of remorse in allocution that's

Petitioner's counsel explained, in the vast majority of 

have to be?  I take it it's not enough just to recite 
one of the 3553(a) factors. 

1  true that before the hearing, they're going to have some 
2  sense based on the written materials that they've 
3  reviewed and based on the parties' identifications of 
4  what they think the appropriate sentence is.  As 
5
6  cases, the PSR, the parties are already going to 
7  identify the potential grounds for a variance, and so 
8  it's very few cases that there's going to be a ground 
9  that's going to come out --

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, at a minimum, the court 
14  would have to identify the relevant 3553(a) factor.  I

16  the particular factor, the record in the case.  Again, 
17  the test is to ensure that they focus adversarial 
18  presentation.  If it's a really an open-ended factor, 
19  like the nature and circumstances of the offense and the 
defendant's characteristics, obviously more is going to

 MR. ROBERTS:  Here I think it would have 

been sufficient for the judge to say.  I'm contemplating

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you disagree with 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  We don't think that 

the Petitioner on the specificity of notice required? 

1  a variance under section 3553(a)(2)(C), based on the 
2  fact that Petitioner's conduct indicates that he is 
3  likely to commit future crimes. 
4
5
6
7  notice of the specific fact on which the court is going 
8  to rely is required.  That would start to make the 
9  notice requirement unworkable, but I don't think that's 
how it's been interpreted, to require the very specific 
10
11 
facts in the departure context. 
12
 The same situation, the parallel thing 
13  applies here.  As I was going to say before on the 
14  burdensomeness, it hasn't been burdensome, unduly 
15
16  really isn't any reason to think that it would be 
17  different for here. 
18
19  that we're were talking about, the key fact is rule 
32(h) does indisputably require notice for traditional 
20
21  departures.  And a notice requirement for variances is 
22  essential to prevent evisceration of that notice 
23  requirement because a court can always impose the 
24  same -- use a variance to impose the same sentence that 
25

it could have imposed as a Guidelines departure. 

burdensome, to require notice for traditional, and there 

 And to get back to something earlier as well

 So that notice requirement, which is still

4  construed to include variances.
5
6  for the focused adversarial testing that rule 32 
7  requires for the reason the Court said in Burns.  If the

17
18  to have adversarial testing of that issue.

20
21  understand it.  Why couldn't that issue have been 
22  adequately discussed at a hearing in which there was no 
23  particular notice, but at the end of the hearing the 
24  judge said, this is what I'm planning to do because I'm 
worried that they won't get treatment in prison and so 
25

do is either address the possibility of an 
above-Guidelines sentence in a random and wasteful way 
by trying to conceive of every possible grounds or 
they're just not going to address it at all, like in the 
example that I gave before when we just didn't address 
the potential variance based on prison not providing --
being able to provide the appropriate treatment.

reasons behind that apply with equal force in the 
variance context. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you think that this 

come out the same way --

1  it in this -- in this particular sentencing hearing. 
2  The point is that, you know, we're not going to do that. 
3  And so a judge that's operating under that and it's 
4  going to vary on that ground isn't going to get that 
information because we're -- as you say -- we're not

 And so that -- it's really the reason that

9  the requirement in the existing rule is there, and the

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yes -- I mean, it's not the

22  have to give notice or not?  And if she has to give

 But now you're urging us to say -- to do 
something that ordinarily this Court doesn't do, that 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If we -- if we grant the

1  trial judges do, to deal with harmless error, which 
2  would be spending our time on this very particular case 
3  setting no law for any other case? 
4
should, you know, first obviously address the rule 32 
5
6  question on which it granted certain certiorari, but 
7  after doing that, we think the Court should address the 
8  harmless error question because that will provide useful 
9  guidance to the lower courts.  There are likely to be a 
lot of harmless error cases because half of the circuits 
10
11  have erroneously concluded that the rule doesn't require

 IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But then it would be easy 

 The alternative ground for affirming the 

1  future dangerousness against his amenability to

4  judgment below is that suggested by Justice Scalia and 
Justice Alito, namely:  That Federal Rule of Criminal 
5
6  Procedure 32(h) was drafted for a different era, an era 
7  of mandatory guidelines.  And there is no reason, 
8  particularly in light of the right rulemaking process, 
9  to extend rule 32 to an advisory guideline era.
10
11  for a district judge to escape any obligation to give 
12  32(h) notice because he could simply say:  Oh, yeah, 
13  before I would have ranked this as a Sentencing 
14  Guidelines matter, but now I'm treating it as a 3553(a)

17  understand your concern about the possibility that 
18  district judges might, I guess in theory, attempt to do 
19  an end run around rule 32(h) by recasting a departure 
20
21
22  circumstances in which the ground for a departure on 
23  rule 32(h) has some overlap with the ground for a 
24  variance under 3553(a), but I would offer several 
25

responses.  My first response is that I feel the Court 

factor, so I don't have to bother with 32(h) anymore.

decision as a variance decision. 

 And, admittedly, there are certain

Alderson Reporting Company 

Appeal all have interpreted that obligation to consult 
the Guidelines to include consideration of possible 
grounds for departure. 

1  crossed that bridge a little bit in the Booker remedial 
2  opinion when it created an advisory guidelines system. 
3  The whole premise of the advisory guidelines system was 
4  to enhance the discretion of the district judge.
5
6  judges still have a reason to engage in the departure 
7  calculation.  As this Court made clear in Rita, district 
8  judges must begin by consulting the guidelines.  And the 
9  Second, Third, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Tenth Courts of

14  Kimbrough made clear that even if those two grounds 
15
16  a departure calculation, that there is yet another 
17  reason; and that is because it may affect the 
18  scrutiny-of-reasonableness review. 
 As the Court explained in Kimbrough, when a 
19
district judge departs from the Guidelines, the district 
20
21  judge's determination may be entitled to greater respect 
22  when the judge makes the determination that a case

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But didn't the decision that

 Indeed, just this last Friday, the 

jurisprudence has made the departure determination 
irrelevant. 

1  the Guidelines are not mandatory make what used to be 
2  known as Guidelines departures completely irrelevant?  A 
3  case that would qualify for a Guidelines departure 
4  would, by definition, be a case in which the 3553(a) 
factors justified a sentence other than a Guidelines 
5
6  sentence?  So I don't understand why there's any need to 
7  go through the departure analysis any longer at all. 
 MR. RUTLEDGE:  Justice Alito, I don't 
8
9  believe that this Court's Booker and post-Booker 
10
11 
12
13  Sentencing Commission posted on its website additional 
14  proposed amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that 
would inject new grounds for departures including fraud 
15
16  for emergency assistance and violations of Federal food 
17  and drug laws that entail a risk of serious bodily 
18  injury. 
 Departures remain relevant to the guidelines 
19
because they are the basis upon which the Commission can 
20
21  continue to fulfill its mandate to provide for the type 
22  of uniform sentencing that still is possible. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  I just don't understand 
23
24  that.  You're not -- a court -- a sentencing court, 
25

after concluding that there is no ground for a departure

5
6  departure, as I said before, by definition, that is 
7  going to be a case where the 3553(a) factors warranted a 
8  non-Guidelines sentence anyway.  So it seems like a 
9  useless appendage at this point.
10
11  case, Justice Alito, that as this Court's Booker 
12  jurisprudence unfolds, that the concept of a departure 
13  declines in importance, in addition with respect to the 
14  32(h) obligation for notice.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why is the 32(h) 
15
16  obligation relevant?  That is, looking through the 
17  history of it, I see that in 32(i)(C) it says that the 
18  government has to allow the parties' attorneys to 
19  comment on the determination of the probation officer 
and other matters relating to an appropriate sentence. 
20
21
 Then, in a case called Burns v. United 
22  States, this Court says that that right to comment 
23  includes a right to notice. 
24
25

was already the law and make specific that it includes a 

 And so all that 32(h) did was to take what 

41
 

Alderson Reporting Company

of departures including not applying it. 

 So what?  I mean would you decrease that, 

together with the case of Burns. 

 So I don't know where that leaves me, except 

 But even if you didn't have 32(h), you would

2  to.

4  have precisely the same right once you got 32(i)(C)

7  thinking it doesn't matter, because the defendant has 
8  precisely the same right either way.  And I guess it's 
9  easier just to say "departure" means generally all kinds 
10
11
 That's not a stretch of the language.  It is 
12  quite right it is not consistent with what they thought 
13  they were up to, but not -- it is -- maybe before -- if 
14  they had passed this before Hawaii became a State, you 
could say:  Well, they didn't think it would apply in

21  effect of rule 32(i)(1)(C), then the Court confronts the 
22  question whether the basic ideas that animated its 
23  decision in Burns should be extended in an 
24  advisory-guidelines era.  And Burns, at bottom, rested 
25

 MR. RUTLEDGE:  Certainly, Justice Breyer. 
If we were to put 32(h) to one side and consider the

 One was the question of unfair surprise.
 
1
2  And we think, with that respect, that the post-Booker
 
3  era is different from the pre-Booker era.  And the
 
4  reason why, Justice Breyer, is because pre-Booker the
 
5
6  expectation of a within-Guidelines sentence. 
7
 And post-Booker, particularly in light of 
8  this Court's decision in Rita, the parties cannot come 
9  to the sentencing hearing with that expectation because 
the district judge may not presume the reasonableness of 
10
11 
the within-Guidelines sentence. 
12
 And so to the extent that Burns rested on 
13  concerns of unfair surprise, the rationale has dropped 
14  out after Booker.
15
16  to Burns which Justice Ginsburg alluded to, which is 
17  this question of full adversarial testing.  And I agree 
18  with you, Chief Justice Roberts, that Chief Judge 
19  Boudin's decision in the Vega-Santiago case provides the 
20
21
22  act all the time.  Parties come to the hearing with a 
23  theory, a theory of how the judge should exercise her 
24  sentencing discretion within a known range, and knowing 
the applicable legal criteria, and have an opportunity

 Now, there is a second strand of reasoning 

pathway here.

 And we believe that, particularly in light 
3  of the recent amendment to section 32(d)(2)(F), that's 
4  going to include the possibility of the 3553 factors --
5
6  parties are going to have the opportunity to come to the 
7  hearing with the ability to engage in full adversarial 
8  testing. 
9
10
11  if the basis for the variance is going to be a matter of 
12  surprise, then notice is required? 
13
14  that premise, Chief Justice Roberts:  That they are may

18  Judges in all of those instances.

10
11  presents a concern of impracticability, Justice Kennedy, 
12  for one simple reason; and that is by relying on a 
13  mechanism such as the continuance, the parties are given 
14  the opportunity to identify for the court whether or not 
there's a concern of unfair surprise; and if there is, 
15
16  the district judge is in the position to decide whether 
17  or not she believes that the continuance is necessary. 
 If the notice claim only arises at the time 
18
19  that the sentence is entered, there's relatively little 
opportunity at that point for the district judge to go 
20
21  back and reconsider the record on the basis of unfair 
22  surprise.  And that sort of takes me to the basic point 
23  that Justices Souter, Alito and Justice Ginsburg all

demonstrated ability to stalk and threaten his ex-wife, 
would that have been adequate?  And interestingly, I 
think pages 23 and 126 of the Petitioner's reply brief 
illustrate that either the answer to that question is 
going to be "not necessarily," or otherwise appellate 
judges are going to be strung up having to unpack 
whether or not notice is adequate, because it is 
Petitioner's petition in this case that even if the 
defendant had been put on notice as to the future 
dangerousness, that that did not, quote, "put the 
defendant on notice" that the district judge supposed 
the futility of treatment might justify an

 In the event that a district judge engaging

explication of her reasoning makes a statement about the 
amenability or non-amenability of the defendant to

seize on that extra statement and bring it back to the 
pre-sentencing report and the parties' pleadings and
