 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-1065, 
Pottawattamie County v. McGhee.

 Mr. Sanders?
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN SANDERS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. SANDERS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 If a prosecutor's absolute immunity in 

judicial proceedings means anything, it means that a 
prosecutor may not be sued because a trial has ended in 
a conviction, Yet that is exactly what happened in this 
case.

 Lower courts may not fashion exceptions to 
the immunity this -- this Court provided in Imbler by 
purporting to relocate a due process injury from the 
trial to an earlier investigation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your -- your case here is 

a polite way of telling us we wasted our time in 
Buckley v. Fitzsimmons.

 MR. SANDERS:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, we were just 

spinning our wheels in that case?

MR. SANDERS:  Your Honor, I don't believe so 

at all.  I think that this case presents exactly the 
question that Buckley reserved, and that is whether the 
fabrication of evidence by a prosecutor in and of 
itself, without regard to its use in some way, states a 
constitutional cause of action.

 In this case, the use at trial, obviously, 
was absolutely immunized under Imbler and many of this 
other -- this Court's other precedents.  Despite 
respondent's best efforts to argue that there was some 
sort of due process violation caused by the fabrication 
itself, without regard to its use in some way, there 
simply is no support for that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does that mean that, even 
if we were dealing with police officers who did what the 
prosecutors were alleged to have done at the 
investigation stage, no prosecutor, only police 
investigators, the fact that a trial and a conviction 
had occurred would mean that the police officers were 
not liable, either?

 MR. SANDERS:  Your Honor, the fact that a 
trial and conviction had occurred could mean that the 
police officers were liable because of the due process 
violation at the trial, but in footnote 5 of Buckley, 
this Court was very clear and insisted that there is no

disjunction between observing that a prosecutor, like a 
police officer, has only qualified immunity during the 
investigation while, at the same time, insisting that 
that does not affect the fact that the prosecutor has 
absolute --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Take two cases.  One is 

Justice Ginsburg's case, a police officer fabricates the 
evidence, dupes the prosecuting attorney, or -- or 
doesn't fully disclose.  Case two, a prosecutor does the 
same thing and gives it to a fellow prosecutor.

 Same -- should the analysis be precisely the 

same?

 MR. SANDERS:  Your Honor, it should be the 

same if the prosecutor in the second case that you 
hypothesize had nothing to do with the later 
prosecution.  In other words, if we could view that 
prosecutor simply as an ordinary citizen, simply as a 
complaining witness, as analogous to a police officer, 
So there's no argument in this case that simply, by 
virtue of being a prosecutor, a prosecutor has absolute 
immunity.

 The courts below wrongfully abrogated trial 

immunity because trial is the only place where the 
injury of conviction and subsequent incarceration could 
have taken place.  Without reference to that specific

injury, there is simply no other injury.  The --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm not sure that I fully 

grasp your answer to my first question and to Justice 
Kennedy's, that is, yes or no, if everything that 
happened was alleged to have happened, but it was done 
by a police officer or a different prosecutor, 
nonetheless, the trial went on, the fabricated evidence 
was introduced, without any participation by the actual 
prosecutor in that fabrication, does a conviction --
does the -- do the police officers or the prosecutors 
that was not involved in the trial get absolute -- are 
they -- are they no more liable, not because they have 
absolute immunity, but because the trial and conviction 
at which the evidence was used overtakes what liability 
they might have had, absent the trial?

 Is that your position?
 MR. SANDERS:  Your Honor, our position is --
I believe I would agree with you.  Our position is there 
is no liability for the initial fabrication.  As the 
United States explains in its brief, for a police 
officer to be held liable in those circumstances, it 
would need to be under some sort of malicious 
prosecution theory that would depend on the actual 
conviction and the use of the evidence at trial.

 But the use of the evidence at trial is the

injury itself, and that is exclusively a prosecutorial 
act, only a prosecutor could --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're not answering the 
question clearly.  Are both the prosecutor, in Justice 
Ginsburg's hypothetical, and the policeman liable? 
Can't you answer that?  Yes or no.

 MR. SANDERS:  Yes.  This Court --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Good.  That's what I 

thought your answer was.

 MR. SANDERS:  Yes.  The police officer --
likely, this Court has never -- never addressed the 
issue.  The police officer would likely be liable 
because the police officer would have no immunity for 
the use of the evidence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, she's more concerned 
about the prosecutor, and the prosecutor, also, would be 
treated just like a police officer?

 MR. SANDERS:  If the prosecutor performed no 

prosecutorial function, that's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  In the case?
 MR. SANDERS:  That's correct, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But only if the --

only if the evidence is presented at trial?

 MR. SANDERS:  But only if the evidence is 

presented at trial because that's the only way the

evidence can provide injury and so --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So the -- so the law is 
the more deeply you're involved in the wrong, the more 
likely you are to be immune?  That's a strange 
proposition.

 MR. SANDERS:  Your Honor, I think it's not 
the more deeply you are involved, it's whether you are 
in the unique position of a prosecutor to cause injury 
by use of the evidence at trial.  That is exclusively a 
prosecutorial function.

 The function test of -- of Buckley goes to 

what function someone is performing, but only the 
prosecutor can ever perform the function of actually 
using the evidence.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's strange to say 
you can have a prosecutor, who wasn't involved in the 
trial, would have liability, but as long as the 
prosecutor, in effect, turns the investigatory stage 
material over to himself, rather than to another 
prosecutor, then there's absolute immunity.

 MR. SANDERS:  Your Honor, that is correct, 
but I think the Court, more than 80 years ago, when it 
summarily affirmed Yaselli v. Goff from the Second 
Circuit, spoke to this question.

 In that case, the Court said -- affirmed the

Second Circuit in its view that, if a prosecutor 
cannot -- if a prosecutor has absolute immunity for 
acting maliciously at trial, that immunity cannot be 
circumvented --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  No, but the -- the 

question is not at trial, nothing about trial.  It's the 
pretrial conduct.

 MR. SANDERS:  The -- the odd thing about --

if we are taking out reference to the trial itself, then 
there simply can be no claim.  Respondents urge a new 
freestanding right, separate and apart from the due 
process trial right, yet at the same time --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you said that 

there -- that there would be liability, as long as it 
wasn't the same person involved in the investigation and 
the trial.  Even though there had been a trial, you 
say -- you answered Justice Scalia, that those people 
separated from the trial would be liable, even though 
there was a trial, and it's at issue.

 MR. SANDERS:  Your Honor, looking to the 
common law, the rationale for that would be a form of 
malicious prosecution, but as you observed in your 
concurrence in Albright, asserting malicious prosecution 
against a prosecutor would be anomalous because it's the 
prosecutor who is exclusively responsible for causing

the kind of injury.

 If a police officer or a nonprosecuting 
prosecutor simply fabricates the evidence, as Chief 
Judge Easterbrook of the Seventh Circuit said, there can 
be no cause of action.

 It is the exclusive function of a prosecutor 

in a case who uses the evidence who can cause the 
injury, and although --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that makes no sense 

because, if you go down that road, then what you're 
saying is that neither the -- neither a police officer 
or a different prosecutor who fabricated evidence could 
be liable, either, because the only person who causes 
the deprivation is the prosecutor who uses the false 
evidence at trial.

 MR. SANDERS:  Your Honor, this Court has not 

spoken to that question, but as you stated, that would 
be the rationale of the restatement actually.  The 
restatement says, if there is no deception of the 
prosecutor, then it is the prosecutor's willful and free 
will use of the evidence at trial.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, the Second Circuit 

in its decision, Judge Newman, looked at it and said 
there are two causes to the injury here.  One is the 
fabrication, joint tortfeasors.  There are two people

who can cause any injury and the prosecutor who actually 
puts the evidence in at trial.  That's how you hold 
police officers and different prosecutors liable because 
they are assisting in the violation that is occurring.

 MR. SANDERS:  Uh-hmm.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why doesn't that theory 
fit the same prosecutor who commits two different acts?

 MR. SANDERS:  Your Honor, I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  One commits the direct 

violation, and the other act, the investigatory act, 
contributes to it, leads to it as a joint activity with 
it.

 MR. SANDERS:  Your Honor, I believe the 
analysis is not that it -- because it leads to the 
injury itself.  The tort of wrongful conviction based on 
use of false evidence at trial has only one element 
under this Court's precedents in Pyle and Mooney and 
Hysler and Rochin.  That element is the prosecutor's use 
of the evidence at trial.  But simply because that act 
is absolutely immune is not to say that someone else 
who's responsible for --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're confusing -- the 

constitutional injury is the deprivation of liberty. 
That's the injury.

 MR. SANDERS:  That's correct.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What causes that injury 
is not an element of the crime.  It is -- the question 
is have you proven the violation, have you proven the 
injury.

 MR. SANDERS:  Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why does the use 

define the scope of the injury?

 MR. SANDERS:  Because that is the way a 

prosecutor would be held liable.  The cause of action 
against a prosecutor, even though he would be absolutely 
immune, would be the prosecutor's knowing or even 
unknowing use of the false evidence at trial.  But in 
this case, Respondents ask for a free-standing due 
process right that would somehow at the same time 
protect the interest against wrongful conviction at 
trial.  That simply can't be.  This Court's decision --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the view that 
Judge Fairchild expressed very simply.  He said if this 
fabrication had not occurred, there never would have 
been any trial.

 MR. SANDERS:  Your Honor, as we discussed in 

our opening brief in this case, I think that Judge 
Fairchild's reasoning is classic malicious prosecution 
reasoning.  That is, that it's the false evidence that 
impelled the prosecution.  But again, this Court has

been absolutely clear that a malicious prosecution 
theory cannot be asserted against a prosecutor because a 
prosecutor can initiate willfully and maliciously a 
wrongful prosecution based on good evidence, bad 
evidence, or no evidence at all.

 It's simply untenable to say -- and this 
Court's decision last term in Van de Kamp made clear 
that where the injury comes at trial, where that is the 
interest protected against, that you can somehow 
abrogate immunity and continue with a case based on that 
kind of claim based on a claim of an earlier due process 
right --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was there no injury in 

the period before?  Let's leave out the trial for a 
moment.  There was a deprivation of liberty during the 
investigatory stage.

 MR. SANDERS:  Your Honor, I think any 

earlier deprivation of liberty would be covered by the 
Fourth Amendment.  The Fourth Amendment is not 
implicated in the question presented here.  It has not 
been briefed.  Surely there would be an interest against 
wrongful seizure or, since this -- these arrests were 
pursuant to legal process, against a form of malicious 
prosecution.  But again, that would be a Fourth 
Amendment theory and it could not be asserted if it is

malicious prosecution against a prosecutor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Would you clear up one 
thing for me I really don't quite understand.  You do 
agree that if the police officers did this there would 
be liability?

 MR. SANDERS:  Your Honor, this Court has not 

addressed that issue.  That is the view of some of the 
circuits and the Restatement.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Are you assuming that to 

be correct or are you disputing that?

 MR. SANDERS:  We're assuming that to be 

correct, but if I --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But if that's true, why 
doesn't the trial immunize the police officers because 
they didn't cause the trial?  Well, they were in the 
background in the same sense that these prosecutors are. 
But why would the police officers be liable?

 MR. SANDERS:  A police officer would never 

get immunity at trial because --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Not to get immunity, but 

why is he liable?  Why is he liable?  Because the injury 
was caused by the trial, if I understand your theory.

 MR. SANDERS:  The theory of the common law 

on malicious prosecution would be that the police 
officer is liable because his fabrication of evidence

impelled the proceeding, caused the proceeding .

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But it was not a malicious 

prosecution.  The prosecution -- the prosecutors acted 
in good faith all the way through, so there is no 
malicious prosecution.  So what is the basis for 
liability against the police officers?

 MR. SANDERS:  The basis for liability 
precisely against the police officer would be the 
violation of the due process right to a fair trial, 
Wrongful conviction on the basis of the introduction --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Why doesn't the theory 

apply to the facts of this case also?

 MR. SANDERS:  This theory wouldn't apply to 

the facts of this case because in this case the 
prosecutors made the decision independently to initiate 
the prosecution.  It's undisputed that they did that in 
their capacity as prosecutors.  They -- the police 
officers' act could not cause injury but for the 
immunized act of a prosecutor beginning the prosecution 
and conducting the trial.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  This investigation by the 

prosecutor could not have caused injury but for the 
immunized act of going forward with the trial.

 MR. SANDERS:  But, Your Honor, I think --

MR. SANDERS:  I think that that reasoning 

would be to what this Court affirmed in Yaselli and what 
this Court has said -- and which the Court has 
repeatedly cited favorably, and that is -- and it would 
also run up against the concerns that Justice Kennedy 
indicated in his concurrence in Buckley, which this --
the majority in Buckley also disputed and said there is 
no disjunction between qualified immunity for a 
prosecutor during an investigation but absolute immunity 
for the act of setting the prosecution in motion.

 The Court was absolutely clear in footnote 5 

of Buckley that there was no disjunction, and as this 
Court has indicated in Malley v. Briggs and other cases, 
anything other than absolute immunity for a prosecutor 
would impair the -- would impair the performance of a 
central actor in the judicial process.

 With the Court's permission, I'll reserve 

the balance of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL
 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

and may it please the Court:

 This Court's decision in Buckley v. 

Fitzsimmons the question presented today, which is 
whether a cause of action exists against prosecutors 
alleged to have fabricated evidence.  Respondents' 
answer to this question asks this Court to announce for 
first time ever that there is a free-standing due 
process right not to be framed.  That theory would 
untether due process from the right to a fair trial, 
which is the process a defendant is due before being 
deprived of liberty.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why do we need that theory? 
I mean, why not just say what Newman said and the others 
said?  There is no free-standing right.  There is just a 
right not to convict a person with made-up evidence, and 
of course a prosecutor insofar as he's involved in the 
prosecutorial stage is absolutely immune.  But if he's 
involved in the investigatorial stage of that event, 
well, then he's not immune absolutely.  That's a policy 
decision.  That has nothing to do with free-standing 
rights.

 MR. KATYAL:  Respondents' primary submission 
before this Court is not that argument.  They don't rest

that argument.

 MR. KATYAL:  Right, and with respect to that 

I think we have several, several responses.  The first 
is that this Court has rejected that kind of mere 
foreseeability analysis in the context of section 1983.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Mere foreseeability.  You 
can fill in those boundaries, Toffler, not Toffler, as 
you wish.  But the basic theory isn't a problem because, 
after all, we're just drawing a line somewhere within 
the stage of an ongoing tort on the basis of policy, and 
Buckley suggests such a line.  I don't see a conceptual 
problem there, is my problem.  Maybe there are practical 
problems, but I don't see a conceptual one.

 MR. KATYAL:  I think there are practical and 

conceptual problems, which is why Buckley reserved 
precisely this question in footnote 5, and here's the 
basic policy or conceptual concern.  Our point is that 
if a section 1983 defendant is absolutely immune for the 
constitutional wrong, then you can't read back in time; 
a plaintiff can't look back in time and isolate some 
other acts as to which they are nonimmune and thereby --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I interrupt you right 

there.  I would say they are not absolutely immune for 
the whole constitutional offense.  That's the line I'm 
trying to draw.

MR. KATYAL:  And, Justice Breyer, I'm saying 

to do that requires you to read the due process 
violation as occurring sometime before the trial, and 
then we're back to the free-standing rationale and the 
opening up of the due process clause to something this 
Court has never, ever accepted.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So I agree with you on 

that.  I agree with you.  I won't do it.  I'll take it 
as one tort.  Began before the investigation stage, ends 
with conviction.  One tort.  Now, within that tort we 
draw a line and we draw a line based on policy purposes 
as to when the prosecutor is absolutely or qualifiedly 
immune, and where that line comes is Buckley, 
approximately.  Okay?

 Now, I don't see a conceptual problem with 

that and I'm having a hard time finding a practical 
problem.

 MR. KATYAL:  The conceptual problem is that 

this Court has been explicit that section 1983 is not 
the font of tort law.  Rather, you need to isolate a 
constitutional violation.  Here, the constitutional 
violation is the due process clause.  That violation 
begins, as this Court's decisions in Napue and Pyle say, 
when the fabricated evidence is introduced at trial in 
order to secure a conviction.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And how do you get the 

policeman who has fabricated the evidence?

 MR. KATYAL:  Because the policeman 

essentially induces the prosecution at an earlier point 
of time and acts through the innocent agent, the 
prosecutor, that introduction of evidence at trial is 
not something as to which the policeman has any sort of 
absolute immunity.  And so in Justice Breyer's example 
of a prosecutor introducing evidence, that is something 
as to which the prosecutor is absolutely immune.  That 
is where the constitutional violation begins.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What if a prosecutor knows 

that it's fabricated evidence?  The police officer 
fabricates the evidence and says:  Mr. Prosecutor, it's 
a very bad man; I fabricated the evidence.  The 
prosecutor introduces it.  What result there?

 See, your footnote 6 presumes that the 

prosecutor doesn't know.

 MR. KATYAL:  Right.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose he knows?
 MR. KATYAL:  And if the prosecutor does 

know, we don't think that there is a Fifth Amendment due 
process violation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Against the policeman?
 MR. KATYAL:  Against -- against the

policeman in that circumstance, because the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Again, the more aggravated 

the tort, the greater the immunity.

 MR. KATYAL:  And I agree that that seems a 

little odd --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You're basically saying 

that you cannot aid and abet someone who is immune, and 
that's just not the law.

 MR. KATYAL:  No, what I'm saying and what 

this Court's decisions have said is that absolute 
immunity doesn't exist to protect bad apples.  It 
reflects a larger interest in protecting judicial 
information coming into the judicial process.  And if 
prosecutors have to worry at trial that every act they 
undertake will somehow open up the door to liability, 
then they will flinch in the performance of their duties 
and not introduce that evidence.  And that is the 
distinction between the police officer, who is liable, 
and the prosecutor, who is -- who is absolutely immune.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  A prosecutor is not 

going to flinch when he suspects evidence is perjured or 
fabricated?  Do you really want to send a message to 
police officers that they should not merely flinch but 
stop if they have reason to believe that evidence is 
fabricated?

MR. KATYAL:  Justice Sotomayor, we 

absolutely want to send that message.  The worry is that 
allegations of wrongdoing, as this Court has recognized 
in Imbler and Van de Kamp, can -- can supersede that. 
And just to give you --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Am I right that none of 
the -- neither of the two prosecutors in this case were 
sanctioned in any way for their conduct?

 MR. KATYAL:  I believe that is correct, and 

I also believe that no ethics complaints were ever 
brought.  That is, rather the Respondents went into 
Federal court seeking money damages instead of ethics 
violations and the like.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you have no reason 
to dispute the numerous studies we were provided that 
show that as a matter of routine prosecutors are not 
sanctioned for improper prosecutorial conduct in the 
investigatory stage, are you?

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, I do think that there is 
a debate in the briefs before this Court, including the 
brief by 12,400 or so prosecutors that takes the reverse 
view.  But be that as it may, I think that is a question 
for the legislature.

 This Court has said repeatedly that those 

ethics and disciplinary violations are -- are a

successful deterrent, and there is others as well that 
this Court has pointed to that may be available, 
including counsel's liability.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you can't have it 
both ways and say this is a policy we should take into 
account and then when Justice Sotomayor asks you a 
question, say:  Oh, well, that's for the legislature.  I 
mean, you're -- it seems to me you're trying to have it 
both ways.

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, with respect to a cause 

of action and whether the principles of absolute 
immunity apply to this, I think this Court has already 
recognized several times that the overriding interest is 
protecting the judicial process and not letting 
information be chilled and not come in.

 To give you a couple of data points, there 

were 14.4 million arrests in the year 2006 and 1.1, 
approximately, million felony convictions.  Respondents' 
theory would allow prosecutors in any of those 
circumstances to be sued for an alleged fabrication of 
evidence, and that's something that could be -- that's 
something that's not that hard to envision, since 
criminal evidence, unlike civil evidence, is messy.  It 
often involves cooperation agreements, leniency 
agreements and the like, and for that reason it's very

natural, and this Court has recognized that in Imbler, 
for the defendant in a criminal case to say:  Well, I'm 
going to blame the prosecutor; they fabricated evidence, 
they made this story up; and -- and then seek civil 
liability.

 And what this Court has said repeatedly is 

that the societal interest suffers.  And that is why 
it's not about, Justice Kennedy, protecting the bad 
apple and someone who exacerbates the harm by carrying 
the fabricated evidence through trial.  Rather, what 
this Court's absolute immunity decisions consistently 
reflect is the principle that when someone is 
introducing evidence at trial, you don't want to chill 
them in the performance of their duties in any way 
through the rubric of civil liability.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  I don't understand why at 

the time of introducing the evidence, the policy 
concerns that you've described arise, because we were 
criticizing what he did before he introduced the 
evidence.

 MR. KATYAL:  When -- when the evidence is 

introduced and it's the prosecutor himself who developed 
that evidence, maybe through flipping a witness or 
something like that, that --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right, and he would know

whether or not it was fabricated.

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, he would know whether or 

not it's fabricated, but the question is whether he 
would know that he could insulate himself from an 
allegation of wrongdoing.  And Respondents' theory, 
which allows the due process clause to be some sort of 
free-standing right, would permit those suits even at 
the earliest stages of an investigation and permit 
strike suits even before the criminal process is 
underway.

 And that, I think, is a fundamental point, 
which is this Court, no court has, ever really accepted 
the notion that prosecutors can be liable, that there is 
a cause of action for --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But haven't we said that 
during the investigating stage their conduct is subject 
to different rules than during the trial?

 MR. KATYAL:  For purposes of absolute 

immunity, and we agree with that.  So, for example, 
Justice Stevens, in your Fourth Amendment decision in 
1975 on the Seventh Circuit, we agree there is liability 
when a prosecutor is, for example, conducting a raid or 
something like that.  There the constitutional violation 
is complete before the trial, and whatever the 
prosecutor does at trial --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I just don't see the -- I 
don't to see if I can understand the reason why the time 
in which the violation is completed, namely after the 
trial, goes to the question of whether there is 
liability for pretrial conduct.

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, we think there is no 

liability for pretrial conduct, and so long as you agree 
with me that the due process clause violation begins 
only at the trial --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  It was completed at the 

trial, but it began when the -- the phony investigation 
started.

 MR. KATYAL:  The -- the text of the due 

process clause says the deprivation of life, liberty, 
property with -- under due process of law, and due 
process under this Court's decisions is what happens at 
trial, not before.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

arguments to why there ought to be liability for the 
prosecutor -- rather, for the police officer and not the 
prosecutor, and both of those are arguments this Court 
has already heard and rejected.

 On the immunity issue, the argument 

Petitioners make seems to distill to the proposition 
that as long as you're suing a prosecutor for injuries 
inflicted at trial, the prosecutor ought to have 
absolute immunity.

 Now, that's not a crazy theory of immunity. 

It's exactly the theory of immunity that the Seventh 
Circuit adopted in the Buckley decision and this Court 
reversed, unanimously as to the press conference and by 
a majority opinion with respect to pretrial 
investigatory conduct involving fabrication.  If that 
sounds familiar, it should.  That's the conduct that's 
at issue here.

 So the absolute immunity issue in this case 

was decided in Buckley.  Now --

JUSTICE ALITO:  When the issue, when the --

the claim is based on the evaluation of the truthfulness 
of a witness who eventually testifies at trial, where's 
the line to be drawn between the investigative stage and 
the prosecutorial stage?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think, Justice Alito,

the place to draw the line is the place this Court drew 
the line in Buckley, which is probable cause.  And 
before probable cause, when prosecutors are engaging in 
investigatory functions, I don't think we want them 
shaping the witness for trial.  I think we want them 
trying to figure out who actually committed this crime 
and who would we have probable cause to perhaps initiate 
process against.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What concerns me about your 

argument is the -- is a real fear that it will 
eviscerate Imbler.  Now, maybe you can convince me that 
it will not have that effect, but as the Solicitor 
General argued at the end of his argument, a very -- in 
the typical criminal case, the witnesses are not 
John Q. Public with -- who have never engaged in any 
wrongful activity.

 A typical witness is -- well, let's take the 
case of the prosecution of a -- a white -- of the CEO of 
a huge corporation for insider trading or some other 
white-collar violation.  And the chief witness against 
this person is, let's say, the CFO of this company, who 
when initially questioned by law enforcement officials 
and investigatory officials, made -- made statements 
denying any participation in any wrongdoing, but 
eventually changed his story and testifies against the

CEO at trial in exchange for consideration in a plea 
deal.

 Now, your argument, in a case like that --

or you could change the facts, make it an organized 
crime case, make it a prosecution of a drug kingpin 
who's testifying -- the witness against him is a 
lower-ranking person in the organization who has a 
criminal record, maybe has previously committed perjury, 
has made numerous false statements, is subject to 
impeachment.  In all of those cases a claim could be 
brought against the prosecutor.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Alito, let me 
try to answer it this way, which is you mentioned both 
organized crime cases and insider trading cases.  Well, 
I think if there is any circuit in which those kind of 
claims are going to be brought it's probably the Second 
Circuit.  The Second Circuit has lived with this rule 
since the year 2000 and the Zahrey decision that's 
already been mentioned.  There has not been a floodgate 
opening, there's not been a torrent of these claims. 
There's been a trickle.  They remain very hard to 
allege, and the allegations here --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I mean, that might be 
true as an empirical matter, but I don't understand why 
it would be hard to allege.

MR. CLEMENT:  What would you --
JUSTICE ALITO:  What would you have to 

allege to get by Iqbal or to get by summary judgment? 
You allege that the testimony at trial was false and 
that the prosecutor knew that it was false.  And in 
support of that you have prior inconsistent statements 
by the witness, and you may have the evidence that was 
introduced by the defense at trial that is inconsistent 
with that.  You have a triable issue.
 MR. CLEMENT:  I don't --
JUSTICE ALITO:  You certainly get by 

12(b)(6).

 MR. CLEMENT:  As I hear your hypothetical, I 
don't think so, because the thing that's missing is the 
allegation that the prosecutors fabricated that 
evidence.  This isn't a case about coaching a witness.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but what --

what if there's an acquittal?  Then you have at least a 
jury not believing the evidence, and that also is strong 
support for at least supporting an allegation.  He 
fabricated it; nobody believed it when it was presented 
at trial.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, two things, Your Honor.

that take place during the investigatory stage, you

would be protected by Imbler.

 Now, in the acquittal situations, this Court 

doesn't have a case directly on point.  But if I read 
the Hartman decision, for example, Hartman v.  Moore, 
and apply it to this context, I assume that in the 
context of an acquittal if you tried to bring a claim 
like this, this Court would interpret through the common 
law the -- a malicious prosecution type element that you 
would have to satisfy.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why is it difficult to 

allege fabrication?  The -- the allegation is that at 
point A this witness denied that the defendant did 
anything wrong, and then at point B the defendant told 
an entirely different story after having received from 
the government a plea deal that promises no prosecution 
and entry into the witness protection program or 
something like that.  That certainly is sufficient 
evidence to -- of fabrication, is it not?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Alito, let me 

say this.  First of all, you are going to have to 
pinpoint those kind of allegations pre-probable cause, 
which is not going to be the case in a lot of cases.

 Second of all, I mean, this Court --

by that.

MR. CLEMENT:  In -- in the typical case, 

if -- if the witness perhaps in the first instance comes 
up with one testimony and later comes up in -- with a 
different story later, the question for purposes of 
absolute immunity is going to be, did all of the conduct 
that you're alleging, the fabrication, did all of it 
take place before probable cause attached?  And in a lot 
of cases prosecutors don't even get involved until after 
probable cause, until after there have been arrests, 
something like that.  And in those cases --

JUSTICE ALITO:  That's an entirely false 
picture of the way any sophisticated prosecution is 
handled today, completely false.  You want -- the 
prosecutor may not know whether there's probable cause 
until the prosecutor interviews the witness.

 MR. CLEMENT:  And, again --
JUSTICE ALITO:  And so then you have to go 
back and determine whether there was -- if there wasn't 
probable cause before the interview, then there is 
liability.  But if there was probable cause before the 
interview, then there isn't liability.

 MR. CLEMENT:  I think if I understand your 

hypothetical, the question would actually be whether 
there was probable cause before the re-interview, 
because if at the point --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Before the re-interview, 

because the prosecutor doesn't want to take the case to 
the grand jury before looking this witness in the eye 
and seeing whether this -- this guy who's got a lot of 
impeachment baggage is -- is a -- is a credible witness.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, two things, Justice 

Alito.  First of all, if you have all -- if you had the 
interview and the re-interview before probable cause and 
you have the allegations that it was done for the avowed 
purpose of depriving the person of their liberty, then 
you would, I think, apply Iqbal, and you would ask under 
all the circumstances of that case whether it's a 
plausible allegation.

 And this Court is obviously in a better 

position than I am to say how it would apply Iqbal in 
those kind of cases.  But what I can tell you is that 
for nearly a decade the Second Circuit has had this 
rule.  Now, the Second Circuit is the circuit that 
brought you Iqbal.  So for that same decade they did not 
have the rule of Iqbal, and yet they didn't have a 
torrent of these claims.

 So, I think going forward, if you recognize 

these claims --

because there is usually a circuit conflict here, and 
you look at one circuit and say the world hasn't fallen. 
But you have no idea how many of these claims are 
asserted and dismissed at an early stage or -- or 
whatever.

 You're saying, what, that there haven't been 

many Second Circuit opinions on this question?

 MR. CLEMENT:  I think if you look at 

reported, both unpublished and published Second Circuit 
decisions at the district court level and the court of 
appeals level, you would find very few cases that even 
cite Zahrey.  I think it's something like maybe 17 I 
think is what we found.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you think there 
will be -- do you think there will be more if we agree 
with your theory?

 MR. CLEMENT:  In the Second Circuit?  I 

don't think so.  I think it will be the same number in 
the Second Circuit.

 Now, in the Seventh Circuit that has lived 
with the Buckley remand rule, I suppose there will now 
be a couple of dozen cases there.  But I do think it's 
revealing that the circuit that has certainly the kind 
of cases that Justice Alito was dealing with, has not 
had a flood of these cases.  As far as I'm aware, the

U.S. attorney's offices in that circuit have not had to 
rework the way they do business in those circuits, and I 
do think that these are claims that are going to be 
difficult to allege.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but it's also 

you don't really know, right?  In other words, we're 
concerned about the chilling effect on the prosecutors. 
We don't know what the impact of the Second Circuit's 
decision has been on the prosecutors.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Your Honor, we don't 

know for sure.  We don't know either way, because either 
way this Court is going to adopt a clear rule.  What I 
can say is at least I'm pointing to empirical evidence 
in a circuit that has lived with this rule for a decade. 
That seems to me a better empirical basis to go on than 
absolutely nothing.

 But let me give you another example, which 
is this Court a couple of years ago decided a decision 
called Hartman v. Moore.  Hartman v. Moore sort of 
recognized that there was a tort called, I think, 
retaliatory inducement to prosecute.

 Now, in footnote 8 this Court recognized 

that actually you could sue a prosecutor for retaliatory 
inducement to prosecute if you focused on the 
investigatory activities.  That's exactly the same basic

theory we have here, which is you focus on the 
investigatory activities of a prosecutor and say that 
there is a valid 1983 claim.

 Now, again, to my knowledge there have not 

been a flood of Hartman claims brought against 
prosecutors.  I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- what is the 

basis for the 1983 claim without the submission at 
trial?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Without the submission at 
trial -- I mean, it would depend, I suppose, on the 
circumstances.  You could have, certainly, a Fourth 
Amendment --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you know I'm 
not talking about the Fourth Amendment violation, which 
is complete whether there's a trial or not.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well -- and then maybe I just 
need a concrete hypothetical.  Let's say -- let's say --
let me -- let me provide one.  Suppose that there was 
this -- the prosecutor put on this fabricated evidence 
at trial, and then the -- the whole case sort of 
unraveled because the system actually worked the way 
it's supposed to.  On cross-examination the witness 
cracked and it became clear that there was this 
conspiracy to use perjured evidence.

Now, at that point -- I mean, I suppose the 
government's theory would be because you never deprived 
the person of their liberty, the knowing use by the 
prosecutor of perjured testimony at trial does not 
violate the due process clause.

 But I hope that's not the rule.  I mean, I 
hope that in a Mooney case, if you bring the -- make a 
Mooney violation against somebody who is actually 
guilty, so you knowingly use perjured testimony against 
somebody that's -- that's guilty, so if you did a 
harmless error analysis, you would say, well, the use of 
the perjured testimony really didn't deprive the person 
of their liberty because they were otherwise --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's -- what's -- what's 

your best authority for the proposition that there's 
liability in the case the Chief Justice put?  What's 
your best case?

 MR. CLEMENT:  I -- I -- I'm not sure I have 

a best case for that, Justice Kennedy.  I mean, let 
me -- let me give you what I think is a very good case 
that illustrates a similar principle, but I -- I will --
I will be candid that I think this is an extrapolation 
from Mooney, but a very sort of clear extrapolation from 
Mooney.

 My best case in some ways I think is Malley,

because their proposition seems to be that -- this is 
the other argument you have heard and rejected -- is 
that if there's an absolutely immune act in the causal 
chain, then that somehow means that there is no 
violation.

 Think about who was sued in the Malley.  It 
was the police officers.  What did the police officers 
do?  They procured an invalid arrest warrant.  Now, did 
their actions independent of the absolute immune act of 
the magistrate injure the plaintiffs?  No.  Without the 
magistrate issuing the warrant, there was no arrest, 
there's no search, there's no injury to the plaintiffs.
 So we allow in our system somebody to bring 

a constitutional tort claim, even though there's an 
absolutely immune act in the causal chain.

 The lower court in Malley actually accepted 
exactly this argument, that if you have any absolutely 
immune act in the causal chain that breaks it off.  This 
Court rejected it and was frankly fairly dismissive, 
dismissed it in the footnote, footnote 7 of the opinion.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You will have to refresh 

my memory.  Wasn't that a Fourth Amendment violation 
ultimately?

 MR. CLEMENT:  It was a Fourth Amendment 

violation.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So that -- so that's 

not --

MR. CLEMENT:  No, I think it illustrates the 

principle, which is you don't have to have a completed 
constitutional violation in your 1983 action.  I mean, 
Malley illustrates that principle, but so does the text 
of -- of section 1983, frankly.  Section 1983 doesn't 
force you to have a completed constitutional violation. 
It provides liability if you subject someone to a 
constitutional violation or cause them to be subjected 
to a constitutional violation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The difference here is that 

the -- the absolutely immune act which follows the --
the unlawful act is -- is an absolutely immune act by 
the very actor who performed the earlier act that --
that you say induces liability.  And so the argument is, 
what's the use of giving him liability later on if -- if 
you can simply drag him into litigation by -- by 
alleging that he at an earlier stage committed a 
violation?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the difference.  I 
mean, to me that's the -- the crux of this, that it is 
the same actor who has absolute liability whom you're 
trying to get on the basis of -- of earlier action.

MR. CLEMENT:  Well --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's the reason the rule 

seems perverse.

 MR. CLEMENT:  What's that?
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's the very reason the 

rule they're arguing for seems perverse.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I would ask -- I would 
ask both of you to go back and read two things, and I 
would particularly like Justice Scalia to go back and 
read your separate opinion in Burns.  Because in Burns 
you confronted just this issue.  You conceptualized what 
happens at the warrant stage as a variant of malicious 
prosecution and you said:  Now, could a prosecutor, sort 
of as kind of a complaining witness in that context, 
procure a warrant that they were subsequently involved 
in?  And you said:  I don't see any reason why not.  I 
think you got it right there.

 The other thing I would ask you to look at 
is footnote 8 of the Hartman v. Moore decision, because 
there you were dealing with a retaliatory prosecution 
claim.  Now, the Court's opinion was very careful to 
say, you know, it's really not a retaliation -- a 
retaliatory prosecution claim; what it is is a 
retaliatory inducement to prosecute case.

on anything that goes on at the trial to establish the 
due process violation, what do you rely on to establish 
the violation?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess the question 

is where is it complete, or do you say it doesn't have 
to be a complete violation?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I guess what I would do, 

Mr. Chief Justice, is try to take issue with your 
premise, which is that we can't advert to the absolute 
immune act at all.  Of course we can.  I mean, this 
isn't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, let's say that 

you -- let's say that you can't because we read Imbler 
as conferring absolute immunity on what goes on at the 
trial.  And if you can't advert to that, you don't have 
a constitutional violation, right?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I would still say we do, 

but please let me try to take one more crack at the 
premise, which is Imbler is not a use immunity case and 
this Court has rejected the proposition that just 
because you're absolutely immune for an act there's no 
evidentiary use of that in going after conduct that was 
earlier in the causal chain.

 This Court specifically confronted that in a

case called Dennis v. Sparks that was with, you know, 
the granddaddy of them all, judicial immunity, and said 
even the judge's actions could be proved up as part of a 
tort action.  So there is no use immunity for --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Against -- against 

the judge?

 MR. CLEMENT:  It wasn't against the judge, 
but I -- but with all due respect, I don't think that 
matters.  And I also think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's the 

distinction here in this case, isn't it?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, but -- but it's a 

distinction without a difference.  It's a distinction 
this Court confronted in -- in Hartman in footnote 8. 
It's a distinction Justice Scalia confronted.  And also, 
the consequences of accepting their view is to really 
turn all of your absolute immunity cases into a fool's 
errand.

 I mean, think about Kalina.  I mean, the 
supporting affidavit wasn't the thing that inflicted 
injury.  Now, the thing that inflicted injury were the 
two documents that the supporting affidavit supported, 
the warrant and the information.  Now, it would have 
made no sense for this Court to say, well, there is only 
qualified immunity for the supporting affidavit, so

let's send this back to the lower court, if you couldn't 
even get into evidence the fact that there was an 
information or a warrant.

 So too in the Malley case, of course you 

can use -- now it's a different -- it's a different 
person.  In Kalina -- Kalina, it's the same person.

 Or take a look at Burns, for example.  In 
Burns the prosecutor's advice to the police officer, 
that's not what injured the plaintiff in that case.  It 
was the warrant that was eventually procured.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In terms of the 

chilling impact on the prosecutor, what difference does 
it make whether it's at trial or pretrial for use at 
trial?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think it makes all the 
difference in the world in the sense that if -- if they 
know that everything they do at trial is going to be 
protected, those functions, which is the basis of this 
Court's functional approach to absolute immunity, are 
going to be protected.  Now, if they're going to be --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it won't be protected. 

They won't have that assurance, because when they --
when they produce evidence at trial, oh, yeah, I guess 
the production at trial will be protected, but you're --
you're telling us that they can go back and say, ah, but

you got that evidence in a bad manner, and therefore we 
can sue you, not for introducing it at trial, but for 
fabricating it before trial.

 I -- I don't see that there is much of a 

difference as far as the deterrent effect upon the 
prosecutor is concerned.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think there is going 

to be an effect on the deterrent effect on the 
prosecutor pretrial, which is they will be procured.  I 
mean, think about the contrary incentive you're --
you're creating.  Suppose you're a prosecutor.  You've 
participated in the misconduct before trial.  You now 
have the decision to make:  Okay, I was -- I was 
complicit in the fabrication of this perjured evidence; 
should I put it on into evidence?  Well, let's see.  If 
I don't put it on into evidence and I come clean now, 
I'm actually liable for the arrest and all the pretrial 
detention.  If I actually introduce it into evidence 
now, I'm scot-free.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  There's a different 

tendency, which I would say this is a slight fluke, what 
you're describing.  I'm more worried about what Justice 
Alito brought up, that, other things being equal, I 
think it's probably a good thing to get prosecutors 
involved in the questioning process.  That -- that has a

kind of check on the police.

 And the concern I'd have is that the --this 
will discourage the prosecutors from becoming involved 
in the witness -- witness questioning process, at least 
not before the police are well on the way.  And that is 
a very negative incentive, I would think.

 So what is your most pro-prosecutorial rule 
that you could live with that will in fact minimize the 
risk of that kind of disincentive?  Now, are you just 
going to say, well, Buckley?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Or is there something -- I 

mean, I can see Buckley with the, you know, probable 
cause.  It turns on and off as you're talking to the 
witness.  First what he says, you have the probable 
cause; then you don't; then you do; then you don't.  I 
mean, I -- I'm not -- I just want you to give your best 
thought to this problem and tell me what is the most 
safe rule that will allow you to win your case?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Breyer, I mean, 

I would say that there is no reason for this Court to 
disturb the line it drew in Buckley.  Now I could, 
because of this case --

very discouraging to, you know, AUSAs or DAs going in 
and talking to the witnesses with the police.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And they say they do it in 

Chicago, I think.  In other places, they do it a lot.
 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I mean, another thing 
presumably, Justice Breyer, you want to encourage is 
having the police officers come to the prosecutors and 
get legal advice about what they're doing.  And this 
Court squarely confronted that question in Burns and 
said the advice-giving function, which is a function 
only a prosecutor, only a lawyer anyways, can perform --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, could you answer 

Justice Breyer's question, which I -- I think raises a 
-- a critical point in terms of Justice Alito's examples 
of talking to the witness.  Why isn't that at some 
point -- I think in Buckley, the "judicial phase."  Why 
is this the judicial phase?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Kennedy, let me 

respond.  Let me say why I don't think I can really 
improve on the probable cause line.  I mean, in this 
case, the police officers and the prosecutors were 
involved in this from the get-go.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, but probable cause 

doesn't work because you have -- you have probable cause

once you fabricate the evidence.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's circular.
 MR. CLEMENT:  No, I don't think so.  I think 

for the purposes of evaluating when there's probable 
cause, you have to eliminate the fabricated evidence, 
and so I think that you evaluate probable cause, but 
here's why I think it's the right line, Because think 
about the prosecutor's special function.

 If you don't have probable cause to arrest 

any individual for a crime, then the function the police 
officers ought to be performing is one of a 
truth-seeking function and that is a classic police 
investigatory function.

 Now, the moment they have probable cause, 

I'm willing to listen to the argument that at that point 
they shift roles, and at that point they're not looking 
at the evidence the way the police officer is, just to 
find out whodunit; but they're looking at it to say, 
well I have a job to do, I have to put a case on, and, 
you know, this person says what they say, and, you know, 
there's some problems with that and the jury's not going 
to believe that, so let me talk to him some more.

 That's why I think the probable cause line 
is not only administrable, but it makes sense in this

context.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose the prosecutor 

isn't sure there's probable cause and he calls -- calls 
in the accountant, the CFO, and really doesn't begin to 
believe his story, so he starts probing and finally he 
gets the CFO to change his story with the plea -- plea 
bargain.  Would that be part of the judicial process? 
Or is that still clearly investigatory?

 MR. CLEMENT:  I think at the point -- if the 

interview begins and he doesn't think he has probable 
cause, I think that that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, he's trying to find 

out.  That's what --

MR. CLEMENT:  Of course he is trying to find 

out.  But he's -- but he's not trying to find out if 
there's probable cause necessarily to identify a 
particular suspect.  What he's trying to do, is there 
probable cause to arrest anyone?  And that's exactly the 
question a police officer asks every single day.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, also, you're making 
me more worried because I think, if 85 percent of all 
the defendants -- or 90 percent plead guilty, it might 
be a highly desirable thing to get prosecutors involved 
in the truth-discovering process, I mean, so that they 
don't just see themselves as the job of -- well, we're

going to take somebody, put them in jail.

 Maybe -- maybe that's a reason for pushing 

it back a little bit, this -- this line.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well -- you know, I'm not sure 

what the logical place to push it back any further is, 
and I think -- you know --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where have you got it now? 

You've got it as when there is probable cause for 
believing that someone has committed a crime?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Someone?  So it's 

someone -- needn't be the particular person they 
eventually indict?

 MR. CLEMENT:  That's right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Uh-huh.
 MR. CLEMENT:  And let me say this, Justice 

Breyer, I mean, I know you don't want to talk about 
Burns, but I'd like to, just for a second, because I 
think it's a very similar policy concern.

 As a policy matter, sure, we want 

prosecutors to get -- to give advice to police officers, 
but qualified immunity is not insignificant protection, 
and think about that, I mean, the incentives you're 
creating for the same anomaly that the Court recognized 
in Buckley.  The incentive would really --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, we thought it 

was -- I'm sorry.  Why don't you finish your answer?
 MR. CLEMENT:  I just wanted to say the 

incentive would really be perverse.  Under Burns, if the 
police -- if the police officer comes to the prosecutor 
and says -- you know, we want to fabricate evidence to 
frame it, can we do it?  And the prosecutor says, yes, 
you can do that, go ahead; there's qualified immunity.
 Now, if the prosecutor says, go ahead and 
let me help, there would somehow be absolute immunity. 
I mean, that is really an anomalous result, that it's 
the n anomaly that caused this Court in Buckley to draw 
the line at probable cause.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I was going to 
suggest in response to your point that -- you know, 
qualified immunity is really significant.  Of course, it 
is, but we've recognized, in a number of contexts, in 
the judicial area, for example, that it's -- it's not 
enough.

 We have also recognized that in the 

prosecutorial area, and trying to draw the line where 
you do -- I think this was one of the points Justice 
Alito was making, is that, sometimes, you're 
investigating and preparing your case at the same time.

just going to look and see what I can find.  You have 
particular areas.  The prosecution requires you to show 
four things, So you are looking at those four things. 
You are preparing your case, and you're investigating.

 MR. CLEMENT:  And, again, the Court 

addressed exactly this Court in the -- exactly that 
issue in the Buckley decision and said, sure -- you 
know, from -- with the benefit of hindsight, you can 
sort of retrospectively look and make anything in the 
investigatory stage part of -- and part and parcel of 
the prosecution.

 And I don't think that was something that 

this Court saw as a reason not to draw a clean line 
that's consistent with the functional approach.  It's 
consistent, not just with Buckley, but with Burns and 
with Kalina and with a whole host of this Court's 
decisions.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  In -- in answer to Justice 

Breyer's question, would -- would it be a -- would it be 
practical and conceptually correct to draw the line at 
the stage at which the prosecutor is interviewing 
witnesses to evaluate credibility?

 So, at that stage, the prosecutorial 

function has begun and absolute immunity would kick in.

I suppose I might be able --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Not on whether there is 

probable cause because probable cause is -- is 
evanescent.  It comes, and it goes.  It is -- it is --
it is inextricably intertwined with what the prosecutor 
is doing in questioning the witness.

 MR. CLEMENT:  And let me say this:  If I 

could add a couple of words, I think we could probably 
live with that line, which is, if the prosecutor is 
interviewing those witnesses with an eye towards 
credibility for use at trial, I mean, that's a line 
that, I think, would be, I think, probably pretty 
consistent with probable cause, but something that we 
could live with, but --

JUSTICE ALITO:  But with a line toward 
investigating credibility for use at a trial, which 
is -- which is, at that point, foreordained, but, if the 
evaluation is being done for the purpose of determining 
whether there should be a trial, then, no.  That's your 
answer?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I mean, I worry that 

words are being put in my mouth.  I would say that, if 
the prosecutor is interviewing the witness for the 
purpose of judging their credibility at trial, then 
that's something for which you may be able to sort of

tweak the line on Buckley and say that's covered.

 I actually think it won't make any 

difference because I think that should only be happening 
after probable cause.  If I could --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, your approach, 

then, encourages prosecutors to be trigger happy. 
They're prosecuting right now because they know, then, 
that everything else, they have absolute immunity, so --
you know, shoot first and ask questions later.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, shoot first -- you mean 

go to an impartial magistrate and try to get somebody 
arrested or --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, just begin the 

formulation.  I'm -- I'm starting to prosecute this 
person, rather than saying, let's look, let's 
investigate, let's interview, and then decide who we're 
going to prosecute.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I suppose --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In Justice Alito's 

hypothetical, you've got a CFO, you can -- you know, 
you've probably got probable cause to go after him as 
well, but you want to begin interviewing him, to see if 
he's going to flip in your case against the CEO.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, if you have probable 
cause, then I think you're on the other side of the

Buckley line, and that's an objective determination, and 
I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you've got --

you've got to make that decision early in the process, 
rather than later.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think it's -- I'm not 

sure it's a decision you have to make.  I think it's 
actually something that would be evaluated objectively 
after the fact, and I think the way that this Court 
should approach this case is neither of the parties 
before you have asked this Court to overturn Buckley.

 I wouldn't do it under those circumstances, 

but, of course, it's worth adding that, if you were 
going to overturn Buckley, then the place to probably 
start would be to go back to first principles, and if 
you're going to go back to first principles, then what 
you're going to find is that there was no common law 
support at all for absolute immunity.

 And I wouldn't think that this Court was 

particularly interested in coming up with implied 
immunities that aren't in the statute and had no basis 
at the common law, and that's why I think some of the 
Justices that have looked at this as an original matter 
have tended to be quite reluctant in recognizing 
absolute immunity because it lacks support in the text

and it lacks support at the common law.

 So we're -- we're happy with the lines that 
this Court has already drawn.  But if the Court's going 
to go back to first principles, well, let's go back to 
first principles and look at -- the at the statute 
Congress passed in 1871.

 That statute did not provide any immunities, 

and I do think, as we say in the brief, this is a case 
where it's important not to lose the forest for the 
trees because this is a statute was passed -- passed in 
1871.  This is one of the great civil rights statutes.
 Is it really plausible to think that the 

Congress that passed this statute didn't want to provide 
a remedy in the circumstances before the Court today?  I 
think it's clear, from this Court's cases -- there may 
not be a case that lines up all the dots exactly, but I 
think it's clear, from this Court's cases, that the 
police officer that engages in this misconduct has 
committed a grave, grave constitutional violation and 
ought to be liable.

 I think the prosecutor who engages in the 

pretrial misconduct and then doesn't participate in the 
trial is just as liable as that police officer, and I 
can't think of a single reason why the only reason a 
prosecutor would get absolute immunity is, if they not

only participated in the pretrial misconduct, but 
completed the scheme by committing further misconduct at 
trial.

 For all those reasons, we think the Court 

should affirm.  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Mr. Clement.

 Mr. Sanders, you have five -- five minutes 

remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN SANDERS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. SANDERS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

We have four main points.

 Beginning with the Second Circuit's decision 

in Zahrey and subsequent cases in the Second Circuit, 
have significantly cut back on the meaning of Zahrey. 
The Wray decision, which we discussed in our reply 
brief, the Gonzalez decision, which we discussed in our 
opening brief, have not allowed for this kind of 
continuous liability for a prosecutor.

 They have made very clear, particularly the 

Gonzalez decision, that when it is a prosecutor's 
actions before a judge advocating on behalf of the 
State, that are responsible for a deprivation of 
liberty, in that situation, absolute immunity applies.

I think it's important to understand the 

consequences --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what does that 

prove?  What does that prove?  I don't understand why 
you bring that up because it shows that the fact that 
there aren't many cases, only 17 in the -- in the Second 
Circuit, it doesn't mean anything because the Second 
Circuit is not applying as liberal a rule as your 
opponent suggests.

 Is that --
MR. SANDERS:  No, Your Honor.  I think it's 
to -- I think it's to say that the Zahrey decision has 
not had the kind of impact and has not been applied in a 
way that respondents are asking for it to be applied.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  That's -- that's just 

what I said, and, therefore -- and had it been applied 
that way, there would have been more than 17 cases in 
the Second Circuit.

 MR. SANDERS:  I'm not sure I understand the 

question.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.
 MR. SANDERS:  The -- I think it's important 
to understand the consequences of affirming the courts 
below, either on the basis of the Zahrey theory or on 
the freestanding due process theory offered by

respondents.

 It would work a radical change in the law of 

immunity because it would mean that far more wrongful 
conviction claims against prosecutors would go forward 
under only qualified immunity.

 That is the inevitable consequence of 

affirming the courts below in this case.  These cases 
are not difficult, as Justice Alito said, to plead, 
particularly because, in most of these sorts of cases, 
most of the discovery will have been done during the 
post-conviction review process.

 And so there will be plenty of -- plenty of 
grounds for a plaintiff to allege a plausible violation 
during the investigative process and survive a motion to 
dismiss or survive summary judgment, even if, 
ultimately, that comes to nothing, the consequence would 
be to hold prosecutors to inconsistent standards of 
liability, qualified immunity or absolute immunity, 
based simply on the allegations in a complaint, 
something this Court has specifically said is -- is not 
appropriate and should not be --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I want, before you're 
finished, to get a clear picture of your view of the 
dimensions of the claim because you rely heavily on the 
trial part.  Everything proceeds as it was alleged to

have proceeded in this case, except that just before the 
trial begins, Harris comes forward and said it was all a 
pack of lies, and so there is no trial.

 MR. SANDERS:  Uh-huh.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is anyone in this picture 
liable?  The defendants have been incarcerated for some 
time, but when it blows up, they're let out.  No trial, 
but everything else, the same.

 MR. SANDERS:  Your Honor, I believe there 
would be no due process liability.  There might be two 
independent grounds for liability under some Fourth 
Amendment malicious prosecution theory, which is not at 
issue in this case, and possibly under State law 
remedies, as Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas 
indicated in their concurrence in Albright, we do not go 
to the Federal constitution's Due Process Clause unless 
we're sure that the plaintiffs have exhausted their 
possible remedies under State law.  In this case, Iowa 
State law provides a cause of action for malicious 
prosecution.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said -- I think your 

position is that due process begins when trial is 
underway, and before that due process doesn't enter the 
picture?

 MR. SANDERS:  Your Honor, I believe that

this Court's decisions make clear that due process 
applies to the judicial process; that is, the filing of 
charges and the later conduct of the prosecuting --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, but what about the 

pretrial detention?  Isn't that a deprivation of 
liberty?

 MR. SANDERS:  Your Honor, it would be, but 

that would be Fourth Amendment territory.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Why would it be Fourth 

Amendment?  Why isn't it Fourteenth Amendment right on 
the nose?  They're deprived of liberty without due 
process of law.

 MR. SANDERS:  Your Honor, this Court --
seven justices in this Court's decision in Albright 
agreed that there was no due process cause of action for 
the wrongful institution of criminal proceedings, that 
in that case there may be some sort of Fourth Amendment 
claim.  There may be some sort of State law claim under 
Parrot v. Taylor, but I have not --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But that case talked about 

the institution of prosecution, not the deprivation of 
liberty during pretrial detention, which is a different 
matter.

 MR. SANDERS:  Your Honor, I believe the 
Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence would still

indicate that that is a concern of the Fourth Amendment, 
not the Due Process Clause, and that pursuant to Paul v. 
Davis and Parrot v. Taylor, there may indeed be some 
sort of State law cause of action for defamation or loss 
of status, but that there is no support for a Federal 
due process claim.
