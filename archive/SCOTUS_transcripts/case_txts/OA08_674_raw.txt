CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

first today in Case 08-674, NRG Power Marketing v. Maine 

(10:02 a.m.) 

Public Utilities Commission. 

Mr. Lamken. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. LAMKEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

This case concerns a bedrock principle of 

Federal -- Federal energy law, the Mobile-Sierra 

doctrine.  The question presented and the issue decided 

below is whether Mobile-Sierra's public interest 

standard ceases to apply whenever a contract rate is 

challenged by a noncontracting party. 

FERC and we agree that the answer is no. 

Mobile-Sierra's presumption of --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does it matter who is 

the challenger?  Are you in a different position than 

the other parties to this action? 

You're a third party who is being bound to a 

particular rate.  The others do have a different 

interest, or they're in a different position with 

respect to their challenges, correct?

MR. LAMKEN:  Your Honor, I represent -- we 

represent -- I represent NRG, which entered into the 

settlement agreement and is -- would like to be bound by 

the results of the auction contract.  And so we are 

happy with the agreements we enter into, and a concern 

that we have is that nonparties can come in and 

challenge the contracts under a lower standard. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So aren't you in a 

different position than those other challengers? 

MR. LAMKEN:  We certainly are in a different 

position, but they --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why doesn't that 

difference do what the D.C. Circuit said? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Lamken, you're not a 

challenger?

MR. LAMKEN:  That's exactly right.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- not to his side --

that, but that's what I'm trying to get to.  The D.C.

Circuit Court's reasoning was very simple:  You're a 

contracting party; you're bound to it.  Why should the 

others who didn't agree to this term be bound by 

Mobile-Sierra?  That's the essence of their holding. 

MR. LAMKEN:  Right.  Nobody is arguing that 

a noncontracting party is bound to terms that it didn't 

agree to in a contract. 

The question is that, when a noncontracting 

party comes in to challenge the terms that two 

consenting, willing buyer and a seller have agreed 

to, what is the standard that should apply for that 

outsider to come in and challenge the rate the two 

people have agreed to? 

And Mobile-Sierra and Morgan Stanley all 

provide the answer, and that is the public interest 

standard.  The standard is that, under the Mobile-Sierra 

doctrine, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must 

presume the contract rate meets the just and reasonable 

requirement provided by law. 

Unless --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So then does that bind 

all types of third parties? 

MR. LAMKEN:  It certainly applies to the 

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and it would be a 

rather odd rule that the agency which is charged with

Congress with administering the statute, has the 

greatest expertise, is bound by a more demanding 

standard, but an entity, an outsider with no such 

statutory mandate and no such expertise is subject to a 

lower standard when it comes in and asks for a contract 

rate to be overturned or abrogated. 

In fact, the court of appeals’ ruling can't 

be reconciled with Mobile-Sierra's foundation and the 

need for contractual certainty.  The whole point is to 

provide certainty of contract so that companies can 

invest hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure 

projects without worrying that their contracts will be 

abrogated lightly after the fact.  But few could risk 

entering into such contracts and make those investments 

if any noncontracting party -- if the Mobile-Sierra 

doctrine applied only to contracting parties, the two 

people who signed the contract.  But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's a bit much to 

say that the importance is to preserve the stability of 

two parties' contract, and, therefore, a third party who 

didn't sign the contract is bound to the two parties' 

contract. 

MR. LAMKEN:  Well, the nonparty isn't 

actually paying the rate.  The two parties are paying 

the rate.  The nonparty is saying:  I'm adversely

affected by that rate indirectly.  And we're all 

regularly adversely affected by contracts we didn't 

enter into.  The example we give in our brief is the 

theatergoers affected by the amount the theater pays for 

the movies and the popcorn and things like that.  But 

the question is what's the standard for that outsider to 

abrogate a rate the two, a willing buyer and a willing 

seller, have entered into? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, so why don't 

you -- why isn't it restricted to some type of direct, 

parties directly affected, as well as -- I mean, you 

complain about the hordes of people who will be able to 

challenge these.  Well, it assumes that anybody can 

challenge it. 

MR. LAMKEN:  Well, it certainly applies to 

the parties most directly affected, which are the 

parties that actually entered into the contract and are 

paying the rates.  So it applies to the Federal Energy 

Regulatory Commission, which is the expert regulator, 

and it doesn't make much sense to have another --

another exemption for some category of not directly 

bound but sufficiently -- sufficiently affected parties. 

It would --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Is there any other area of 

the law in which the parties to a contract can, in

effect, dictate the substantive standard of 

administrative review for challenges raised by 

nonparties? 

MR. LAMKEN:  I think the answer is I don't 

know if there is other areas where there's a 

possibility of a Memphis clause, if that's what you're 

referring to, where the parties can actually –- when 

they enter into a contract, they can actually lower the 

standard.  But the general rule is that when a party 

comes in and tries to abrogate a contract, they have no 

greater rights to challenge the contract than the 

parties who entered it themselves.  If they are a 

third-party beneficiary, it's the same right.  And if 

they're a nonparty, at least so far as we can tell, they 

have no right to challenge the validity of the contract, 

at least as a matter of contract law. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Am I correct -- and maybe 

this is more proper for the government than for you, or 

for all the parties.  I take it no one questions the 

propriety, the lawfulness, of the FERC determination to 

convene the settlement process?  There's no argument 

that this was an improper, an unlawful process? 

MR. LAMKEN:  No.  There is certainly no such 

claim before this Court, and I'm not aware of any such 

one.  But what came out of the process were agreements

with respect to rates, and the settled rule is that such 

agreements cannot be abrogated unless the public 

interest would be severely harmed. And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can I --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Of course, there is. 

What's -- what’s really lurking behind this case is 

whether this is a contract rate, and there FERC 

disagrees with you, I take it.  You were talking about 

that the rate that emerges from a contract between two 

people –- nobody else is party to it, but you say the 

rate stands; FERC cannot abrogate the rate; nobody can 

ask FERC to abrogate that bilateral contract rate.  But 

here we're not talking about a bilateral contract, where 

how many people were involved in the settlement?  Well 

over a hundred. 

MR. LAMKEN:  Scores, yes.  And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So that's quite a 

different picture than the bilateral contracts that were 

at issue in Sierra and Mobile. 

MR. LAMKEN:  Certainly FERC agrees with us 

that at least some of the rates before this Court are 

contract rates. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did the lower court reach 

that question?

Official 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did we grant cert on that 

question? 

MR. LAMKEN:  You did not, and this Court 

regularly declines to address matters that were merely 

assumed or presumed by the court below and instead 

answers the question that was actually answered by the 

court below, which in this case is an important and 

recurring question.  Based on the decision below, FERC 

has actually gone back and rewritten more than 50 

contracts to create an exemption for noncontracting 

parties, including contracts that are clearly bilateral 

contracts, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry?  What do 

you mean, an exemption for noncontracting parties? 

MR. LAMKEN:  Simply to say that the 

Mobile-Sierra doctrine can't apply when the challenge is 

brought by a noncontracting party, but rather what FERC 

wrote into the contracts effectively was the highest 

standard permitted by law will be applied to them.  And 

nobody sitting at these tables can tell this Court what 

that standard would be, which is precisely why this is 

an important issue. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You don't agree that 

FERC has the authority to exempt noncontracting parties

from the binding effect of the contract rates, do you? 

MR. LAMKEN:  No, we don't, which is 

precisely one of the -- we don't believe that the court 

had authority to announce that rule.  We actually 

believe the court erred in announcing that rule.  It --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It isn't in the case. 

MR. LAMKEN:  Yes.  Whether or not these are 

contracted --

JUSTICE BREYER:  This is a case in which, as 

I think most cases where they approve contracts, what 

they're finding is that the contract rate in this 

circumstance, or here the settlement rate in this 

circumstance, is a just and reasonable rate, because. 

All right?  So what are we supposed to do?  I mean, are 

you going to say he's wrong, the lower court's wrong, 

because they got the whole thing mixed up.  I mean –-

could we say that? 

MR. LAMKEN:  Yes.  The lower court got 

everything wrong, it got the whole thing mixed up; send 

it back.

straightforward.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  He took the words right out 

of your mouth. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. LAMKEN:  Thank you, Justice Breyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But you would -- would you 

agree with my assumptions there? 

MR. LAMKEN:  Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That what this case is 

about -- and it's a fortiori from the ordinary contract 

case -- is that sometimes an agency, because of 

particular economic circumstances, concludes that a 

particular rate-setting system is a just and reasonable 

system, and once that's in place, then as part of that 

system is the rule you can only challenge it when it 

violates the public interest, for example. 

Now, you can go and attack the whole 

business on the ground the whole business is an abuse of 

discretion or it departs from the statute.  But if the 

whole business is okay, that's the end of it. 

MR. LAMKEN:  Right.  I --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, have I just said the 

correct law in your view or not? 

MR. LAMKEN:  We would not -- that, Justice 

Breyer, in fact would be our back-up position.

JUSTICE BREYER:  But I'm not interested in 

if you have a back-up or not.  I'm interested in, is it 

correct or not? 

MR. LAMKEN:  Yes, we would agree with it, 

that that is a correct statement of law.  But our 

primary position and the primary error in the court 

below was it said even when you have a contract rate, 

nonparty -- there is an exemption based on the identity

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you just said to 

Justice Scalia that the court below didn't find that 

this was a contract rate. 

MR. LAMKEN:  That's right.  It merely 

assumed it.  And this Court --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It assumed it, so you're 

asking us to assume the same thing and announce --

MR. LAMKEN:  Well --

that if these are contract rates, they're bound by 

Mobile-Sierra; and if they're not, what are we supposed

General could deport an alien to a foreign country

a country; we're not going to even address whether this

under this whole program that would succeed under the

interest standard, or vice versa? 

MR. LAMKEN:  Are you asking me can I 

conceive of such a rate that would fail and succeed 

under one? 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes. 

MR. LAMKEN:  I think that -- one of the – 

one of the  interesting things about the just and 

reasonable standard, the ordinary just and reasonable 

standard, is you can actually look at the interests of 

the contracting parties to a degree that you cannot 

under the public interest standard.  The point of the 

public interest standard is it has to adversely affect 

the interests of the public.  The whole point --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I'm not sure that answers 

my question.  Could there be -- could there be a rate 

that would violate one standard and not the other? 

MR. LAMKEN:  Well, they are both the just 

and reasonable standard.  And the one could violate one 

application --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER 

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FERC, 

IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. MILLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The court of appeals erred in holding that 

the Mobile-Sierra public interest standard is 

inapplicable when contract rates are challenged by a 

noncontracting third party.  That error provides a 

sufficient basis for reversing the judgment below, and 

although there are other issues in the case, those 

issues were not addressed by the court of appeals, and 

this Court should remand and allow them to be resolved 

by the court of appeals rather than addressing them 

itself in the first instance. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Were the -- are the 

Respondents correct and was the court of appeals correct 

in calling this a presumption?

that was agreed upon a presumption of a reasonable rate? 

MR. MILLER:  Well, the -- the Court in 

Morgan Stanley held that Mobile-Sierra rests in part on 

the idea that when wholesale businesses negotiate a 

contract for the sale of power, that that can be 

presumed to be just and reasonable. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you don't quarrel with 

that word --

MR. MILLER:  No.  We quarrel --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- or would you quarrel 

with that characterization? 

MR. MILLER:  That's the way that this 

Court has described the standard.  Now, of course, in 

this case the Commission looked at the mechanism 

created, the forward capacity auction, and it looked at 

the transition rates, and it didn't simply presume them 

to be just and reasonable.  It -- based on its 

examination of them -- determined that the rates set out 

in the settlement and the rates that would be 

established under the mechanism created by the 

settlement would be just and reasonable. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just and reasonable, or 

would comply with the public interest standard?

having Mobile-Sierra if -- if they're going to reexamine 

the thing under the usual standard anyway? 

MR. MILLER:  Well, the settlement -- no one 

is suggesting that the settlement agreement itself is a 

Mobile-Sierra contract.  The settlement was a resolution 

of a disputed proceeding before the Commission.  It's 

sort of analogous to a consent decree.  The Commission 

had to approve that before it became effective.  By its 

own terms, the settlement agreement wouldn't become 

effective as binding between the parties unless the 

Commission approved it. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your -- your opening 

statement about what this Court should do is a change 

from your statement of what we should do in your briefs. 

In your -- you just said the Court should

brief, you say the judgment of the court of appeals 

should be reversed insofar as it granted the petitions 

for review.  You've changed your position on what we

To the extent that you think that there are other issues 

that are presented other than the question presented as

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's a change. 

Before you didn't think there were other issues that 

affected the determination or might.  You said we should 

grant -- reverse the determination insofar as it granted 

the petitions for review. 

If we say that the petitions for review 

should have been denied, then we don't send it back. 

MR. MILLER:  Should have been granted. 

Right.  Yes.  Right.  That's right. 

It -- I mean, our view is that the 

appropriate disposition is a remand to the court of 

appeals to allow it to decide whether these other issues 

are properly before it, and the answer to that may be –-

be no, but the court of appeals should have an 

opportunity to consider that in the first instance. 

The reason that, in our view, the court of 

appeals was wrong in holding that there's a third-party 

exception to Mobile-Sierra is that, as I said a moment 

ago, the Court in Morgan Stanley recognized that 

Mobile-Sierra rests on a presumption that the rates 

negotiated between sophisticated wholesale businesses 

can be presumed to be just and reasonable.  That's a 

feature of the rate.  There is no reason why the same 

rate for the same power could be just and reasonable 

when it's challenged by one person, but not when it's

Second, the purpose of the public interest 

test under Mobile-Sierra is to allow contract 

modification only when it's necessary to protect third 

parties; that is, members of the public.  So it doesn't 

make sense to say that that test is inapplicable 

whenever you have a challenge that's presented by one of 

those third parties or a member of the public. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is there -- what would 

happen in a situation in which there's a tariff price 

instead of a contract price?  In those situations, the 

buyer could come in, presumably, and say:  It's not a 

fair and just price vis-à-vis me; I didn't agree to it; 

it's not. 

In a normal situation with a contract price, 

third parties, many not -- not the main -- main 

parties, like the Maine Public Utilities Commission, 

could come in and say what?  It's not fair to the public 

in general? 

MR. MILLER:  In the contract setting? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes. 

MR. MILLER:  Yes, third parties could come 

in, and if they -- they would have to satisfy the public 

interest test.  They would have to show that there are

circumstances, severe impact on the public interest. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could they come in and 

show that between the contracting parties the price is 

unfair?  Is that what this is about, that they would try 

to come in and somehow define the public interest as 

being informed by the unfairness to the individual 

parties? 

MR. MILLER:  I think that sort of argument 

would be foreclosed by Sierra. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but that's the 

question before us. 

MR. MILLER:  Well, you have --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The D.C. Circuit said 

they shouldn't be bound by that determination, and 

you're arguing that they should be because --

MR. MILLER:  What -- what the Court said in 

Sierra is that mere unfairness, one of the -- the fact 

that one of the contracting parties got a bad bargain is 

not a reason to set aside the contract, except for the 

Court did reserve the extraordinary circumstance where 

it's going to put the supplier out of business, which 

would adversely affect the public interest if they can 

no longer deliver power at that rate.

original question with your adversary, which is:  Is 

there a difference among the objectors here, between 

those who are objecting to the terms between the two 

contracting parties as outsiders, as members of the 

public, and those who are objecting because this 

settlement agreement does something different?  It binds 

them personally to a buying price, and so why shouldn't 

there be a different approach to those individuals? 

MR. MILLER:  I think there are two responses 

to that, Your Honor.  The first is that the reasoning of 

the court of appeals draws no distinction between those 

two --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I agree. 

MR. MILLER:  Okay. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so the 

question is:  Should there be a distinction? 

MR. MILLER:  Yes.  And I think certainly the 

Commission appreciates the idea that there's something 

wrong about -- or there's something unfair about A and B 

getting together and deciding on the rate that C is 

going to pay.  And to the extent that you're concerned 

about that situation, the answer to that is that when A 

and B set the rate that C has to pay, C is not paying a 

contract rate in the Mobile-Sierra sense, because C is 

not -- C is paying a rate it has not agreed to.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that's what the 

Third Circuit -- I'm sorry, that's what the court below 

didn't --

MR. MILLER:  The court did not use that mode 

of analysis.  The court below said that we were talking 

about contract rates and their being challenged by 

nonparties to the contract, and the court thought that 

in that context the Mobile-Sierra public interest 

standard doesn't apply, and that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're saying, in effect, 

that Mobile-Sierra does not apply to an agreement 

between A and B that not only sets the rate between the 

two, but also fixes the rate that one of them will 

charge to C? 

The last feature is not a Mobile-Sierra --

is not eligible for Mobile-Sierra treatment. 

MR. MILLER:  That's right, because C's rate 

in that scenario is not a rate that it has agreed to. 

It's being set unilaterally by people other than it, and 

so it's in our view more appropriately characterized as 

a tariff rate that is not subject to the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  But that's -- but

at all. 

MR. MILLER:  That's right.  And the 

D.C. Circuit made that quite clear, particularly on page 

20a of the petition appendix in its opinion, where it 

described the question before it, yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But it is your view, is it 

not, that the rates that result from the auction are not 

contract rates within the meaning of Mobile-Sierra? 

MR. MILLER:  That -- that is our view, that 

that's -- it's not the basis for the court of appeals’ 

decision. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The court of appeals 

never got to what FERC thinks is the heart of the case, 

whether this is a contract rate, whether -- you say it 

is not -- and whether FERC has the authority nonetheless 

to apply the public interest standard.  But none of 

those have been addressed by the D.C. Circuit. 

MR. MILLER:  That's -- that’s exactly right, 

Your Honor.  The court didn't reach --

MR. MILLER:  No, we think the Court should 

answer only the question that was ruled upon below and 

leave those other issues to the extent that they have 

been properly --

JUSTICE BREYER:  How can we?  I mean, that's 

a -- why not answer a case -- a question about 

employment discrimination law?  Where -- where in this 

FERC thing does this say that these are contracts of a 

kind that Mobile-Sierra was about?  I mean, I don't even 

know if Mobile-Sierra -- whether you could -- a third 

party could attack such a contract under public – under 

a just and reasonable standard, unless I knew first what 

the Commission thought about it in this context, because 

then the Commission's question would be:  Is that a 

reasonable view?  So what am I supposed to do here? 

MR. MILLER:  Well, I think we agree with 

Petitioners that it is quite common for this Court to 

decide a case, taking the case on the same assumption 

that the court of appeals did, and answer the questions 

that are raised --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You don't get to

MR. MILLER:  Right.  Right. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What's the assumption?  The 

assumption is the court of appeals thinks that the 

contract between -- among the generating -- the 

generators, that that is a Mobile-Sierra contract.  So 

we're supposed to say, if that were a Mobile-Sierra 

contract, which it isn't, then we should decide whether 

a third party could attack it, about which the 

Commission has said nothing.  Is that right?

depends upon the other.  The validity depends upon the

the ordinary just and reasonable standard.  It doesn't 

depend on the clearing prices of the auctions, which 

are the -- I mean, what the --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's all true, but I 

would want to know what the Commission thought about 

that one, too. 

MR. MILLER:  What -- what the Commission 

thought is that the -- the Commission looked at the 

auction mechanism and determined that it was likely to 

produce just and reasonable results.  And the Commission 

emphasized that at any point anybody can come in and 

challenge the auction rules and say that they're not 

just and reasonable, and the Commission will review that 

entirely unencumbered by this provision of the 

settlement.  And, in addition, within 45 days after each 

auction, anybody can come in and challenge those 

results.  And only after that 45-day period does the 

public interest review clause become effective. 

The -- the last point I would like to make 

about the court of appeals' analysis is that this Court 

made clear in Morgan Stanley that Mobile-Sierra applies 

to the Commission when it is acting sua sponte, and 

there is no reason why FERC's power should depend on 

whether somebody has filed a complaint.  If FERC is 

bound, public interest standard, under Mobile-Sierra

when there is a Mobile-Sierra contract, it makes very 

little sense to say that it ceases to be bound by that 

as long as anybody in the world other than the 

contracting party comes in and files the complaint to 

initiate the FERC investigation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, we -- we don't know 

that that's the other side's position.  I was going to 

ask him that.  Their position is that the third party 

can -- can attack the -- the agreement without being 

encumbered by Mobile-Sierra, but I don't know that 

they've said that once a third party does mount such an 

attack the Commission is suddenly also unencumbered by 

Mobile-Sierra. 

MR. MILLER:  Well, the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I have assumed that their 

position is the Commission remains bound by Mobile-

Sierra, but these third parties can -- can demand a 

court -- that a court apply a different standard. 

MR. MILLER:  I had not understood that to be 

their position, but I think it would be very strange --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  We can --

the contract, but they will be binding on NSTAR, which 

sells 25 percent of the power in the New England market; 

they will be binding on the other five Respondents, 

including Maine and Massachusetts as well as 

Connecticut. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, they can 

self-supply, can't they? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Even if they had that 

option, Justice Sotomayor, it would not change a tariff 

into a contract.  Just because there is the option of 

self-supply doesn't mean that parties who are disputing 

the contract, disagreeing with it, not to mention not 

contracting, should be bound to it as though it were a 

contract.  The option of --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  They're not bound to it. 

They -- they are saying that -- claiming -- that their 

rates are too high because the contract was too high, so 

-- and therefore, their rates are unreasonable.  And 

what Mobile-Sierra says -- it certainly says it as 

between the two contracting parties -- that if it's at 

arm-length between sophisticated seller and buyer 

of -- of the power, they are bound by it, and

exorbitant, the rates are too high, whether that person 

is likewise bound by Mobile-Sierra.  Isn't that right? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Justice Scalia, with all 

due respect, that situation is not here. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's what the court 

of appeals decided.  Their simple question was 

Mobile-Sierra binds the contracting parties, and it 

doesn't -- the rate doesn't stick for anybody else. 

That's all they decided. 

And the question that you're asking 

certainly is looming over this whole case, but it isn't 

presented to us because it wasn't even dealt with in any 

way, shape, or manner by the D.C. Circuit. 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Absolutely correct, Justice 

Ginsburg.  The D.C. Circuit's reasoning here was based 

on facts that were, in fact, not present here.  We 

agreed then, we argued to the FERC, we argued to the 

court of appeals, we argued in opposition to certiorari, 

that what's involved here are tariff rates. 

And the D.C. Circuit's ruling in our view 

was correct, and its reasoning was correct insofar as 

Mobile-Sierra binds contracting parties, as Justice 

Scalia has just articulated and Morgan Stanley 

reiterated.  It involves parties trying to escape an 

improvident bargain.

What we have here is an auction system that 

sets rules of general applicability. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I thought one large 

difference -- I thought Justice Scalia suggested that 

the rate negotiated by -- in that bilateral agreement, 

that that rate would not be subject to just and 

reasonable attack by anyone, that the public interest 

standard attaches to that rate and FERC can't abrogate 

it.  It's a rate that's set, it's binding on FERC, and 

FERC presumably, because it has no authority to abrogate 

it, could not entertain any complaint that would ask to 

have it abrogated. 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Section 4.C of the 

settlement agreement that FERC approved under the just 

and reasonable standard says to the world:  We can make 

an exception for ourselves under the just and 

reasonable -- under the Memphis rule.  We can make an 

exception to the public interest standard.  The 

government says it can make an exception for itself. 

The only ones powerless to invoke --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I didn't -- I didn’t 

follow.  I didn't think there was -- was there a Memphis 

clause in this settlement? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  There is.  There is in 

section 4.C in effect a modified Memphis clause which

says that the parties can come together and agree to a 

different standard, Justice Ginsburg. 

So, in a sense, the irony here, if the Court 

were to reverse and apply Morgan Stanley -- I'm sorry, 

Mobile-Sierra and Morgan Stanley -- would be that the 

only ones powerless to invoke the just and reasonable 

standard to review the auction rates would be the 

Respondents --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  -- who never agreed to this 

supposed contract. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why are you powerless? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  I’m sorry. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why don't you to go to the 

Commission and say:  Commission, there is always special 

circumstances. You may think that in this kind of 

situation, which is a special situation, that the public 

interest standard, whether it's in a contract or whether 

it's in a tariff or wherever you want to put it, is the 

right standard for review.  You may think that.  But you 

don't think it for yourselves, you don't think it for 

somebody else, and here's some reasons why you don't

Why aren't you exactly as powerful or powerless as 

anybody else? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Justice Breyer, there is an 

immense difference, as you and the Court is well aware 

because it has been articulated in opinions, between the 

public interest standard and the ordinary just and 

reasonable standard, and the government would like that 

discretion to say in effect --

JUSTICE BREYER:  My point is if you don't 

like that as applied to your situation, you have a 

remedy.  That's what the public -- that's why they're 

there, agencies.  They are there to listen to you and 

give you a remedy, and the remedy is, if you convince 

them you shouldn't be subject to that, they'll say fine;

nothing about natural gas and asking us to do it?

is contrary to the statute, the just and reasonable 

standard. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Then you're going to say 

you mean they never can do it, but it's well settled. 

It's well settled that they sometimes can say -- I mean, 

my point is this:  I just found the quote I was looking 

for.  So I was thinking natural gas.  It applies to 

electricity capacity, too.  Justice Jackson:  "The 

wealth of Midas and the wit of man cannot produce or 

reproduce a natural gas field." 

That applies to electricity capacity.  We 

can't reproduce it.  You can't.  The Commission devises 

a system for trying to get it done, and if they do it 

reasonably, they win. 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  But the -- the Commission 

should not be accorded discretion to adopt a standard 

that contravenes the statute.  We're dealing here --

JUSTICE BREYER:  The standard -- the statute 

is "just and reasonable."  That calls up a whole 

mechanism from the 1930s.  I thought that it is long --

we're long past that point, that -- that whatever 

Brandeis thought it was, which they did in the thirties 

and forties, that it has also been interpreted to 

include the power to the Commission to deviate from

under certain circumstances to be just and reasonable, 

even though you don't use cost-of-service ratemaking. 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  What we're dealing with in 

this case is the question of whether the government and 

the Commission should have virtually unbridled 

discretion to adopt a standard that has been called 

"practically insurmountable," as recently as Morgan 

Stanley.  It was --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that -- that's because 

of section 4.C, you say? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Section 4.C of the 

agreement --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  Which -- which 

gives the Commission a good deal of flexibility, which 

you say you -- your clients don't have or your State 

doesn't have.  But that isn't the basis on which this 

case was decided below.  It was decided on the very 

simple basis that the Mobile-Sierra doctrine simply does 

not apply to challenges by third parties.  It had 

nothing to do with the details of 4.C and the -- the 

excessive discretion given -- given to the Commission 

but not to you. 

It was a very simple proposition on which we 

granted cert, whether Mobile-Sierra's public interest 

standard applies when a contract rate is challenged by

an entity that was not a party to the contract.  That's 

the question.  And what's your answer to that? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Our answer is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you support the opinion 

of the -- of the court below? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  We do support it, Justice 

Scalia, and the reason we do is that Mobile-Sierra is 

about contracts.  And --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It isn't about contracts. 

It's about reasonable rates.  I thought what it was, was 

a determination by the Commission, approved by -- by 

this Court, that when two giants of the industry, very 

knowledgeable, deal at arm's-length and come up with --

with a contract, that is presumptively reasonable, and 

unless it contravenes the public interest, that rate 

will -- will be upheld. 

Now, you say it should be upheld only 

between the two contracting parties.  What good does 

that do? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  It -- it can be held --

upheld only between the two contracting parties if 

they're the ones who have agreed to it.  Under 

Mobile-Sierra, there is a presumption of free 

negotiation and consent. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the rationale is the

commonsense notion that it's a presumptively reasonable 

rate, and if that's true, how is that altered by the 

identity of the party that attacks it? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Because, Your Honor, the 

question also is what the standard should be if it's 

presumptively reasonable; and it is taken as such, 

because it is freely negotiated, because there is 

consent to it.  Because one of them is seeking to escape 

it, and use the Commission to escape it, then 

Mobile-Sierra says it should be presumed just and 

reasonable, and only when the public interest is 

seriously harmed --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, why is -- why is it 

not presumptively a commonsense notion when some 

different party attacks it?  It -- it's still a 

determination that this rate, as a commonsense matter, 

is presumptively reasonable. 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  As to this case, again, 

there are no rates yet.  We're talking about an auction 

mechanism that will not even involve a contract, and the 

government says so as well, that -- we and the 

government agree that it will not involve a contract. 

So how can --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.  That's different

market forces of another kind -- of another kind. 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Well, you know, I feel, 

with all due respect, that we are talking in alternate 

universes here, the government and the Petitioners and 

we; and the reason is, as the Court has quite aptly 

identified, the court of appeals used a rationale that 

simply is not wholly fitting to the facts here. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why shouldn’t we tell 

them that, and then they can pick it up from there? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Well --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because what they did say 

could be -- have heavy consequences.  We know that that 

has already happened.  FERC has revised a number of 

contracts to conform to the D.C. Circuit's idea that 

it's the parties to the -- to the contract, not the rate 

that's sheltered by Mobile-Sierra.  That's a very 

consequential decision, and so we would tell the D.C. 

Circuit, if we agreed with FERC and the Petitioners on 

that:  D.C. Circuit, you've got that wrong. 

Now, there may be other matters, other 

issues like the ones that you would like us to decide as 

a matter of first view, but as Justice Scalia has 

pointed out more than once, we have a question.  It is 

the very question that the D.C. Circuit decided.  Why 

should we go beyond that?

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Because addressing that 

question, Justice Ginsburg, as Justice Breyer said, is 

not the question that the Commission addressed.  It 

isn't the question in terms of the factual situation 

here that is really at issue.  We're dealing here with 

tariff rates that are set through the auction mechanism. 

If the Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but we don't like to 

decide these questions, you know, initially.  We -- we 

like to have some lower court do the dirty work, and we 

can correct them. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It’s -- it's a lot easier 

that way, and we're more likely to reach a correct 

result, rather than -- than wading in with, you know, 

-- from scratch.  That's our usual practice. 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  And the government's 

position on certiorari was that there should be a remand 

without reversal for reconsideration in light of Morgan 

Stanley. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You're in a very 

tough position because of the way this has progressed. 

I think you can make a strong argument that you 

shouldn't be bound by these contract rates if FERC 

doesn't have a lot of discretion to let you go.  If FERC

has a lot of discretion to let you go, your argument 

that you shouldn't be bound is a lot weaker.  And the 

way the case has been presented, we're pushing on only 

one -- one side of that. 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  And I recognize that fact, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that the Court is presented with a 

dilemma here because it's dealing with tariff rates when 

the question presented talks about contract rates. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So is the answer then 

maybe where Justice Ginsburg and Justice Scalia were 

going, that -- because where I’m coming from, why I have 

been asking this, is I actually think the answer to the 

question so far on the question presented is 

"sometimes."  Sometimes you can't; sometimes you can. 

And it depends on a lot of things -- situations, 

circumstances, arguments to commissions, what they held, 

et cetera. 

So maybe that's the thing to do, you answer 

the question, say "sometimes."  Sometimes they can use 

one; sometimes it's the other.  Indeed, in this very 

case, they've argued that it's -- that it's not even 

within the mainstream of Mobile-Sierra.  And maybe 

that's so, maybe it's not.  Send it back, say it depends 

on circumstances, time, et cetera.  And then they can 

argue all these things out that we've just been hearing.

What about that? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  And, Justice Breyer, the 

"sometimes" is absolutely right from our standpoint. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but if we 

ruled that --

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  There may be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If we decided it on 

that basis, we would be giving FERC a victory on the 

question of its authority to depart from Mobile-Sierra, 

even though that wasn't presented in this case. 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  No.  In our view, Mr. Chief 

Justice, noncontracting parties under Mobile-Sierra 

cannot be bound --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, I know --

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  -- by tariff rates. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- but Justice 

Breyer was hypothesizing that sometimes they can be, and 

sometimes they can't be.  And you accepted his 

proposition. 

And what I'm saying is that's a very 

significant question.  FERC wants to argue it here, but 

it's not before us. 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  The “sometimes” -- if I 

could complete the answer, Mr. Chief Justice, is that 

the “sometimes” would include contract rates.  In other

words, where there are strictly contract rates –-

whereas, here, we have tariff rates -- FERC would not 

have that discretion.  It cannot have discretion to 

apply the public interest standard to tariff rates any 

more than it could apply the ordinary just and 

reasonable standard to contract rates which --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Has anybody before --

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  -- Mobile-Sierra fits. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- even suggested that 

Mobile-Sierra is a “sometimes” thing?  Do -- did 

any of our opinions say that it's a “sometimes” thing, 

except in one respect, and that is the doctrine does not 

apply when -- when, downstream, the rates -- or even 

between the parties, the rates would violate the public 

interest? 

That's a “sometimes.”  It won't apply then, 

but have we ever suggested that, you know, today it 

may; tomorrow it -- it won't?  Or have we ever suggested 

what standards might determine the “sometimes” question? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Mobile- --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Have we ever suggested how 

you can -- you can have a “sometimes” doctrine which 

will produce the stability in the industry that Mobile-

Sierra was intended to produce?

Mobile-Sierra.  People had to be able to predict whether 

they can take natural gas out of the ground, how much 

they can make on it, and once they enter into an 

arm's-length contract, they should be able to rely on 

it. 

That was the whole purpose.  And, now, you 

want to us say, well, sometimes it will work, and 

sometimes it won't.  And we're not going to say when; 

we're going to leave it to the D.C. Circuit to invent 

some “sometimes.” 

That doesn't make any sense, does it? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Again, I may have been 

unclear, and I apologize if I was, in response to 

Justice Breyer and the Chief Justice's question, but the 

point is that the “sometimes” would not apply to the 

situation that we have here, where there are rates of 

general applicability and tariffs. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I -- can I go –-

stop you there, just so that we're all on the same page? 

If this were, hypothetically, a contract rate -- some of 

the transition fees appear to be.  The parties to that 

agreement are saying, we're going to pay, in transition 

fees, X amount.

doctrine applies to those contract rates and binds third 

parties who are challenging that particular rate between

not challenging that a contract should bind those two 

parties or those hundred-plus parties that agree to the 

contract.

can't because that's the doctrine.  Okay. 

Under what circumstances could a third party

opposed to being contrary to the public interest? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Well, the public interest 

standard, as articulated in Morgan Stanley, would 

require showing an extraordinarily high burden of proof.

not fair and reasonable? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  If that party were directly 

affected --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What does the word 

"directly affected" mean to you? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  It would mean having to pay 

rates that flow inevitably --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  Now, you're trying 

to confuse the issue.  Yes, that's the auction question 

and whether that auction is a contract price subject to 

the Mobile-Sierra doctrine at all.  That's a different 

issue. 

I've given you the simple hypothetical. 

Could all of those other respondents -- except NSTAR --

come in and say that it's not fair and reasonable 

to me because, at the end, I'm going to pay more; I'm 

going to do something -- it's going to affect me in some 

indirect way. 

Are you taking the position that there's 

something else that FERC must do when those third 

parties come into -- into that simple situation?

back to the facts, and I'm dealing with a 

hypothetical. 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  And the hypothetical, I 

would say, is answerable that the just and reasonable 

standard, as it was applied in Bridgeport Energy and 

Milford Power and tens of other cases --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you are taking the 

extreme -- you are accepting that -- what the lower 

court said?  Under every circumstance, if it involves a 

contract price, fair and reasonable being something 

other than contrary to the public interest? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Fair and reasonable is a 

standard different from the public interest standard. 

That's a matter of law. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So your adversary's 

arguments that what you're really saying is you can 

never have finality to a contract agreement between 

parties because any third party can come in and raise --

stand in the shoes of the contracting parties and argue 

the rate's not fair and reasonable? 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But FERC can’t -- can FERC

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Mobile-Sierra applies --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Who does it apply to?  I 

mean, it's just -- just the two parties? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Mobile-Sierra effectively 

says those two parties are bound by the contract, and 

FERC is bound by it -- that's Morgan Stanley –- no 

matter when the issue is raised. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay. 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  And a noncontracting party, 

if it is a rate that applies generally, can challenge 

it. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can a noncontracting party 

go to FERC and challenge it before FERC, whereupon FERC 

is no longer bound by Mobile-Sierra?  Or is FERC 

suddenly unchained when a third party brings a 

proceeding before FERC?  It's a strange situation. 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  FERC is bound by the just

may apply that just and reasonable standard. 

Now, the public interest standard looks for 

serious harm to the public. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, no.  The public 

interest standard is a just and reasonable standard. 

What -- what it amounts to is saying, when -- when you 

have a contract rate that's been negotiated between 

sophisticated parties, that rate is presumptively just 

and reasonable, and the only way you can show that it is 

not just and reasonable is to show that the public 

interest is harmed. 

It's -- it's not something different from 

the just and reasonable standard, or it would be 

contrary to -- to the statute because the statute 

requires that the rates be just and reasonable, right? 

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  It -- it is part –- they 

are one standard, as Morgan Stanley very clearly says, 

and the question of what noncontracting parties can 

challenge a statute depends on who the noncontracting 

party is, the nature of the contract, what interest is 

affected, and I would presume some of those factors 

might affect FERC's judgment.

MR. BLUMENTHAL:  The answer to that question 

is no. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  Okay.  Thank you. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And so, as long as that's 

so, I guess you could mount a challenge on the ground 

that to apply the contract regime system to circumstance 

X, Y, and Z, without permitting your challenge that you 

want, is, in fact, a violation of the APA, at the least. 

Okay? 

Now, that's why I say "sometimes."  Could 

you imagine such a situation, which I think is what 

Justice Sotomayor was getting at, or do you want it all 

the time?  If you want it all the time, I'm not --

you're not getting sympathy from me.  If want to say 

there could be such a time, maybe.  I think I could 

think of five.  All right?

Mobile-Sierra has to do with the two contracting 

parties.  It doesn't, as the counterargument goes, 

shelter the rate from any attack by anyone, including 

FERC.  It's put in terms of FERC cannot abrogate that 

rate.  But your -- you are defending the position that

actual purchaser under the agreements here. 

And I think that is actually part of the nub 

of what was bothering the D.C. Circuit.  The D.C. 

Circuit may have been bothered that there might be 

actual purchasers here, people who directly themselves 

purchase under the rate who haven't agreed to it.  But 

that concern is wholly subsumed within the notion of 

whether or not the rate that entity is paying is a 

contract rate.  But which rates here are contract rates 

or not contract rates is an issue the D.C. Circuit 

didn't actually get to.  It's not clear it was properly 

preserved before the D.C. Circuit, because the claim 

that some of the rates are not contract rates was 

raised only by intervenors. 

So while we adhere to our view that these 

are contract rates, this Court need not get to it.  It 

need only address the issue the court addressed below, 

which is whether there is a broad-based, third-party 

exception to Mobile-Sierra.

be energy law’s equivalent of the Maginot Line, that it 

protects against direct assaults from the contracting
