 The first is that the United States has not

17  title to Indian trust lands.  And the second is that 
18  Patchak, the plaintiff, lacks prudential standing

 MR. MILLER:  There are -- there are two parts 

reality of the allegation.  Who would -- who would be 

into trust.  And that's why the regulations set out a 
30-day period after the announcement of the intent to 
take the land into trust before title is actually 
transferred.  So somebody would have to file during that 
period, as the MichGO plaintiffs did --

1  challenge what the Secretary has allegedly done here, 
2  which is to take lands into trust in violation of the 
3  statute per our earlier -- I know that the U.S. is 
4  challenging that assumption, but let's assume the -- the 
5
6  able to challenge it, and in what mechanism? 
7
8  to that.  And taking the timing question first, the 
9  claim would have to be brought before the land was taken

19  other claims under NEPA or the IGRA -- but under section 
5 of the IRA, the proper plaintiff would be a State or 
20
21  local government, because those are the entities that 
22  are directly affected, directly regulated by the 
23  transfer of jurisdiction to the tribe --
24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's assume a situation 
where you first promise the land to one tribe, and then,

That's why I said timely filed.

2  The United States says, I change my mind; I'm going to 
3  give the land to the other tribe.  Does the tribe that 
4  you have denied the land to have any standing or any 
rights with respect to challenging that determination? 
5
6
 MR. MILLER:  Yes.  As the beneficiaries of 
7  section 5, the parties for whose benefit Congress acted 
8  and the Secretary would be acting, I think in that 
9  scenario a tribe would have standing to challenge it.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Miller, you -- you claim 
10
11  on behalf of the government that the decision of whether 
12  to take the land into trust has nothing to do with the 
13  use to which the land will be put; wherefore, these 
14  plaintiffs who were complaining about the use to which 
15
16

18  pending a lawsuit which would have prevented the use 
19  that the government intended the newly trusted land to

 You delayed for 3 years because there was a 
22  challenge to whether you could use -- whether this land 
23  could be used for what you call gaming and I call

Secretary's policy, as set out in --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, wait.  On what basis? 

 MR. MILLER:  Well, the -- the challenge in 

MichGO organization, alleged that the Secretary had not 
complied with NEPA, had not adequately considered the 
environmental consequences of the action to take the 
land into trust. 

1  irrelevant? 
2
3  that case was -- was not just to the use.  It was to the 
4  decision to take title to land into trust.  And the 
5
6
7  On any basis other than --
 MR. MILLER:  There was a NEPA claim, for 
8
9  example.  And the -- the plaintiff in that case, the 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
action consequences are there from the mere decision to 
15
16  take it into trust?  Unless you know what it's going to 
17  be used for, you have no idea what the environmental 
18  consequences are. 
 MR. MILLER:  Well, that's -- that is true. 
19
And it is also true that NEPA may in some circumstances 
20
21  require consideration of the use for which the land is 
22  to be put; but, it doesn't follow that section 5 
23  requires or contemplates protecting the interests of 
24  nearby landowners from the use.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Based in part on the use to 

which it was going to be put; right? 

 MR. MILLER:  Right, but what -- what MichGO 

 MR. MILLER:  That -- I mean, that was -- the 

of the 30-day regulation is to allow people who want to 

1  to -- was to the transfer, you say.

7  was seeking, what the plaintiff was seeking in that 
8  case, was an injunction barring the transfer. 
9
10
11  challenge the transfer to have a full opportunity to 
12  litigate those claims.  And that is why the --
13
14  of Mr. Patchak?  Suppose he had filed in the 30-day 
window. The Secretary gives notice to affected persons. 
15
16  So he comes in and he says:  I think that you don't have 
17  authority to do it because this tribe wasn't under 
18  Federal jurisdiction, and so I want you to call -- call 
19  it off.  Nothing -- nothing has been transferred within 
20
21
 I thought both your brief and the tribe's 
22  brief said that the judicial review would be available 
23  to any affected person who used that procedure.  Is 
24  that -- is that true?
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that wouldn't be true 

30 days. 

 MR. MILLER:  I mean, if they could establish

 Now, in this case, he filed outside the 

30-day period.  He was aware that --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you said -- you had it 

enforce against the Secretary the limitations that 
Congress put on the Secretary.  So would there be 
standing in that situation? 

 Mr. Patchak comes in within the 30-day 

1  standing, but -- if he had filed within the 30-day 
2  period, the Secretary would not take title to the land 
3  until there was a full opportunity for judicial review. 
4

6
7  was important if.  So the argument is this tribe wasn't 
8  under Federal jurisdiction.  I could raise that because 
9  I'm an affected person.  Somebody's got to be able to

15
16  Patchak as a private individual, but there would be 
17  standing for a State or local government or, in 
18  the unusual situation that Justice Sotomayor suggested, 
19  for another tribe --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So then you disagree with 
the tribe that said in no uncertain terms, in its reply 
brief, that this case is not about the availability of 
judicial review.  Judicial review was available in the 
30-day window.

 MR. MILLER:  There would not be standing for

is going to be made of it. 

 The government doesn't acquire this land with 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, on the standing point, 

1  with that in the context of the discussion of the 
2  sovereign immunity issue.  I don't understand that 
3  statement in the tribe's brief to have been a concession 
4  that there would have been standing.
5
6  I mean, the -- the distinction that you're setting up 
7  between acquisition of land and use of land -- this goes 
8  back to Justice Scalia's question -- that strikes 
9  me as -- as artificial, that the question of when land 
10

14  going to be used.  So that in the end, this really is a 
15
16
17  in -- in this sense, in the sense that -- and you're 
18  right that the regulations do refer to the purposes for 
19  which the land is to be used, but that's because --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And the statute as well 
20

promote economic development, which is dependent on some 
understanding of how the land is actually going to be 
used by the tribes.

 MR. MILLER:  Well, it is a land use statute 

 MR. MILLER:  That -- that is exactly right.

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why not?  Of course, it 

be arguably within the interest.  That -- that adverb is 
left out in much of the discussion. 

1  And that's why, in determining whether -- the Secretary 
2  has to take account of use in order to determine whether 
3  it will, in fact, serve the interest of promoting tribal 
4  economic development and self-governance, but it doesn't 
follow that the effect of that use on bystanders, on 
5
6  other property owners in the vicinity, is within the 
7  interests that Congress had in mind --
8
9  doesn't have to be within the interest, it just has to

13  the elements to be considered in taking title, why isn't 
14  somebody who is affected by the proposed use within the

17  the facts of this case as an example, you know, 
18  Patchak's objection is not to the jurisdictional 
19  transfer.  It's not to the fact that this is now going

use generally.  At what point was it acknowledged by all

 MR. MILLER:  The regulations do not address 

1  that this would be for gaming?  At the very outset? 
2
 MR. MILLER:  I believe that in applying to 
3  have the land taken into trust, the tribe said what --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  At the very outset.
4
 MR. MILLER:  -- it wanted to happen. 
5
6
 JUSTICE ALITO:  What would happen if someone 
7  filed a challenge within the 30-day period and then the 
8  government took title to the land while the litigation 
9  was pending?  Do the regulations preclude that from 
happening while the litigation continues, or is it 
10
11 
necessary for the -- the challenger to obtain a stay 
12 
from a court? 
13
14  that.  The BIA manual provides that that action, of 
15
16  the litigation is pending. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, is that enforceable? 
17
 MR. MILLER:  I -- I think that it would not 
18
19  be, but I think that -- I guess I would say two things 
20
21  these regulations, the 30-day notice rule, precisely for 
22  the purpose of ensuring that there would be an adequate 
23  opportunity for judicial review, and thus removing the 
24  constitutional doubt that the Eighth Circuit had found 
25

taking the land into trust, should not be taken while 

about that.  The first is that the Secretary enacted 

associated with the IRA. 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And I think -- so there is every reason to 

1
2  think that the Secretary is going to conscientiously 
3  carry out what those regulations provide for, which is 
4  allowing judicial review.  And if the Secretary were 
ever to do that, I think he would find that going 
5
6  forward in every case, courts would enter a stay. 
7
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, they didn't 
8  here.  I mean, when Patchak filed his suit, title had 
9  not yet passed to the Secretary.  And he sought a stay.
10
11  denied, and he could have sought relief from the court 
12  of appeals, and he didn't. 
13
14  that point, you thought nothing prevented the Secretary 
from moving forward, and in fact, the Secretary did move 
15
16  forward even though he'd already filed the suit. 
17
18
19  isn't it just like your 30 days?

 So why are we considering quiet title?  What 

1  standing for a moment.  I'm just thinking of your quiet 
2  title action. 
3
4  This was a -- I looked at the complaint, as I -- as I 
gather from his questions, so did the Chief Justice. 
5
6  And it is a complaint filed before the -- the property 
7  was taken into trust, and it asks for an injunction 
8  under the APA, if it wants review of that, before the 
9  government has any title to it at all, or at least it 
10
11
12  has that to do with this?  Why isn't it 
13  exactly what -- now, that's the same as the Chief 
14  Justice asked, and I have exactly the same question.
 MR. MILLER:  Right.  Well -- and in that 
15
16  period before the land is taken into trust, the APA, 
17  everyone agrees, permits -- permits that litigation. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Well, why isn't 
18
19  that -- that's the end of that argument, then, isn't it? 
20
21  before the land was taken into trust; the district court 
22  denies the request for the injunction.  The court of 
23  appeals reverses that.  And so there we are.  We're 
24  reviewing that action by the court of appeals, reviewing

Because this suit was brought seeking an injunction

to relinquish the title to the land.  And so that --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I don't know how --

1  sought before the land was taken into trust. 
2
3  question of whether to enjoin the transfer from taking 
4  place is moot.  Because --
5
6  Well --
7
 MR. MILLER:  The relief that's being sought 
8  now -- and this is made clear in Patchak's brief in the 
9  court of appeals -- is an order compelling the Secretary 
10
11
12  how we should treat that.  There -- there was an order. 
13  Suppose that order was wrong.  Suppose they should have 
14  granted the injunction.  Then isn't what we should do, 
send it back because that injunction should have been 
15
16  granted, then have a hearing or trial or whatever you 
17  want to have on whether the Act applies, and then figure 
18  out how you do relief?  Which I don't know. 
19

21  the transfer is completed.

whether to enjoin a not-yet-completed transfer is before

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, then your -- your

2  appealed it different --
3
4
5
6  reliance is on the -- is on the QTA. 
7
 The tribe says, isn't it ironic that if you 
8  really have a claim in the land as a property owner, you 
9  can't sue under the QTA, and this person is much further 
removed.  Well, that's because he has a different ground 
10
11 
for relief.  That's all we're talking about. 
12
 MR. MILLER:  Well, the --
13
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So the fact that the QTA 
14  suddenly, deus ex machina, pops onto the scene doesn't 
mean that it -- that that changes his -- his ground for 
15
16  relief that he's -- that he's relying upon.  His ground 
17  of relief has always been the same, APA. 
 MR. MILLER:  With -- with respect, Your

4  properly before the Court.  But I mean, one thing I 
5
6  often happens that, as the nature of the claims or the 
7  identity of the parties changes throughout the course of

9  wouldn't have been barred before.

11  Act.  Somebody sues an officer of the United States for 
12  a tort, that suit can go forward.  But if the Attorney 
13  General then certifies under the Westfall Act that the 
14  employee was acting within the scope of his or her 
duties, then it gets converted into an action against 
15
16  the United States, which might, if it falls within one 
17  of the FTCA exceptions, be brought --
18
19  that.  The Act provides for that, right?
20
21  example of how, as -- as the parties, or the relief --
22  here, it's the relief -- changes, sovereign immunity can

 When you strip title to land, which is a fact 
7  in this case, you strip sovereignty.  You wreak havoc on 
8  ongoing governmental operations, you -- on criminal 
9  jurisdiction, civil jurisdiction, the backdrop against 
which contracts were negotiated, investment decisions 
10
11 
made and economic development undertaken. 
12
13  and this Court in Coeur D'Alene have never allowed 
14  injunctive relief to strip the United States of title 
that it has.  The essence of sovereign immunity is, 
15
16  right or wrong, you cannot take title away that the 
17  United States has. 
18
19  the -- is that in the Administrative Procedure Act?  I 
20
21  the -- the old bugaboo of sovereign immunity, and says 
22  when it -- when it will stand and when it won't.

 MS. MILLETT:  If you look --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if you're relying on the 

Quiet Title Act, that -- that clearly covers only suits 

thought the Administrative Procedure Act eliminates 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, is -- is that in

 MS. MILLETT:  For two reasons, Justice 

Scalia.  Because the APA itself -- and this is on page 

1  which seek to say, I own the land rather than the 
2  government, and this is not such a suit.  So I don't see 
3  why the normal APA principles wouldn't govern. 
4
5
6  6a of the addendum to our brief -- says that it does not 
7  waive sovereign immunity and does not grant relief if 
8  another statute expressly or impliedly forecloses the 
9  relief that is sought.  And the Quiet Title Act says you 
cannot have an injunction stripping the United States of 
10
11  land, period, and you cannot have any litigation over 
12  title --
13
14  sought under the Quiet Title Act is title in the 
plaintiff.  That's the relief ultimately sought. 
15
16
 MS. MILLETT:  No --
17
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, on the way to that, you 
18  may -- you may get some injunctive remedy, but the basis 
19  for the lawsuit is -- is not:  I own the land.
 MS. MILLETT:  With respect, Justice Scalia, 
20
21  you can get no injunctive relief whatsoever even if you 
22  are asserting title.  But the Quiet Title Act itself is 
23  brought -- it limits relief to monetary compensation, 
24  unless the government agrees to a specific relief.

 MS. MILLETT:  But -- no.  Justice Scalia, 
5
6  with respect, on page -- this is 2a of the addendum to 
7  our brief, 2409a(a), the type of suit that is addressed, 
8  and to which the Indian lands exception applies, is a 
9  suit -- and I'm reading here from the second line of

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay. 
17
 MS. MILLETT:  And right -- subsection (a), 
18  the second line, all right:  "The waiver of sovereign 
19  immunity is for a civil action under this section to

22  "Under this section."

3
4  mind is a suit in which the plaintiff claims a right,

6  "under this section," well, that's what this section is 
7  about, a suit in which a plaintiff claims the right, 
8  title or interest.

respect.  That tells you what you have to do if you are 
10
11  allowed to proceed under the statute to win, the first 
12  step of what you have to do.  But what subsection (a) 
13  says is what is carved out, what is a wholesale -- and 
14  this Court said in Mottaz, a retention of immunity, even 
15
16  wrong administratively, as in Mottaz.  What you 
17  do -- have done is retain immunity. 
 When the -- the section here right under the 
18
19  sentence I read, Justice Scalia, about this section does 
not apply to trust or restricted Indian lands, what that 
20
21  meant was that this -- that Congress, against a backdrop 
22  of complete immunity, said:  We've looked at lands, 
23  we've studied what we're doing, and we are not doing two 
24  things, and we're going to be explicit about it.  We are

13  on page 25 of his brief, his court of appeals brief, at

title, but to take title out.  And that's when the Quiet

that has not been briefed by either party particularly.

9  the citizenship of a party changes, so it coincides with

cases where the filing of the complaint -- nothing

14  Indians, and when land is taken into trust, it 
15
16  is implicated, anyone who is affected by that

1  It does, however -- the intent in 465 is to have land

3  separate the fact that the land is being taken into
 
4  trust from the specific use to which it is being put.

5
6  trust for a specific use.  And you can see, in fact, 
7  that the government has reached the same conclusion. 
8  When you look at the regulations that the Secretary has 
9  adopted in consideration of section 465, they not only 
address land use, the tribe has to identify the use to 
10
11 
which the land will be put, but they also require the 
tribe to identify any conflicts of land use, which 
12 
13 
clearly addresses the fact that other people are going 
to be affected by the land use.
14 
 Consequently, those -- and we believe 
15
16  those -- those regulations are subject to Chevron 
17  deference because they fall within the scope of the 
18  authority delegated to the Secretary, and they don't 
19  conflict with the broad delegation there in the -- in

23  Alito's question.  It does seem that we may be wasting

20

22  quiet title action, people could go upset government 
23  title to property years and years later.  And they would 
24  say:  Oh, well, we're not challenging the title; we're 
just challenging what happened when it was taken, the 
25

South Dakota or South Dakota v. United States -- in 
which the Court there found that the lack of judicial 
review pushed towards the conclusion that the 
Reorganization Act is an unconstitutional delegation of 
the legislative authority.  And that was one of the 
reasons, or that was the reason cited in the Federal

plaintiff is to give him the land. 

 MR. NELSON:  Or to pay him for it, yes, Your 

 MR. NELSON:  That is the gravamen of the 

injury.  Yes, Your Honor.

 Is there some midway position that the 

characterization of your position.  And the Respondent 

1  position -- at least this was the way the Respondent
 
2  puts it -- that it can basically moot their action by
 
3  turning this into a quiet title action just by taking
 
4  title.  And let's assume that that's one
 
5
6  on the other hand says, oh, well, this is an APA action, 
7  we can -- we can wait forever, at least for 6 years. 
8
9  government can't moot the case too soon, that it must 
wait a reasonable time?  Or is there no basis in the 
10
11 
statute or in the cases for that position to hold? 
12
 MR. MILLER:  If I understand correctly, 
13  you're asking about a case where the -- the lawsuit is 
14  filed before the land has been transferred.
15
16
17  restricting the government's ability to do that.  I 
18  mean, short of the plaintiffs obtaining an injunction 
19  from the Court.  I guess the broader point I would make 
about that timing question is that the -- the court of 
20
21  appeals --
22
23  you're -- you're sticking with your position.  You say 
24  you can basically moot a suit at any point you want just 
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes, yes. 
 MR. MILLER:  I don't know of any basis for 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, in other words, 

by taking title, so you're -- you're not accepting any 

54
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All or nothing?  Okay. 
 MR. MILLER:  -- it would be exactly the same, 

error in that analysis is -- is that the question here 
is not whether Patchak's suit is a Quiet Title Act 
action.  The question is whether the Quiet Title Act 
expressly or impliedly precludes relief under section 
702, and the answer to that question is yes.

1  qualification to that proposition. 
2
3  would just emphasize that that was not the basis of 
4  the -- the ruling of the court of appeals.  The court of 
5
6  filed, and under the Court's analysis --
7
8
9  even if it was filed later.  And I think the -- the 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  that.  The first is that the general principle 
17  recognized by this Court in Brown v. GSA and a number of 
18  other cases is that when you have a narrowly drawn 
19  remedial scheme for a particular subject, that that 
20
21  the Quiet Title Act is exactly such a scheme.  It's the 
22  mechanism for adjudicating a disputed title to real 
23  property in which the United States claims an interest, 
24  and it has its own procedures, its own statute of 
25

precludes resort to more general remedies.  And here, 

 And I'd just like to make two points about 

Official 

 MR. MILLER:  That -- that is our position.  I 

appeals held that it doesn't matter when the suit is 

limitations --

55
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. MILLER:  I think -- for two reasons.  And 

2409a(a), which is, you know, to adjudicate a disputed 
title to land on which the United States claims an 
interest.  That's a perfect description of what this 
case is. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but -- but in saying 
1
2  that you've just broadened it, or arguably, you have. 
3  If -- if you think that the quiet title action is really 
4  about the narrower set of cases, which is when a person 
himself claims title, how can you get from that to say 
5
6  that there is an express or an implied refusal of -- of 
7  this kind of claim? 
8
9  the first is, just that -- that first sentence of 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
 And the second is that the last sentence of 
section 702 directs our attention to whether the relief 
15
16  is expressly or impliedly forbidden by another statute. 
17  And the relief that is sought here is an order 
18  compelling the Secretary to relinquish title on behalf 
19  of the United States to this land.  And --
20
21 
22 
23 
24
25

not sure that there aren't any others, but --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What specific -- do 

other consequences other than the ability of the 
Secretary to take land in trust flow from whether or not 
a tribe is recognized in 1934? 

 MR. MILLER:  I -- I'm not aware of any.  I'm

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right.  Do you have any 

 Are you sure that's good for the government?
 MR. MILLER:  Well, this action would be 

1
2  concern that the government will get hoist by its own 
3  petard? 
4
your argument leads is that this individual, or any 
5
6  individual claiming that the government took title 
7  incorrectly, can sue under the Quiet Title Act, even if 
8  they don't claim that title was taken from them. 
9
10
11  barred under the Quiet Title Act because the Quiet Title 
12  Act expressly precludes this relief, where -- where 
13  Indian trust land is at issue, where the relief that's 
14  sought is an injunction compelling relinquishment of 
15
16
17  only time the government takes land, right?

 One point I would make on that is just refer

 MR. MILLER:  I'm not aware of others, but --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What --
 MR. MILLER:  -- I can't say with confidence
