CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument this afternoon in Case 08-964, 

Bilski v. Kappos. 

Mr. Jakes. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. MICHAEL JAKES 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. JAKES:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The Federal Circuit's rigid and narrow 

machine-or-transformation test for all patent-eligible 

methods should be reversed.  The requirement that any 

and all methods must be either tied to a particular 

machine or transform specific subject matter doesn't 

find any basis in either the language of section 101 or 

anywhere in the patent statute. 

It's not required by this Court's 

precedence, and it's contrary to the established 

principle that section 101 should be read broadly to 

accommodate unforeseen advances in the useful arts. 

There are recognized exclusions from section 101, from 

that broad language, such as laws of nature, natural 

phenomenon, and abstract ideas.  Those may not be 

patented.

But these exceptions, which are drawn from 

the Court's precedent, including this Court's Diehr 

case, also find support in the statutory language, 

which says that any process must be new and useful. 

So the prohibition against patenting laws of 

nature or abstract principles -- it applies equally to 

all four categories of subject matter under 101, but, 

here, the Federal circuit has created a new test just 

for processes that are not found in the statute or 

required by this Court's decisions. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, the government 

says that the -- that the term on which it hangs its hat 

is the term “useful arts” and that that meant, 

originally, and still means manufacturing arts, arts 

dealing with workmen, with -- you know, inventors, like 

Lorenzo Jones, not -- not somebody who writes a book on 

how to win friends and influence people. 

What’s wrong with that analysis, that 

that's what "useful arts" meant, that it always --

always was thought to deal with machines and inventions? 

MR. JAKES:  Certainly, "useful arts" 

encompasses industrial processes, manufacturing 

processes, but it has never been limited just to those 

types of processes.  I'll admit that during the 

Industrial Revolution most of the inventions concerned

machines and manufacturing processes.  But we have cited 

counter-examples that show that business was also within 

the useful arts. 

It's also up to Congress to decide how to 

implement the patent system and the statutory scheme --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, if you leave 

something out, Congress can put it back in, tailoring 

the protection to what they feel is necessary.  But if 

it covers everything under the sun, I've never seen a 

case where Congress would take something out. 

Now, if we are relying on Congress, I guess 

the circuit would say, let's go narrow, and we 

won’t have -- you know -- since you referred to 

Congress, I thought I would bring that up and see what 

you think. 

MR. JAKES:  Congress has acted in certain 

circumstances.  One of them is in section 273, to 

provide prior user rights for business methods.  Another 

area is 287(c), where medical activities are also 

exempted from remedies under the statute. 

There has been a bill introduced to exempt 

tax avoidance methods, but that has not yet been passed. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But just so you would say 

tax avoidance methods are covered, just as the process 

here is covered.  So an estate plan, tax avoidance, how

to resist a corporate takeover, how to choose a jury, 

all of those are patentable? 

MR. JAKES:  They are eligible for patenting 

as processes, assuming they meet the other statutory 

requirements. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So that would mean that 

every -- every businessman -- perhaps not every, but 

every successful businessman typically has something. 

His firm wouldn't be successful if he didn't have 

anything that others didn't have.  He thinks of a new 

way to organize.  He thinks of a new thing to say on the 

telephone.  He thinks of something.  That's how he made 

his money. 

And your view would be -- and it's new, too, 

and it's useful, made him a fortune -- anything that 

helps any businessman succeed is patentable because we 

reduce it to a number of steps, explain it in general 

terms, file our application, granted? 

MR. JAKES:  It is potentially patentable, 

yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Well then, if that 

were so, we go back to the original purpose of the 

Constitution.  Do you think that the Framers would have 

wanted to require anyone successful in this great, vast, 

new continent because he thinks of something new to have

had to run to Washington and to force any possible 

competitor to do a search and then stop the wheels of 

progress unless they get permission? 

Is that a plausible view of the patent 

clause? 

MR. JAKES:  No, Your Honor.  I wouldn't 

characterize it that way, but I do believe that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how do we limit it to 

something that’s reasonable?  Meaning, if we don't 

limit it to inventions or to technology, as some amici 

have, or to some tie or tether, borrowing the Solicitor 

General's phraseology, to the sciences, to the useful 

arts, then why not patent the method of speed dating? 

MR. JAKES:  Well, first of all, I think, 

looking at what are useful arts, it does exclude some 

things.  It does exclude the fine arts.  Speaking, 

literature, poems -- I think we all agree that those are 

not included, and there are other things as well.  For 

example, a corporation, a human being -- these are 

things that are not covered by the statutory categories. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why are human 

activities covered by useful arts? 

MR. JAKES:  Human activities are covered. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, you are saying 

they are covered, but why should they be?

MR. JAKES:  I believe the statute provides 

for them to be covered by defining them as a process.  I 

can give you a -- one good example, which would be a 

surgical method performed by a doctor.  Those are 

patentable.  They are patent eligible.  In section 

287(c), Congress has carved out and said, you can't go 

after the doctor for infringement, but that is an 

entirely human activity, and it has long been 

patentable. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think that there 

is some benefit to society from patenting a method to 

cure someone that involves just human activity, as 

opposed to some machine, substance, or other apparatus 

to help that process? 

MR. JAKES:  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you believe that that 

was the intent of the patent law? 

MR. JAKES:  I believe that falls within the 

useful arts, and I believe that there is an advantage to 

that.  There are really two advantages to the patent 

system.  One is encouraging people to come up with new 

things, such as a surgical method or a method of hedging 

consumption risk. 

The other is the disclosure aspect.  A 

doctor might choose to keep it secret.

JUSTICE BREYER:  So you are going to answer 

this question yes.  You know, I have a great, wonderful, 

really original method of teaching antitrust law, and it 

kept 80 percent of the students awake.  They learned 

things --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It was fabulous.  And I 

could probably have reduced it to a set of steps, and 

other teachers could have followed it.  That you are 

going to say is patentable, too? 

MR. JAKES:  Potentially. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Fine.  Now, suppose 

I reject that view, hypothetically, and suppose I were 

to take the view that this is way too far, that that’s 

not the purpose of the statute.  Suppose for 

hypothetical's sake I'm still a little nervous about 

that -- that circuit's decision there.  Have you any 

suggestion for me? 

MR. JAKES:  I think that we should go back 

to the first principles that were enunciated in Diehr 

and other cases, that abstract ideas per se are not 

patentable.  That's my position, and what I would 

advocate in this case and in any case, as long as you're 

--

at your claim 1, in Joint Appendix page 19 to 20.  How 

is that not an abstract idea?  You initiate a series of 

transactions between commodity providers and commodity 

consumers.  You set a fixed price at the consumer end, 

you set a fixed price at the other end, and that's it. 

I mean, I could patent a process where I do 

the same thing.  I initiate a series of transactions 

with sellers.  I initiate a series of transactions with 

buyers.  I buy low and sell high.  That's my patent for 

maximizing wealth. 

I don't see how that's different than your 

claim number 1. 

MR. JAKES:  If that was a novel and 

unobvious method, then it should be patentable, but it's 

eligible as subject matter --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but your claim 

1 it seems to me is classic commodity hedging that has 

been going on for centuries. 

MR. JAKES:  Your Honor, if that were true, 

then we should run afoul of the obviousness provision 

under section 103.  Now, the Patent Office did initially 

allow some of our claims over the prior art. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you know that the 

insurance industry -- the insurance business, as we know 

it, really began in England in 1680, when they

discovered differential calculus, and they had 

expectancy and actuarial tables, actuarial for life, 

expectancy for shipping, and this really created a whole 

new industry. 

In your view, I think, clearly those would 

be patentable, the -- the explanation of how to compile 

an actuarial table and -- and apply it to risk.  That 

certainly would be patentable under your view, and 

it's -- it's difficult for me to think that Congress 

would want to -- would have wanted to give only one 

person the capacity to issue insurance. 

MR. JAKES:  I think that method would be 

patent eligible.  But, as you said, it would have to be 

reduced to a concrete set of steps, like our claim 1. 

Now, claim 1 may be written in broad terms, and it may 

some day run into the prior art, but it does require 

people to do actual things. 

I think even the Patent Office agreed that 

there are physical steps in our method here.  And in the 

insurance method --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- I'm sorry. 

Just -- what are the physical steps?  Initiating a 

series of transactions between commodity provider and 

market participants? 

MR. JAKES:  That would be one.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You get on the phone 

and you call the baker, and you get on the phone and you 

call the grocer and say:  I can set up a deal for both 

of you. 

MR. JAKES:  It could be.  It could be done 

that way because it does take a person acting to do 

that.  It's not purely --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And so in the insurance 

case, it takes a person to go over to the Bureau of 

Statistics and compile statistics on -- on life -- on 

life expectancy. 

MR. JAKES:  That could be.  Now, a patent 

on the data -- that's another category that's not 

included in the subject matter of those four categories. 

The data itself is not patentable, but if it is a series 

of steps, it should be eligible as long as it meets the 

other statutory requirements as a process. 

There’s nothing in the useful arts -- now, 

we have heard the word "technology."  That can be a 

difficult term, because “technology” in its broadest 

sense means the application of knowledge as opposed to 

general knowledge. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't that the basis on 

which the patent law rests in Europe, in other 

countries?  They do not permit business method patents.

It has to be tied to technology, to science or 

technology.  So if other systems are able to work with 

the notion of technology-based, why not ours? 

MR. JAKES:  I would agree, Your Honor. 

There are those systems that do have a requirement like 

that.  Ours does not.  Ours speaks in very broad 

terms about any --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I was talking about 

-- you said that technology-based, that wouldn't work 

because there are so many definitions.  I'm simply 

asking you the question:  Does it work in these other 

systems?  That they -- they exclude business methods, 

they include technology-based innovations. 

MR. JAKES:  That's right.  But they have 

also defined "technology" in such a way as to exclude 

business methods.  And I don't think we can do that. 

The fields of operations research, 

industrial engineering, even financial engineering --

there has been an explosion in these particular fields, 

and to now call them non-technological because they 

didn't exist over 100 years ago wouldn't make --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you suggesting they 

didn't exist because we didn't give them patents 

100 years ago?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or they exist because 

computers have increased –-

MR. JAKES:  It's very much related to our 

current economy and state of technology, with computers 

and the Internet and the free flow of information.  But 

that's what --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, but a patent limits 

the free flow of information.  It requires licensing 

fees and other steps, legal steps.  So you can't argue 

that your definition is improving the free flow of 

information. 

MR. JAKES:  Your Honor, I would, because of 

the disclosure requirement of the patent laws.  It 

requires people to disclose their inventions rather than 

keeping them secret, so there is a second benefit to the 

patent system just other than encouraging people to 

invent, and that is to have that information get to the 

public generally.  And in exchange for that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even though the public 

can't use it, right, until the patent expires? 

MR. JAKES:  Until the patent expires, if a 

valid patent issues on that, yes. 

But that's our system.  We do give exclusive 

rights in exchange for that information being provided 

to the public.

JUSTICE STEVENS:  There's language in the 

opinion. 

MR. JAKES:  It outlines the general 

principles --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes. 

MR. JAKES:  -- and also tells us that there 

are only these specific things that are not included 

within the subject matter. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But is it correct that 

there's none -- none of our cases has ever approved a 

rule such as you advocate? 

MR. JAKES:  I don't think this particular 

subject matter has been ruled on by the Court.

there was a case that could have been decided on the 

grounds that it was a method of doing business, and 

instead the Court chose to decide that case based on 

obviousness.  And really –-

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You know, you mention that 

there are all these -- these new areas that didn't exist 

in the past because of modern business and whatnot, but 

there are also areas that existed in the past that don't 

exist today.  Let's take training horses.  Don't you 

think that -- that some people, horse whisperers or 

others, had some, you know, some insights into the best 

way to train horses?  And that should have been 

patentable on your theory. 

MR. JAKES:  They might have, yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, why didn't anybody 

patent those things? 

MR. JAKES:  I think our economy was based on 

industrial process. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It was based on horses, for 

Pete's sake.  You --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You would really have 

thought somebody would have patented that.

enforcement.  I can't really answer why somebody

There are teaching methods that were 

patented.  There are a number of them that we've 

included in our brief where there were patents issued 

for teaching methods, and I don't think that we've had a 

serious enforcement problem with people being sued for 

using teaching methods.  But there have been those 

people who have sought to patent them rather than keep 

them as secrets or just use them. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  How old -- how old were 

those -- those cases? 

MR. JAKES:  They range.  Some of them go 

back quite a ways, to the last century. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this general 

question, too?  I have always admired Judge Rich, who 

was very active in drafting the '52 amendment. 

MR. JAKES:  Yes.

article that he wrote.

patent-eligible subject matter, looking at the State 

Street Bank case. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In the Diehr case, the 

Court said that in the end, the abstract idea must be in 

a process that, oh, implements a proposal that the 

patent laws were designed to protect, which brings you 

almost back to the beginning.  You don't --

MR. JAKES:  It does. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You don't know much from 

that language.  But that was something that you could 

touch, that you could see, that looked like a machine; 

the substance was different before the process and after 

the process.  And -- and none of that's applicable here. 

It's --

MR. JAKES:  The Diehr invention was an 

industrial process of the conventional type, because it 

was a method of curing rubber.  But today the raw 

materials are just as likely to be information or 

electronic signals, and to simply root us in the 

industrial era because that's what we knew I think would 

be wrong and contrary to the forward-looking aspect of 

the patent laws. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, isn't the 

manipulation of electronic signals a substance that’s

different in kind from just a method of how to go about 

doing business or a method of how to approach a 

particular problem? 

Isn't there -- isn't that what the Federal 

Circuit was trying to explain, which is that there has 

to be something more substantive than the mere exchange 

of information; that it has to involve -- it used the 

word "transformation."  It hasn't defined the outer 

limits of what it means by that. 

MR. JAKES:  I think there is a difference. 

But by rigidly looking at that transformation test, what 

you do is you exclude lots of other things where the 

transformation is not required --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's exactly what I --

maybe I can get you to inadvertently help by -- a 

hypothesis you don't like.  That's why I say it's 

inadvertent. 

You said there are two things.  There are 

actually four things in the patent law which everyone 

accepts.  There are two that are plus and two that are 

minus.  And the two that are plus is by giving people a 

monopoly, you get them to produce more.  As you said, 

you get them to disclose. 

The two minuses are they charge a higher 

price, so people use the product less; and moreover, the

act of getting permissions and having to get permission 

can really slow things down and destroy advance.  So 

there’s a balance. 

In the 19th century, they made it one 

way in respect to machines.  Now you're telling us: 

Make it today in respect to information.  And if you ask 

me as a person how to make that balance in respect to 

information, if I am honest, I have to tell you:  I 

don't know.  And I don't know whether across the board 

or in this area or that area patent protection will do 

no harm or more harm than good. 

So that's the true situation in which I find 

myself in respect to your argument.  And it's in respect 

to that, I’d say:  All right, so what do I do? 

MR. JAKES:  I think the answer is to follow 

the statute. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, thank you.  I thought 

that was the issue, not the answer. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. JAKES:  Congress has spoken in broad 

terms and given us those four categories, and by looking 

at those, I think that answers the question. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But it doesn't, because 

we don't work in a vacuum.  We work in a context. 

MR. JAKES:  Yes. 

20 

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so it begs the 

question, because we go around in a circle:  What does 

"process" mean in a patent law that was passed in 1952 

that had one set of manufacturing and other items that 

are technologically tied and this is not?  So how do we 

discern Congress's intent, other than by the use of the 

word "process" in context? 

MR. JAKES:  I think that "process" is not by 

itself.  It says "any new and useful process."  And so 

we have -- we can look at those words and understand 

that natural phenomena, laws of nature, which are not 

really new because they are part of the storehouse of 

knowledge available to everyone, and "useful," meaning 

there has to be a practical application. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the word "knowledge" 

is not used in the act.  So it's not just useful 

knowledge. 

MR. JAKES:  No. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's useful knowledge in 

relationship to something. 

MR. JAKES:  Practically applied, yes, in the 

real world, whether that's the exchange of information 

or electronic data transformation.  One of the problems 

with the transformation test is that it would exclude 

some valuable inventions that I think everyone would

agree are technological under any test such as data 

compression, such as FM radio.  Even Bell's claim, the 

claim to transmitting sound using undulating current, 

wouldn't necessarily pass the transformation test.  So I 

think we need to look at --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, if that’s --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it would be different, 

it seems to me, than what you are -- let's assume you 

can't patent an alphabet.  I assume that’s true.  And 

you can take an alphabet to make beautiful words, and --

and so forth.  You -- you want to say that these --

these electronic signals can be used in a way just like 

the alphabet can be used. 

And many of the scientific briefs say that 

their process is different, that they are taking 

electronic signals and turning them into some other sort 

of signal.  But that's not what you are doing. 

MR. JAKES:  That may be, but those signals 

could also be transmitted.  On -- on your question about 

the alphabet, you said look at the Morse claim 5, which 

was an alphabet to Morse Code.  That's exactly what it 

was.  It was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you reject -- you 

reject the substitute.  You think you can patent an 

alphabet because it is a process of forming words.

MR. JAKES:  It could be, yes.  Now, I think 

you run into all kinds of other problems.  And that's 

really where the focus of the patent statute should be, 

so that we have the fair give-and-take, the bargain that 

is necessary, that we -- too much overpatenting as 

opposed to too little.  The test there is obviousness. 

That's where it takes place, not at this threshold. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Morse's code was not 

obvious. 

MR. JAKES:  What is that? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Morse's code was not 

obvious, and yet --

MR. JAKES:  No, it wasn't. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  As I understand that 

case, the only thing patented was the use of his code 

with respect to the telegraph machine that he proposed. 

The Patent Office rejected -- maybe I am reading the 

case wrong, but it rejected all of the claims except 

those that related to the use of the code with a 

particular machine.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The same thing with --

well, Bell's patent was --

MR. JAKES:  In Morse's claims, I believe it 

was claim 8 was the one that was rejected, and the rest 

of them were accepted.  Claim 8 was the very broad claim 

to transmitting information over a distance, however 

accomplished. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's not skip over 

that, because the rest of the claim in Bell related to 

how to transmit over the wire, correct? 

MR. JAKES:  His disclosure did, but his 

actual claim was interpreted as being using undulating 

current to transmit sound, however that was 

accomplished.  It was very broad, and that's why --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that was what was 

rejected. 

MR. JAKES:  No.  Bell's claim was not 

rejected.  That one was approved, yes.  The Morse claim,

mean it met the transformation test, didn't it? 

MR. JAKES:  It might have.  It might have. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It clearly did. 

MR. JAKES:  Well, it's not that clear from 

the Federal Circuit's transformation test whether that 

would apply or not, because although the Federal Circuit 

has said transformation of data might qualify, it said 

it has to represent something physical, something -- a 

real object.  And sound doesn't necessarily have to be 

that.  Sound can be generated artificially.  So --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sound -- sound is not 

physical, and electric current is not physical? 

MR. JAKES:  I think electric current is 

physical. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, I think so. 

MR. JAKES:  Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sound is, too. 

MR. JAKES:  It can be, but when it's 

transmitted over a wire, it's not.  It's something else. 

It's an electrical current then. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sound is not transmitted 

over the wires.  Sound has been transformed into 

current, and current is transmitted over the wire and 

then transformed back at the other end into sound.

discussion of the Morse and the telephone cases, because 

it's certainly our view that those would come out the

(Laughter.) 

MR. STEWART:  And, you know, Justice Scalia, 

you mentioned how to win friends and influence people. 

I think at a certain level of generality you could 

describe both Dale Carnegie and Alexander Graham Bell as 

people who devised methods of communicating more 

effectively. 

The reason that Bell's method was patentable 

was that it operated in the realm of the physical.  Bell 

had devised a process implemented through machines by 

which sound was transformed into electronic current. 

Current was then transmitted over a distance and 

transformed back into sound. 

Innovations as to new techniques of public 

speaking, new techniques of negotiations, techniques 

that go to the substance of what is said may be 

innovative.  They may be valuable.  They are not patent 

eligible because they don't deal in the realm of the 

physical. 

So while the industrial processes that we 

discussed at some length in our brief were at the time 

of the framing the paradigmatic patent eligible 

processes, they were -- they are not the only processes 

that can be patented.  In a --

Brief, you argue that -- that the patent here is -- is 

not -- is unpatentable on the independent ground that it 

would pre-empt the abstract idea of hedging consumption 

risk.  If you -- if you are right about that, is this a 

good case for us to get into these –- into  the very 

 

broad issue that Petitioner has raised? 

MR. STEWART:  I -- I think we would 

certainly prefer to win on our primary ground, and let 

me say a couple of things about that.  First, we would 

fairly vigorously resist the notion that the rule that 

was announced by the Federal Circuit is rigid or 

inflexible.  That is, all that the Federal Circuit has 

really said is that to have a patent-eligible process 

you have to identify some link to a machine or a 

transformation of matter.  And the Federal Circuit has 

said with respect to some processes the link to the 

machine may be so attenuated, the machine part of the 

process may be such a small segment of the process as a 

whole, that this wouldn't be enough.  But the Federal 

Circuit said:  We leave for another day the hard 

questions that will arise when part of the process is 

machine-implemented and another part is not. 

And in order for the PTO and the Federal 

Circuit to go about the business of devising more 

precise rules as to when particular links to machines

are sufficient to create patent eligibility, we first 

need to establish the -- the basic principle that some 

link to a machine or transformation is necessary.  So I 

think we -- we have made the alternative argument in our 

brief, and I think it is a basis for affirmance. 

But if the Court decided the case on that 

basis, we would lose at least the -- the limited clarity 

that the Federal Circuit's opinion has provided; that 

is, it would still be open to people in the future to 

devise new contractual arrangements designed to allocate 

risks, new methods of teaching antitrust, and --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about if we say 

something as simple as patent law doesn't cover business 

methods, instead of what the Federal Circuit has begun 

to say, which is technology is tied to a machine or a 

transformation of the substance?  But I have no idea 

what the limits of that ruling will impose in the 

computer world or the biomedical world.  All of the 

amici were talking about how it will destroy industries. 

If we’re unsure about that, wouldn't the safer practice 

be simply to say it doesn't involve business methods? 

MR. STEWART:  I think that would be 

incorrect, and it would create problems of its own. 

That is, the -- the innovation that was held to be 

patent eligible in State Street Bank was not a process.

The Federal Circuit was not construing the statutory 

term "process."  It was construing the statutory term 

"machine."  And it said, in essence, a computer that has 

been programmed to perform various calculations in 

connection with the operation of this business is a 

machine. 

It went on to say the opposing party in that 

case had not raised any objection under section 102 or 

103, and, therefore, the Federal Circuit –-

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No ruling in this case 

is going to change State Street --

MR. STEWART:  Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- because it wasn't 

looking at process or the meaning of "process."  It was 

looking at something else. 

MR. STEWART:  Well, again, I think that the 

invention that was held to be patent eligible in State 

Street is commonly described as a business method, even 

though it was held to be patent eligible as a machine 

rather than as a process. 

So, to say that business methods are 

categorically ineligible for patent protection would 

eliminate new machines, including programmed computers, 

that are useful because of their contributions to the 

operation of businesses.  And similarly, the court --

the Federal Circuit in other cases has held that a claim 

to new and innovative computer software may be held 

patentable as a process, as a method of accomplishing 

particular tasks through the use of a computer, and 

those might be business-related tasks.  So, to say that 

business methods were ruled out would itself be a fairly 

sweeping holding. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Also you could say business 

methods apart from machines are not patentable.  How 

about that? 

MR. STEWART:  If the Court said that in the 

limited area of business methods, if there is no machine 

or transformation, there is no patent eligibility --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose you say this.  I'm 

just testing things out.  Start with Diehr.  I

from business methods, not machines, dah, dah, dah, dah,

transformation; how broad or narrow is that?  We don't 

know.  Many people's problems will be solved if it's 

either broad on the one hand or narrow in the other. 

Two, are you automatically patented -- in 

the patent statute, if you just sort of reduce this to a 

machine by adding a computer on at the end?  They've 

flagged that as a problem.  They haven't answered it. 

Could there ever be a situation where it doesn't meet 

this test but still is patentable?  We’re not sure. 

MR. STEWART:  Let me take those points --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 

MR. STEWART:  -- in the order that you made 

them. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you see what I'm trying 

to do?  I'm trying to note the things that have been 

raised in these 80 briefs insofar as possible, say 

there’s a lot there for the future that we can't really 

decide, but say as a pull back, okay. 

MR. STEWART:  Let me address those points in 

order.  The first thing is that in Diehr when you had 

the “e.g.” cite, it was "e.g., transforming an article 

into a different" state of -- state or thing.  And I 

think the obvious inference is "e.g." was used because 

the other prong of the machine-or-transformation test is 

use as a machine.  That is, in the context of Mr.

Morse's invention or Mr. Bell's invention, there is 

transformation of a sort, but it wouldn't naturally be 

characterized as transformation of matter. 

Those things were held to be patent eligible 

not because they transformed matter, but because they 

involved the use of a machine.  And so, what the Court 

in Diehr said transformation of a matter or an article 

into a different state or thing is the clue to the 

patentability of a process that doesn't involve a 

particular machine. 

And the -- the type of process it had in 

mind was the process that was described in Corning v. 

Burden or the process in Cochrane v. Deener, situations 

in which an individual had devised a method of, in one 

sense -- one case, it was manufacturing flour, and in 

another case it was rolling puddle balls, of 

manufacturing items.  And that person said, here is the 

series of steps that you have to go through, but it’s 

not essential that you use any particular tool or 

machine for each of these steps.  That was why the 

word --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Stewart, I 

thought I understood your argument up until the very

involve a machine.  But then you say but it might be if 

you use a computer to identify the parties that you are 

setting a price between and if you used a microprocessor 

to calculate the price.  That's like saying if you use a 

typewriter to type out the -- the process, then it is 

patentable.  I -- I -- that takes away everything 

that you spent 53 pages establishing. 

MR. STEWART:  Well, I guess there -- there 

were two different places, I believe, at which we 

identified ways in which this sort of hedging scheme 

might be made patent eligible.  The first is we 

described a hypothetical interactive Website in which 

people -- parties and counterparties could essentially 

find each other by the computer and could agree to terms 

on that basis.  And in that situation, the -- the 

computer would be at the heart of the innovation.  It 

would be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  That's just 

saying instead of looking at the -- in the Yellow Pages, 

you look on the computer.  And that makes all the 

difference to you? 

MR. STEWART:  I think an -- an interactive 

computer technique, one in which you sign on and can 

find people without tracking them down specifically, can 

simply identify yourself on the Website as somebody

who is interested in engaging in a particular 

transaction and a potential counterparty can find you, 

is different from the Yellow Pages. 

But I guess the fundamental point I would 

make is -- and this is really responsive to the second 

part of Justice Breyer's question -- I think it is both 

a virtue and a vice of the test that the Federal Circuit 

has announced and that we are advocating that it doesn't 

solve all the hard questions.  That is, the Federal 

Circuit has said since this particular patent applicant 

didn't identify any machine or any transformation that 

would be necessary to the accomplishment of its method, 

that person is out of luck, and, therefore, it's 

inappropriate for us to go on to decide kind of the 

precise level of substantiality that a machine or 

transformation must play --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But if you look at 

your footnote, that involves the most tangential and 

insignificant use of a machine.  And yet you say that 

might be enough to take something from patentability to

MR. STEWART:  And all we've said is that it 

might be enough; that is, hard questions will arise down 

the road as to where do you draw the line, to what 

extent must the machine or the transformation be

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you think it's a 

hard question.  If you develop a process that says look 

to the historical averages of oil consumption over a 

certain period and divide it by 2, that process would 

not be patentable.  But if you say use a calculator, 

then it -- then it is? 

MR. STEWART:  I think if it's simply using a 

calculator for its pre-existing functionality to crunch 

numbers, very likely that would not be enough.  What 

we see in some analogous areas is that the computer will 

be programmed with new software.  It will be given 

functionality it didn't have before in order to allow it 

to perform a series of calculations, and that gets 

closer to the line.  And, again --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But your 

footnote -- I don't mean to dwell on it -- it says to 

identify counterparties to the transactions.  So that if 

what you're trying to get is the -- the baker who sells 

bread, because you are going to hook him up with the 

grocer who sells, you know, in the grocery store, if you 

punched in, in your search station -- you know, give me 

all the bakers in Washington -- that would make it 

patentable?

saying it would be patent eligible.  We would have to 

review those facts, and the PTO would have to review 

those facts in the context of an actual application. 

I guess the point I'm trying to make is 

simply that we don't want the court, for instance, in 

the area of software innovations or medical diagnostic 

techniques to be trying to use this case as the vehicle 

for identifying the circumstances in which innovations 

of that sort would and would not be patent eligible, 

because the case really doesn't present any -- any 

question regarding those technologies.  And, therefore, 

we --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, if it veers the 

other way, which is by saying that we exclusively rely 

on the machine-or-transformation test, that we're 

precluding applications of the patent law in those 

fields, the things we can't imagine.  Once you announce 

an exclusive test, you're shoe-horning technologies that 

might be different. 

MR. STEWART:  I guess I would say a couple 

of different things.  The first is that it seems 

unlikely, even with new and rapidly emerging 

technologies, that somebody would come up with a system 

that seems for patent purposes analogous to the 

inventions that have been patent eligible in the past

that didn't involve any machine and that didn't involve 

any transformation. 

Having said that, I would note that in both 

Benson and in Flook, the Court held open the possibility 

that some unforeseen event could take place that 

would -- as to which the application would be patent 

eligible, even though the machine-or-transformation 

test --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So help us 

with a test that doesn't go to the extreme the Federal 

Circuit did, which is to preclude any other items, 

something we held open explicitly in two other cases, so 

we would have to backtrack and say now we are ruling 

that we were wrong, and still get at something like 

this? 

MR. STEWART:  Well, I think the Court could 

say -- could do essentially what was done in Benson and 

Flook, namely acknowledge that there had never been a 

case up to this point in which a process had been held 

patent eligible that didn't involve a machine or a 

transformation.  It could leave open the possibility 

that some new and as yet unforeseen technology could 

necessitate the creation of an exception. 

But -- and the point we would also make is 

this seems to be a very unlikely candidate for such an

have -- for which they have sought a patent is in no 

sense different in kind from risk management techniques 

that have been undertaken for centuries. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but that –- that 

goes back to, not 101, but 102 and 103.  That goes back 

to obviousness or the standard weeding mechanisms for 

patents. 

MR. STEWART:  Well, this may or may not be a 

novel or nonobvious method.  But even if we assume that 

this is nonobvious for purposes of section 103, in that 

it represents a sufficient advance over the prior art, 

that people skilled in the art would not necessarily 

have come up with it, it still is a different in kind 

from risk management techniques that have taken place in 

this country for -- for 200 years.  It is -- it is -– 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Stewart, did you --

did the government put forward this

was it the Federal Circuit's on its own? 

MR. STEWART:  The Federal Circuit, sua

case had been argued to a panel, but had not been 

decided, and the Federal Circuit set the case for 

reargument en banc, posed a number of questions to

the -- the parties and the government did advocate the 

machine-or-transformation test. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Tell me what your --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Did or 

did not? 

MR. STEWART:  It did.  It did advocate the 

machine-or-transformation. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You did -- and if you 

read Judge Mayer's opinion, it has a simplicity to it. 

It says, if it's technology, then its within the realm 

of patent, and if it's not technology, it isn't.  If 

it’s based on science or technology -- and that seems to 

be what is used in other places. 

MR. STEWART:  I don't know that our test --

I think our test, in a sense, has a shorthand version of 

that.  I don't know that focusing the inquiry directly 

on whether technology is involved would make the inquiry 

easier, and that is so for two reasons. 

First, people could dispute whether 

particular advances are properly regarded as 

technological advances, and, second, we would still have 

the difficult problems that the Chief Justice has 

referred to, where you have a process that is described 

as involving technology at some step along the way, and 

courts will still have to make the determination, is

that a sufficiently substantial step to make the 

process, as a whole, a technological one. 

So I don't think that, by adopting a 

technological arts test, the Court would avoid the 

difficulties that it has appropriately identified with 

the machine-or-transformation test. 

The other thing I would say about the 

machine-or-transformation test is this is not a 

government position of recent vintage; that is, the 

government's brief to this Court in Gottschalk v. Benson 

-- or its reply brief, which was filed around 1971 --

basically said, although this Court has never announced 

machine or transformation of the test, that is the 

principle that can be abstracted from the totality of 

the Court's decisions. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Was the State Street case 

a machine-or-transformation test? 

MR. STEWART:  It would --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You talk about the State 

Street case in your brief, and it's complicated because 

of the Federal statute that followed it.  If you had 

just the facts of State Street before us, and forgetting 

the Federal statute was enacted after it, how would you

way.  I mean, State Street Bank --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's what I thought. 

And is it -- is it machine or transformation, in your 

view? 

MR. STEWART:  Well, it was machine -- that 

is, in State Street Bank, the claim was not to a process 

within the meaning of section 101.  The claim was not to 

a method of accomplishing things by means of a computer, 

which would be, potentially, a process.  It was to the 

computer itself, the programmed computer, that the 

innovation in State Street Bank was that the devising of 

new computer programs that allowed the computer to 

perform various tasks in association with the carrying 

out of the hub-and-spokes investment -- investment 

method.  And, certainly --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So what did that --

what did that transform? 

MR. STEWART:  It didn't transform anything, 

but it would fit -- the transformation part would be 

irrelevant because the machine-or-transformation test 

is, in our view, the appropriate rubric to apply in 

construing the statutory term process, that is, when the 

person doesn't say, I have invented a new machine, but, 

rather, says, I've identified a new process for 

accomplishing things.

If a person claims to be -- to have invented 

a new machine, then that -- it is either a machine or it 

isn't.  A computer is certainly a machine.  Really, the 

only -- I think the only --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I don't understand how 

that can be a patent on a machine if the only thing 

novel is the process that the machine is using. 

Isn't -- isn't the question -- really, the question 

there was whether the new process was patentable. 

MR. STEWART:  Well, I think what -- the 

argument that the other side, the person challenging the 

patent in State Street could have made, but apparently 

didn't, was the person could have said, of course, the 

computer is a machine, but a computer programmed with 

new software to perform different functions is not a new 

machine.  It's not a different machine from the one 

that has always -- not always, but that has already 

existed, and therefore, it doesn't satisfy section 1 or 

section -- 102 or section 103, but that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that was one of the

that was actually presented to it was correct; that is, 

the argued was made the programmed computer is 

patentable as a machine --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How would you come out in 

the State Street case today, if all of the arguments 

were made under your test? 

MR. STEWART:  Well, under our test, we would 

come out the same way because the computer would be a 

machine.  The only question would be whether the 

programming of the computer with new software caused it 

to be a patentable different machine from the one that 

existed previously. 

Now -- now, we do think that software 

innovations can have the effect of causing the computer 

to be a different, special purpose computer, as the 

phrase –-

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I'm sorry.  I must be 

awfully stupid.  You say it would come out the same way. 

In the same way the court did or this way you argued?

Official 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I don't understand why 

that isn't just the application of a process, which --

which is not itself patentable subject matter, to a 

particular machine that can use the process --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's -- that's a problem 

I have. 

MR. STEWART:  Well, I guess -- let me 

backtrack.  If you look at the text of the statute –-

it’s reproduced at page 2 of the Blue Brief -- and it 

says -- it's right in the middle of the page.  "Whoever 

invents or discovers any new and useful process, 

machine, manufacture, or composition of matter is 

potentially entitled to" --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So I thought you were 

saying that the correct argument for the people 

attacking the patent in that case was to say, this is 

not a machine.  The machine there is a computer.  This 

is a program that changes switches, and that is a 

different process for the use of the machine. 

Now, whether that process is or is not 

patentable depends upon a lot of things that we don't 

have to go into in this case.  Is that right? 

MR. STEWART:  I don't -- no.  I don’t think 

that is what I was saying.

MR. STEWART:  What I was saying is that –-

somebody claims to have invented a new machine, the 

transformation test really has nothing to do with the 

inquiry because a -- a better television or a better DVD 

player can be patented as a machine, even though 

transformation of matter is no --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  It's not on a computer, 

which the only difference from the old computer is it's 

using a new program.  You can't say that's a new 

machine. 

MR. STEWART:  Well, but my -- I think --

first, I think you can because I think if you -- if you 

improved the hardware of the computer in order to enable 

it to perform --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But that patent didn't 

require any change in the hardware, if I remember it 

correctly. 

MR. STEWART:  But I -- but I think the 

argument that has been made with success -- and PTO 

agrees with this -- is that programming a computer by 

means of software to produce -- to perform new functions 

can create a novel --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But then all we do is every 

example that I just gave, that I thought were examples 

that certainly wouldn’t be patented, you simply patent 

them.  All you do is just have a set of instructions for 

saying how to set a computer to do it.  Anyone can do 

that.  Now, it's a machine. 

So all the business patents are all right 

back in.  Now, that -- what I think we were looking 

for was -- or at least I was -- was why that isn't so, 

and how you are going to later, down the road, deal with 

this situation of all you do is you get somebody who 

knows computers, and you turn every business patent into 

a setting of switches on a machine because there are 

no businesses that don't use those machines. 

MR. STEWART:  Well, first of all the only 

ruling that we're -- I backtrack a bit, to say, we 

opposed cert in this case because we recognized that 

there are difficult problems out there in terms of 

patentability of software innovations and medical 

diagnostic --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You thought we -- you 

thought we’d mess it up.

would mess it up.  We thought that this case would 

provide an unsuitable vehicle for resolving the hard 

questions because the case doesn't involve computer 

software or medical diagnostic techniques, and 

therefore, we thought the Court would arrive at the 

position that I think at least some members are feeling 

that you have arrived at, that you will decide this 

case, and most of the hard questions remain unresolved. 

And, frankly, we think that's true. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But this case could be 

decided without making any bold step --

MR. STEWART:  Again, I don't -- I don't 

think it would be a bold step to say that 

machine or transformation is the test.  That is, we have 

gone for more --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But even the Federal 

Circuit didn't say it was the test.  It said it is for 

now.  We know that things that we haven't yet 

contemplated may be around the corner, and when they 

happen, we will deal with them. 

MR. STEWART:  And we would -- we would be 

entirely content with a ruling like that.  And we would 

say that the claimed hedging method here is not the sort 

of Space Age innovation that might cause Justices to 

say:  This is just different in kind from anything that

the drafters of the patent statute could have imagined. 

The other point I would make about the 

programmed computer is, to follow up on my television 

and DVD example, that when you claim a machine or a 

manufacture, as the committee reports to the 1952 Act 

said, those words are broad.  They encompass everything 

under the sun that is made by man.  And so a television 

is indisputably a machine, even though its function is 

not to transform matter.  It's only when you get to the 

term "process" that you are left with -- that the 

machine-or-transformation test kicks in. 

And really, the argument on the other side 

is:  The term "process" in ordinary speech is extremely 

broad.  It can literally be read to encompass any series 

of steps, whether or not linked to technology, whether 

or not linked to a machine or transformation.  And the 

other side argues you should construe it that way in the 

patent statute. 

I guess the -- the three reasons we would 

say that's not so are, first, under the canon of 

noscitur a sociis, it’s appropriate to construe the 

term "process" in conjunction with the other terms. 

Those other terms are broad, but they all refer to 

physical objects that don't exist in nature and are 

created by man.  And a huge array of very productive,

innovative activity doesn't culminate in the creation of 

any new physical substance, and the word "process" 

surely was intended to add something, but it would be 

quite strange to construe the word "process" to 

encompass the whole range of human endeavor when the 

other words are limited to the creation of new things in 

the physical. 

The second thing is that when this Court in 

the past has explained the term "process," it's always 

linked it to the operation of machines, as in the 

telephone cases and in Morse, or to the transformation 

of matter in ways that may not be dependent on a 

particular machine. 

And the third thing I would say is that in a 

sense, there’s a strong “dog that didn't bark in the 

night” quality to our argument; that is, even though the 

Court has never said in so many words that a method of 

allocating risk by contract is a patent-eligible 

process, the economic history of this country really 

would have been fundamentally different if it had been 

believed from the outset that innovations of this 

character could be patented and potential competitors 

could be foreclosed from engaging in the same method. 

If the Court has nothing further?

Mr. Jakes, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. MICHAEL JAKES 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. JAKES:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

The Federal Circuit did announce this test 

as the sole test for all processes.  It said it applied 

no matter what the process was.  So we do have to face 

these difficult questions. 

I think the question can be avoided, because 

we don't need a rigid test of this type based on 

machine or transformation.  The question we’re looking 

at and should be looking at is:  Are we trying to patent 

an abstract idea? 

Now, the government has gone farther than 

that and really wants to exclude methods of organizing 

human behavior.  I think that's the way they describe 

it.  That's really the business method rejection in 

other words.  And I think that runs contrary to section 

273 of the statute, which recognized that there were 

business methods that could fall within the patent 

statute, and as a result, prior user rights should be 

granted. 

To speak briefly about the State Street Bank 

case, that was a type of business method that was 

implemented on a machine.  The Federal Circuit said it

didn't matter.  They weren't looking at whether it was 

in machine form or method form.  Their reasoning would 

have applied the same either way, and to do otherwise 

would be to place form over substance.  And in a sense, 

that's what some of the transformation debate is about. 

It's form over substance.  Why should transformation be 

the key?  The key should be:  Is it a practical 

application of a useful result? 

Our method, we believe, is a practical 

application.  As the Patent Office has said, it does 

involve physical steps.  I think that was one of the 

clues that the patent office has relied on in saying 

whether or not something is abstract.  Since it is not 

an abstract method, it's rooted in the real world, we 

think it should be eligible to have its examination at 

the Patent Office and it shouldn't be thrown out on an 

arbitrary test. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The -- the physical 

step that your process involves is picking -- picking up 

the phone and calling people on both sides of the 

transaction. 

MR. JAKES:  It could be.  It also requires 

the sale of a commodity at a fixed price.  That is 

something that actually takes place in the real world, 

as opposed to a mental process within somebody's head.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
