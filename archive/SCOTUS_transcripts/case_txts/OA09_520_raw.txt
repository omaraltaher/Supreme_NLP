 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 09-520, CSX 

Transportation v. The Alabama Department of Revenue.

 Mr. Phillips.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The pivotal, and in my judgment, incorrect 

holding of the Eleventh Circuit in the Norfolk Southern 

case is reproduced in the appendix to this case, because 

Norfolk Southern is the controlling precedent for our -­

for our particular dispute.  And at page 29A of the 

appendix to the petition, in there, the court of appeals 

said that there is nothing in the 4-R Act's plain 

language that indicates an intent to reach exemptions 

content from generally applicable sales and use taxes.

 To our way of thinking, all this case is 

about:  Whether or not the State has free reign to 

employ exemptions without exposing the effects of those 

exemptions to a challenge under (b)(4) of the statute.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But in light of our AFC 

case, it seems to me that what you are arguing is that

the statute -- the effect of your argument is that the 

statute gives more protection in the case of 

non-property taxes than property taxes, and that's an -­

an odd reading of the statute, which is directed 

primarily to the -- to the property tax.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  No, I think, Justice Kennedy, 

what we are doing is recognizing that Congress was very 

specific and very explicit about how to treat property 

taxes and set up an entire quite carefully articulated 

scheme in dealing with them in (b)(1) and (b)(3), and 

then said, in general, when you are dealing with areas 

that are not approved by (b)(1) and (b)(3), then you 

have to examine whether or not the overall scheme, in 

fact, discriminates against rail carriers.

 So, while it is true that there could be 

circumstances in which you may end up with somewhat more 

protection as a consequence of (b)(4), I think that's a 

function of Congress not having limited the (b)(4) 

exemption to property, and just saying it's -- it's a 

discrimination against the rail carrier generally that 

the statute is aimed to prevent or to protect against.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But what's the -- what's the 

possible rationale for that distinction?  Why would that 

distinction make any sense?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think because

Congress didn't have the full run mine of possibilities 

in front of it at that point in time.  I mean, it 

probably had some sense of what other taxes were out 

there that might pose discrimination, but I do think 

that Congress is very much concerned that the States, 

once they saw the roadmap laid out for them in (b)(1) 

through (b)(3), might seek other ways to recoup what 

they were going to lose in revenues when the 3-year 

period lapsed, and to be in a position to protect the 

railroads in the (b)(4) -- through (b)(4) in a situation 

when there would be future actions taken by the States.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- in the legislative 

record?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Not -- there's very little in 

the legislative record, Your Honor, because the -- the 

specific formulation of -- of this (b)(4) catch-all 

provision comes in very, very late in the 15-year 

process.  Every other lower court that -- every lower 

court that has looked at it has drawn the inference, 

which seems to me the only fair inference to draw, when 

Congress said:  Look, this is not just for in lieu 

taxes.

 I mean, there was -- there was some debate 

about that going on between the House and the Senate, 

and the conference committee makes it clear.  This is

not just something that's adopted by the States in lieu 

of a broader property tax.  It is intended, then, to 

have, I think, the language that you would normally give 

to a term as broad and sweeping as any other tax that 

discriminates against rail carriers.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Phillips, this is what 

troubles me about -- about your position:  You make a 

viscerally appealing case on the facts of this case, 

where you say that your clients, the railroads, are 

being taxed more than competing carriers, truckers 

and -- and water carriers.

 But if all -- if all it says is 

"discriminates," and you think that that has to be 

applied without qualification, then even if -- if a 

state makes an exemption for, you know, widows over 85 

and doesn't make the same exemption for railroads, the 

railroads win, right?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  That -- that -- no, I don't 

believe that's the necessary -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?  How do you limit the 

term "discrimination"?  Just a discrimination in favor 

of other competing carriers?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think it -- it is 

discrimination that Congress would have intended to 

prohibit under these circumstances.  So I think in the

situation where you are talking about a single exemption 

for some group that does not compete or otherwise do any 

business with the railroads, we would not have a basis 

for saying they were similarly situated -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why do you assume 

that?  Congress didn't limit it to that in -- in the 

property tax exemption.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it -- it did to some 

extent, because there was a whole question about how -­

you know, you had a whole comparative class that 

Congress defines in the property context.  So you make a 

context between the industrial and commercial property 

and the railroads' property.  So Congress defined the 

comparison class, but I don't think it's fair -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But not -- not just the 

industrial and -- and commercial competitors with the 

railroads.  The railroads were to be given, you know, 

the most favored treatment of -- of all the industrial 

and -- and commercial entities, I -- I think.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  To be sure, Justice Scalia, 

but it was still as compared to the entirety of the 

industrial and commercial property base, and it was -­

and the analysis has traditionally been the averages of 

the commercial industrial property.

 So you -- and part of the problem here -­

it's not a problem, but, you know, one of the reasons 

why you can't make direct comparisons is that because of 

ACF Industries, you don't evaluate exemptions under 

(b)(1) to (b)(3) -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But in this case -­

correct me if I'm wrong -- off-road users, agricultural 

users, and construction and timber companies -­

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- have the same -- have 

the same tax structure as the railroads.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So there is an objective 

reference, neutral, and it seems to me that that's just 

quite rational to put the railroads there and not in the 

category of road -- road users.

 Now, if -- unless you are arguing the 

discrimination has to have -- has to have a purposive 

component.  That might give you a different case.  I'm 

not sure you prevail on that, either.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, but -- remember, 

Justice Kennedy, we don't even get to this issue if what 

you say is we are going to take all exemptions off the 

table.  And I guess I would go back to Justice Scalia's 

point, which is that there is a reason why this is a 

viscerally satisfying case, because we are talking here

about a discrimination.

 You know, when Congress says, we want to -­

we want to eliminate any tax that discriminates against, 

the one thing it seems to me, clearly, Congress did not 

intend to exclude from that was a tax that discriminates 

against the -- the immediate direct competitors of the 

railroads in a way that would undoubtedly undermine the 

stability of the -- the financial stability and success 

of the railroad.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought the concern was 

that the interstate actors should not be disadvantaged 

vis-à-vis the home people, the local businesses, and 

that was what was achieved.

 But you're -- you are not complaining about 

discrimination against a railroad in comparison to local 

businesses.  You -- you are complaining about that you 

are not getting most-favored-nations treatment vis-à-vis 

other interstate carriers.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  That's -- that's correct, 

Justice Ginsberg, but I think the premise of your -- of 

your question is the place where we would probably 

differ, which is:  To be sure, Congress intended to 

protect interstate carriers against discrimination in 

favor of local operations.  That's clear in (b)(1) 

through (b)(3) and otherwise pervades the legislative

history.

 But there is also a significant amount of 

discussion in that same legislative history to encourage 

intermodal competition; that is, competition between the 

railroads and others, both intrastate and interstate. 

And so it seems to me that the statute that's -- that 

prohibits all discrimination against rail carriers, 

identified as carriers -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose a -- suppose a tax 

were structured so that the same tax applied to 

railroads and -- and -- and motor transport, but because 

of the way the tax was assessed, the railroads paid far 

more per mile than -- than the -- than the road 

transport.  Could the railroad then come in and say: 

Oh, we want to be like the farmers; we are off-road?

 I mean, I can see you making that 

argument -­

MR. PHILLIPS:  I can see us making that 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- in case -- in case 

number two, welcome back.  That's going to be your 

argument.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I always like to come 

back, but I don't -- I think the answer to that is -­

again, I think the -- the Court ought to interpret the

term "discrimination" against the clear objectives that 

Congress intended to fulfill when it protected the 

railroads this way.

 And the two protections that are embedded in 

there is one that Justice Ginsberg identified, which was 

to protect them against local interests in a way where 

they had no political influence, and the other one is to 

protect them against their direct competitors in the 

intermodal competition realm.  And if it's -- if it's a 

discrimination that doesn't achieve either of those, 

then it seems to me you either say they are -- are not 

similarly situated or you would held -- you would hold 

that the State has a legitimate reason for doing what 

it's doing, and that that's just not a discrimination 

within the meaning of the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So -- so 85-year-old widows 

would be covered?  That would be discrimination because, 

you know, there are only resident 85-year-old widows who 

are covered, right?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, they would have -- they 

would be, to be sure, local interests.  But I think the 

problem with this is, and it goes to the core argument 

that the State makes, which is:  How are you supposed to 

define "local business" for these purposes.

 And I don't think the -- the answer to that

is:  I have no way to know that, because Congress didn't 

purport to define the comparison class for purposes of 

(b)(4).  It seems to me that when Congress said "any 

other tax" -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I agree with that, and that 

makes me suspect that Congress didn't -- didn't want to 

forbid exemptions in (b)(4).

 MR. PHILLIPS:  But it seems to me quite -- I 

mean, the flip side of that argument would be to say, if 

they imposed the tax of 4 percent on the railroads and 

2 percent on 85-year-old widows, that would be 

challengeable under (b)(4), because it's not an 

exemption, it's a differential, and that the exemption 

down to zero is -- is attackable under (b)(4).

 It seems to me the right answer to this is, 

there is no reason to include your widow as a relative 

comparison class for purposes of (b)(4) and get out of 

that problem as opposed to setting this up.

 To me, the fallacy of this analysis is to 

try to use exemptions and say that there is something 

special about exemptions beyond the (b)(1), (b)(3) 

context where Congress clearly acted, recognizing that 

it had to protect the States' ability to have exemptions 

for property taxes.

 But then Congress goes to non-property taxes

and to other taxes not covered by (b)(1) and (b)(3). 

Then, it seems to me, you have to -- you just should 

change the analysis.  Look at whether or not similarly 

situated are being treated differently and if there is 

any kind of State justification for that, and if not, go 

through the analysis in the way -- and protect the 

railroads precisely the way that Congress meant for them 

to be protected.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Phillips, are you 

saying that the -- the railroads have to be taxed in the 

very same way as, say, the -- the trucks?  Because one 

answer to your argument is:  Well, they haven't created 

a non-tax situation for the other interstate carriers; 

they are just subject to a different tax.  The motor 

carriers have to pay motor fuel tax.

 So are you saying to the State about that, 

you have to have the same sales tax, use tax, for 

everyone; you can't have a motor fuel tax for one and 

sales tax for the other?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I think, ultimately, my 

conclusion would be that you can't have one -- you can't 

have this kind of a tax on us and not tax the motor 

carriers the same way.  But I do think it's important to 

recognize two considerations, at least as this case 

comes to this Court.

One is that the State and the trial court 

conceded that the appropriate comparison class was the 

motor and water carriers.  So the question of who is 

the -- who is properly in the comparison class has never 

been adjudicated.

 And second, it seems to me that the question 

of what constitutes discrimination is not the issue in 

this case.  The only question in this case is whether 

there is something special about exemptions that makes 

them off-limits to the (b)(4) inquiry.

 So I think, candidly, Justice Ginsburg, 

while I'm quite certain that Alabama and I would 

disagree fundamentally about how to approach this, it 

doesn't seem to me that that's a question that this 

Court should tarry long over, and instead ought to 

simply evaluate the very narrow question that was both 

presented by the holding below and presented in the 

petition as it came through the Solicitor General's 

invitation stage, which again, as I say, very narrowly 

focuses exclusively on exemptions, and of course allow 

us to have them.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, why does the course 

for the court -- taking account of what you said, that 

the provision about other taxes came out very late in 

the day -- they had spent a lot of time talking about

the property tax.  And the property tax, we know, they 

wanted to preserve the exemptions.

 So why not take this latecomer of thought or 

discussion and say:  Well, we'll assume that they want 

to treat that with regard to exemptions the same way 

that they treated property tax, which was the big-ticket 

item.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think part of the 

reason, it may well be because the property tax was a 

big-ticket item, so you were trying to protect certain 

State interests, and Congress did it very clearly.  I 

think it is quite a remarkable stretch of -- of 

construction of the statute for the Court to say, we're 

going to take this very carefully reticulated scheme, 

which creates the inference that Congress meant to 

protect these kinds of exemptions for the States, and 

say we are going to now incorporate that wholesale, when 

Congress didn't use language that in any way compares.

 It didn't include -- it didn't limit it to 

railroad property.  It didn't define a class in any 

particular way, and instead, it basically said, what we 

need here is something that will protect the railroads 

when the States become more innovative and come forward 

with additional problems.

 And we would leave it to the courts,

unfortunately -- I recognize that is not the most 

satisfying solution sometimes, but we will leave it to 

the courts to decide what forms of discrimination we 

would have intended to preclude, because we are here to 

protect the railroads.

 If there are no further questions, I would 

like to reserve the balance of my time.

Phillips.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA A. SHERRY,

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 MS. SHERRY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The only question that the Court needs to 

resolve today is whether a non-property tax that's 

imposed on a rail carrier but from which its competitors 

are exempt can ever be another tax that discriminates 

against a rail carrier under subsection (b)(4).  The 

answer is yes.

 A lot of the Court's questions focus on some 

of the difficulties that are inherent in a 

discrimination inquiry, but as Mr. Phillips pointed out, 

those difficulties are just as inherent in a

discrimination inquiry under (b)(4), whether we are 

talking about exemptions or whether we are talking about 

differential tax rates or whether we are talking about 

any other type of discrimination claim that can be 

brought under (b)(4).  That is the very nature of 

(b)(4):  It broadly prohibits another tax that 

discriminates against a rail carrier, and inherent is 

that is the notion that courts are going to have to 

decide what it means to discriminate.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think we have to 

decide whether the appropriate comparison class is the 

rail carriers' competitors or some broader class?

 MS. SHERRY:  I don't think the Court has to 

decide it.  As Mr. Phillips pointed out, that was an 

issue that was conceded below by the State, at least at 

this stage of the proceedings.  And they acknowledged 

that in note 7 of their brief, so it wasn't something 

that was addressed by the Eleventh Circuit below.

 I think, as the Court wants to address it, 

it should reject the notion that the only comparison 

class in a (b)(4) case, no matter what the (b)(4) case 

looks like, is all other commercial and industrial 

taxpayers.  And I think the Court should reject that 

primarily because that's not what the tax says.

 If you look at the language of (b)(4), it

talks about another tax that discriminates against a 

rail carrier.  Congress easily could have said another 

tax that discriminates against a rail carrier, as 

compared to other commercial and industrial taxpayers, 

and it didn't do that.

 And Justice Ginsburg, to your question 

involving whether we should be focusing on interstate 

versus local businesses and whether that was Congress's 

focus, of course that was -- that was certainly one of 

their concerns, but the reason that doesn't work is if 

you look to even subsections (b)(1) through (3), the 

comparison that is very clearly spelled out there is not 

between local businesses and interstate businesses; it's 

between rail transportation property and other 

commercial and industrial property.

 Now, that other commercial and industrial 

property can be owned by an interstate business like 

Wal-Mart just as easily as it can be owned by a local 

coffee shop, and so I think to suggest that the only 

thing Congress wanted to prohibit was this local 

interstate type of discrimination is not borne out by 

the text.  If you look at subsection (b)(4), we think 

the language speaks for itself.  It speaks broadly of 

another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier.

 Another question that a number of you have

asked is why Congress would want to treat property 

taxes' exemptions differently than non-property tax 

exemptions, and I think the answer has to come from the 

text.

 In ACF, this court concluded that Congress 

did not want to prohibit property tax exemptions based 

on the text of the statute and its structure.  And when 

it comes to non-property taxes, the text of the act and 

the structure of the act simply tell a different story, 

and that has to be the best indicator of what Congress 

intended.

 Again, subsection (b)(4) speaks broadly of 

another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier. 

This court has long recognized that taxes can 

discriminate in a number of different ways, including by 

granting some taxpayers an exemption and not granting 

that exemption to other taxpayers.  That's the ordinary 

meaning of "discriminates," and the broad and 

unqualified language in (b)(4) is easily susceptible to 

that meaning.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Sherry, there seems to 

be a question as to what remedy somebody would be 

entitled to under subsection (c) in the challenge 

brought against a tax exemption.  So what's the 

government's position on that?

MS. SHERRY:  The government's position, 

first with respect to subsection (c), is that it is a 

broad grant of jurisdiction to the district courts to 

adjudicate all violations of subsection (b), and that 

seems clear from the first sentence in that provision.

 I'd also note that the arguments that were 

made with respect to subsection (c) in this case were 

brought up by the government in ACF; and in ACF the 

government explained why the best reading of subsection 

(c) is a broad grant of jurisdiction over all violations 

of subsection (b).  That's clearly what Congress 

intended.

 While Congress intended to provide a 

substantive right for rail carriers to come into court 

and claim discrimination on one of the four -- under one 

of the four subsections, it also intended to provide a 

Federal forum.  And the reason that it did that was 

because at the time, rail carriers were having a very 

hard time bringing claims in the State court.  The Tax 

Injunction Act was out there then, as it is now, and it 

does provide an -- exception, rather -- for when State 

court remedies are not plain, speedy, and efficient.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I think Justice Kagan 

meant to ask, assuming that we say yes, it -- it 

applies; exemptions don't count -- are included in

whether there is discrimination, and the Court finds 

discrimination between the way the railroad is taxed and 

the way motor carriers are taxed, what -- what then? 

What is the remedy?

 MS. SHERRY:  I think in that type of case 

the remedy would be for the rail carrier to be exempt 

from the tax, and that's because what subsection (c) 

provides -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Without -- without 

putting on -- I mean, the motor carriers do have the 

tax.

 MS. SHERRY:  Oh, I apologize.  I should back 

up.  I am assuming that when you said that the Court 

found that there was discrimination, the Court had 

already engaged in inquiry as to whether or not this 

other tax compensates for or provides a justification 

for any differential treatment.

 If the -- the Court were to find 

discrimination but find that maybe, you know, 50 percent 

of the tax was compensated by this other tax, it could 

remedy that situation by only enjoining, and it should 

remedy the situation by only enjoining, the 

discriminatory portion of the tax.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well -- well, but in 

any case when you have discrimination, you can remedy it

by reducing the tax, for example, in this case on the 

railroad or by increasing the tax on the people who are 

otherwise exempt.

 MS. SHERRY:  And I don't -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  A decision that I 

suppose would be left at some point or another up to the 

State.

 MS. SHERRY:  It would certainly be left up 

to the State and the State could choose to remedy it 

in -- in any number of different ways, including the one 

that Your Honor suggests, but the remedy that is 

actually provided for in subsection (c) for the Federal 

court to issue is to enjoin the discriminatory portion 

of the tax, and the focus is on the tax -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the 

discriminary -- the discriminary portion of the tax may 

be regarded as the excess that is imposed on the 

railroad or the deficiency on -- on the others.

 MS. SHERRY:  I -- I think it's better 

understood as -- as -- as speaking specifically to the 

tax itself, and not to the tax exemption.  And in fact, 

in the -- at the cert stage when the government 

suggested a reformulated question presented, it 

reformulated the question to better focus on the fact 

that this is a challenge to a discriminatory tax and not

to a discriminatory tax exemption.

 And I think the State in -- in its 

supplemental brief at the cert stage acknowledged that 

is the better way and correct way, in fact, to look at 

these type of challenges and what the appropriate remedy 

would be.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You present the case to us 

as if it's either/or:  That we must either in 

disagreement with your position, to say that it doesn't 

apply to exemptions; or if it applies to exemptions, it 

must be remanded.  Can we say that the exemptions are 

not covered by the act unless the railroad is a target 

of an -- an isolated target and it's clear that it's 

discriminatory?

 I mean, do we have to have your either/or 

position?

 MS. SHERRY:  I -- I don't know that the 

Court has to -- has to go with one or the other, but I 

think the Court should not hold that it only applies to 

exemptions to the -- to the extent it's the type of tax 

where it's generally applicable on its face, but 

everyone is exempt except for the rail carriers, or 

everyone is exempt except for the rail carriers and 

maybe some targeted and isolated group, as - as this 

Court recognized in ACF.

And the reason I think that is so is because 

that's what the language provides in (b)(4).  Certainly 

Congress was concerned with taxes that would single out 

a rail carrier, but that wasn't their only concern.  And 

an example that I've thought of but I think helps put 

that into some perspective is:  I think Alabama would 

concede that if instead of imposing a generally 

applicable sales tax, it had a separate excise tax on 

diesel fuel for use in locomotives, and it was a 4 

percent tax, looks exactly like the one we are looking 

at, except it is an a separate excise tax, that that 

would be the type of singled-out tax that could be 

challenged under (b)(4).

 And it makes little sense that they -- that 

a State could basically insert that type of tax into a 

generally applicable sales tax and that would be 

immunized from any scrutiny.  The adverse economic 

impact on the rail carriers is the same whether you are 

looking at a singled-out tax or whether you are looking 

at a generally applicable -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't make any -- any 

sense, you are quite right; but -- but Congress thought 

it made sense in (1) to (3), so why doesn't it make 

sense in (4)?

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the argument.

 MS. SHERRY:  I think the reason that 

Congress thought it made sense in (1) through (3) and 

the reason that this Court in ACF concluded that 

Congress wanted to permit property tax exemptions is 

because of the language of (1), (2) -- (1) through (3), 

and because of the very specific comparison class that 

is provided there.  That is noticeably absent from 

(b)(4), and in fact wouldn't really work in (b)(4).

 And what I mean by that is if you look at 

(b)(1) and you look at (b)(3), it's a comparison between 

transportation rail property on the one hand and 

commercial and industrial property on the other; and as 

we all know, commercial and industrial property is 

specifically defined to -- may I finish?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can finish the 

sentence.

 MS. SHERRY:  I don't know if I will get to 

the point, but suffice it to say -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Use a lot of conjunctions.

 (Laughter.)

 MS. SHERRY:  I'm not surprised.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Don't even try.

 MS. SHERRY:  The point is:  (B)(4) doesn't 

talk about property; it talks about discrimination

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF COREY L. MAZE

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. MAZE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Justice Kennedy, you hit on the proper 

definition of a tax that discriminates in this case.  A 

tax that discriminates under (b)(1), (2), and (3) is a 

tax that singles out railroads as compared to the 

general mass of taxpayers.  So another tax that 

discriminates is a tax that singles out railroads as 

compared to the general mass of taxpayers.

 The pivotal question in this case is the one 

raised by Justice Kagan and Justice Scalia, and that is: 

Why in the world would Congress, on the one hand, say 

you can exempt property taxes under this statute, but 

you can't -- you -- we are prohibiting sales and use tax 

exemptions, when for 15 years Congress never had a 

single hearing, a single study, and never even heard a 

single complaint from the railroads about discriminatory 

sales and use taxes?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it may be because

the universe of non-property taxes is -- so infinitely 

large that there's a much greater room for -- a much 

great danger of discrimination.  We know all States have 

property taxes.

 MR. MAZE:  Right.  But again, I think the 

answer is what Justice Ginsberg was pointing out, that 

we would say the United States and CSX still has not 

come up with a good reason.  They basically said -- the 

United States said, you just look at the statute and it 

tells a different story.

 There are three good reasons that Congress 

would have intended, and the Court should read property 

tax exemptions and non-property tax exemptions to be 

read the same way, and the first one is the one that 

Justice Ginsberg was pointing out:  The purpose of the 

statute was to protect out-of-State, interstate 

businesses from being easy prey in the State 

legislature.  They don't have voting power.

 But if you put an interstate business in the 

generally applicable tax scheme, that means they are 

paying the same tax as the local businesses and local 

taxpayers.  They are protected.  If the tax rate goes 

up, the local businesses, the local taxpayers, will 

protect them.  If too many exemptions occur, the local 

taxpayers and the local businesses will protect them.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you are arguing in 

favor of -- you are arguing in favor of a very 

idiosyncratic interpretation of the concept of a 

discriminatory tax, aren't you?

 In almost any other context, granting tax 

exemptions to one group but denying them to another 

group would be viewed as -- if there isn't a good reason 

for drawing the distinction, as discrimination, wouldn't 

it?

 MR. MAZE:  Yes.  I definitely agree, as an 

abstract matter, an exemption could be a tax that 

discriminates.  But what Congress has told us in (1) 

through (3) with regard to property taxes is you can 

grant an exemption, and Congress didn't want to -- and 

they also told us -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  And it did so with explicit 

language by -- in -- what is it -- (a)(4), by referring 

to property that is subject to a property tax levy.

 MR. MAZE:  Right.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So what you're saying is 

that the ordinary interpretation of the concept of a 

discriminatory tax should not be applied here, because 

Congress used specific language to take tax exemptions 

out of the determination of discrimination under other 

provisions.

JUSTICE ALITO:  What sense does that make?

 MR. MAZE:  I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What sense does that make? 

The fact that they specifically took it out of some 

provisions but not out of this provision, you think, 

leads to the implication that they meant to put it in 

here, too, where they could have easily used language 

here to put it in.

 MR. MAZE:  Right.  Well, I would say that 

Congress wasn't even thinking about non-property tax 

exemptions when they wrote before.

 But the answer is:  Our argument is to say 

that we understand from the structure of the statute as 

a whole that Congress didn't intend to preempt the 

State's ability to issue tax exemptions.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me.  May I pose a 

hypothetical so that I understand?  And I think it 

follows up on what Justice Alito was saying.

 Let's assume all taxes are equal between 

water carriers and railroads, except there is an excise 

tax:  4 percent on the railroads, 2 percent on the water 

carriers.

 MR. MAZE:  Right.

4 percent.  On your theory, is that discrimination or 

not?

 MR. MAZE:  No, because they are paying a 

generally applicable 4 percent tax.  Again, remember, in 

the property tax -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But this is not an 

exemption area, so what meaning do you give -- that's 

what I'm trying to figure out.  Are you saying -- what 

meaning are you giving to discrimination at all, other 

than -- unless we accept that the class always has to be 

the commercial class?

 MR. MAZE:  I'm giving the meaning the same 

meaning that the Court suggested in ACF; that is, (b)(4) 

is a tax.  Another tax that discriminates is one that 

singles out the railroads.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you can single 

out the railroads through exemptions.  I mean, let's say 

you have a tax of $1,000 per mile per day for anything 

that uses a thoroughfare in the State.  However, things 

that use roads, waterways, you know, the long list that 

in effect leaves only the railroads exposed.

 You are saying that can't be regarded as a 

tax that discriminates against the railroads?

 MR. MAZE:  I'm saying that a tax that in 

effect, in the end, singles out the railroads because

they are the only ones that pay it; that would be 

discrimination.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So what if 

there's only two that pay it?  Only -- and it applies 

only to railroads and bicycles?

 MR. MAZE:  Well, then again, the tax 

wouldn't be generally applicable.  This is what the 

Court went over in ACF.  In this case, the parties 

agreed -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We can determine 

that a tax is not generally applicable based on the 

exemptions.  If everybody else is exempt, well, it's not 

generally applicable.  If just bicycles are also exempt, 

then it is not generally applicable.  We have to look at 

the exemptions to decide whether there is 

discrimination.

 MR. MAZE:  No.  Actually, you are not 

supposed to look at the exemptions at all.  If you think 

about property taxes, when you have a generally 

applicable property tax, exemptions are removed from the 

comparison class.  All you are looking at are the 

businesses that pay the tax.  In that case, as long as 

the businesses that pay the tax are paying the same 

rate -­

businesses, where does the line between singling out the 

railroad get drawn?  When they exempt 98?  When they 

exempt 97?  When they exempt 95, or is it at 80?  Where 

do we draw the singling out?  If the State says the 

general tax is 4 percent, but everybody -- but how many 

are exempted?

 MR. MAZE:  Well, again, I would say that you 

use the phrase -- see, I know that singling out is not 

the best answer, but the lower courts have looked at it. 

We have seen cases where even 80 percent -- as long as 

20 percent of the businesses in the State are paying it, 

it's generally applicable.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What sense would there 

be for Congress to use the word "discriminate" and 

intend, in the hypothetical I gave you earlier, that 

railroads will pay 4 percent like everyone else, but 

their competitors, for no reason other than that the 

State wants to favor the water carrier, is only paying 

2 percent?  What -- what conceivable reason would 

Congress want that differential to exist?

 MR. MAZE:  Because Congress understood that 

exemptions for individual businesses -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not talking about an 

exemption.  I'm talking about a rate difference.

difference, a benefit of any kind to an individual 

business, Congress understood that that is important to 

the State.

 Let's say, for example, we had a business 

who's has had an economic crisis or we want to bring a 

new business into the State.  Congress understood that 

is important to the State tax policy.  The point of the 

statute was simply to put the railroads on equal 

footing.

 Again, if you think back to property taxes, 

we can treat trucks however we want to.  We could exempt 

them.  We can treat them at a different rate.  As long 

as the railroads are paying an equal rate to the general 

mass, it's not discrimination.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So it's a commodity that is 

purchased by only railroads and one other class, and 

there is a 4 percent sales tax on this commodity, but 

the other class is exempt from the tax.  Now, is that -­

is that discrimination against the railroad?

 MR. MAZE:  Can you explain the classes 

again?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Let's say there is some 

commodity that is purchased only by railroads and 

truckers, and there is a 4 percent tax on the commodity, 

but truckers are exempt from it -- from the tax.

Is that discrimination against the railroad, 

even though it takes the form of -- it's not 

discrimination against the railroad because it takes the 

form of a tax exemption?

 MR. MAZE:  No.  Again, in that instance, 

like the Court said in ACF, that would be a case in 

which the railroads had been singled out, because only 

two businesses were paying the tax.  One has been 

exempted; then the railroads are only one left paying 

it.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Once you say that, your 

argument that exemptions can't count as discrimination 

is destroyed, because you are conceding that an 

exemption can constitute discrimination.

 MR. MAZE:  At that point, as the Court said 

in ACF, it's not an exemption scheme anymore.  At this 

point, it's just a tax on the railroads.  Again, there 

is no reason in the text or the structure or the history 

of the act to treat property taxes any differently than 

sales and use taxes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then you need to give us a 

test, and the test is whether or not the railroad is 

singled out as a target group for discrimination.

 MR. MAZE:  Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Something like that -- for

discrimination, something like that.

 MR. MAZE:  And that's the test that just 

Judge Posner gave in the ACF case.  That's the test that 

the Court suggested in ACF.  That's the test that the 

Eleventh Circuit used here.  You know, one of the 

problems -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Just so 

I follow:  And that test says what?

 MR. MAZE:  The test is -- as long as it is a 

generally applicable tax that does not single out or 

target the railroads, it is not subject to challenge. 

In fact, the Court -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sure I'm just 

repeating myself here.  So that it doesn't single it out 

if there's one additional business or line of business 

subject to the tax, no matter how small that exemption 

is?

 MR. MAZE:  You mean how small the business 

is that is actually paying the tax?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.

 MR. MAZE:  That's a question for the 

Court -- excuse me, choked.  That would be a question 

for the Court, yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Exactly.  So the 

Court has to decide, even when you are dealing with

exemptions, whether or not that discriminates against 

the railroad?

 MR. MAZE:  Right.  But it's the same test.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If I'm right, that 

means you lose the case -­

MR. MAZE:  No.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- at least as the 

question presented has been addressed, because all we 

are deciding -- I understand you think we ought to 

decide more, but all we are deciding is:  Can (b)(4) 

ever come into play when the discrimination arises from 

an exemption?

 MR. MAZE:  No.  The question presented 

precisely is whether a State's exemptions of rail 

carrier competitors, but not rail carriers, from a 

generally applicable sales and use tax.  In this case, 

we've already presumed that the fact has been 

established that this a generally applicable tax.  The 

Eleventh Circuit has already made that determination. 

CSX and the United States agree with it.  There is no 

question in this case that it is generally applicable.

 The only question is:  Under the test we 

have just articulated, does it single out the railroads? 

No.  Everybody agrees it's a generally applicable tax. 

Thus, as a matter of law, it cannot be another tax that

discriminates.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So to answer that 

question, you are telling us that we have to define what 

discrimination means?

 MR. MAZE:  I think inherently you have to 

understand what another tax that discriminates is before 

you can say whether something is subject to challenge as 

another tax that discriminates.

 One of Justice Scalia's points earlier was 

to Mr. Phillips, there is no limiting principle if you 

treat property tax exemptions differently than 

non-property taxes, and not only can they change the 

comparison class, the railroads do.  They will argue 

against the States' different comparison classes.  Take 

Justice Kennedy's example:  If the local farmers are 

exempt, they would argue that that is discrimination 

against interstate commerce; again, the phrase Congress 

used to bind the four together.

 We've had cases at the same time that 

Burlington Northern was arguing the diesel fuel cases on 

an interstate competitor class.  They turned around at 

the same time in Wyoming and argued that a coal 

transportation tax is discriminatory because it singled 

them out versus -­

railroads do.

 MR. MAZE:  Sure.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it still doesn't 

get to the question that in courts in each particular 

case will be able to decide, even under your test, 

whether it singles out railroads.

 The only question I have is that whether 

singling out means railroads have to be the only 

business subject to it, or if it has to be, you know, 

some theory -- Justice Kennedy was looking for a test. 

I don't know if we have got a workable one -- to decide 

when it's really discriminating against the railroad and 

when it's that the exceptions are just the way 

taxes normally work.

 MR. MAZE:  And, again, if we adopt a test, 

which we believe is the right test, the Eleventh Circuit 

has already done it in this case.  This would be a 

question for another case.  Again, there is no more 

generally applicable tax than Alabama's 4 percent sales 

and use tax.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Haven't you just pushed all 

the difficult questions into the word "generally 

applicable"?  I imagine a fuel tax applies to everybody 

in the State, but then we exempt everybody who does 

business in the State with fuel.

MR. MAZE:  Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Except for railroads.

 MR. MAZE:  Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right, now.  You want 

to call that not a generally applicable class?  Do you 

want to call it a discrimination against railroads?  It 

seems to me about the same question.

 MR. MAZE:  Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So why isn't 

the easiest thing to say, since there's so many other 

questions involved in discrimination:  Yes, the clause 

applies?  What counts is a discrimination is an 

obviously difficult question, and we will send it back 

for somebody else to wrestle with this, since it's so 

difficult.

 MR. MAZE:  Here's the problem the State has 

with that -- and you almost channelled what Mr. Phillips 

said earlier -- that we leave it to courts to determine 

discrimination.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What is the choice?

 MR. MAZE:  Well, this is a State tax.  Under 

the clear statement rule -- we detrimentally rely on 

these statutes when we determine whether we can tax 

someone or not.  Now, you know, if the courts were to 

say, you can't prospectively tax because you lose,

that's one thing, but we have taxed the railroads for 

years -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  I realize that, but what 

they are worried about is somebody that's having passed 

on the property level -­

MR. MAZE:  Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- thinks I have a great 

revenue-raising idea.  What we do is tax the New York 

Central, and then they sit down with a bunch of lawyers 

and the lawyers say:  Oh, great, they come through this 

State; what we'll do is we'll have a tax that applies to 

all fuel and then we will exempt everybody except the 

New York Central.  All right.  Great.

 We've now found a replacement of the revenue 

that they just said in Congress we couldn't have in the 

first three provisions.

 MR. MAZE:  Right.  And, again, that would be 

the test that we've talked about -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, because you're saying 

that's not generally applicable.  They are saying sure 

it is, read the first line, applies to everybody.

 You say no, no, no.  That's a trick because 

of the second line.  So now what we will do is we'll 

monkey around with it a little bit.  And we will make it 

tough.

All I'm saying is that's precisely the same 

question in that context as whether it's discriminates 

or not.  I'm not saying it's an easy question.  I'm just 

saying it might be clearer if we said, yes, the thing 

applies, now go work out the hard question of whether 

you had have got a discriminatory tax.

 MR. MAZE:  And -- and, again, the problem we 

would have with that is now you are going to have two 

different definitions of what another tax that 

discriminates in (b)(4) for property taxes, which CSX 

agreed applies to property taxes -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  The property taxes, the 

language is different.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I didn't understand your 

last answer.  What was it?

 MR. MAZE:  CSX argues on page 8 and 9 of the 

reply brief that with regard to property taxes (b)(4) 

would apply if the tax singles out the railroads.  But 

now they are arguing another tax that discriminates, the 

very same phrase means any differential treatment of any 

kind when it comes to non-property taxes.  To agree that 

the test would be different is not only not clearly 

required by the statute, it would be illogical, because 

what happens is, you can have an infinitely broad 

definition of discriminate.  Any treatment that we do

differently for non-property taxes is discrimination, 

which not only does it make note -- the most favored 

taxpayer, they might as well be considered charities, 

billion dollar charities.  We could -- we could never 

tax them at all, because we exempt someone from every 

single tax we levy.  For example -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  You are assuming how the 

Court will decide the word "discriminate."

 MR. MAZE:  Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I understand what you are 

saying, and so would every other judge.  And of course, 

it's hard to figure out in these contexts what is real 

discrimination, but there could be obvious cases.  And 

so why cut out the obvious cases simply because it's 

hard in a non-obvious case to figure it out?

 MR. MAZE:  Because Congress didn't clearly 

put in the statute that we want a different definition 

for discrimination when we have one.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  There is no way -- there is 

no way with the property -- the property tax is tough. 

And once you start taking exemptions into account, it's 

double tough, and there is very little need, is there? 

Every State in the country has property taxes and every 

State in the country has property taxes on businesses.

 MR. MAZE:  Right.

JUSTICE BREYER:  And -- and it might not be 

so that every State in the country has particular taxes 

on diesel fuel.  And it might be that they don't have 

taxes on rails, or it might be that they -- you see? 

So, I -- I -- that's how I am explaining to myself. 

What do you think?

 MR. MAZE:  I think that if -- well, first of 

all, every State taxes diesel, at least for truckers, 

and most do for the trains.  But if Congress was 

thinking about this, they should have told us what 

discriminate means.  And I think that -- honestly, I 

think we should go across the street and have them tell 

us.  But -- but they are not here and what we are saying 

is the easiest way to do this and the proper way to do 

it is simply to read the test to be the same as property 

for non-property taxes.

 If the test is single out railroads when you 

are talking about property taxes, it should be the same. 

Again, the point would be, we can't tax at all 

non-property taxes, at all if the definition literally 

is, any differential treatment.  Congress never would 

have intended to literally prohibit States from 

taxing -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's not quite -- it's

which is without a reason.  Now, the other side hasn't 

defined what a legitimate reason would be.  And that's a 

separate inquiry.  But if there is a -- some form of 

legitimate reason to treat people differently, I think 

the other side is saying that's okay.

you that we can't give a justification.  Again, (b)(1)

know, we don't know how to tax anymore.  I don't know 

why it's any more certain if we -- if we say the key is 

whether it's a generally applicable tax than it is if we 

say the key is whether it discriminates against 

railroads.  I mean it's the same inquiry.  So what do 

you care?  It's just as -- just as unpredictable 

ex ante.  It's exactly the same inquiry, whether it's 

generally applicable or whether it discriminates against 

railroads.  Isn't -- isn't -- isn't that what you have 

been saying?

 MR. MAZE:  What I have been saying, yes, a 

tax doesn't discriminate -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, it's twiddle dum or

improvidently granted, it doesn't make any difference.

 MR. MAZE:  I -- I would have no problem if 

you dismiss it improvidently granted.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MAZE:  I would certainly accept that. 

And, again, if the test is the same, the Eleventh 

Circuit has already answered the question.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but it's not quite, 

because this is the same problem I was raising.  You 

just shoved the difficult questions into generally 

applicable.  But you might think of some new ways of

doing it that they don't want.  So I would worry about 

giving you just the decision where the word in the 

statute is "discriminate," and nowhere does it say 

"generally applicable."  I'd somewhat worry about 

whether this statute shoves the same problems into two 

words that aren't there as to rather leaving those 

problems for resolution under the one word that is 

there.

 MR. MAZE:  The -- the statute actually does 

use the word "generally applicable."  If you turn to 

page 25 of the joint appendix -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'll believe you, I'll 

believe you.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MAZE:  Well, but it makes a good point 

in the original version of (b)(3), you could not levy a 

tax against a leveler property tax at a tax rate higher 

than the tax rate generally -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  The word -- the word I was 

looking at was is 4, impose another tax that 

discriminates against a rail carrier providing 

transportation, subject to the jurisdiction of the board 

under this part.  Now, I read all the words of 4, and I 

found the word "discriminates," and I did not find the 

two words "generally applicable."

MR. MAZE:  Right.  And you will find the 

word "discriminate" at the beginning of each of these 

section as well, saying each of these discriminate 

against interstate commerce, meaning they all 

discriminate in the same manner.

 Again, if you think about it, when you have 

a specific provision or several specific provisions 

followed by a general, you have to give some independent 

effect to the specific provision.

 Here's the problem with CSX's argument, the 

independent effect that they are giving (b)(1), (2), and 

(3) for property taxes is that they are narrowing the 

prohibition on discriminatory property taxes from the 

infinitely broad anything goes discrimination test for 

all property taxes, which again is illogical when the 

only thing Congress talked about for 15 years was 

discriminatory property taxes.  The only -­

it is hard to have exact equality in terms of ad valorem

-- you know, a 5 percent legal room.

 MR. MAZE:  Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Couldn't you, if we 

rule against you, when you get back and other State 

officials say, look, the one thing we don't have to 

worry about is being precise.  We have got some legal 

room, so we can exempt the 85-year-old widow, we can, 

you know, exempt the farm property.  We just kind of 

have to get it close so that if somebody looks at it, 

and they'll say, well, it doesn't really look like they 

are discriminating against railroads, why isn't that 

pertinent and why doesn't it respond to a lot of your 

concerns?

 MR. MAZE:  Textually that's a problem 

because the 5 percent in it only applies to assessment 

ratio problems in (b)(1) and (b)(2), and the rest -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I know.  I'm 

using that not as saying that this is applicable to 

(b)(4), but that it gives you an idea that Congress 

didn't have the precise absolute rule, and you go one, 

you know, 1 inch over the line and you are in trouble.

 MR. MAZE:  I -- I don't think at that point 

the courts have any idea what they can do.  What -- what 

how does a State know what is over the line and what's 

not?  I mean, now we know as long as we subject them to

 MR. MAZE:  Because I know that everyone who 

pays the diesel fuel tax pays 4 percent.  It generally 

applies to everyone.  A -- a problem that you have with 

subsection (c), again, and that the United States and 

CSX has avoided so far is it is a jurisdictional 

problem, and it has been raised as by one of our amici.

we obviously don't agree that there is, it says that no 

relief can be granted unless have you an assessment 

value problem of plus or 5 minus percent.

(b)(4), the whole point is if it's not a property tax, 

you don't have ad valorem assessments, so the details 

limiting jurisdiction when you do have ad valorem taxes 

don't apply to this case at all.

 MR. MAZE:  The problem with that is -- that 

is CSX's argument -- is now you are reading into 

Congress's intent for the statute and the moment you 

open up to what Congress's intent for the statute is, we 

know that Congress didn't intend to make railroads the 

most favored taxpayers in any way.  The railroads 

actually said that themselves.  If you start reading 

intent into the statute, the intent was simply to put 

them on equal footing.  So you would have to read (b)(4) 

to say, just like property taxes, and non-property taxes 

as long as they are subject to a generally applicable 

tax there is no discrimination, you are not subject to 

challenge.  So again, I don't think that would -- would 

be an issue.

 Now one of the problems I see that the Court 

has is this fear that the States are going to take a 

generally applicable tax and then all of a sudden start 

exempting everyone.  Let's say, for example the State of 

Alabama sales and use tax.  It's not going to happen for 

a very simple reason.  Our sales and use tax funds our 

schools.  At the moment we start exempting every single

business, our schools don't have any money.  We are not 

going to pick on the railroads by exempting, exempting, 

exempting, exempting.  The railroads, quite honestly, 

can't fund our schools.  We are having a hard enough 

time funding them as it is, and we are not going to just 

target railroads by exemption.  So I see that the Court 

might have a problem understanding what's the line with 

exemptions, but it's just never going to happen.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  How are these any different 

from property taxes?  I mean States could say the same 

thing about property taxes.  Nonetheless it was felt 

necessary to specify that -- that exemptions don't 

count.

 MR. MAZE:  Right.  But -- but -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Before deciding whether or 

not you are discriminating against the railroads.

 MR. MAZE:  Again, because Congress 

understood that exemptions are a -- an integral part of 

the State's tax policy.  We need to be able to give 

exemptions to individual businesses.  This is -­

MR. MAZE:  No.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it doesn't really 

matter that it's a tax exemption; you are just saying if 

the tax is a positive imposition or a negative one, 

taking someone out, it doesn't matter.

 MR. MAZE:  Right, because that's the way it 

works for property taxes.  Let me be very clear what we 

are asking the Court to hold.  On page 335 of ACF, this 

is what the Court held in that case:  A State may grant 

exemptions from a generally applicable ad valorem 

property tax without subjecting the taxation of railroad 

property to challenge under (b)(4).  All we are asking 

the Court to do in this case is substitute three words. 

Ad valorem property is out; sales and use tax is in.

 There is nothing in the language, the 

structure or history of the Act that would suggest, much 

less clearly and manifestly mandate, which is necessary 

under the clear statement rule, that that rule should be 

any different.  Again, it would be illogical because it 

would be illogical to think that Congress spent 15 years 

worried about one problem and that problem is, is the 

States were discriminating in property taxes.

 But there is one clear, easy way to see that 

the railroads didn't really believe that this was a 

clear statement against generally applicable sales and

use taxes.

 The point was made earlier, the railroads 

will sue us all of the time to save money.  It's very 

telling that the railroads didn't sue any State, despite 

we have been taxing this way since the 1930s, until the 

late 80s or early 90s under this theory, because even 

they when they read this statute, understood it to mean 

only if we are singled out or targeted.  That's the way 

they litigated (b)(4) for the first decade.  It's only 

when they couldn't win those cases any more that they 

changed what they believed it meant.

 But the fact that this was able -- again 

sales and use taxes is their most expensive tax.  And as 

they say in the -- in the Norfolk Southern opinion, the 

third largest expenditure of the railroads is diesel 

fuel.  If the third largest expenditure of the railroads 

is out there to be taken away -- the taxes, they 

certainly would have sued us within the first 10 years 

if this statute clearly said we couldn't do it.  But 

nobody believed that is what the statute said, because 

Congress never said it in the entire 15-year history. 

The statute itself when you read it doesn't say it.

 Just as the Court said in ACF, this statute 

is at best vague on the point of tax exemptions.  And in 

that case, under the clear statement rule, you have to

defer to the State.  Congress needs to tell us 

specifically what we can and can't do.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- what authority do 

you have for the proposition that the clear statement 

rule applies to the exercise of the congressional power 

under the Commerce Clause?  Is that -­

MR. MAZE:  A -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- some general rule that 

we've always had?

 MR. MAZE:  ACF actually applied the clear 

statement rule, not only said it applied, it said it 

compelled the ruling in this case.  The -- I'm sorry, 

I've got the page number?  In ACF, you said it was -­

sorry -- I drew a blank all of a sudden.

 Regardless, it's in ACF, the Court said 

that -- I'm sorry, it's page 345 of ACF.  The Court 

said -- "absent unambiguous evidence" was one of the 

quotes, and then at the end it said, you have to show 

Congress's clear and manifest purpose; and the Court 

said because you can't see a clear and manifest purpose, 

because there is no unambiguous evidence -- again, 

because the statute doesn't talk about tax exemptions at 

all.

where they never challenged it, did all these other

States not only tax their diesel fuel, but at the same 

time exempt the diesel fuel tax from all their 

competitors.

 MR. MAZE:  Absolutely.  We have been doing 

it since the 1930s.  As you'll see in -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  What's the rationale, that 

the trucks don't have to say it but the railroads do?

 MR. MAZE:  Because Federal law makes us do 

it.  Federal law taxes diesel fuel differently on road, 

and they makes us -- die -- fuel off-road.  And because 

they're taxed differently at the Federal level, the 

States have had to adopt it.  In fact the 

Hayden-Cartwright Act up until the 1980s forced us to do 

so.

 So we have been doing this since the 1930s. 

Congress obviously knew we were doing it when we wrote 

the "four R" Act.  And yet nobody ever complained. 

Congress knew exactly -­

Just a -- a few quick points.  First of all, 

with respect to the reason why the States didn't 

challenge these tax exemptions earlier; for some of us 

it's relatively easy to remember what the price of fuel 

oil was back in the 1970s, it was somewhere in the sort 

of 10 to 30 cents a gallon range.  Therefore exemptions 

of that amount of tax, 1 percent exemption of that 

amount of tax is not a whole lot of money.  Today the 

rates are $4 a gallon, and an exemption under those 

circumstances, particularly when you have a fixed rate 

for your major competitor, gives you a more than 

substantial incentive to bring an action under these 

circumstances.

 The notion that somehow the -- the State has 

gone down this path because of Federal law has not been 

true for at least 15 years.  That statute was repealed 

and Alabama could have modified its tax however it 

wanted to and chose not to do so.

 Justice Alito, your hypothetical I think is 

almost exactly this case, because as my friend 

indicated, diesel fuel is by far the biggest expense 

that the railroads have.  It's also a very significant 

expense for the motor carriers, and it is a pretty 

trivial expense for everybody else in the -- in the 

State of Alabama.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Phillips, do you agree 

that -- that, generally applicable produces the same -­

requires the same inquiry as discriminates?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, you're ultimately going 

to have to come down to the same issue, and the problem 

is, and I -- the reason why I -- I find it hard to 

accept Justice Kennedy's formulation, which is simply 

singling out the railroads, because in ACF the Court 

sort of said well, we will hold that out as a 

possibility.  If you're doing -- you know, it would be 

one thing if you are just singling them out.

 But it seems to me that in a statute like 

(b)(4), where you -- where you are more broadly, and you 

don't have the (b)(1) to (b)(3) baggage to deal with 

property taxes, the idea that you would then limit 

(b)(4) solely to the situation of singling out is -- is 

simply not a fair way to characterize it.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So give me a definition 

of discriminate.  Give me your working -- it can't -- as 

I started to ask your adversary, it can't be most 

favored taxpayer status.  True?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  It has to be that -­

the traditional and common understanding of discriminate 

is that you treat similarly situated individuals 

differently without -- with an adequate justification.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what constitutes an 

adequate justification?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it depends on the -­

it's going to depend on the tax, and I don't know the 

answer in this context, because as Justice Alito's 

question reveals -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well -­

MR. PHILLIPS:  -- it could be that the vast 

majority of diesel fuel is -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Stop.

 You are going to grant an exemption; you are 

going to treat someone differently because you are 

favoring them for a reason.  People don't -- States 

don't do these willy-nilly.  Either some enterprises or 

some individuals, like the 85-year-old widow, you are 

sympathetic to her.  You want to encourage your water 

transport, because it's an industry that is nascent in 

your State and you want it to grow, so it's a 

pro-competition reason.  Are those legitimate?  And if 

those are -­

MR. PHILLIPS:  I -- the first one I think 

without question.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- what isn't?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I think the second one has 

more of a problem, because I don't think Congress

intended to allow to you favor direct competitors of the 

railroads when the ultimate effect of that may be to 

undermine the -- the financial stability of the 

railroads.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Give me a working 

principle.  What does -- how do you define legitimate 

and illegitimate, assuming -­

MR. PHILLIPS:  I would define.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The government reason is 

always going to be premised on wanting to favor someone 

for a reason.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  I think ultimately 

the way to analyze this is case is what was Congress's 

ultimate objective.  And if the state is putting forward 

a legitimate reason that is fully consistent with 

Congress's overall objective, then there is no problem.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That is the problem 

because there were two objectives.  One was to promote 

equality with local businesses and the other to promote 

equality -­

MR. PHILLIPS:  Competition among carriers.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Which suggests to me that 

there are two ways to worry about discrimination.  Have

treatment?  There I think if the answer is per se, if 

you do that you lose.  And if you are not in that world 

and you are talking about some other classes, then it 

seems to me it depends on how far you want to go in 

terms of how much of an exemption you want to play.

 But the important part of this is still and 

I think the questions to Mr. Maze reflected is that you 

should undertake the inquiry to determine whether there 

is discrimination even if the State happens to use the 

guise of exemptions as opposed to rate differentials or 

anything else.

 There is nothing special about exemptions 

that takes it off the table.  It proposes the Federalism 

concerns and that ACF spoke to this issue.  ACF said you 

should not extend the statute beyond its evident reach 

reflecting the (b)(1), (b)(3) and (b)(4) relationship 

without a clear statement.  That's not what we have in 

this case, Your Honor.
