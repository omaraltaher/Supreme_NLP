consolidated case, 7073, Gould v. United States. 

 Mr. Horan. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. HORAN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 09-7073 

 MR. HORAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

 The statutory interpretation question here 

is what laws trigger section 924(c)(1)(A)'s "except" 

clause.  Mr. Gould offers an interpretation that gives 

meaning and effect to every word and phrase of section 

924(c)(1)(A) and that follows this Court's recent 

holdings regarding the broad scope of the phrase "any 

other provision of law." 

 The government, on the other hand, advocates 

19 

a narrow construction that is not supported by the text 

20

21 

22 

23

and defends it primarily on the basis that section 

924(c) supposedly should always produce the most severe 

mandatory minimum sentence for every defendant. 

 Respectfully, the government's 

24 

interpretation is incorrect.  Its reading gives no 

25

practical effect to the phrase "any other provision of 

4

law," and the government has not cited and has yet to 

even attempt to distinguish this Court's recent 

interpretation of the very same phrase, "any other 

provision of law," in Republic of Iraq v. Beaty just 

last year. 

 Unlike the government's, Mr. Gould's 

interpretation is true to the text; it is true to this 

Court's holdings; and it's true to Congress's evident 

purpose in 924(c)(1)(A), and in particular in its 

"except" clause. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if the text of this is 

so clear, how is it that Mr. Gould and Mr. Abbott 

propose different interpretations of this provision? 

 MR. HORAN:  Your Honor, as a judicial 

matter, I would note that I think our interpretations 

16 

are not that far apart.  But -­

17

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But they are not the same, 

18 

are they? 

19

20

21 

22 

23

 MR. HORAN:  They are not.  And our 

interpretation, we believe, is the closest to the actual 

text.  Our interpretation requires reading no language 

into the text.  It -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't there -- isn't it -­

24 

there is a missing prepositional phrase in this -- in 

25

the provision that we are looking at? 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1

2 

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8

 It says, "except to the extent that a 

greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided."  For 

what?  And all of you have to -- are filling in the 

prepositional phrase.  For an offense of conviction, 

for -- for an offense that's part of the --of the 

underlying transaction, for a violation of this 

particular provision or one that's very similar to it. 

 There is just no way of getting around the 

9 

fact that something has to be read in there.  Something 

10

11

12 

13 

14 

15

is implied; isn't that right? 

 MR. HORAN:  Your Honor, respectfully, I 

believe under our interpretation, it -- there is -- you 

do have to understand something to be in there, but we 

are not actually reading anything into the text.  That 

is the reason -- to be sure, the words "any kind of 

16 

conviction" are not in there. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 However, the most natural reading of the 

text, without adding anything to it, is that 

924(c)(1)(A) requires a 5-year -- at least a 5-year 

minimum sentence, in addition to any sentence for the 

predicate drug trafficking or violent crime, except to 

the extent that a greater minimum sentence is provided 

for the defendant by subsection 924(c) or by any other 

provision of law.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So that means there would 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

be no punishment, added punishment, at all for the 

possession of the gun; that is, you have the -- the 

possession with intent to distribute, no gun involved, 

and you get 10 years mandatory minimum for that.  That 

automatically would wipe out any add-on for the gun, 

6 

under your reading. 

7

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13

 MR. HORAN:  Yes.  Yes, Justice Ginsburg. 

And to follow on that, it is true that our 

interpretation -- we think that the plain text dictates 

that if the "except" clause is triggered, the lesser 

mandatory minimum sentence under 924(c)(1)(A) shall not 

be imposed; that is -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  You keep 

14 

saying that you're not reading anything into the statute 

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

21

22 

23 

24

under your interpretation, but you are.  You are 

limiting the -- the "any other provision of law" to any 

other provision of law specified in the charging -- in 

the counts of conviction, correct? 

 MR. HORAN:  That is the -- yes, Your Honor. 

We are recognizing that limitation. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you -- you said to 

Justice Alito that you weren't reading anything in, but 

you are.  You're reading into it that the other 

provision of -- of law to refer to counts of conviction 

at sentencing, correct? 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. HORAN:  That is correct, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So why is 

that read-in logical, meaning it's giving no extra 

punishment for the possession of a firearm?

 MR. HORAN:  Your Honor, two things -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Which was, I think,

Justice Ginsburg's -­

 MR. HORAN:  If I may -- and I think then -­

I think it will help in answering your question, Justice 

Sotomayor.  That is correct.  The only thing I would 

say -- the thing I would additionally say, though, is 

that there is, under the sentencing guidelines, which 

must be applied even now, as -- to provide a recommended 

range, there would in each of these instances be a 

firearm enhancement that enhances the underlying 

predicate offenses' sentence that the defendant would be 

facing and also how the -- the district court would 

work.  So I believe -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that is not 

22 

mandatory? 

23

 MR. HORAN:  That is no longer mandatory. 

24 

That is correct.

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you're saying that the 

gun possession can be accounted for by the judge as a 

matter of discretion using guidelines, but there's no 

mandatory at all? 

 MR. HORAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  That is 

correct.  There would no longer be a mandatory sentence 

for -- or mandatory additional punishment for the 

firearm possession.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and I suppose the 

prosecution can alter the consequence based on what it 

chooses to bring in a single prosecution. 

 I mean, if it has other -- other 

14 

enhancements, it should bring a separate prosecution for 

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

that.  So long as it brings it in one suit, you say, in 

one prosecution, you get the break.  But if -- if the 

other enhancement is brought -- has been brought in a 

separate prosecution, you don't get it. 

 MR. HORAN:  Justice Scalia, I think that's 

correct to an extent.  The -- the main exception to 

that -- and I think it's a significant one -- is that 

the "except" clause would most often be triggered in the 

mine run of cases by the predicate drug trafficking or 

violent crime that carries with it a greater mandatory 

minimum sentence.  That is, for double jeopardy 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

purposes, the same offense as 924(c). 

2

3 

4 

5

 So, in fact, there is a significant 

constraint on the prosecution, that it cannot bring a 

separate prosecution for 924(c) and its predicate drug 

or trafficking -- drug trafficking or violent crime.  So 

6 

it's a significant limitation on this -­

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  Yes, I understand 

8 

what you're saying.

 MR. HORAN:  Okay.  And Justice Sotomayor, to 

return to your question, if I could answer it in two 

parts.  First -- and I didn't mean to overstate, if I 

did -- we are not reading additional language into it. 

Our reading is contained within the context and the 

actual text that -- that is confined to section 924(c).

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Explain how, because you 

just said to Justice Scalia that if the mandatory 

minimum is in a separate charging instrument, then it 

doesn't affect you at all.  It only affects you if the 

count is in a count of conviction at sentencing.

 MR. HORAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  That is 

21 

correct. 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what in the language 

23 

of 924(c) sets forth that limitation? 

24

25

 MR. HORAN:  Your Honor, I would say that it 

is the words "is otherwise provided" and the context in 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1 

which any textual reading -­

Official 

2

3 

4 

5

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But -- but there 

"otherwise provided by law" could be Federal, State 

laws.  It could be in the indictment, not in the 

indictment.  You're proposing that we limit this 

somehow, but I want to see what the language is that 

you're relying upon to limit it. 

 MR. HORAN:  Your Honor, it is -- first of 

9 

all, the statute begins by directing the defendant -- I 

10

11 

12 

13

mean, directing the district court to "any person."  So 

they're focusing on the defendant.  That is the 

offense-defining provision, to be sure, of the sentence. 

 But the -- throughout the text, it also 

14 

directs the district court to take account of minimum 

15

sentences that are provided for other crimes; for 

16 

instance, primarily the predicate -­

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In relationship to what? 

Isn't that the government's argument, which is that you 

have to say in relationship to something, whether it's 

the indictment or, as the government would have it, in 

relationship to the possession or carrying of a firearm? 

Why isn't that the more natural reading? 

 MR. HORAN:  Your Honor, because that -­

24 

because the statute as a whole is essentially 

25

instructions to the district court on how to sentence a 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

defendant, if at all, for the 924(c)(1)(A) offense. 

2

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8

 It directs them to, after considering the 

person in front of them, to impose a sentence of 5 years 

or less, in addition to the predicate -- any penalty for 

the -- the predicate drug trafficking or violent crime, 

except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is 

otherwise provided. 

 The natural reading of that is -- and must 

9 

be -- that it is a -- a greater minimum sentence is 

10

11 

12 

13

provided for that defendant; that is, before the 

particular district court with the particular offenses 

that he has before him at sentencing. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Don't most crimes of 

14 

violence and drug trafficking carry more than a 5-year 

15

16

17 

18 

19

20

21 

22 

23 

24

sentence? 

 MR. HORAN:  Many of them do, Your Honor.  In 

fact, those that carry a mandatory minimum sentence 

largely carry -- all carry, in fact, 10 years. 

 There are some -- there are some both 

predicate drug trafficking offenses and predicate 

violent crimes that carry either no minimum at all or a 

mandatory minimum of 5 years or less, and so would not 

trigger the except clause. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So let's suppose somebody 

commits a rape and a maiming in the same -- in the same

criminal act.  You're saying that the prosecution -- and 

let's assume it's his third.  It's his third violent 

crime.  So he would get the enhancement as being, you 

know, a three-time violent crime loser.

 You're saying he could get that enhancement 

and the enhancement under this -- under this gun -- he 

had a gun at the same time.  He can get it if the 

prosecution charges rape in one prosecution, for which 

he will get the three-time loser enhancement, and then 

in a separate prosecution, it charges maiming and the 

use of a firearm.  Then he gets both enhancements, 

right? 

 MR. HORAN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That seems -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not sure that that's 

right.  I think that -- that this may well apply to the 

crime that is being -- that is being prosecuted where 

the crime is defined as a real offense in the world, 

with the limitations put on that term by the guidelines. 

I would think that would be a natural reading, in which 

21 

case you'd look to the conduct of the person. 

22

23 

24 

25

 And if the conduct of the person is such 

that it calls for a mandatory minimum of a certain kind, 

there we are.  And if that exceeds this amount, there we 

are.  You can't apply it.  And if it doesn't, you do 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

apply it. 

2

3

 MR. HORAN:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Have you looked into that? 

4 

I mean, that was my reading of it as -- in the most

natural way.  The word "crime" is ambiguous.  Sometimes 

it means words in a statute.  Sometimes it means an 

affair in the world.  And I thought this one probably 

meant the affair in the world. 

 MR. HORAN:  Well, in answering your 

question, Justice Breyer, in answering Justice Scalia's 

question, my assumption was that there were, in fact, 

mandatory minimums such that this would play out with 

one being greater than the other. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, he's disagreeing with 

you.  He -- your theory -- you're not reading "crime" to 

mean an affair in the world.  You're reading it to mean 

a particular prosecution for a particular violation of a 

statute.  Right? 

 MR. HORAN:  No, that's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I read that -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  He wants to read it as an 

22 

affair in the world, whatever that means. 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If that's so, then this 

24 

gives tremendous power to the prosecutor to decide what 

25

the sentence will be in terms of how he manipulates the

charge.  And I thought that probably this, read with the 

guidelines, is designed not to -- not to permit that. 

It's to minimize the discretion, not to maximize. 

 MR. HORAN:  Your Honor, there will be 

circumstances in which a -- the prosecutor and the 

government, based on how it makes its charging 

decisions, can affect the floor that's created by the 

minimum sentence. 

 It's a different situation than Deal, which 

was actually determinant sentences.  It's not actually a 

circumstance where the government can determine the 

punishment itself.  That would still be to the district 

court. 

 But we maintain that this is the most 

natural reading.  And, in fact, for instance, when this 

concern came up in Deal, that was to confirm the most 

natural reading of the plain text.  The government would 

actually turn that analysis on its head under these 

circumstances.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Justice Breyer is 

reading a bit what your co-counsel is advocating, what 

Mr. Abbott is arguing? 

 MR. HORAN:  No, Your Honor.  I -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No?

makes any difference.  I mean, has there ever been such 

a case where the prosecutor worked this in such a way 

that he would produce this? 

 Are you aware if any such case ever 

happened? 

 MR. HORAN:  No, I'm -- I'm not aware of 

that, Your Honor, in part because the "except" clause is 

-- there aren't that many instances of the "except" 

clause having been actually applied.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And there has never been 

the incentive to do so, until we accept your 

interpretation.  Then there will be means to do so. 

 MR. HORAN:  There may be -- Justice Scalia, 

14 

there may be some incentive do so, subject to other

25

constraints, including the -- the usual practice of 

charging, for instance, most offenses as they come under 

the transaction in the same indictment.  There will be 

counterincentives, to be sure. 

 Your Honors, for the -- in addition to the 

fact that our interpretation does not involve, we think, 

adding anything into the text that others must, we think 

it establishes -- it advances an evident purpose that 

Congress had in this, which was to ensure that a 

defendant who is convicted under 924(c)(1)(A) receives 

some sufficient minimum punishment.

 After 1998, the 1998 amendments, section

sentences.  And that's what this is about.  So this way, 

a defendant will receive a sufficient minimum sentence

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. RYAN

18 

19

 I'd like to spend some time on the second 

question in our petition regarding whether other 

firearms offenses are included within the scope of the 

"except" clause. 

 But before I do, I'd like to make a couple 

of points about the first question, which is common to 

21 

our case and to Mr. Gould's. 

22

23 

24 

25

 Justice Sotomayor asked:  Why isn't the 

government's reading the most natural?  And the answer 

is pretty simple.  The government's reading leaves one

 The government has, in its current 

interpretation, suggested that the "except" clause 

applies to one provision of law outside of 924(c). 

That's 3559(c).  And yet with respect to that provision, 

the "except" clause does absolutely no work, both for 

practical reasons and because of the way 3559(c) is 

written. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  930(c):  A person who 

kills any person in the course of bringing a firearm 

into a Federal facility shall be punished as provided in 

sections setting forth minimums for murder and 

manslaughter.  So it would also have an effect in 

930(c), no?

 MR. RYAN:  It's not clear from the 

16 

government's argument, Justice Sotomayor. 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I wasn't sure why it 

18 

didn't list 930(c), but -­

 MR. RYAN:  As I understand the government's 

argument, the sentence that -- the only sentence that 

would count outside of 924(c) would be a sentence 

specifically for a 924(c)(1)(A) offense -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know, but its brief 

24 

does two formulations.  It says -­

25

MR. RYAN:  Exactly right.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- anything that affects 

924(c), and then in other places in its brief, it says 

the -- the "except" clause refers to any higher minimum 

sentence for possessing, using, or carrying a firearm in 

relationship to a drug or -- drug offense or a crime of 

6 

violence.  Those are two different formulations. 

7

 MR. RYAN:  That's exactly right, Justice 

8 

Sotomayor.  And if the -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm focusing on the 

second formulation. 

 MR. RYAN:  Okay.  That point actually 

demonstrates why the government's justification for this 

limitation doesn't hold up.  As the government argues at 

one point, the reason to read "any other provision of 

law" to include only sentences for 924(c)(1)(A) crimes 

is because the "except" clause, when it refers to this 

subsection, refers only to sentences for section 

924(c)(1)(A) offenses. 

 Yet, that is not the case.  As this Court 

indicated in O'Brien, 924(c)(1)(B) is a separate 

offense.  Well, if 924(c)(1)(B) can trigger the "except" 

clause, and it's not the same offense as 924(c)(1)(A), 

the government's argument about excluding other offenses 

that might be separate from 924(c)(1)(A) no longer holds 

up.

 The other difficulty with the government's 

reading, to go back to the practical point, is that if 

you apply it just to 3559(c), it can have no effect 

because as a practical matter no one can serve a term of 

years after successfully completing a life sentence, 

which is what's required under 3559(c); and 3559(c) 

itself has a provision that, the "notwithstanding" 

provision, that makes clear that only the life sentence 

should be imposed when 924(c) is the third strike for 

purposes of 3559(c). 

 That, in turn, just leaves future 

applications, and there the government's scenario under 

which the language that currently has no effect might 

have some effect is nothing short of far-fetched.  It 

would require Congress to amend the sentence of 

924(c)(1)(A) outside of 924(c)(1)(A) and not indicate 

how those two penalties should interact. 

 Now, if I could turn to the questions about 

19 

a transactional limitation, which we suggest.  The point 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

of suggesting that the "except" clause should be limited 

to sentences for the same transaction is suggested by 

some of the questions directed to Mr. Gould's counsel. 

We think that it's the more natural reading of the 

statute in part because of concerns recognized by this 

Court in the United States v. Deal, namely that the 

20

10

statute is not designed and should not be read to give 

prosecutors unreviewable discretion as to when the 

minimum sentence in 924(c) ought to be applied or not. 

 It also would preclude the equally odd 

situation of a defendant being able to benefit from the 

"except" clause in a multi-count indictment when the 

defendant has -- faces a higher mandatory minimum 

sentence for a completely unrelated -- unrelated charge. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Where would we look to find 

the definition of a criminal transaction for these 

11 

purposes? 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 MR. RYAN:  You could look into 924(c) 

itself.  Our view is that it would be no different than 

the transaction that would give rise to the 924(c) 

charge itself and so, for that reason, would necessarily 

include the predicate offense or another firearms 

offense. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What if there were several 

19 

924(c) offenses committed during a rather brief period 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

of time?  What if on the same afternoon an individual 

engaged in a number of drug trafficking offenses and 

during each of those used or carried a firearm?  Would 

they -- would they be part of the same criminal 

transaction?

 MR. RYAN:  No.  Just as different -­

different transactions can lead to multiple 924(c) 

charges, which is what happened in Deal, that could also 

occur here. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you say "different 

transactions," but I'm looking for the definition of a 

criminal transaction.  The criminal law has labored with 

this for a long time.  It's not a self-defining concept, 

is it, a criminal transaction? 

 MR. RYAN:  No, it's not, but -- Your Honor, 

but I don't see how it would be any more difficult to 

determine the transaction than to look at what would 

constitute the 924(c) offense.  It would be the same set 

of operative facts that could lead to a 924(c) charge 

which would count as the transaction.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Ryan, I thought that 

you had three positions, and now you're talking about 

the second one, which is any greater minimum sentence 

arising from the same criminal episode.  But I thought 

your first position was any greater minimum sentence 

applicable to the defendant at sentencing. 

 MR. RYAN:  That is Mr. Gould's position. 

Our position is limited to the same transaction.  Our 

alternative position, which I'd like to turn to now -­

not -­

 MR. RYAN:  Well, the way it would have to 

work is that there would have to be a previous 

conviction. 

 Now, if I could turn to the firearms 

argument.  Our argument here is straightforward. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me, before you go 

on.  Your last remark -- it has to be a previous 

conviction.  So why doesn't that leave it in the hands 

of the prosecutor whether to bring that conviction, that 

other case, prior or subsequent? 

 MR. RYAN:  I -- I misspoke, Justice Scalia. 

You're exactly right.  It would include uncharged.  It 

would -- it would prohibit prosecutors from being able 

to use charging instruments to determine whether 924(c) 

would apply.  I was thinking of a particular example, 

but in the general case, you're right.  I apologize for 

that misstatement. 

 Now, if I could just spend a little bit of 

19 

time on our second question.  Our argument here is 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

fairly straightforward and fairly modest, and it relies 

on the fact that 924(c) is essentially a firearms 

offense.  And the punishment provided in the different 

paragraphs in 924(c) are primarily about firearms.  And 

so, in looking to determine the meaning of "any other 

provision of law," it is quite natural, as both the 

23

Official

9 

First Circuit recognized and as the government 

recognized in Whitley, the Second Circuit case, to 

include provisions of law outside of 924(c) that punish 

firearms offenses.

 Now, to be sure, this particular limitation 

is not commanded by the plain language of the statute 

and rests, like the government's argument, on context 

and purpose.  But the difference is that this argument 

still gives some effect to the "except" clause.  It 

10

would apply, as here, to other firearms offenses outside 

11 

of 924(c) like the Armed Career Criminal Act.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, it gives broader 

effect.  It gives broader effect to the "except" clause, 

but the government's argument gives effect to the 

"except" clause, doesn't it? 

 MR. RYAN:  It gives no practical -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  3559(c), which was enacted 

at the same time as this "except" clause, wasn't it, and 

makes explicit reference to -- to 924(c)?

 MR. RYAN:  Two points, Justice Alito. 

First, the government's reading has no practical effect. 

It leaves the "except" cause with no practical effect. 

You could take the "except" clause away, and there would 

be no difference in terms of the sentence under 3559(c).

 As for the enactment of 3559(c), the 

24
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4

5

government's argument is actually different.  The 

government argues that when 3559(c) was amended to 

include possession -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.

 MR. RYAN:  -- it was at that point that the 

6 

"except" clause also entered into 924(c). 

7

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

 The difficulty with that argument, as we 

explain in our brief, is that 3559(c) was already linked 

with 924(c) insofar as both addressed use.  And because 

3559(c) and 924(c) were already linked, and the 

"notwithstanding" provision within 3559(c) indicated 

that if the 924(c) offense is your third strike, you get 

the life sentence, that's it.  Well, the fact that 

Congress then amended 3559(c) to make another connection 

with 924(c) can't possibly explain why there is a sudden 

16 

need for the "except" clause. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 But the question is an -- is an important 

one because it goes to the fact that the government has 

offered three different interpretations of the language 

in this case.  The first -- one of the first was in 

Whitley, where it suggested "any other provision of law" 

includes other firearms offenses outside of 924(c), 

provided that they impose a consecutive sentence.  That 

argument was rejected for the idea that, instead, 

924(c)'s "except" clause actually applies to no existing

provisions of law.  And now the Government argues that 

it applies to one, 3559(c), and it has come up with a 

new theory as to why the "except" clause exists in the 

first place.

 But that theory doesn't hold up, and the 

government's shifting interpretations, if nothing else, 

suggest that the government has not hit upon the most 

natural reading. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you have offered 

three different readings, so one can't say that this 

statutory text has a clear meaning, which I think is 

your first argument -- that it has a clear meaning.  And 

yet, we have Mr. Gould's reading and then the two 

readings that you've offered us, same episode and same 

gun. 

 MR. RYAN:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  We think 

our first argument is the most natural and the clearest, 

but I take your point.  And the only response I would 

make is, if shifting interpretations or different 

interpretations suggest that at the end of the day the 

language is ambiguous and grievously so, under the rule 

of lenity, we ought to prevail.  So I'm perfectly 

comfortable with that conclusion. 

 If there are no further questions, I'd like 

to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

which was, which of the two statements are you 

advocating?  That the "except" refers to a provision 

that imposes a greater minimum sentence for violating 

924(c) explicitly, or are you saying the "except" 

clause -- and I'm quoting from your brief, in two 

different places -- the "except" clause refers to a 

higher minimum sentence for possessing, using a firearm 

in relationship to a crime of violence or a drug 

offense? 

 MR. MCLEESE:  I don't think there needs to 

be an explicit reference.  I think that the "except" 

clause is triggered by an offense which has a greater 

mandatory minimum and which has the same elements as and 

is the same offense as a section 924(c) offense. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  If that's 

the case, your adversary just said, Mr. Abbott's 

27
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

attorney just said, that you don't believe that section 

924(c)(1)(A) is trumped by 924(c)(1)(B) or by 18 U.S.C. 

section 930(c).  Is his allegation correct or is he 

wrong?

 MR. MCLEESE:  He is incorrect. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay. 

 MR. MCLEESE:  First, with respect to the 

internal structure of 924(c), 924(c) as it was amended 

in 1998 is a somewhat complex statute.  It has a mix of 

sentencing enhancements and elements which create 

aggravated versions of the offense, but it is all a 

single offense for double jeopardy purposes, for 

purposes of what punishment to impose.  And, therefore, 

the "except" clause operates consistent with the 

definition I just suggested quite sensibly and tells a 

district court judge imposing sentence if a defendant 

has brandished a firearm and also discharged it, you 

pick one of the 924(c) menu items, they are all a single 

offense, and you impose a single mandatory minimum 

sentence that is the greatest of those which are

 Now, with respect to 930(c) -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  So that if

he discharges a firearm, and it says it is a sentence of 

25

not less than 10 years, and he -- and that firearm is

also a short-barrelled rifle with a 10 year minimum, 

does he get 10 years, or does he get 20 years? 

 MR. MCLEESE:  He gets 20 years. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How?

 MR. MCLEESE:  Because there are -- the 

"except" clause says look to your defendant, look to see 

which -- whether there is any provision of law which 

carries with it a greater mandatory minimum which 

punishes the section 924(c) offense.  In that instance, 

there are two.  One of them provides for a 7-year 

mandatory minimum; one of them provides a 20-year 

mandatory minimum.  The "except" clause -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if it was a machine 

14 

gun, where there's a 30-year minimum, does he get 40 or 

15

16

18 

19

30? 

 MR. MCLEESE:  He gets 30.  You always get -­

the "except" clause operates internally to section 

924(c) to tell the district court judge, very helpfully 

in light of the complexity of the provision:  You impose 

one mandatory minimum sentence for each 924(c) 

21 

violation, whether aggravated or less aggravated. 

22

23 

24 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's not -- I 

can't imagine a single district judge getting that 

wrong.  To think that, oh, my gosh, here it says 10 

years if you discharge the firearms, and here it says 5

years if you have one, which one do I use in a case when 

it's discharged? 

 MR. MCLEESE:  That's not -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You don't need this 

provision, the -- your argument can't be that this 

language is to make sure the district judge knows in 

that case to use the 10-year rather than the 5-year. 

 MR. MCLEESE:  That point, Mr. Chief Justice,

applies in support of our position, because everyone

agrees that the primary function, the first half of the 

"except" clause, does exactly that.  That's all it does. 

It does nothing else.  To the extent -- the "except" 

clause says "except to the extent a greater minimum 

sentence is provided by this subsection," the only 

function -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that would include (B). 

That would include (B).  (B) is part of the same 

subsection, isn't it? 

 MR. MCLEESE:  Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, you know, I -- I think 

what the Chief Justice says is very obvious when you are 

just talking about (c)(1)(A), but it isn't obvious to me 

that if -- if the firearm is discharged and in addition 

it's a machine gun or destructive device, that you'd 

only get -- you'd only get the 30 rather than the 30

 MR. MCLEESE:  Quite so.  And the -­

And -- and the "except" clause would -- would handle 

that.

 MR. MCLEESE:  Correct.  And it's important 

7 

to realize when -­

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I would have 

9 

-- I guess things are obvious to different people.  I 

10

11 

12 

13

would have thought it would be odd to say when there are 

increased minimums that the highest minimum applicable 

isn't the one that applies. 

 MR. MCLEESE:  I agree with that, but it's 

14 

important to realize that another issue that a district

court judge might confront is whether you should 

cumulate them.  So it should be, as Justice Sotomayor's 

question suggests, that if there are several available, 

that you get 20 because it's a machine gun and 10 

because it was discharged.  And from the perspective of 

busy district court judges, a provision which says, in 

figuring out how to sentence a 924(c) offender, you 

don't have to look through this complex statute to 

figure out what your sentencing enhancements, do some 

double jeopardy analysis; all you need to do is simple 

math.  You are directed to look to, of all the ones that 

31
 

Alderson Reporting Company

are available, the one that is longest of the mandatory 

minimums. 

 The point I was trying to make, though,

Mr. Chief Justice, is all of this, the idea that it

really isn't that critical even to clarify in the first 

half of the "except" clause what to do, is consistent 

with our position, which is the "except" clause all 

together, both internally to section 924(c) and as it 

reaches externally, is about clarifying something that, 

it may be true, district court judges otherwise would 

have been able to figure out, had they done a lot of 

analysis.  But it makes it much simpler, and the 

practical utility of it is to clarify a sentencing 

judge's options with respect to a statute that had been 

made much more complex. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But your main -- the 

meat of your argument focuses on 3559(c), right?  There 

is this significant provision out there that does 

provide a greater mandatory minimum.  And I just don't 

see, as a practical matter, why people would worry about 

that.  Under 3559(c), you get life.  And you're saying, 

well, they put in the "except" clause to be sure that 

the judge would add another 5 years at the end of a life 

sentence.

 MR. MCLEESE:  Mr. Chief Justice, I think the

effect of the "except" clause is the opposite, which is

not add additional sentences. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, exactly.  Yes, 

I'm sorry. 

 MR. MCLEESE:  And I agree, from the 

perspective of a defendant, that may not be most 

consequential.  But this is a provision which, taken as 

a whole, was clarifying, not just externally to 924(c), 

10

but also internally, what district court judges should

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Well, just so 

I make sure I understand, the basic point you're making 

is that there are some things under your reading that 

this deals with.  One is the internal point, and we can 

disagree as to whether that's necessary or not, and the 

other is 3559(c), where it seems to me it doesn't make 

any difference whether you're in there for life or life 

and the additional 5 years.

 MR. MCLEESE:  I agree, it's not practically 

significant to a defendant, although sentences of life 

plus additional terms or consecutive life are not at all 

uncommon in the code.  But it is of significance to 

district court judges, who are trying to figure out what 

sentence to impose.  And this provision -­

number I don't recall.  It's not one of the provisions 

that -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, but I'm still trying 

4 

to understand your position, which is -- I read what you 

5

6 

7 

8

said to me the "except" clause means, and I'm applying 

it to 930(c), and I couldn't figure out why you didn't 

list it. 

 MR. MCLEESE:  Because 930(c) does not 

9 

require an actual killing of a person.  It extends to 

10

11 

12 

13

14

15

conspiracy and attempt.  And, therefore, one can violate 

930(c) without violating 924(c) and vice versa.  And, 

therefore -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How? 

 MR. MCLEESE:  By conspiring -­

16 

person -­

17

18 

19 

20

 MR. MCLEESE:  -- or by attempting to do so. 

So 930(c) has a broader reach because of these vicarious 

and inchoate forms of liability.  So a defendant could 

be convicted separately of 930(c) and of 924(c).  They 

21 

are not the same offense for double jeopardy -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So there are two possible 

readings now of the "except" clause where it says -- the 

words are this subsection doesn't apply where a 

mandatory -- where any other provision of law sets forth 

35

a higher mandatory.  Now, one possible reading, which is 

yours, is what this means is that, judge, where you are 

operating under that provision you just mentioned, and 

you're going to -- the guy has committed two serious 

924(c) things and so he is entitled to life -- this is 

just what the Chief Justice said -- this is done to 

remind the judge don't give him life plus 25 years, 

because it would be 25 years under this statute, not 5. 

That's one possible reading.

 The other possible reading is, judge, where, 

in fact, you have a pretty -- you have the underlying 

drug offense that's going to get you up into the 30s and 

it's -- you know, in the guidelines, it's going to be 

probably 10, 5 years, or whatever it is.  You have a 

pretty high drug offense already.  And now we give him 5 

extra years, say, for having a gun under this, unless 

he's already gotten, say, a mandatory minimum of 7 

years. 

 And if he's already gotten the mandatory 

minimum of 7 years, here's what's happening:  Judge, 

turn to the guidelines, and the guidelines will tell you 

to add 3 or 4 extra years.  So in one -- that -- those 

are the two possible readings. 

 Now, the first reading to me makes very 

little sense.  The second reading to me says, yes, this 

36
 

Alderson Reporting Company

is serving a purpose.  It's once you're sure this guy 

has to go to jail for 5, 6, 7, maybe 10 or 20 years for 

sure, extra amounts are controlled by the guidelines, 

which is administered by a judge.

 Now, if you just came across that for the 

6 

first time, which would you think was most probable.

 MR. MCLEESE:  Well, I think when you place 

this in the context of the 1998 amendments that enacted 

the "except" clause, it is quite clear that the former 

is more plausible.  And the reason I say that, there are 

really five features of the 1998 amendments that 

illustrate that the "except" clause is not to be read as 

eliminating any sentence for a section 924(c) offense, 

but rather is clarifying which sentence to impose.

 The first is that the 1998 amendments, 

setting aside the "except" clause for a moment, in every 

respect substantially increased the scope and severity 

of section 924(c).  It changed what had been mandatory 

sentences to mandatory all the way to life.  It -- it 

responded to this Court's decision in Bailey by 

increasing the substantive scope of the provision.  It 

increased the -- it created increased mandatory minimums 

for 7-year and 10-year offenses. 

 So it would be odd to think that in the 

second half of a presumptively narrow exception clause, 

37

3

11 

12 

13

Congress at the same time ran in the direct opposite 

direction and had a substantial rollback of pre-existing 

section 924(c) sentencing provisions.  And that's -- to 

be clear, at the time of the 1998 amendments, these 

Petitioners would have been subject to the mandatory 

minimum sentences that they received.  They would have 

been subject to 10 years in one of the cases for the 

drug offense and 5 additional years mandatory and 

consecutive under 924(c).  For the other, they would 

have -- he would have been subject to 15 years for being 

a felon in possession and an armed career criminal and 5 

additional under 924(c). 

 So one of the features that is key is 

14 

putting this in the context of the 1998 amendments, 

15

16

17 

18 

19 

20

which were in every respect -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait, but it -- but it 

does -- it does subject them to less, at least with 

respect to those -- those enhancements set forth within 

the subsection itself.

 MR. MCLEESE:  That is true, but that is not 

21 

a rollback of pre-existing provisions.  It's a way of -­

22

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why? 

 MR. MCLEESE:  Because none of -- in prior 

24 

924(c) law, there wasn't a body of law that would have 

25

given anybody who would get the benefit of the "except" 

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

clause under 924(c) a higher sentence.  What -- all the 

"except" clause does is it makes clear under this more 

complicated scheme that when we are increasing these 

provisions, a 7 or a 10, you shouldn't telescope them 

all inside 924(c).  You shouldn't add them all together; 

6 

you pick the highest. 

7

8 

9 

10

11

12 

13 

14 

15

16

 And so it -- the "except" clause is not a 

rollback.  It is a way of accommodating and giving clear 

direction to the complexity of the newly enacted 

provision.  And -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  When -- when did Congress 

pass the statute that they amended in 1998?  The one 

with -- you're saying -- I mean, it's a good point.  You 

have a point, that this would make it more lenient, the 

interpretation.  But the "it" was passed when? 

 MR. MCLEESE:  Well, section 924(c) in its 

17 

original form I think was passed in the 1960s. 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So that's way before the 

19 

guidelines.  So what they are trying to do now is the -­

20

21 

22 

23 

24

25

in 1998, is they're trying to -- see, in 1998 what 

they're trying to do is take some of these old 

provisions and reconcile them with this new system that 

has come along.  So I agree you have a point there. 

 But it -- it does make a certain amount of 

sense, because what it is saying is, in these cases 

39

12 

13 

14 

15

where you have a whoppo mandatory minimum anyway, so 

you're sure he's got it; now, the additional amount will 

be controlled by the guidelines, which are subject to 

not much discretion.  They are pretty close to mandatory 

minimums, but there's a little wiggle room. 

 MR. MCLEESE:  On the general approach of 

Congress under 924(c), it also bears note that in the 

last 25 years Congress has amended section 924(c) six 

times, and setting aside for a moment the "except" 

clause, in all of those amendments Congress has 

uniformly expanded its scope or increased the severity 

of sentences.  So the "except" clause would be the sole 

provision in which Congress rolled back section 924(c). 

And there are several other features of the 1998 

amendment that make clear that that is not what Congress 

16 

did.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do you answer 

Mr. Ryan's argument that you can read it this way, you 

can read it that way; therefore, he wins under the rule 

of lenity? 

 MR. MCLEESE:  Well, this Court's cases make 

clear that the rule of lenity comes into play at the end 

of the analysis only if there is grievous ambiguity 

after all the considerations of statutory construction 

have been considered.  We haven't yet discussed all of 

40

12 

13

them, and I think when all of them are discussed, there 

is no grievous ambiguity.  In fact, the reading that we 

suggest is the only reasonable reading, all factors 

considered.

 And if I can turn back to a couple of other 

features of the 1998 amendments, another feature is 

the -- the title of the act itself, which is an Act to 

Throttle the Criminal Use of Guns.  And, again, it's 

just inconsistent with the provision that has these 

features and has that act, that it would be a 

substantial important decrease in the mandatory minimum 

sentences applicable to a large class of -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's a 

14 

difficult -- you're saying, because Congress wanted to 

15

16 

17 

18

get tough on the people who use firearms in this 

provision, every ambiguous clause should be read in a 

way that makes it tougher on the criminal defendant? 

 MR. MCLEESE:  I don't -- that would push the 

19 

argument too far.  I think it is highly relevant to 

20

construing this -- the statute as a whole, that that was 

21 

the clear overall function of that amendment. 

22

23 

24 

25

 Now, there are two other features of the 

1998 amendment, which are, it did as has been previously 

noted -- also, the only other thing that Congress did in 

the 1998 amendment, other than modifying section 924(c), 

41

13

is it made a corresponding change in section 3559(c) to 

-- to correspond.  So we know that section 3559(c) was 

front and center in Congress's mind as it was enacting 

the 1998 amendments.  And it is very natural, when 

Congress is creating a more complex statute and giving 

district court judges guidance about which mandatory 

minimums to select under that statute, to mention and 

have language that accommodates the fact that there 

is -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, with respect to 

3559(c) they were in fact being more lenient, not 

stricter, right? 

 MR. MCLEESE:  No, I think they were

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought you said 

earlier that the purpose of this, what it does, is it 

makes sure that you don't add 5 extra years on the 

people who are sentenced to life. 

 MR. MCLEESE:  I think it clarifies the 

relationship, and, in fact, arguably it could have 

clarified the situation in a way that would have been 

beneficial to defendants.  And the reason I say that is 

when Congress enacted the first half of the "except" 

clause, which said pick one and only one mandatory 

minimum and impose it -- we're talking internally to 

42

12 

13

section 924(c) -- if it hadn't mentioned 3559(c), there 

could have been the idea that if there -- if Congress 

didn't direct the same approach with respect to 3559(c), 

there's an implication that in fact you should impose 

both. 

 And so what it really was doing was 

clarifying what would have been unclear.  And it is, 

again, only half of a presumptively narrow provision 

which is just clarifying the relationship -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Which is right. 

You're saying when you get life, or you get 5, just 

serve life; don't serve the extra 5. 

 MR. MCLEESE:  Yes.  Yes, but it's not saying 

14 

that to defendants.  It's saying that to busy district 

15

16 

17 

18

court judges, who just need to know in a simple, clear 

way what am I supposed to -- what sentence am I supposed 

to -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's the only thing 

19 

that that additional language which says "otherwise 

20

provided by this subsection or by any other provision of 

21 

law" -- why didn't they just mention 3559(c)? 

22

23

 MR. MCLEESE:  Well -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the only thing it 

24 

covers, that tiny little thing, which has no effect at 

25

all, except for the benefit of the busy district judges, 

43

 MR. MCLEESE:  Well, remember that it was -­

although it is not hugely consequential to defendants, 

it was a provision that Congress was directly 

considering then. 

 But there is another function, which is it 

creates a default rule for future similar provisions 

like 3559(c).  And so there -- and had, again -- so it's 

not limited to its function with respect to 3559(c); it 

also serves, as Congress often provides, a default rule. 

 And so, again, there is a fifth feature of 

the 1998 amendments for those of whom this is concern, 

which is that the legislative history of the provision 

strongly corroborates our interpretation.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, it's not strongly.  The 

-- what is it an example?  You're saying the other -­

this thing also serves the purpose that perhaps someday 

Congress will pass a new statute, a totally different 

one, and a busy district judge might think that he 

should add the 5 or 25 years from this provision on to 

whatever sentence this hypothetical new statute 

provides, but this will tell him not to do so.  Did you 

have anything in mind? 

 MR. MCLEESE:  Well, I -- there are -- there 

are other provisions that, like 924(j), which do provide

13

sentences for 924(c) offenses that are codified 

elsewhere in the code.  And with respect to other 

offenses, that's also quite common.  So there's nothing 

implausible about the idea that -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  I take it in those other 

offenses there are other things in the code, and the odd 

thing about this one is there is no other thing in the 

code except the one we've been discussing.  And so I 

just wondered if there -- was there at the time anybody 

thinking of adding some new thing that this might have 

been applicable to?  Or have you come across anything? 

I take it your answer is no. 

 MR. MCLEESE:  I'm not aware that -- that 

14 

Congress had some particular pending legislation in 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

mind.  My point more generally, though, is that it is 

quite common for Congress to provide penalties for 

offense A in a different section, and so creating a 

default rule is a perfectly reasonable thing for 

Congress to have done while it was clarifying the 

internal relationships among the various 924(c) 

provisions and the provision in 3559(c), which is front 

and center in front of it. 

 With respect to the legislative history, the 

24 

"except" clause language was proposed by Senator Jesse 

25

Helms.  In the legislative history of the provision, 

45

there is nowhere any comment by anyone suggesting that 

anyone understood it as rolling back pre-existing

different from the fundamental policy of section 924(c), 

which has always been defendants who commit drug 

trafficking offenses or violent crimes and who involve a 

weapon will get an additional -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there any

evidence in the legislative history that the reason they

put this in was to ensure that people who got life would

 MR. MCLEESE:  There's no explicit reference 

to that.  But that is, I think, a -- a good inference 

from the fact that all of the other explanations are far 

more implausible. 

 And there is something -- there are two 

things which support that inference more specifically, 

one of which is, again, that Congress did have in front 

of it section 3559(c) and was amending it.

 The second is that the sole reference 

anywhere in the legislative history to the "except" 

clause is in the testimony of a witness at a hearing, 

and what that witness said about it was that it will 

prevent confusion with other provisions.

 And so there is, I think, a -- a strong

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's one witness at a 

hearing?  At a hearing?  And you really think that the 

rest of the Congress knew about that hearing?

 MR. MCLEESE:  I don't.  My point is really 

more the negative, which is if the "except" clause, in 

the second half of an exception that is in its first 

part intended to clarify, was instead a major policy 

shift from the pre-existing policy of section 924(c), 

additional mandatory consecutive sentences, and instead 

a shift over to sentences which we will try to adjust or 

ameliorate in light of other -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no.  It's a shift 

14 

over to the sentencing guidelines, which say a person

20

like this one will receive an extra 3 or 4 or 5 years 

depending on the circumstances.  Will receive it, just 

like a mandatory.  Unless, of course, it is an unusual 

case.  That's what it's a shift to. 

 MR. MCLEESE:  Two responses -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Am I wrong? 

 MR. MCLEESE:  Two responses, Justice Breyer, 

one of which is that Congress has amended 924(c) both 

before and after this provision, and it's clear that 

Congress is not shifting away from a mandatory minimum 

regime to a regime that -- where the guidelines are 

47
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

relied upon to provide the minimum sentence that 

Congress requires. 

 And it is a shift not just to a guidelines

regime, because if this a major policy shift into a

different world, there -- it poses a question of 

statutory construction as well, not just about

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Advisory. 

 MR. MCLEESE:  But -- but the point is that 

Congress -- if Congress was shifting in the "except" 

clause, there's a question:  What's the nature of that 

policy shift? 

 If you were going to try to reduce 924(c) 

24 

sentences to accommodate sentences on other provisions 

25

of law, instead of just making them an add-on always, 

48

5

then there's a question:  What policy should you pick? 

Should you pick any other sentence the defendant is 

facing at this sentencing?  Should you pick any other 

sentence arising out of this transaction?

 That's not a guidelines issue.  That's a 

6 

question of what is the policy reflected by the statute?

the perfectly natural reading is to say, look, we are 

providing some minimum sentences when this happens, when 

this is the violent crime and you use a gun, but if you 

have already got a higher sentence for the violent 

16 

crime, then this doesn't apply.

be sure, but one thing -- it's certainly not the only 

reasonable policy.  You could focus on the transaction 

or you could focus on what the defendant is facing at 

the sentencing.  All those are among the policy options 

you would consider. 

 And what's interesting is that Petitioners 

24 

can't agree among those policy options.  And they can't 

25

agree among those policy options because section 924(c)

has no guidance about it.  And the reason section 924(c) 

has no guidance about it is because Congress wasn't 

making that policy choice at all.  Congress was simply 

clarifying how to implement the preexisting policy under 

section 924(c), which is always impose, for a section 

924(c) violator, an additional separate mandatory 

minimum sentence.  But here is advice about how to do 

that.  Here is advice about how to do that internal to 

section 924(c).  Here is advice about how to do that 

external to 924(c) under 3559(c) and with a default rule 

for other similar provisions.  That's the -- the modest 

objective that Congress was attempting to achieve.  And 

as everyone agrees -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  For other 

provisions anywhere in the code?  I mean, regardless of 

whether those provisions are being prosecuted in this 

particular indictment? 

 I mean, you're -­

 MR. MCLEESE:  No -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're saying that the 

other side has to say, well, it's only those that are in 

this -- in this particular criminal transaction, or only 

those in the particular indictment. 

 Do you escape that necessity?

 MR. MCLEESE:  I think we do, and the reason

we do is because, in our view, this provision operates 

only when you're talking about prosecution for the same 

offense in double jeopardy purposes.  And so it's not 

possible for -- under our submission, for the Government 

to prosecute somebody for one of these variants of 

section 924(c) and then come back again later and 

prosecute again and manipulate the overall structure of 

sentences, because they are the same offense. 

 If you move outside that into things that 

are not the same offense for double jeopardy purposes, 

then the prospects do open up for irrational patterns of 

outcome based on the order in which things are 

prosecuted and, in addition, irrational patterns of the 

mandatory minimums based on -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how is your reading

 MR. MCLEESE:  Mr. Abbott has two readings, 

and our reading differs from each of them.  The first of 

Mr. Abbott's readings is transactional in nature.  Ours 

is focused on the section 924(c) offense itself. 

 The second of our readings is -- the second 

of Mr. Abbott's readings is focused on a firearm, just 

the fact that a firearm is involved.  And, again, ours 

is focused on the use of a firearm in a way that 

constitutes the section 924(c) offense.  So those are 

51
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1 

the differences. 

Official 

2

3 

4 

5

 But if I could just point out the other 

anomalies, there are two other anomalies that we have 

not yet touched upon.  One of them is that Petitioners' 

submissions create anomalous patterns of floors of 

6 

statutory minimums, as we've discussed in the briefs.

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 If a defendant under Petitioners' 

submission, principal submission, has committed a drug 

offense that carries a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence 

and brandishes a firearm, it is -- carrying a 7-year 

minimum, the floor is 12 years.  If that defendant's 

drug offense is more aggravated and carries a greater 

sentence so that there's a 10-year mandatory minimum, 

the overall mandatory minimum, under Petitioners' 

submission, reduces to 10. 

 And there is the further anomaly that for 

offenses that are different, Petitioners' submission is 

that the defendant will end up, although adjudicated 

guilty of a section 924(c) offense, with no sentence 

whatsoever.  There will be a free-floating adjudication 

of guilt.  And because the defendant, let's say, is a 

felon in possession and is sentenced under the Armed 

Career Criminal Act, when the judge goes to sentencing, 

the judge, on Petitioners' view, says:  I will give you 

15 years under the Armed Career Criminal Act; that 

52

triggers the "except" clause, and therefore, I impose no 

sentence whatsoever under section 924(c).  That also is 

an anomaly. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  As Justice -- as 

Justice Breyer has pointed out, he can take that into 

account in figuring out what sentence he would want to 

impose beyond the greater minimum. 

 MR. MCLEESE:  That is true.  My point about 

9 

the anomaly is just that it is very strange, to my 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

knowledge unheard of, to have a judge go to sentencing 

and have a series of adjudications and to tell the judge 

as to one of them it's not the greater or lesser 

included offense of another; you don't even need to 

impose a sentence on that -- on that adjudication.  The 

backdrop basic assumption is, on each of the 

16 

adjudications, you impose a sentence. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 Now, that's not true if offenses are greater 

or lesser or are the same offense, for double jeopardy 

purposes.  But under Petitioners' submission, that is 

true with respect to offenses like being a felon in 

possession of a firearm and being someone who violated 

924(c) that are different offenses in double jeopardy 

law and have always been given separate judgments, 

separate punishments.

 If the Court has no further questions, we 

53

would request that the judgments below be affirmed.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. RYAN 

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN NO. 09-479 

 MR. RYAN:  I'd like to make two points on 

8 

rebuttal. 

9

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 There has been a great deal of discussion 

about the general purpose of 924(c), but as this Court 

has indicated, the best indication of a statute's 

purpose is the statute's language, and although the 

government argues that the sole purpose of 924(c) was to 

enhance punishment for defendants, the "except" clause 

belies that simplistic assertion of the purpose.  The 

"except" clause actually mediates the punishment that is 

provided in 924(c). 

 The government's reading, at the end of the 

19 

day, wants to rely on purpose in order to give no effect 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

to the "except" clause.  The idea that 3559(c) is an 

instruction to busy district court judges, even putting 

aside the impossibility of serving an additional 

sentence after completing a life sentence, doesn't hold 

up, because the government never disputes the fact that 

3559(c) begins with the statement, "Notwithstanding any 

54
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1 

other provision of law."

 So the busy district court judge never needs 

to turn to the "except" clause in 924(c)(1)(A) to know 

that you impose a life sentence when the third strike is 

a 924(c). 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Whenever Congress uses a 

phrase like that, "notwithstanding any other provision 

of law," does that mean that Congress must think that 

there is some provision of law that falls within that?

 MR. RYAN:  Possibly, yes, and that -- here, 

the other provision of law would be 924(c), and so the 

point would be -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Doesn't Congress commonly do 

14 

that to make sure that something covers any existing 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

statute there might be that would fall within that, 

without necessarily saying, well, there are two of 

them -- if there are two, maybe there are three?  Going 

through the entire code to find out how many there might 

be, or if there is any?

 MR. RYAN:  Yes, Justice Alito, and that's 

21 

consistent with my point, is that -­

22

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But it's not consistent with 

23 

your main argument about the "except" clause, is it? 

24

25

 MR. RYAN:  Well, yes, it is, because the 

"except" clause would also apply to any other provision 

55
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1 

of law. 

Official 

2

3 

4 

5

6

 JUSTICE ALITO:  No, but your argument is the 

"except" clause has to have some pretty substantial 

effect, or otherwise the "any other provision of law" 

part of it -- otherwise, they wouldn't have put it in. 

 MR. RYAN:  Oh, I apologize.  I misunderstood 

7 

your -- your question. 

8

 The "notwithstanding any other provision of 

9 

law," in the context of 924(c), would not have any

effect if the "except" clause was considered first.  But 

3559(c) applies to many other triggering offenses, and 

so with regards to those -- and the government has not 

suggested that 3559(c) has -- has no effect. 

 The last point I'd like to make is that 

there's no doubt that regardless of one's view about 

mandatory minimum sentences as a matter of policy, no 

one doubts that Congress has the authority, if it 

chooses to exercise it, to stack one mandatory minimum 

sentence on top of another.

 But as this Court's cases make clear, 

Congress, under the rule of lenity, needs to make that 

choice clear.  And if nothing else, the government's 

shifting views indicate that Congress has not exercised 

that choice clearly in this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
