 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-5274, Dean v. United States.

 (11:10 a.m.)

 Mr. Forster.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT J. FORSTER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FORSTER:  Thank you, Your Honor.
 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the 

Court:

 The issue before the Court in this case is 
whether the discharge provision of 924(c) carries with 
it some requirement of intent.  We believe that the 
answer to this question is yes.  And to that end we 
would cite to the leg -- to the text of the statute 
itself as well as the history involved, the presumption 
of mens rea that is inherent in all statutes such as 
this Court's case law has been clear on as well as the 
principle of the rule of lenity, if we get to that 
point, and if the Court deems that there is some type of 
ambiguity.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Forster, there are 
three levels under this:  Possession, brandishing, and 
if the gun is discharged.  You don't quarrel with the 
notion that Dean at least brandished this gun?

MR. FORSTER:  We -- we do not dispute that, 
Your Honor.  No, he clearly intentionally brandished the 
weapon.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So we're talking about a 
three-year difference between brandishing and if the gun 
is discharged?

 MR. FORSTER:  Yes, Your Honor, that's 

exactly right.  And the statute in 924 requires that the 
use of the firearm be during and in relation to the 
underlying crime of violence, which in this case is a 
bank robbery.  And we believe that the proper reading of 
the statute would require that the discharge also be 
done during and in relation to the underlying crime of 
violence.  Otherwise, the statute simply would not make 
any sense.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think one of the 

stronger arguments against you is the use of the passive 
voice.  It doesn't say anybody who discharges a firearm. 
It says a firearm is discharged.  And that seems to me 
to take it away from the element of intent that you're 
trying to focus on.

 MR. FORSTER:  Your Honor, I think that it's 
a transitive verb the way it's used.  By definition it 
would have some object.  Someone would have had to have 
discharged the weapon.  And so I think that the Court's

cases on mens rea and so forth would continue to apply, 
even given the way that it's phrased in the statute.  I 
don't think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you think it's 

different -- I don't remember the grammar too well.  You 
think "if firearm is discharged" is different than 
"firearm discharges;" is that your point?

 MR. FORSTER:  I'm not sure it would make a 

difference in this case, Your Honor, because I don't 
think there's any -- I think that by definition the 
Court would have to ask itself who discharged the 
weapon.  I don't think you can just use the word 
"discharge" in a vacuum.  It has to be during --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I'm not sure 
that's right.  I mean, if in fact the bank robber tries 
to flee and the security guard is forced to use his 
firearm, increasing the danger to everybody else in the 
bank, I'm not sure this statute wouldn't cover that as 
well.

 MR. FORSTER:  Your Honor, I don't believe 
the statute would, because the individual who would be 
charged with it would not himself have "during" or "and 
in relation to" the underlying crime of violence.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it doesn't say -- it 

says, "if the gun is discharged."  And I think on the

government's reading it would cover the police officer 
who is trying to apprehend a robber and fires a gun.

 MR. FORSTER:  Yes, Your Honor, I think under 
the government's theory that would be true.  But I think 
that would open up --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  What -- what --

I guess I'm not following this.  You say it would be 
true that if the blank -- if the bank guard fires his 
own gun when -- when the bank robber is fleeing, that 
would come within this?

 MR. FORSTER:  No, Justice Scalia, not under 

our reading.  I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You say under the 

government's it would?  I don't think it would under the 
government's either.  Do you?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You have to use or carry 

the firearm before -- before section 2 even applies.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's the police 

officer who snatches the gun.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ah, that's different, yes.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's different.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So it's using the 

robber's gun, but by the police officer who is 
apprehending him.  In other words, as I understand the 
government's view, it doesn't matter whether it's the

police officer.  It has to be the gun of the robber, but 
it doesn't matter whether it's the robber or the police 
officer who discharges it.

 MR. FORSTER:  That's true, ma'am.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I guess it's also the 

government's view -- this is even weirder -- that it 
doesn't matter who brandishes the gun.  The -- the bank 
guard grabs the gun and brandishes the gun, and that 
also gets additional time served for the bank robber. 
It doesn't seem fair.

 MR. FORSTER:  Your Honor, I don't believe 
that the -- that the hypothetical of the guard waving 
the gun around, I don't think that would meet the 
definition of "brandish" the way 924 defines it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It has very specific --

what are the words that define what is brandishing?

 MR. FORSTER:  Justice Ginsburg, "brandish" 

is defined under the statute a couple of different ways. 
The -- the dictionary definition of "brandish," which is 
to grab something and wave it around, is certainly 
contained in that.

 But the definition goes further.  The 

definition also says that if I, for example, make known 
that I have a gun, if I pass a note saying I have a gun, 
that would also be brandishing under the statute.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I -- I didn't think the 

government or anybody was reading the definition of 
brandishing to include a police officer.

 MR. FORSTER:  The way the government's brief 

-- well, with regards to brandish, Your Honor, I don't 
know that the government goes that far.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it runs into the 

problem, which is also a different problem for you, and 
that is the brandishing must be for the purposes -- for 
the purpose of intimidating.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Right.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  So that's probably going to 

eliminate the case in which the officer grabs the 
felon's gun.  So the problem that it seems to me that it 
creates for you is that "brandish" is specifically 
defined to have that particular intentional element. 
There is, however, no definition of -- of the -- of the 
term in question here, which suggests that they did not 
have any discharge -- that they did not have any --
any -- any intent to impose an intent requirement.  When 
they do it, they know how to do it.  In this case they 
didn't do it.

 MR. FORSTER:  Your Honor, I would disagree 

with that simply for this reason.  This Court's case law 
is clear that if Congress wants to do away with the mens

rea element, they must affirmatively do so.  And I don't 
think that it's proper to say that because there's a 
specific definition of "brandish," therefore they meant 
discharge to be basically strict liability.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why is it improper?  I 
mean, it may not be conclusive, but it seems to me 
evidence that points in that direction.

 MR. FORSTER:  Your Honor, I think that that 
would be disregarding the presumption of mens rea that 
exists pursuant to this Court's case law as well as the 
requirement --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  We have -- we have lots of 

cases in which it makes sense to disregard that 
presumption, and -- and nobody thinks twice about it, I 
mean, accomplice liability being an example.

 There are -- there are -- there are lots of 

State crimes in which it is dispensed with, reckless 
driving, death resulting.  And in all of those cases 
what in effect the rationale is that the -- that the 
individual who is being charged has created a risk, no 
one can control that risk, including himself.  But he 
bears the responsibility for, if you will, bad luck if 
the risk is realized.  And that is the rationale for --
for holding him liable for discharge here without any 
particular knowing or -- or intentional act in making

the discharge.

 So why doesn't that make sense and why is 
that not an answer to the usual presumption that there 
will be a specific state of mind required?

 MR. FORSTER:  Your Honor, I don't think this 

statute is driven by consequence.  And as I understand 
Your Honor's hypothetical --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why?  Why?
 MR. FORSTER:  Because the words that the 

statute uses are directly focused to the -- to the 
conduct of the defendant:  "Possess, use, brandish, 
discharge," as opposed to, for example, carjacking.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, this is conduct.  I 
mean, it isn't just bad luck.  This is -- what we have 
here is a negligent bank robber.  I mean, he has left 
the safety off, okay, and -- and trips the gun.  I mean, 
bank robbing is bad enough, but negligent bank robbing 
is something --

(Laughter.)
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- is something that should 

be punished more severely.

 MR. FORSTER:  Your Honor, certainly under 
the statute the Court has far more authority than the 
ten years it imposed, and I think Congress is clear that 
they -- they allowed for substantially larger sentences

in such a case.  This case obviously just discusses the 
application of the mandatory minimum.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your -- your 

argument would give rise to very serious problems of 
proof.  Every time a gun goes off, the bank robber would 
be able to say it was an accident.  I mean, we had a 
particularly klutzy robber here that everybody agrees it 
was an accident, but, you know, in many cases it won't 
be clear.

 Yes, I was pointing the gun at the person, 
but I didn't mean to fire it.  It just went off.  And 
he's sad about it just as everyone else is.  And that 
would get to the jury in every case.

 Just because it was easy here doesn't mean 

it's going to be easy every time to draw a line.  And it 
gets back to Justice Souter's point.  If you pose the 
risk that the gun is going to go off, that's 
additionally punishable conduct.

 MR. FORSTER:  Your Honor, obviously -- I 

mean, the risk certainly does go up.  But as I -- as I 
think the statute is written, it's not driven by what 
the risk is.  As I say, as opposed to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's not my 

question, really.  The question is the problem of proof. 
Yours is an easy case.  Most cases it's not going to be.

Most cases when the gun goes off, the robber will be 
able to say, I didn't intend that it discharged.  It 
was -- it was an accident.

 MR. FORSTER:  Your Honor, I don't believe a 
jury would be -- would make that decision, because under 
this Court's authority in Harris, that would be for the 
judge; and -- and obviously criminals would make these 
claims, and it would be --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me?  That would be 

for the judge?

 MR. FORSTER:  Under this Court's authority 
in Harris, Your Honor, brandish and discharge are not 
elements of the offense that must be indicted and proved 
to a jury.  They are sentencing elements or enhancement, 
if you will, that -- that would be up to the judge, and 
that's this Court's Harris ruling.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Doesn't that undermine your 
argument that there's a presumption that a mens rea has 
to apply, because this is just a sentencing element?

 MR. FORSTER:  Your Honor, I don't believe 

so.  This Court has never said that merely because it is 
a sentencing enhancement rather than an element of the 
offense that somehow the statutory rules of construction 
cease to apply.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't it part of the

background here that it was proposed at the time these 
enhancements came into the law, it was proposed that 
there be a specific state of mind requirement for the 
discharge of the gun, and that was not enacted?

 MR. FORSTER:  I didn't hear the -- I'm 

sorry, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that part of 

the legislative history was that there were proposals --
I mean, there is a rather sharp difference between 
"possess" -- yes, you have to have a knowledge, intent 
element -- "brandishing," very clear, for purposes of 
intimidation -- then "discharge" has no -- it's just 
that the gun is discharged.

 Weren't there proposals to include something 
like what was included for the other two, that is, that 
there be an intent requirement?

 MR. FORSTER:  Your Honor, there were various 

drafts in the House and the Senate that -- that 
specifically provided the intent requirement.  The 
compromise that came out was basically a disagreement 
over the penalty, and the language that the Congress 
used, "during and in relation to," necessarily implies 
some type of an intent element.  I think the circuits 
are clear on that; it has to be knowing, otherwise it's 
not during and in relation to.

And so I believe that the choice of language 
that Congress uses -- there has to be the connection, we 
believe, between the use -- during in relation to and 
the discharge.  Otherwise the statute makes no sense, 
because it wouldn't be triggered by anything.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  I can't get anywhere 
with the language, to tell you the truth.  I could read 
it either way.  It -- the House language is the same. 
The person "discharges," yeah, but what if he discharges 
it accidentally?  Is the accidental case or unintended 
case meant to be covered or not meant to be covered?

 MR. FORSTER:  We don't --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And you don't get anywhere 

-- I just can't get anywhere with the language.  The 
reason they put the "is discharged" is probably for 
parallelism.  It was a drafting section in the Senate, 
and they do their job in a stylistic way.  I found 
nothing that suggests anything other than that.

 So -- so where am I?  Sometimes a person who 
discharges the weapon accidentally is really much worse 
than the one who does it purposely.  Purposely, he 
shoots at the ceiling; accidentally, he kills a person 
dead; okay?  So I mean, I can't get too far with that.

 So where -- so there we are.  Is there 
anything else -- there is the post problem that the

Chief Justice mentioned.  Is there anything else you can 
say to me, who really doesn't see it one way or the 
other way in this statute?

 MR. FORSTER:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Would you say, look, this 

is why you win?

 MR. FORSTER:  Your Honor, in the committee 

reports and so forth I think it's pretty clear that they 
did not intend an unintentional or an accidental 
discharge to be covered.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why -- why do you think 

that?  I mean, it is absolutely true that a person who 
is a bank robber and has a gun and has already shown it, 
and it goes off accidentally is, is -- has caused a 
tremendous harm in certain cases, which traditionally 
has been thought meriting a higher sentence.

 And it is also true that he doesn't have the 

same state of mind as the one who does it purposely. 
That is true, too.  Both are true.  And so now what 
should I do?  I know what you want me to do, but why?

 MR. FORSTER:  Your Honor, the requirement --
we think that the discharge again must be during and in 
relation to.  There has to be that connection.  And --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which -- it's during the 

bank robbery.

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's in relation to the --

I mean, you know, in a sense it is, in a sense it isn't; 
same problem.

 MR. FORSTER:  I don't think this case --

this Court's case law would support a finding that an 
accidental use would have been in relation to.  That's 
this Court's ruling in Smith.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, there's accidents 
and accidents.  And couldn't one say, looking at this 
that, well, we will -- the State will find that the 
culpability that we will attribute to this statute is 
reckless?  If recklessness were the requirement 
certainly the facts in this case would fit, would they 
not?

 MR. FORSTER:  I think that the evidence 

would suggest that he was reckless --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You accept that --
MR. FORSTER:  -- but I don't believe that it 

was knowing.  And then I think that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You say reckless is not 

enough, it has to be knowing.  This is not a mere 
accident.  It's -- this -- the gun was loaded, it wasn't 
locked, and he's raking in money with one hand, holding 
the gun with the other.  The teller is crouching down. 
I mean, there was -- there was a pretty substantial risk

of something going wrong, right?

 MR. FORSTER:  Absolutely, there was.  But I 
think this Court's authority in Smith talks about the --
the intent element that is inherent in this.  It has to 
be purposeful, it has -- it cannot be by accident, and 
that's what this Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?  You place a lot of 
reliance on this:  During and in relation to any crime 
of violence or drug trafficking crime.  But that --
that's in the prologue, and it applies only to the 
matter covered in the prologue -- to wit, "During and in 
relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking 
crime, for which the person may be prosecuted in a court 
of the United States, uses or carries a firearm or in 
furtherance of any such crime possesses a firearm."
 That -- that's what all that language 
"during and relation to" applies to.  And then it 
continues:  "Shall," if that "in relation to" exists, 
"in addition to the punishment provided for such crime:" 
One, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less 
than five"; two; and number three, what we're dealing 
with here, "if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced 
to a term of imprisonment of not less than ten years."

 I don't see how that language during and in 
relation to any crime of violence applies to anything,

except the use or carrying of a firearm.

 MR. FORSTER:  Justice Scalia, sir, we 

believe that the proper -- that the better reading would 
be some connection between those two, between the 
discharge and the underlying, the during and relation 
to.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why is that?  How could you 
-- how could you make the lack of connection any clearer 
than by ending the first, the introduction with a dash, 
and then putting 1, 2, and 3?  I mean, it seems to me 
that it applies to the portion before the dash.

 MR. FORSTER:  Your Honor, if that were the 
-- if that were the interpretation, then it would lead 
to what we consider to be some of the absurdities as far 
as the results go.  If there is no connection between 
"during and in relation to" -- I will refer to it as the 
connection.  In absence of that connection, any number 
of different things could occur, and that connection is 
what makes this statute make sense.

 And I believe that the government basically 
acknowledges that in their brief, that there has to be 
-- if there's not some connection -- I think it's page 
29 of the government's brief.  When we discussed the 
absurd results that might flow from a statute where 
there is no such connection, what the government says --

I believe it's on page 29 -- is that to avoid these 
absurd results, this connection does exist.  But then 
the next sentence they say:  But it doesn't mean there 
is a mens rea.

 And it seems to me that what the government 
wants in that case is the "during and relation to "has 
to apply to discharge to avoid the absurd results, but 
yet they don't want Smith to go along with it.  And 
Smith said that during and relation to is purposeful, 
has to have an effect, and it can't be done by accident.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  How would -- how would a 

discharge not be during and in relation to?  Give me an 
example of -- of what you're worried about.

 MR. FORSTER:  Any discharge any other time.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  He sees a duck fly by the 

window and he's a hunter.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that -- excuse me. 

That's not -- that's not covered.  Number 3 only applies 
to someone who has already been guilty of what's set 
forth in the prologue.

 MR. FORSTER:  That's the connection that we 

believe is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's the only 

connection that's necessary.  You have to have done what 
was set forth in the prologue, and it has -- has to be

in the course of doing that.  But "the course of doing 
that" means just in the course of using a firearm in 
connection with the bank robbery.

 MR. FORSTER:  Your Honor, I don't think 

that's the -- the best way to read it.  I think it has 
to be during and in relation to the bank robbery.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The -- the "use or carry" 

certainly has to be in relation -- during and in 
relation to, but that's step one.  So he already is 
using and carrying or carrying in relation to the bank 
robbery.  And then -- so that's the starting premise. 
That excludes all your things about years before or 
years after he carried -- he carried a gun.  You -- step 
one narrows it to the person who uses or carries a gun 
in connection with a bank robbery.

 MR. FORSTER:  And -- and I would agree with 
that, and then when you take this Court's authority in 
Smith to say that that type use during and in relation 
to cannot be accidental.  And so I go back to the 
original question Your Honor asked me, did he 
intentionally brandish it?  Clearly.  And so we believe 
that if -- if this case we are here about is fit into 
Smith, he's on the hook for the seven years under 
brandish, but because the discharge was accidental, it 
cannot constitute use under this Court's authority in

Smith.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me ask you a question 
about that.  I thought that "or possesses" was separate 
from the "uses or carries."  Is possession an example of 
using or carrying or is it as it says -- "or who in 
furtherance of such crime possesses"?  Is that a 
separate -- separate enhancement?

 MR. FORSTER:  I don't know that I would use 
the word "enhancement," Your Honor.  The principal body 
of 924 --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right.
 MR. FORSTER:  -- "carries" with "uses" as in 

this case as well as later on in the statute 
"possesses."  So it says both.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But merely possessing is 

enough to get the first enhancement of five years.

 MR. FORSTER:  If it is in furtherance --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Or relation to.
 MR. FORSTER:  If it --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  The "uses or carries" 

doesn't -- doesn't necessarily apply to the possession.
 MR. FORSTER:  The -- I believe, under the 
reading of the statute, Your Honor, they're separate. 
He could have been charged arguably with possession --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right. 

21 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

MR. FORSTER:  -- in furtherance of, but he 

wasn't.  He was charged with using during and in 
relation to the underlying crime of violence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why do we have to find that 

the phrase "if a firearm is brandished" and the later 
phrase "if a firearm is discharged" require intentional 
brandishing and intentional discharging?  Why can't we 
limit it by saying, oh, of course it means if the 
firearm is brandished by the bank robber or by the felon 
or if it's discharged by the felon, but leaving it quite 
undetermined whether it has to be intentionally 
discharged, or even intentionally brandished for that 
matter.

 MR. FORSTER:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The definition of 

brandishing, I guess, requires some intent to put 
another person in fear.

 MR. FORSTER:  Your Honor, I think that you 
would then have to turn to this Court's -- well, first 
of all, I think it's the best reading of the statute. 
It doesn't make sense any other way to say that you can 
have the gun discharged but not be during and in 
relation to the underlying crime of violence.  It 
doesn't make sense.

 Second, I believe that this Court's

statutory rules of construction would say that if 
Congress wanted to do away with the mens rea element in 
this case, they would have had to have done so 
expressly.  And we don't believe that they did.

 Now, every circuit that has discussed the 

requirement "during and in relation to" has found a 
knowledge requirement that you can't not know the gun is 
there, for example.  There has to be the knowledge 
requirement.  And this Court's authority in Smith 
suggests or says clearly that it cannot be used 
accidentally.

 So now the question becomes this:  If the 

Court decides that during -- that the discharge must be 
during and in relation to, and when the Court does that 
it takes its own authority in Smith to say that it has 
to be purposeful, it has to have the effect of the 
commission of the crime, now is -- would the use in this 
case be subject to Smith?  And Smith is clear that 
accidental discharge simply -- or accidental use, rather 
-- it didn't talk about discharge exactly -- but that 
accidental use would never be because it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why -- you say that this 

background -- that there has to be a state of mind 
element.  And we can accept that that's a general 
principle, but here we have a provision that does

require a state of mind -- specifically requires a state 
of mind for the possession, for the brandishing, intent 
to intimidate, but here is this other one that suddenly 
doesn't.  So wouldn't the text of this statute say --
the third one, discharging a gun, they didn't mean to 
have any element because -- any element of mens rea --
because they had it in number 1 and 2, and 3 leaves it 
out.

 MR. FORSTER:  Your Honor, if -- I believe 
such an interpretation would basically mean that that 
silence would be interpreted as a strict liability, that 
silence with regards to the specific intent requirement 
would mean the Congress meant that no intent was 
necessary.  And that's simply never what these cases 
from this Court have held.  There's the presumption that 
Congress operates against, and if they wish to eliminate 
the mens rea element, they must do so expressly.  And we 
simply do not believe that it -- that it happened in 
this case.

 One last point is, we believe there's 

nothing else that Congress would have had to have done 
to establish a general intent, and if that's true, then 
I think the very least that could be said about our 
interpretation is that it would be a reasonable one, in 
which case lenity principles would then come into play.

 MR. FORSTER:  Thank you.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. Maynard.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 MS. MAYNARD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 By its terms, the sentencing factor in 

section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) contains no mens rea 
requirement.  Rather, it requires a certain fact to be 
present in the course of the section 924(c) offense, 
namely that the firearm is discharged.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does it require that the 
discharge be during and in relation to the crime?  I 
mean, suppose the bank robber, you know, he sees -- son 
of a gun, he sees among the customers a man that ran off 
with his wife a year ago, and he is just overcome with 
anger, and he -- you know, he takes a shot at this guy. 
It's not in relation to the bank robbery.  Would --
would that discharge be covered?

 MS. MAYNARD:  As long as the discharge 

occurs while the 924(c) offense is going on --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.
 MS. MAYNARD:  -- yes, Justice Scalia, it 
would -- it would apply.  The "during and in relation 
to" language from the principal paragraph is part of the 
offense, but it does not carry down to the separate 
sentencing factors.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about the 
police come in and say, "Drop it"; he says, "Oh, my 
robbery's over"; he drops it, and it goes off?

 MS. MAYNARD:  That case might present a 
question about whether or not, once he drops it in 
compliance with a lawful order to do so, he is still 
committing the section 924(c) offense.  If the section 
924(c) offense is deemed to be over at that point, then, 
no, the firearm would not -- the fact would not have 
been present while the course of the section 924(c) --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So that's the line 
between is it going on.  But assuming the offense is --
the bank robbery is still going on, like he's got 
confederates gathering up the money or something, does 
that fall under your theory that the gun is discharged?
 MS. MAYNARD:  In our -- under our theory, 
the -- there must be a temporal connection between the 
offense for which the defendant is being sentenced, 
which is a section 924(c) offense, the using or carrying

the firearm during and in relation to the bank robbery 
in your hypothetical or possessing it in furtherance of 
the bank robbery in your hypothetical.

 If one concluded that because the bank 

robbery continued, even though he was no longer using or 
carrying the firearm or no longer possessing it, that 
the 924(c) offense also continued, and the firearm 
discharges when he drops it, then, yes, the firearm is 
discharged while the section 924(c) offense is ongoing, 
and, yes, the mandatory minimum would apply.

 But -- but that hypothetical presents 

questions about the beginning and end of the section 
924(c) itself, not questions about whether or not the 
discharge was intentional or accidental.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you think that --

regardless of whether it's intentional or accidental, do 
you think he has to discharge it or that he has to 
brandish it?  It is the passive voice.  Does it mean if 
anybody discharges it or brandishes it?

 MS. MAYNARD:  Two -- at least two points 

about that, Your Honor.  The passive voice makes clear 
that Congress cared about the fact of the discharge, 
that Congress was indifferent as to who discharged the 
weapon.  Because the "is brandished" is also stated in 
the passive voice, we think Congress was also

indifferent as to who brandished the firearm, although 
there is a separate provision giving content to what it 
means to brandish, and brandish must be done in order to 
intimidate.  So -- but if a confederate, for example --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Grabs it out of his hand 

and brandishes it.

 MS. MAYNARD:  -- and brandishes in order to 

intimidate the victims in the bank, then yes, both of 
them would be subject to the brand -- to the brandishing 
enhancement.  And even if one thought that the language 
in the -- in the sentencing factor, "if the firearm is 
discharged," applied only to the defendant's conduct, 
which -- that's not our position, and we think that 
clearly -- it clearly encompasses others -- ordinary 
liability rules under Pinkerton and aiding and abetting 
principles would hold a confederate liable for discharge 
by another.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So even if the 

police officer -- the police officer disarms the robber 
and ten minutes later mishandles the gun and it goes 
off.

 MS. MAYNARD:  Again, I think that would 
present questions about whether or not the section 
924(c) offense was still continuing, if the law 
enforcement officer has the weapon.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, assuming it 

is.  I mean, he has got the one guy neutralized but the 
others are still, you know, under the teller's window, 
and that isn't over.  So then the guy who is captured 
already gets an extra three years because the officer 
mishandled the gun?

 MS. MAYNARD:  If the section 924(c) offense 
is -- is -- is ongoing and if the firearm is discharged, 
the mandatory minimum sentence applies.  One might 
conclude that if third parties take the weapon and 
discharge it -- and, by the way, I do believe these are 
purely hypotheticals.  They point to no case where 
that's actually been the case -- but --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, there probably 

aren't a lot of cases where the bank robbers are such 
klutzes that they're fumbling with the gun and it goes 
off, either.

 MS. MAYNARD:  That's true, there may not be 
very many accidental discharges.  But there's no reason 
to believe Congress wanted courts to engage in the 
inquiry about whether or not the defendant accidentally 
discharged the weapon.  If this Court were to her -- to 
hold that accident -- accidental discharges are not 
covered by the sentencing factor, I think that we would 
see more claims of accidental discharge.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I interrupted your 

answer.

 MS. MAYNARD:  About the third -- if one is 

concerned about the actions of third parties who are not 
confederates in any way taking the weapon -- and we do 
believe it does under the statute's language need to be 
the firearm that is the basis of the section 924(c) 
offense, and not someone else's firearm.  But if -- if 
-- in other words, not the security guard's firearm.  If 
the firearm is discharged by third party causes you 
concern, one could conclude that that is not the manner 
in which the defendant committed the offense; and that 
this Court's decision in Harris described this type of 
sentencing factor, these very sentencing factors, as the 
kind of factor that one looks at:  Is a fact present in 
the manner in which the defendant committed the offense?

 And so one might conclude that if the law 
enforcement officer disarms the robber and then later 
discharges the weapon, that that fact of a discharge is 
not part of the manner in which the defendant committed 
the offense.  We don't think that's compelled, by the 
way.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It would be the same --

you would give the same answer if the teller grabbed the 
gun from the robber and it went off?

MS. MAYNARD:  If the teller grabs the gun 

from the robber and it discharges, as long as the 
section 924(c) offense is continuing, then the firearm 
is discharged.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But your alternate 

position would apply to the teller as well as the police 
officer?

 MS. MAYNARD:  One could reasonably conclude 

that if the teller discharges it, it is in fact the 
manner in which the defendant committed the offense. 
But I do think there's reason to believe Congress may 
have been concerned about the fact of the discharge by 
anyone.  I mean, what you're talking about is someone 
who's engaging in inherently dangerous activity.  They 
brought an armed weapon to commit a crime of violence or 
a drug trafficking crime, and they've handled it in such 
a way that either it is discharged --

JUSTICE BREYER:  There is another --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  We don't really have to 
decide all this stuff, do we?  We just have to decide 
whether if he discharges it the discharge has to be 
intentional.

 MS. MAYNARD:  There is no question here, 

Your Honor, but that it was the robber that discharged 
the weapon.  And in fact the Petitioner testified that:

"I pulled the trigger when I was switching the gun from 
one hand to the other."

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But it's also uncontested 

it was accidental, I think.

 MS. MAYNARD:  We have not challenged that it 

was accidental.  But I think that it --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  What do you say to your 

opponent's argument -- I don't know if it's right or not 
-- but that there's sort of a background rule that 
generally we assume when Congress prohibits conduct, it 
means intentional conduct; and normally if they don't 
mean that, they make it rather clear in the statute.
 Is that a correct -- is his background 

principle correct?

 MS. MAYNARD:  I don't think so, Justice 

Stevens, with respect to sentencing factors.  I think 
there's no case in which this Court has indicated -- and 
no common law principles --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  What's the difference 

between a sentencing factor that adds five years to a 
sentence and an element of the crime?  There are a lot 
of us that think that -- you've read Harris and 
Apprendi.  You know there is some debate about whether 
that really makes all that much difference.

in which this Court was interpreting these very 
sentencing factors here, the Court note -- noted that --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me -- let me rephrase 

the question.

 MS. MAYNARD:  Yes.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  If it were an element of 

the crime, would you then agree with his background 
rule?

 MS. MAYNARD:  No, Your Honor, because if it 

were an element --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Then the fact that the 

sentencing factor is an element really isn't 
significant.

 MS. MAYNARD:  I think it might be a harder 
case for us if it were an element of the crime, but it 
wouldn't be an element that would be necessary.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But why would it be a 

harder case for you?

 MS. MAYNARD:  Why would it be a harder case 

for us?  Because if it were a harbor -- hard -- if it 
were an element of the crime, then it would be an 
aggravated offense, and then one could debate whether or 
not the --

Congress intends to punish intentional conduct?

 MS. MAYNARD:  I think there is a background 
rule with respect to the definition of criminal offenses 
that Congress intends some mens rea.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  So you really then are 
relying on the difference between an element of the 
crime and a sentencing factor?

 MS. MAYNARD:  Not -- no, Your Honor, not in 
this way, because it -- it would -- it would be a more 
difficult caper -- case for us, I can see, but that you 
would still be talking about somebody who was engaged in 
wrongful conduct.  There would be no danger.

 I mean, one of the reasons the Court assumes 

a mens rea requirement or reads in a mens rea 
requirement when one's not there, is because of the fear 
of capturing innocent conduct; but what you would be 
talking about is someone who has taken a loaded weapon 
to commit a crime of violence or a drug trafficking 
crime and used it during in relation to that crime or to 
possess it in furtherance of that crime, and is already 
guilty.  They are engaged in --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's entirely

inherently dangerous activity.

That's my point, they both did exactly the same thing.
 MS. MAYNARD:  And it's common in criminal 
law to hold criminals responsible for their unintended 
consequences of their criminal acts, and that's -- in 
your hypothetical it wouldn't be unusual at all to hold 
someone liable for the accidental discharge when they've 
taken a loaded weapon to commit a violent crime, here a 
bank robbery, and handled it in such a way that it goes 
off.  It's completely reasonable for Congress to 
conclude --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You get three extra 

years for having bad luck?

 MS. MAYNARD:  Well, no, well they're -- just 

to be clear, they're both subject to life imprisonment 
for taking the gun and committing -- and using it to 
commit the bank robbery.  So it's not tacking on three 
years; it's increasing the minimum; and that is a 
significant difference, Justice Stevens that this Court 
has recognized with respect to these various factors in

Harris itself, that the -- whether or not there was a 
discharge.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, is this guy 

likely to get life for a bank robbery, the gun 
accidentally goes off?  I don't know whether it's his 
first offense or not.

 MS. MAYNARD:  As a practical matter, no, 

Your Honor.  However, had the accidental discharge 
caused a death, then he would have committed a more 
serious offense, and that may have been the penalty. 
But the point is that one is often subject to higher 
penalties than one might have expected by the unintended 
consequences of one's criminal act.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What would you think -- to 
go back to Justice Stevens' question, I would start with 
the assumption that, normally, not always, where you 
have a criminal statute and the crime has elements, that 
Congress intends that the elements be carried out with a 
guilty state of mind; I would start with that 
assumption.

 Now I would agree with you that sentencing 

is different, and the reason that it's different is 
because sentencing often goes up or down depending upon 
whether the harm that is foreseen does or does not 
occur, irrespective of the state of mind.  So we

couldn't apply that normal background rule, in my view.
 MS. MAYNARD:  I think that's correct, Your 

Honor, and that's our view.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Now -- now, having done 
that I wonder if the background rule should come into 
play once again where a mandatory minimum sentence is at 
stake, for the reason that if the harm eventuates, there 
are many ways in which the sentence will go up.  If this 
person had been killed, for example, it becomes a murder 
in the course of a felony.  There are all kinds of other 
statutes that can aggravate the felony; and if you don't 
apply the mandatory minimum, the judge still can give 
him the higher sentence, if he warrants it.

 But if you apply the mandatory minimum where 
the judge wouldn't go up, the only impact that has is to 
take people who the judge and others think fall into the 
minimal category of bad behavior plus consequences, and 
force them to have a higher sentence.  Now, that would 
be a rationale for a rule of lenity in mandatory minimum 
sentencing matters.

 MS. MAYNARD:  But that would be a 

reconceptualization of the rule of lenity, Justice 
Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, it would.  It would.
 MS. MAYNARD:  And what, it would be a -- as

you said for this Court, in Muscarello, the rule of 
lenity has never been a rule where the defendant always 
prevails; and it would be an odd notion to have a more 
muscular rule of the rule of lenity in the sentencing 
enhancement context than you have with respect to the 
crime itself.

 The whole point of having the mandatory 

minimum is to take away discretion from judges.  What --
and the language of the statute here in our view is 
clear.  It says "if the firearm is discharged," and I 
think it's the present tense that gets you the -- the 
temporal connection to the crime here.  If it is 
discharged while you are using or carrying it or 
possessing it, in the offense in the principal 
paragraph, Congress wanted you to have ten years.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I can't -- I can't --
the trouble is I can't find anything in the history of 
this that really says why they use "is discharged" or 
used "as opposed to discharges."  And I find those very 
metaphysical, those arguments, unless I -- I can see 
either something in the history or some functional 
consideration.

 MS. MAYNARD:  Well, in the blue brief they 

lay out the House's final version, and we have the 
House's final version in one of our footnotes.  And then

they lay out the Senate's final version.

 And one important distinction, Justice 

Breyer, between those two versions is that the House's 
version would have made it active voice, but not only 
active.  But it would have been amenable to the argument 
that during and in relation to -- discharges, because 
it's structured different.

 But the House would have set the penalty for 
a discharge at 20 years.  Okay.  That's -- you can infer 
from that that the House thought an intentional 
discharge should subject you to 20 years.

 The Senate's version, which put it in the 

passive voice, said if the firearm is discharged and set 
a mandatory minimum of 10 years.  And I think you can 
infer from that, Justice Breyer, the -- the current 
structure allows what you're positing, which is more 
culpable defendants who intend to discharge the firearm 
to receive a higher sentence.  And one could infer, I 
think, that the House thinks that should be 20 years.

 So I think the -- the current structure does 

allow judges to take into consideration.  It just sets 
the floor.  And Congress is entitled to do that, and I 
think they have clearly done that and then to take out 
of the realm of debate whether or not the defendant 
intended to discharge the firearm or didn't mean to

discharge the firearm.

 I would like to -- to say one factual point, 
which is in the -- in the indictment Petitioner actually 
was charged with use or carrying.  It just seems -- if I 
could explain, the "use or carry during or in relation 
to," is one prong, one way in which to commit the 
principal offense.

 "Possessing in furtherance" is another way 
to commit the principal offense.  The "use or carry" is 
not modified by "possession in furtherance of," and 
"possess" is not modified by -- by "during or in 
relation to," which is another reason it makes no sense 
to -- to trail the "during or in relation to" down to 
the generally applicable sentencing factors.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there a difference, a 

practical difference, between the two formulations?

 MS. MAYNARD:  The legislative -- well, the 

words are actually different; the text is different; and 
the legislative history suggests that Congress wanted a 
beefed-up "in relation to" requirement for possession in 
order to make sure that incidental possession during --
you know, incidental possession while one is also 
committing a crime wasn't captured.  So the "in 
furtherance of" --

make sure I understand, is that the "in relation to" 
language modifies both "use" and "possession"?

 MS. MAYNARD:  No, sir.  The "in relation to" 
-- the "during or in relation to" modifier modifies only 
"use or carry."  And if one is charged with a "use or 
carry" offense, then the government must show that you 
"used or carried during or in relation to" in the way 
those words have been given meaning by this Court.
 If you're charged with possession, the 

government must show that you possessed the firearm in 
furtherance of.  Now, the -- the "in furtherance of" and 
the "in relation to" prong have been given similar 
meanings by the courts, although generally it's thought 
that the "in furtherance of," like I say, is a sort of 
beefed up "in relation to" requirement because --

JUSTICE BREYER:  "Carries," what about 
"carries"?  If a person is carrying the gun in his 
pocket but he doesn't know it, which could happen, does 
that fall within "carries" or not?

 MS. MAYNARD:  He would be carrying, Justice 

Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So is he guilty of the 

first; do we know?

 MS. MAYNARD:  He would be carrying -- if I

also committing a crime, he would be carrying -- if he 
was also committing a crime of violence, he would be 
carrying it during the crime of violence.  But under 
this Court's decision in Smith, if it were --

JUSTICE BREYER:  The carrying has to be --

although the statute doesn't say it, Smith says the 
carrying has to be in relation to the crime.

 MS. MAYNARD:  The statute does say that 

carrying has to be in relation to --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought it just said "who 

in furtherance of any such crime possesses a firearm."
 MS. MAYNARD:  I am sorry.  I thought you 

were asking me a "carry" hypothetical.  If you are 
asking me a "possession" hypothetical --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it's a "carrying."  My 
-- my interest is the -- whoever, blah, blah, blah, for 
which the person may be prosecuted uses or carries a 
firearm, or who in furtherance of any such crime 
possesses a firearm.  So I thought that the "in 
furtherance" does not modify "carry".
 MS. MAYNARD:  It doesn't.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.
 MS. MAYNARD:  You are right.  Okay.  I am 

sorry.  I answered --

if the person has the firearm -- he is carrying the 
firearm in his pocket and doesn't know it?  He picked it 
up from the tailor, and now is -- is there an intent 
requirement there?  Do we know?  Did Smith talk about 
that?  Do we know?  I mean is there, you know, a state 
of mind requirement?

 MS. MAYNARD:  It's hard to see how one could 

meet this Court's definition in Smith for -- for "in 
relation to," which was to have --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Smith says "in relation to" 
and so the carrying has to be in relation to.  And since 
the carrying has to be in relation to, that pretty much 
--

MS. MAYNARD:  The underlying --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- covers the state of 

mind.

 MS. MAYNARD:  The carrying had to be in 

relation to the underlying drug crime or crime of 
violence.  This Court gave content to "in relation to" 
in Smith to mean have some purpose or effect, facilitate 
or further the underlying crime, not be by accident or 
coincidence.

 The gist of Petitioner's argument here is 

they want to read that "accident or coincidence" 
language down to modify "discharge."  And structurally

that -- that just doesn't work.  And if -- if I can make 
one more point about why it's clear it isn't that, which 
is that the -- the "in possession in furtherance of 
requirement" -- I mean one of the things they say in 
response to our argument is that we are willing to put a 
temporal limitation on the sentencing factors, but not 
an "in relation to" --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I just make sure I 

understand your position?  "During and in relation to" 
modifies the first words it follows.  "In furtherance 
to" modifies "possession."  Now, do either "in relation 
to" or "in furtherance" to it modify the three 
subsequent subparagraphs?

 MS. MAYNARD:  Definitely not, no.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  So neither of them 

applies.  So it doesn't have to be "in furtherance of" 
or "in relation to"?

 MS. MAYNARD:  The -- the sentencing factors 

are set out separately.  And you don't get to them --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  None of the sentencing 
factors require that that factor be in -- either in 
relation to the crime or in furtherance of the crime? 
It could be just walking down the street, you happen to 
have a gun?

the principal offense, Justice Stevens, before you get 
to sentencing factors.  So you have to have either --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Sentencing factors need 
not be in relation to the crime nor in furtherance of 
the crime.

 MS. MAYNARD:  Right.  The definitive --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It has to be during the 

crime.

 MS. MAYNARD:  It has to be during and -- but 
there -- but it's not because the word "during" appears 
in the principal offense, which is how they would have 
our argument be.  The -- the -- it has to -- the 
sentencing factor has to occur.  First you have to 
commit the principal -- let me just back up.  You have 
to commit the principal offense.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Why does it have to be 

"during"?  It -- it doesn't in the statute?

 MS. MAYNARD:  It has to be "during" for 

three reasons.  One, the -- the language of the 
sentencing factor says if the firearm is discharged. 
It's in the present tense.  So the present tense of the 
"is discharged" language -- it has to be while you're 
using, carrying -- "uses, carries, or possesses" is also 
in the act.

 The "is discharged" has to happen while

you're using, carrying, or possessing.  That takes out 
hypotheticals about, well, it was discharged at the 
factory before I got it, and law enforcement discharged 
it well after they took it from me to test the 
ballistics on it.  Those aren't covered because it's not 
"is discharged" while you're using, carrying or 
possessing.

 Secondly, this Court in Harris recognized 

that these are the types of sentencing factors that one 
considers when deciding whether a certain fact is 
present in the manner in which an offense is committed. 
So the fact has to be present in the commission of the 
offense.  That's just the way this type of sentencing 
factor operates, and the courts so interpreted these 
particular sentencing factors in Harris.

 And we know that it's not because of the 
"during" in the principal paragraph, Justice Stevens, 
because there is no "during" element to the "possession" 
prong.  Nevertheless, the sentencing factors apply to 
that prong, and we would apply temporal in cases that --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  There is an "in 

furtherance."  There is an "in furtherance of the 
crime."

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I want to make sure I 

understand.  You are saying it need not be "during" or 
-- you said it has to be "during" but not because the 
statute includes the word "during."

 MS. MAYNARD:  Yes.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, what does -- where 

does the "during" come from then?

 MS. MAYNARD:  The "during" comes from the 

fact that the sentencing factor is in the present tense, 
and says "is discharged."  That means that the "is 
discharged" must occur while the offense is -- is 
occurring.  So the temporal limitation comes from, and 
is from, the nature of these types of sentencing 
factors, which ask:  Is this factor present?  That's 
what Congress cared about.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you say it can't come 

from the prologue, because if it came from the prologue, 
it wouldn't apply to the mere possession.

 MS. MAYNARD:  Exactly.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the possession could be 

at any time, before the crime, after the crime, 
whatever.

 MS. MAYNARD:  Possession -- it would just 

have to be possession that was in furtherance of an 
underlying crime.  Once you're guilty of that, if the

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you have to import some 
-- some contemporaneous -- contemporaneous requirement 
into the 1, 2, and 3.

 MS. MAYNARD:  Some temporal limitation, and 
the limitation is what -- is that it must be discharged 
while you're committing the offense for which you're 
being sentenced when we're looking at sentencing 
factors, which is set forth in 924(c).

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if it's committed when 

the guy is trying to escape, and the gun goes off 
accidentally?  Is that in -- I mean is that during the 
crime?

 MS. MAYNARD:  Again, it would turn on -- on 
-- it wouldn't turn on whether accidental or intentional 
discharge, Justice Stevens.  That would present a 
difficult hypothetical about whether or not the 924(c) 
--

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Two hours later when he got 

home -- he carried the gun in -- IN furtherance of the 
crime.  He still had it with him all the way through, 
and the gun went off after he left the bank.

in furtherance of crime, were still going on at that

point -- in other words he was still possessing it in 
furtherance of the underlying crime of violence, and it 
discharges -- then, yes, the sentencing factor, by its 
plain terms, applies.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Then you're telling me 

that it need not be during as long as it's in 
furtherance of.  So the "in furtherance of" is also 
incorporated implicitly in the sentencing factors.
 MS. MAYNARD:  Well, the -- no, the "in 

furtherance of," it -- the inquiry we would be making at 
sentencing, Justice Stevens, is not was the discharge in 
furtherance of.  You would -- you would -- all you would 
be asking is, were you still possessing the firearm in 
furtherance --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  This must be during?
 MS. MAYNARD:  The discharge must be 

temporally related to the principal offense, yes, 
because the discharge is discharged while you're in the 
course of the principal offense, that's the way these 
types of sentencing factors --

uses or carries a firearm.

 MS. MAYNARD:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So there it is right there, 
or who in furtherance of such a crime possesses shall be 
sentenced.  Okay.  So we've got the during and in 
relation to covering the whole bunch.  Then we have to 
read that into little (ii) and little (iii).

 MS. MAYNARD:  No, Your Honor.  I mean, just 
to make sure I understand what you're say.  The "during 
and in relation to" only modifies the verb "uses or 
carries"?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, exactly.
 MS. MAYNARD:  Okay.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Then we have to read that 

by implication where it says if the firearm is 
brandished during or -- you have to imply that.
 MS. MAYNARD:  That's their argument.

argument?

 MS. MAYNARD:  No, Your Honor.
 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Forget it.

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not your argument 

because if that was the only -- if that was the source 
of the contemporaneous requirement, there would be no 
contemporaneous requirement for the in furtherance?
 MS. MAYNARD:  That's right.  And also --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The provision -- the in 

furtherance provision.

 MS. MAYNARD:  The reason we don't believe 
that's the correct reading is because, as this Court 
indicated in Harris, the principal offense -- the 
principal paragraph sets forth the complete crime, and 
it ends with "shall."  So once you do the things in the 
principals for crime, you're guilty.  And then the only 
question is, what shall your sentence be?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And, of course, some of 

these difficult hypotheticals such as the one that 
Justice Stevens put about the gun going off while the --
while the individual is escaping, that's going to be a 
problem whether you adopt your interpretation or the --
or the petitioner's interpretation, even if you assume 
that it has to be during and in relation to it's still 
going to be a problem.  Is this -- is this during and in

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't have to decide 

that.

 MS. MAYNARD:  It wouldn't have anything to 

do with whether it intentionally goes off, Justice 
Stevens.  Your hypothetical could still raise a

JUSTICE STEVENS:  The strange thing about 

this case is we're talking about a category of crimes in 
which somebody person mistakenly fires the gun, that 
doesn't happen very often.  The whole -- the whole 
dispute is about really a trivial set of crimes.

 MS. MAYNARD:  Well, I think it's important 
to recognize, though, that Congress didn't want to open 
the door to claims that -- that the firearm was 
discharged accidentally.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Sure, when the 

defendant -- and says I didn't really mean to shoot the 
guy?

 MS. MAYNARD:  Right.  I mean, the -- the 

fact of a discharge is what Congress is clearly 
concerned about, and you can tell that from the text. 
What it did want to say is that in the indictment here 
he was actually charged with uses, carries, and

possesses.  The indictment is not perfectly worded.  It 
only has the "during and in relation to," and it -- but 
the -- the instructions were proper and there were no --
the jury instructions in trial were proper and there 
were no objection to the instructions, but I did want to 
correct one point about that.

 And if there are no further questions --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Four minutes, Mr. Forster.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT J. FORSTER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FORSTER:  This Court in U.S. Gypsum was 

very clear when it said that far more than the simple 
omission of the appropriate phrase of a statutory 
definition is necessary to justify dispensing with the 
intent requirement.

 And our argument is simply this, merely 

because this might be a sentencing enhancement rather 
than an element of the offense, this Court never says 
that the normal rules of statutory construction cease to 
apply under those circumstances, which means that the 
mens rea presumption is appropriate in this case, and 
just like this Court said in the passage I just cited.

 If Congress wants to dispense with that 

requirement, they must do so clearly, and they simply

did not do that in this case.  If they wanted to do 
that, they could insert the words "intentionally" or 
"unintentionally discharge," in which case that would be 
clear.  And that simply is not the way this statute 
reads.

 The best reading of the statute, I believe, 

and this is what Your Honor was headed toward, is to 
read the discharge to require during and in relation to. 
I just think that's the best --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that helping?  I mean, 
this did take place during, and you would have thought 
when something goes off accidentally it's in relation 
to.  I mean, you know, I can imagine an argument to the 
contrary, but it isn't obvious.  It just is --

MR. FORSTER:  But, Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER:  They have during, in 

relation to and in furtherance of, so their in 
furtherance of doesn't carry over.  The first two do. 
An accidental discharge is it not in relation to the 
crime?

 MR. FORSTER:  Not under this Court's 

authority in Smith.  I think Smith is clear, the purpose 
and effect and not be used by accident.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  What was the case you 

cited when you started your rebuttal?

MR. FORSTER:  U.S. Gypsum.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Is that the antitrust 

case?  You caught me by surprise.

 MR. FORSTER:  I believe it is.  I believe it 

is, Your Honor.

 Mr. Chief Justice, if there are no other 

questions, I thank the Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel, 

the case is submitted.
