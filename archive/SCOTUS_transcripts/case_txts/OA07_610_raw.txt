 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument next in Case 07-610, Locke v. Karass.

 Mr. Young.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. JAMES YOUNG
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. YOUNG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This case addresses whether the First and 

Fourteenth Amendments permit public employers to compel 
nonunion employees to subsidize the union's expressive 
speech of a political nature in a public forum, 
specifically litigation in courts and before 
administrative agencies not involving their bargaining 
unit.

 We submit that the answer to this question 

is no, a result supported by the Court's unanimous, 
unambiguous, and categorical holding in Ellis.  In 
Ellis, this Court held that, to avoid constitutional 
problems, nonmembers under the Railway Labor Act could 
not be forced to subsidize any litigation not arising 
within their bargaining unit, not even litigation to 
enforce another bargaining unit's agreement in 
bankruptcy proceedings.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But, of course, they 

wouldn't be subsidizing it if -- if, indeed, it is some 
kind of a -- essentially an insurance scheme.  They --
they contribute to the national union, and in exchange 
the national union defends their interest just as it 
defends the interest of other unions.  You didn't 
address that -- that pooling argument.

 MR. YOUNG:  I would respectfully disagree, 

Justice Scalia, but my answer to your question --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't seem to me fair 

to call it "subsidizing" if, in fact, that's what's 
going on.

 MR. YOUNG:  Well, it is also not fair, 

Justice Scalia, to call it "insurance."  It's 
affiliation, and the answer to the question --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know because that 

wasn't inquired into by the court below.  I guess we 
really -- we really don't know, do we, when -- whether 
the local union can make any demands upon the -- upon 
the national union for -- for litigation defense?

 MR. YOUNG:  Well, I think we can rely, 

Justice Scalia, on the admissions contained in MSEA's 
brief, which clearly concedes that, in fact, SEIU has no 
enforceable obligations under its affiliation 
arrangement with MSEA.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if we don't call it 

"insurance," can we all it "pooling"?

 MR. YOUNG:  Well, of course, that -- that is 

what they call it, Justice Kennedy.  And -- and -- and 
pooling is -- is certainly something that we believe the 
Court rejected in Ellis when it set forth a categorical 
rule.

 The pooling argument was raised in the 

briefs in Ellis, and this Court did not see fit to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Young, I thought that 

in Ellis the litigation -- the Ellis Court said that 
that litigation did not have as its subject matter 
negotiation or administration of a collective bargaining 
contract.

 MR. YOUNG:  I don't believe that's the case, 

Justice Ginsburg, because Ellis dealt with enforcing a 
bargaining agreement.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm quoting from -- I'm 

quoting from that decision at page 453.  The case 
involved litigation "not involving negotiation or 
administration of a collective bargaining contract."

 MR. YOUNG:  Well, of course, Justice 

Ginsburg, the -- some of the litigation did involve 
enforcing another bargaining unit's agreement in 
bankruptcy proceedings.  I don't know how that is not

enforcing --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, are you saying the 
Court got it wrong?  I mean, the words that I'm quoting 
are from the opinion:  "Not involving negotiation or 
administration of a collective bargaining contract."

 MR. YOUNG:  Well, that -- that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's the only thing 
that could be germane.  If it doesn't relate to that, 
then your case is solid.

 MR. YOUNG:  Well, I'm trying -- I'm -- I'm 
trying to find the specific language, Justice Ginsburg, 
and I apologize for my inadequacy in this regard.  But I 
think the point that we -- I think the point that we 
would rely on in Ellis in -- in -- in the very paragraph 
that you referred to is the specificity with which this 
Court discussed what was chargeable.  It referred to the 
contract, for instance.  It referred to the exclusive 
representative twice; not an exclusive representative, 
but the exclusive representative.  It referred to the 
bargaining unit not less than five times in that single 
paragraph in discussing what was permissible under the 
Railway Labor Act.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you want to stand or fall 
on the all-or-nothing argument that nonmembers can never 
be required to pay for any extra-unit litigation

expenses, or do you have an -- an additional argument?
 MR. YOUNG:  Well, no, Justice Alito.  We 

believe -- we believe that the -- the Ellis standard is 
the constitutional standard as both principal opinions 
in Lehnert discuss.

 In -- in Lehnert, Justice Blackmun 

specifically recognized it in his -- in his plurality 
opinion; and Justice Scalia himself said there was good 
reason -- good cause to treat Ellis as stating the 
constitutional rule.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, do you take -- do you 
take that as -- as -- as meaning that the union couldn't 
buy litigation insurance?

 MR. YOUNG:  Real insurance, Justice Souter? 

I think that -- obviously that would be a --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Some of those -- some of 
those premiums are going to subsidize the defense in --
in -- in cases beyond this bargaining unit.  In fact, 
most of it will.

 MR. YOUNG:  Well -- but the distinction, 

Justice Souter, I think is discussed in the brief, 
amicus brief, filed by Pacific Legal Foundation.  For 
one thing, it would not be the labor union that would be 
-- another labor union receiving those insurance funds. 
It would be a third-party insurer, presumably.  That

would be --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  So -- so in your view, 

then, even if the agreement with the -- with the parent 
union in this case involved an explicit obligation on 
the part of the parent to come in and defend in -- if 
litigation arose in this unit, that would still be bad?
 MR. YOUNG:  It would add the -- the insult 

of the --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, I'm not interested in 

insults.  Is it -- is it constitutional, or isn't it?
 MR. YOUNG:  We believe it would not be if 
the international affiliate were the insurer, Justice 
Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Then -- and -- and -- and 
you do take the position that a -- a genuine insurance 
policy issued by an insurer would not violate the 
constitutional standard?

 MR. YOUNG:  That -- that is the -- that is 

our argument, Justice Souter.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Even though -- even 

though there may be a great disconnect between the 
premiums and the needs of the particular unit?  I mean, 
let's say the particular unit has -- I don't know -- has 
always had a history of good relations with the 
employer.  It has never had to call upon litigation in

20 years, and they don't anticipate it, and yet their 
insurance premiums rise dramatically because of very 
hostile and extended litigation by another unit.  Do you 
-- do you concede that case?

 MR. YOUNG:  I -- I don't think -- well, I 

don't think I would concede the premise of your 
question, Mr. Chief Justice.  The -- and I think that 
point is -- is discussed fairly thoroughly in Pacific 
Legal Foundation's brief.

 A rate setting in an insurance context is --
is radically different than the affiliations fee setting 
in this context.  Rate -- and -- and much more about 
insurance than, frankly, I know; but it -- it certainly 
is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but it's based on the 
experience of the whole -- the whole cohort of insureds.

 MR. YOUNG:  It's also --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the Chief Justice's 

question says:  Can a -- can a -- a local that is 
certainly on the basis of past experience not going to 
need this insurance nearly as much as other locals --
can it enter into an insurance arrangement with other 
locals to buy the insurance for all of the locals even 
though it knows that it won't benefit very much from 
that insurance policy?

MR. YOUNG:  I'm sorry.  I misunderstood.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That was -- he was trying 

to help you.

 MR. YOUNG:  And I'm sorry, Chief Justice 

Roberts.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You should have said, yes, 

Chief Justice.

 MR. YOUNG:  And -- and I -- and I appreciate 
the help, Mr. Chief Justice, and your pointing that out, 
Justice Scalia.  My -- I -- I misunderstood the 
question, and I apologize.

 Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.  The -- the -- our 

point would be, however, that in that type of 
relationship and I -- as I said, that's --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Does that mean that each 

time they buy an insurance policy they have to 
investigate which locals are going to get the most 
benefit out of it?

 MR. YOUNG:  Well, I don't think that's a --
that's a decision for the locals.  That's the insurer 
setting rates, and -- and I -- I don't know of a market, 
quite honestly, Justice Stevens, for that type of 
insurance.

to the Chief Justice on the facts he gave and a 
different one if the record showed that everybody got a 
proportional benefit out of the group policy?

 MR. YOUNG:  I don't -- no, Justice Stevens. 
I don't think my question -- my answer would differ.  I 
think, however --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  So your answer doesn't 
depend, then, on the facts that he included in that 
question?

either.

 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  I'm not sure he was, 

 MR. YOUNG:  Well, one looks for it where one 

can find it, Justice Stevens and Mr. Chief Justice.

 The differing -- I think that the 

distinction has to be made here between insurance on the 
one hand and affiliation.  There -- in -- in the 
insurance context you have --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Does that mean all 

insurance policies are bad?

 MR. YOUNG:  No, no, no.  I -- I -- I concede 

insurance, Justice Stevens.  I -- my point -- if it is 
true insurance, insurance where there is mutuality of

obligation.

 The difficulty that this Court, I believe, 
found in the Ellis case when it set a bright-line test 
was that it was public -- and I -- and I think can be 
discerned from the Court's other cases, including 
Glickman -- is we're talking about public speech, speech 
of a political nature in a public forum.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, there was -- there 
was mutuality of obligation in the hypothesis that I 
gave you in which the agreement with the parent union 
required an affirmative obligation of the parent union 
to come in and defend if litigation arose.  And you said 
that still would not be constitutional.

 MR. YOUNG:  And I -- and I --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  So the -- so the criterion 

has got to be something other than mutuality of 
obligation, right?

 MR. YOUNG:  And it assuredly is, Justice 

Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  And what is the other 

distinction?

 MR. YOUNG:  The other distinction has to be 
that it is not -- it is -- the problem also arises from 
the nature of the forced relationship.  As this Court 
has recognized in cases such as Ellis and Abood,

allowing the agency shop at all works an infringement on 
First Amendment rights.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  We -- we -- we start with 
that premise, but what is the other distinction, then? 
If it is not mutuality of obligation, what -- what is 
the -- what is the -- the -- the -- the point that 
separates the -- the sheep from the goats here?
 MR. YOUNG:  Well, the mutuality of 

obligation coupled with true rate setting in the sense 
that there is a -- there is --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  What -- what is -- what has 

rate setting got to do with -- with your basic point? 
Your basic point, as I understand it, is that some of 
the money that's being taken from the -- from the local 
union and in our example subsidized by the service fee 
is being used to subsidize litigation for other unions. 
And that is, it seems to me, exactly true in the 
insurance case.

 Some of those premiums will subsidize 

litigation -- speech -- involving speech in -- in other 
union bargaining areas.  What's the distinction?

 MR. YOUNG:  Well, the distinction, Justice 
Souter, would be that there is -- it doesn't seem to me 
that there is a -- there is a larger pool created than 
just a union litigation pool in the insurance context.

Furthermore, the -- the -- the money, in fact, is spread 
about --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  I don't know whether that's 

true or not.  If you buy labor litigation insurance I 
suppose it is not.  Don't they set their rates with 
respect to the experience in labor litigation, not in --
on their experience with automobile accidents.

 MR. YOUNG:  I don't know of an insurance 

company that's quite that specific, Justice Souter, nor 
have I ever heard of labor -- labor union insurance --
labor litigation insurance.  So I'm not sure that such a 
market actually exists.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Neither do I.
 MR. YOUNG:  Certainly there is not on this 

record that would suggest so, sir.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I did want to understand 
your position.  Suppose there is a statewide contract 
for public employees and one union brings a suit to 
interpret a provision of that collective bargaining 
agreement having to do with overtime or holidays or 
something.  And then it notifies the other union, we're 
going to have to drop this litigation because we can't 
afford it.  Even though it ultimately may affect you 
down the line, you're not a party.  I don't see the harm 
in allowing the other union to subsidize or

contribute -- use whatever verb you want -- that 
litigation -- that litigation.

 MR. YOUNG:  Well, of course if the other 

union --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- what -- what harm 

are we trying to prevent here?

 MR. YOUNG:  Well, obviously First Amendment 
harm, Justice Kennedy.  But I think understanding -- if 
I understand your hypothetical --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The First Amendment can 
be -- can be a sword or a shield.  This union wants to 
use it as a sword in order to promote, in order to 
protect its rights under the collective bargaining 
agreement.  I don't see the harm.

 MR. YOUNG:  Excuse me, Justice Kennedy.  I'm 

sorry for interrupting you.

 Certainly the union has the right to 

associate as it sees fit.  The First Amendment protects 
that right.  We are not suggesting that it doesn't have 
the right to go out and ask other labor unions to 
contribute to its litigation activities.

 What the First Amendment -- the -- the First 
Amendment right to not speak is -- is involved when, in 
the words of the Ninth Circuit in one of these cases, 
"they seek to mulch from the unwilling moneys for their

speech activities in a public forum."

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What I don't understand 

about --

MR. YOUNG:  I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Finish because there's 

something --

MR. YOUNG:  Thank you, sir.  And my point 

would be under the hypothetical as I understand it, you 
posed a union in -- within the State under the same 
bargaining agreement being asked to support for 
litigation under one of the other locals.  I can think 
of a number of cases where that's actually the case, two 
locals under one bargaining agreement just in my own 
experience.  And so you're not suggesting something 
that's unusual.

 I think under that circumstances that would 

fall squarely within Ellis' rule.  It involves the 
bargaining agreement.  It may not involve the specific 
bargaining unit, but it is concerning the bargaining 
agreement.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's not quite the 
hypothetical.  Let's say there are two bargaining 
agreements but they're identical, and that this 
litigation that's underway will have persuasive force 
for the union that's thinking about entering, and then

the union decides that it is going to enter to help the 
union involved in the suit, and the members of the, of 
the contributing union object and you say they have a 
First Amendment right.  That's your point?

 MR. YOUNG:  Yes, Justice Kennedy.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't see why the 
objects of collective bargaining the, objects of 
union -- of the union, are not being fulfilled.

 MR. YOUNG:  Because that goes beyond the 

free rider rationale which justifies the agency shop in 
the earlier cases such as Hansen and Street.  The free 
rider that the Congress was concerned with -- and of 
course, it's been adopted through Abood to apply to the 
States -- the free rider that Congress was concerned 
with is the free rider that is required to accept the 
union's services and refuses to subsidize those 
services.  And the -- this Court in discussing that in 
terms of lobbying and public relations activities found 
that the relationship was too attenuated.

 Obviously judicial decisionmaking and 

administrative decisionmaking is good for its persuasive 
effect in many different contexts.  But that -- that 
relationship was found to be too attenuated in Ellis and 
with regard to litigation and certainly in Lehnert with 
regard to public relations --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the part I don't 

understand.  It's not your fault.  I don't understand it 
in the cases either.  What First Amendment right are we 
talking about?  There is an individual who, under the 
agency shop, pays dues to a union.  Now, suppose the 
union uses some of that money in a way that has nothing 
to do with politics, nothing to do with speech, but it 
doesn't happen to benefit that particular member.

 For example, you can have a central union 

headquarters 4,000 miles away where there's a librarian 
who's doing research on a matter that will help lots of 
people, but nobody in this area.  Or you could have a 
program to commemorate the people who were hurt in the 
State of Hawaii at a union uprising or strike of some 
kind where nobody in this particular area is ever going 
to go.

 Now, both of those activities are totally 

legitimate union activities that have nothing to do with 
politics.  But this particular place won't benefit from 
them.  Okay, what in the First Amendment prohibits the 
union from paying for such an activity out of general 
union dues assessed on everybody?  And why would the 
First Amendment prohibit such a thing?

 MR. YOUNG:  Under Lehnert, Justice Breyer, 

the expenditures which you posit would be chargeable and

are not at issue here. `

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine.  If they are 
chargeable because they have nothing to do with 
politics, perfectly legitimate, why isn't it also 
chargeable to pay for the costs of a lawsuit which has 
nothing to do with politics, totally for a union 
purpose, it just doesn't happen to benefit that person 
who's miles away in a different local?

 MR. YOUNG:  Because benefit has never been 
the touchstone.  And under Ellis and under Lehnert and 
certain pluralities --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't want you to tell me 
about cases.  I'm abstracting from -- I want to know the 
reasoning.  I want to know why.

 MR. YOUNG:  Because we are talking about 

public -- political speech of a public nature.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I said there is no politics 

in any of these expenditures.  42 bishops would swear 
there is nothing here that has anything to do with 
politics.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why does it have to be 

political speech?  Isn't it enough that it is simply 
speech that certain people don't want to subsidize, or 
speech, so that the commemoration in Hawaii may be 
something that 99.999 percent of the population would

find very commendable, but someone is being forced to 
pay for that?

 MR. YOUNG:  And I may --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But that's the reasoning 
that you seem to accept and I guess all human activity 
is banned.  Because to my knowledge, all human activity 
takes place through speech with a few exceptions that 
are not here relevant.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it isn't banned. 
It's just -- just -- you know, you don't force the 
nonunion member who indeed may be anti-union to pay for 
it.  And he doesn't want to subsidize the union 
librarian.  He doesn't like unions here.  He doesn't 
like unions in Hawaii.  And for the government to force 
him to -- to support the union is, I thought, part of 
the reasoning behind --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I'd be interested in your 

comments on this dialogue.

 MR. YOUNG:  I'd be happy to jump in here 

somewhere, Justice Stevens.  I appreciate the colloquy. 
And I think the distinction -- getting back to the point 
Justice Alito raised, and the sharp distinction that has 
been made in the compelled speech and compelled dues 
cases is between the activities -- certainly in the 
compelled union dues cases, is activities for which

nonmembers are compelled to accept the union as 
bargaining representative.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But why isn't 

litigation -- what I don't understand is how you draw a 
line between the -- the negotiation of an agreement, 
where Lehnert said this kind of pooling is okay, and the 
enforcement of the agreement.  I mean, we're not talking 
about litigation unrelated to collective bargaining.  It 
is only litigation that deals with the meaning of a term 
in the contract, whether what the employer has done was 
an unfair labor practice, whether there has been a 
contractual violation.

 MR. YOUNG:  For the -- I'm sorry, Justice 
Ginsburg.  For the agreement, for the unit, we concede 
that the union may charge for that public speech of a 
political nature in a public forum.  We have no dispute 
over charging for enforcing or -- or -- enforcing the 
collective bargaining agreement.  That is not our 
dispute.

 The dispute here is only over expenditures 
on behalf of other bargaining units, where we believe 
Ellis said it was too attenuated, but because it is 
not -- my point would be that the litigation which is 
acceptably chargeable -- I think the presumptive -- I 
think the default value in this Court's decisionmaking

on litigation is that it's nonchargeable.  However, the 
Court has drawn a narrow exception for that public 
speech in public forum which is related to the union's 
duties as, not related to but in performance of the 
union's duties as bargaining agent the duties for which 
law imposes the union as a bargaining agent.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I don't understand why 
enforcing, one thing is making the agreement and there 
you agree as you must because of our Lehnert decision 
you can't have these pooling arrangements.  What's the 
difference between negotiating an agreement and 
litigation to enforce it.

 MR. YOUNG:  I think that would go back as 
far as Justice Marshall and Marbury.  It would be an 
empty right if the union were able to negotiate an 
agreement it wouldn't be permitted to enforce.  Begins 
begins that's, that's my point.  I can't see the 
difference between saying pooling is okay when we're 
dealing with negotiating an agreement, but it's not okay 
when we're dealing with enforcing it.

 The distinction is, Justice Ginsburg, that 

the negotiation of the agreement does not occur in a 
public forum, whereas litigation does, and that's the 
distinction we would draw.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought the

distinction you were drawing was whether or not the 
collective bargaining agreement applies to the 
particular union.  If it's a different unit with a 
different agreement I thought you were saying that that 
can't be charged, but if it's the bargaining agreement 
that binds the particular unit, I thought you said that 
was chargeable.

 MR. YOUNG:  Mr. Chief Justice, I'm sorry if 
I was confusing.  I thought I was very specific.  It is 
chargeable for litigation involving the bargaining 
agreement.  We don't dispute that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Of the particular 

unit.

 MR. YOUNG:  Of the particular unit.  That is 

not in dispute here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And I suppose you 
would also concede that if the bargaining agreement is 
exactly the same, you know a number of units have 
exactly the same bargaining agreement, which I would 
suppose is a not uncommon situation, but litigation with 
respect to the terms of the bargaining agreement even 
though it happens to involve a different unit is also 
chargeable to the particular unit.

 MR. YOUNG:  No, Mr. Chief Justice, we would 
not concede that.  We believe that this Court in Ellis

drew a bright line, and I think that's clear in Ellis' 
discussion of the mutual aid pact which was not 
chargeable in Ellis, found not chargeable in Ellis.  The 
distinction that I think this Court has drawn or that 
should I would respectfully suggest should be drawn is 
that -- is a narrow one.  It's consistent with strict 
scrutiny and this Court's jurisprudence in that area. 
Only for speech which is narrowly related to the union's 
duties as bargaining agent and performance of those 
duties can public speech -- can charging nonmembers for 
public political speech in a public forum be justified.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Does that mean, because I 
want to be sure -- you exclude the librarian example of 
Justice Breyer?

 MR. YOUNG:  The librarian I think would fall 

under the general Lehnert test.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  So which side?  You have 

to be clear with me.

 MR. YOUNG:  There were a lot of sides there, 

Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  I understand you to be 

saying they could not charge the nonmember for the 
expenses of the Hawaiian librarian.

 MR. YOUNG:  I think it was the Hawaiian 
commemoration that Justice Breyer referred to that I

think I had to rethink, because it was a public speech 
in a public forum.  The librarian researching bargaining 
issues at the union headquarters in downtown Washington 
or -- well, in downtown Washington of the international 
affiliate I think is chargeable under Lehnert.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  The librarian in Hawaii 

researching something that the plaintiff has no interest 
in spending money on, would that be prohibited.

 MR. YOUNG:  Well, here, Justice Stevens, we 

are simply talking about of course the international 
affiliate.  As far as cross-unit affiliation, I'm not 
sure.  I think that would fall under again, general, 
Lehnert's general test.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could you tell us two 

hypotheticals.  One is the librarian, two is the public 
celebration.  Would nonunion, would participating unions 
be allowed to contribute to either of those activities?

 MR. YOUNG:  Well, of course they'd be 

allowed to.  Can they force nonmembers --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Against nonmembers? 

Against members, there has to be a pro-ration, they has 
to be a pro-ration.  A with the librarian, B with the 
celebration.

 MR. YOUNG:  The public celebration, no; the 

librarian, I believe so, yes.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  You have several times 

mentioned the public forum as having a significance in 
drawing the line and I'm not sure I follow you there. 
Why did you say that?

 MR. YOUNG:  Well, I think -- well, Justice 
Souter, that arises from the Court's determinations on 
things like public relations and lobbying and the 
distinction it makes, the distinction for instance in 
Lehnert between the teacher's voice articles and the 
reserve public education program.  The distinction drawn 
from that, the different, differing results is that 
where internal union communications regarding 
nonpolitical matters were treated as chargeable by a 
majority of this Court and where the, outward looking 
speech activities is treated as not chargeable.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Let me ask you this.  If an 

employer and a union local decided that you know they 
would really let the sunshine in and they would conduct 
their collective bargaining in a theater with 
microphones and anybody could drop in and hear, would 
that change the chargibility of, as against the 
dissenting nonmembers.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMIAH A. COLLINS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. COLLINS:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 When this Court in Abood described the kinds 
of expenditures that bargaining agents are are required 
to engage in and that necessitate a rule that requires 
all represented employees including objecting nonmembers 
to pay their share services of lawyers is what the court 
first mentioned.  The single narrow question presented 
in this case is whether a local bargaining agent that's 
confronted with the need to pay for those services of 
lawyers to draw upon legal expertise in bargaining 
related matters is required to go it alone rely solely 
on its open resources and its own expertise or --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's not what 
we are talking about.  It doesn't have to go it alone. 
It simply can't force members of another unit that can 
decide they are happy to support it but the members who 
don't want to support it who don't like unions, they 
can't be forced to pay for it if it does not relate to 
their collective bargaining agreement.

MR. COLLINS:  But the question Mr. Chief 

just sis whether that, I should add if that unit wants 
to not neither go it alone nor give a free ride to 
objecting nonmembers can they avail itself.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If the litigation is 

not germane to the unit where people object to that 
unit's collective bargaining agreement they are not free 
riding on anything.

 MR. COLLINS:  They are free riding on the 
same thing that Lehnert says they cannot free ride on. 
Lehnert as Mr. Young acknowledges certainly holds that 
as a general proposition when a local union bargaining 
agent is determining how to finance germane expenditures 
that it will incur germane to its unit, it can either 
obviously go it alone rely on its own resources or it 
can enter into an affiliation relationship where it will 
pay an affiliation fee the -- of which will be measured 
by the tote chargeable expenditures incurred by the 
National Union in other bargaining units as well as when 
it's the local's own unit.  What Lehnert teaches is that 
that situation cannot fairly be described as requiring 
the objective nonmember to subsidize other units.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if there is no 

-- I guess I'm getting into the solace thor general's 
position here.  What if the unit with the objective

members does not have a right to call upon the pool? 
Either, or has never called upon the pool in its 
unlikely that it will.  Isn't there, it's not simply 
subsidization.  It's their compelled fees being used for 
something that doesn't Ben fate their collective 
bargaining arrangement.

 MR. COLLINS:  There are three problems with 
that contention by the solace the -- general which the 
petitioners have adopted for the first time in their 
reply brief.  The first problem was precisely that.  It 
was not raised in the Court of Appeals, it's not raised 
in the petition for certiorari.  The second problem is I 
should add it's not been raised in any other post 
Lehnert case and I think the reason this issue is not 
being raised is it's understood I think incorrectly that 
Lehnert itself did not solve a situation where the kind 
of showing that the solicitor general and now with the 
Petitioners would require.  In Lehnert where this court 
did approve pooling of a wide range of expenses the 
court simply referred to the fact that the union in that 
case had a unified membership structure which as the 
court put it under which so many unions operate and the 
court talked about the essence of an affiliation 
relationship between that locals can draw on 
international for services but there was no record, this

was no showing, this was no finding, there was no 
discussion of any notion that that local union in 
Lehnert had an enforceable right for any --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Exactly -- I'm 

sorry.  I was just going to say exactly so I regard that 
issue as still open.  It was not addressed at all in 
Lehnert.

 MR. COLLINS:  It was raised in the reply 

brief in Lehnert.  The Petitioners in Lehnert complained 
that a problem with pooling is that there are no 
guarantees and no standards.  That -- that's why there's 
a discussion that's reflected in Justice Scalia's 
separate opinion, a discussion of the fact that it was 
acknowledged that there is no contractual relationship, 
but that there were certain customs and -- and 
practices.  But there was no evidence and certainly no 
determination by this Court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what did the Court 

mean in Lehnert when it said there must be some 
indication the payment is for service that may 
ultimately inure to the benefit of members of the local 
union by virtue of their membership in the parent 
organization?

 MR. COLLINS:  What -- what the Court meant 
by that, I believe, Justice Ginsburg, is that -- well,

look at the examples the Court gave of what does not --
or the Court referred to certain kinds of payments a 
local union could make which are not part of an 
affiliation fee payment.

 The Court talks about direct payments to 

other locals.  The Court -- the other example given was 
a payment to a -- a national union that wasn't required 
by affiliation but was like a charitable contribution.

 What the Court did not dispute in Lehnert is 
that, to the extent that an affiliation fee is providing 
a pool of resources used by the national union for 
otherwise chargeable services, the potential 
availability of those services does satisfy the 
inurement requirement.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose, let's say, that one 

or more locals someplace else in the country are 
involved in very, very expensive litigation; and, as a 
result, the international assesses all of the locals a 
fee to pay -- to pay for that litigation but at the same 
time adopts a position that it is extremely unlikely in 
the future that the international will ever subsidize 
any other local union litigation expenses.

 Would the local -- would a -- would a local 

union not involved in that litigation -- would they --
would it be permissible for them to charge their

nonmembers?

 MR. COLLINS:  If it were a special 

assessment for a specific purpose, I think under -- it 
is not embraced by Lehnert's rationale.  It might not 
well not be chargeable, because what Lehnert -- Lehnert 
does not arise in a vacuum.  Lehnert talks about the 
typical affiliation fee relationship.  And there have 
been various submissions, treatise articles about that.

 So the notion is that a National Union 
charges an affiliation fee for all of the various 
services it provides, and local unions can draw upon 
those resources as needed.  If you then talk about a 
special assessment --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if you concede that, 
then aren't you conceding there has to be some standard 
by -- under which to assess whether the local union that 
is being required to pay the fee for extra-unit 
litigation expenses is getting something back in return?
 MR. COLLINS:  I think not, Your Honor, for 
-- for two reasons.  First, I do think that Lehnert did 
approve --

JUSTICE ALITO:  It's not necessary for there 

to be any standard under which to assess that they are 
getting anything back in return?  If it's clear they are 
not getting anything back in return, it's still okay?

MR. COLLINS:  Not beyond -- and again the 
question isn't presented, but not beyond what Lehnert 
found necessary.  Lehnert found it important -- and I 
would say necessary to its decision -- that the union in 
that case had what Lehnert described as a typical, 
unified, membership-affiliation-fee arrangement; and it 
talks about a typical affiliation fee where locals pay 
money to go to the pools of otherwise chargeable 
expenditures of the national union.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if you have a 

situation where there is a provision in the collective 
bargaining agreement that the union thinks requires the 
employer to provide air conditioning in the plant, the 
local up in Nome, Alaska has to support that extra --
extra-unit litigation even though it will never have any 
benefit for it?

 MR. COLLINS:  Just as Lehnert plainly holds 
that local would have to support the negotiation of that 
provision in the first place in Nome, Alaska.  That's 
the holding of Lehnert.  The question is whether 
litigation is different, and there is no way that 
litigation is different in any principled way as relates 
to the ruling.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought it meant

to support that type of extra-unit litigation.  I mean, 
I --

MR. COLLINS:  Well, I may have misconstrued 

your -- it was litigation over --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.  Yes, there is 
a provision that is ambiguous, which frequently happens, 
and the union says that requires air conditioning, and 
the company says no, and there is a big fight about 
that.

 MR. COLLINS:  Well, I think my answer is 
still correct, Your Honor.  Lehnert does not hold --
well, it does not provide the answer as to litigation; 
but Lehnert says if the union in the first instance says 
we want to go to Nome, Alaska and negotiate something 
about air conditioning, that that, even though it only 
affects the unit in Nome, Alaska, becomes part of the 
pool of chargeable expenditures that all units can be 
part of.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, sure, because 

that negotiation is germane to the Nome, Alaska 
collective bargaining agreement, if they are negotiating 
it there for that unit.

 MR. COLLINS:  But the litigation is equally 
germane.  Petitioners do not dispute that litigation can 
be germane and chargeable within a particular unit.

They acknowledge that; there is no dispute about that. 
So both the negotiation of the air conditioning right in 
Nome, Alaska and the enforcement of that negotiated 
agreement through litigation are equally germane within 
the unit; the same interests are involved --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But aren't they, aren't 
they equal chargeable?  Isn't the unspoken premise of 
your argument and what Lehnert is getting at -- they are 
not only germane, but isn't there an unspoken premise 
that just as the union will support -- the union of the 
dissident objectors in negotiating a collective 
bargaining agreement, the union will also presumably 
support them if litigation is necessary later on to 
enforce it?

 So that the so-called standard by which the 

union's obligation to support the litigation and the 
unit that includes the dissidents is not somehow 
precisely spelled out.  The assumption is that they do 
have some obligation to support the litigation if it 
comes to the dissidents' unit.  And isn't that -- isn't 
that the point of your argument?

 MR. COLLINS:  That's correct, Your Honor, 

and I want to make clear when the Court spoke in Lehnert 
of the essence of an affiliation agreement, an 
affiliation agreement is a contractual relationship.  We

would certainly view that as creating a covenant of good 
faith and fair dealing that the national union will deal 
fairly with its various units.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Which is a covenant, in 

effect, of support.

 MR. COLLINS:  That's correct, and it's 

actually quite analogous in that regard to the duty of 
fair representation that, let's say an unaffiliated 
local union owns to its objecting nonmembers.  The --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you think as a 

covenant of support you have -- however many -- about a 
thousand individual units.  You think each of those, you 
have a covenant to support them when they all get -- get 
involved in separate litigation?  You can't possibly.

 MR. COLLINS:  No, Mr. Chief Justice, what I 
said was a covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  And 
that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it's quite 

unlike, for example, insurance.  If you have insurance 
and you as the unit have a particular obligation, you 
have a right to have that covered.  There is no similar 
right here.

 MR. COLLINS:  That's -- that's correct, Your 

Honor.  The First Amendment does not create a rate 
setting rule for unions.  And the reason for that is --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay, so there is no, there 

is no covenant of support.  There is what?  A covenant 
of support if the litigation in the local unit that 
includes the dissidents has wide significance, and 
therefore could affect other units?  Is that what the --
is that what the obligation is?

 MR. COLLINS:  No, Justice Souter.  I would 

not --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is this any obligation at 

all?  You said okay, there is an obligation of some kind 
of fair dealing.  Given the question that we've got, 
that doesn't matter unless the fair dealing relates at 
some point to support for litigation, right?

 MR. COLLINS:  That the --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Right?
 MR. COLLINS:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.
 MR. COLLINS:  That the National Union --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  And how do we articulate 

what that obligation is?  If it's not covenant to 
support regardless of what the litigation is, how do we 
articulate what the degree of the obligation of support 
is?

 MR. COLLINS:  The way I would articulated 
it, and then I would like to take a step backward and

compare it to the nonaffiliated situation.  I would 
articulate it as follows, that there is no any First 
Amendment requirement, that there is in reality in the 
affiliation agreement simply a covenant of good faith 
and good dealing that one local will be treated with 
respect to litigation needs as others would be treated.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but the trouble with 
saying that is exactly the point that the Chief Justice 
raised.  You don't take the position that no matter what 
the litigation is, the parent union has got to support 
it.  Therefore, how do we identify the litigation that 
they will support?  How do we know that they have any 
obligation at all?

 MR. COLLINS:  They -- they don't have a 
First Amendment obligation, but, Your Honor, that is 
true in the case of agency fees all together.  We have 
to take a step back and remember that we are trying to 
perform an exercise the court has said can't be done to 
perfection of trying to distinguish between making 
individuals who object support collective bargaining 
activities not support other things.

 In Hudson itself, in the basic situation --

let's assume there is no affiliation agreement, simply a 
local union, a fee is charged based on the percentage of 
expenses in the prior year that went for chargeable

activities, including, let's say, litigation.  That 
creates no guarantee that when the year -- in the year 
that we are now in, when fees are being paid, that if 
litigation is demanded, requested by a nonmember or 
anyone else, that that local union will provide --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it doesn't create a 

guarantee expressed like the terms of an insurance 
policy, but there is, in fact, a local practice to which 
one can refer.  And it seems, it would seem reasonable 
in a case like that to say, okay, you can force the 
dissident to pay a fair share on the expectation that 
the same kind of enforcement litigation will take place 
if there is a dispute this year or next year.

 We don't have, as I understand it, a clear 
sort of expectation standard when we are talking about 
affiliation agreements that involve a parent and many, 
many other locals.  And the point here, it seems to me, 
is to determine whether there is any obligation at all 
whether the dissident is getting anything or can expect 
to get anything for the fee.  And what I want to know is 
how do we describe that obligation?

 MR. COLLINS:  I think, at most, the 

obligation is parallel to the duty of fair 
representation in the sense that the entity that's 
responsible for determining what services are going to

be provided to the employees has to treat, in the case 
of the local union members and nonmembers in the unity 
plea, in the case of the national union it's a different 
affiliated entity fairly -- the reason --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So we are talking 
about an infringement on the objecting members' first 
amendment rights, and your answer is trust us, we'll 
treat you fairly?  I understand that it's a different 
answer if you say you've got a right.  We can impose the 
contribution requirement on you, even though you object 
to it because under this agreement, you have a right to 
call upon our services.  That's a different case.  But 
if your answer is simply trust us we'll treat you 
fairly, that's not the usual standard we apply to 
infringements of First Amendment rights.

 MR. COLLINS:  But I have two answers to 

that, Mr. Chief Justice.  First, it is essentially the 
answer that's supplied under Hudson, where the court 
says simply use the prior year's percentages.  We don't 
know whether this year we'll have the same percentage 
breakdown.  We also don't know whether this year the 
union will have enough money to provide any particular 
service or not.  But we don't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's different. 

That's a little bit more stringent than saying trust us.

That's saying let's look at the last year and we'll 
figure it out.

 MR. COLLINS:  But we look at the -- but --
but we look at the national union typical affiliation 
type arrangement, as the court described it in Lehnert, 
and what we understand is this is a union that's not 
making a profit, it's not piling up fees and putting 
them somewhere.  It exists to provide services to local 
affiliates.

 Those affiliates, if they are not provided 

with services, it's not just the nonmember, the objector 
who's being harmed, the members want those services by 
definition.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But couldn't it be, 

couldn't the national say, local, you have asked for 
assistance with such-and-such litigation.  We think your 
case is what this Court sometimes calls a bad vehicle. 
We don't want to finance your litigation, the issue is 
important and we are going to wait for a case that 
presents it in a better light, is more likely to win.

 MR. COLLINS:  Absolutely, Your Honor, that's 

one thing a national union can properly do.  Another 
thing a national union can properly do is to say we've 
just had an unexpected economic crisis, all of a sudden 
midterm we have to change our priorities and we are

going to have to protect people from a lot of layoffs.

 But the second point I want to make --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The issue is not whether 
that's a fair thing for the national union to do.  The 
issue is whether the person who is being compelled 
against his will to pay dues to the union is getting 
anything back for that compelled payment.  And even 
though the national union may be acting in an entirely 
fair fashion, given its national objectives, the -- the 
compelled payment is not doing what our cases seem to 
say it must do.  It has to be paying for services 
rendered.

 MR. COLLINS:  What -- the value the -- the 

objector is getting is not have a guarantee of services. 
He has the potential for services far beyond what could 
ever be paid for out of the local's own affiliation 
fees.

 And I would add if a national union were to 

act in some improper way in terms of how it doles out 
assistance -- and by the way, one doesn't see cases on 
this, it's really not in the nature of how national 
unions operate, because again, we are talking about 
members and nonmembers equally in terms of who's going 
to get benefits.  So it's not a problem in the real 
world of national unions treating a particular local

unfairly for some reason and not giving them services 
that are given to others.  There are certainly a lot of 
judgments involved, as Justice Ginsburg's question 
elicited.

 But if a national union were to treat 

affiliates unfairly, it's quite possible that if and 
when that occurred, that it might have implications 
under a number of possible causes of actions and 
including possibly the right to object.  Justice 
Scalia's opinion in Lehnert noted that if and when 
services aren't provided, there might be ground for 
objection.

 The question here is is this a basis under 

the First Amendment to have a prophylactic rule that 
says we are so concerned that even though we have no 
rule under Hudson that provides assurance that an 
unaffiliated local union will provide any particular 
services to its members and nonmembers, we have such a 
concern that somehow national unions won't deliver the 
goods, that we are going to set up the hierarchy of 
either guarantees, standards, which if the issue had 
been presented here and we had created a record, we 
would show the Court -- I think no union in this country 
has and for good reason, both because of the virtual 
infinitude of legitimate factors one could consider also

because of the constant changes in needs of local 
unions --

JUSTICE ALITO:  If certain -- if certain 

fees are are being assessed on the theory that this is a 
pooling arrangement, I don't understand why you're 
resisting any effort to impose any standards or any 
inquiry as to whether it's really a pooling arrangement?
 MR. COLLINS:  Because, Your Honor -- and the 

reason I started my argument by saying there is really 
two choices, a local union goes it alone or has the 
arrangement that we have here, is that it simply would 
not be possible in the nature of things to have a set of 
standards and guarantees that would be meaningful in any 
way to govern how national unions provide services to 
locals.  A standard of basic fairness and equal 
treatment is one thing, but to try to say -- and one 
could tick off, I suppose, 50 things we'll consider.

 We'll consider whether it's going to be an 
important precedent, whether it's the kind of thing a 
local can't afford on its own, whether it's important 
now that we have pressing economic problems and everyone 
is being laid off, is this a good test case or a bad 
test case, how broad will the implications of this be. 
One could list 50 factors, but they wouldn't guide any 
inquiry in a meaningful way.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if we determine 

as a matter of First Amendment law that such a 
requirement is necessary, then you lose, because you're 
saying we can't possibly fashion the test?

 MR. COLLINS:  Then we lose and so does the 

union in Lehnert lose.  There was no -- it was 
acknowledged that there was nothing like that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Lehnert didn't 

address the question of litigation.

 MR. COLLINS:  Well, but if -- but there has 

been no argument made that would explain why if you --
if one can pool -- if the union negotiates an agreement 
with a very controversial provision that a nonmember has 
a very legitimate objection to, Lehnert holds that can 
be pooled.  Lehnert does not say the standard --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Your argument seems to be 

that the whole analogy of a pooling arrangement is 
invalid.  That was unrealistic, because there really is 
no way of telling whether any of these things is a 
pooling arrangement.  There is no standard that could 
possibly be articulated that would be meaningful to 
determine whether something that is labelled a pooling 
arrangement really is in any way a pooling arrangement. 
That seems to me argument.  That would seem to cut 
against the whole idea of pooling arrangements not only

for litigation expenses, but for everything else.

 MR. COLLINS:  I have two responses to that, 

Justice Alito.  First, the -- if one had to have the 
kinds of either guarantees or meaningful enforceable 
standards that are implied in your question, then in the 
nature of the beast, it could not be done by national 
unions, and we would be in a system then when all that 
can happen is that a local union has to rely solely on 
its own resources, solely on its own expertise.  And 
it's doing that despite, as Judge Lynch pointed out in 
the concurrence, despite the dire impact that can have 
on its ability to represent people and it's doing it --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it doesn't have to do 
that.  It can use the money of its union members any way 
it wants.  It can contribute to the national all of 
their money if it wishes.  We are only talking about 
that portion of the union income which comes from people 
who don't want to join the union.

 MR. COLLINS:  Well, then it either has to 
allow for -- the union has to either conclude we are 
going to support all of our germane activities, all of 
our chargeable activities through our own funding and 
our own resources, and if that's just inadequate and 
therefore litigation needs to be conducted, we can't do 
it; the employer knows that so it can take advantage of

us in bargaining; we are just going to have to live with 
it; or we can say our members will pay for that but the 
nonmembers won't, because the only solution other than 
using the local's own money is to pay a fee to the 
national.  And as I've indicated in Lehnert as in this 
case, the arrangement is not one that provides 
guarantees --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, one of the 

difficulties it seems to me is the Petitioner's position 
with the sort of all or nothing approach.  But you 
seemed to be taking the mirror position of that.  Your 
argument is all or nothing on your side.  I don't get 
much help from either side as to what the standard 
should be.  I know germane is obviously a malleable 
word, but we are looking to see if there is some test 
that we can use that's not all or nothing.

 MR. COLLINS:  Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I haven't heard from 

either side yet what that would be.

 MR. COLLINS:  The -- the question, Justice 

Kennedy, is whatever the test is if it's satisfied as to 
expenditures within the unit where the services are 
provided, can those services be pooled or is there a 
different test that has to be applied to the pooling? 
My submission is that Lehnert makes clear there is no

separate test.

 As to what the test is within -- and 
therefore, as to the question presented here, one 
doesn't need to decide on the actual test that will be 
applied within the local because as your separate 
opinion and Justice Scalia's separate opinion in Lehnert 
made clear, even under the narrower statutory duties 
test there could still be pooling; the definition as to 
what can be pooled would simply be different.  I'd only 
note on the question of whether the tests should be 
germaneness with the two additional prongs as held in 
Lehnert, or the statutory duties test, that again is a 
question that's not presented here.  As I just indicated 
it doesn't affect the concept of pooling.

 There has also been no confusion, contrary 

to Petitioner's contention, under the Lehnert test.  The 
only issue that's given the courts difficulties is the 
specific issue here as to why the plurality in Lehnert 
seemed to indicate that litigation might be in a 
different status under pooling.  So there is no basis in 
this case for reconsidering the basic Lehnert test of 
chargeability.

 I will simply note, however, that the 

statutory duties test which -- for which Petitioners 
argue really doesn't make the situation clearer than

the -- than the germaneness test because the 
Government -- both the germaneness test and the 
statutory duties test acknowledge that the union's right 
to charge objecting nonmember stems from its function as 
exclusive bargaining representative; but there is no way 
to sustain logically the notion that that means that 
only those things that are done in that exclusive 
representative capacity are chargeable; because the same 
Government interests that allow for charging when the 
union is acting as the exclusive bargaining agent have 
to also allow for charging for those things that are 
necessary in order for the union to play that role, and 
to enforce that role which includes things like the 
headquarters; it includes things like litigation to 
enforce an agreement, even though in those areas when 
performing those functions, the union very often does 
not have an exclusive representational duty or duty of 
fair representation.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there a rule or a reg 

somewhere in the Labor Department that says if the 
national union takes its money from its local, spends it 
in a way that has nothing to do with politics 
whatsoever, zero -- but either wastes it or they build 
too big a building, or they do something that doesn't 
benefit Local Number 432, does 432 have any remedy?

MR. COLLINS:  There is no Labor Department

 JUSTICE BREYER:  There is no remedy at all.
 MR. COLLINS:  No, and I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So union members who are 

being gypped, they just have to put up with it.

 MR. COLLINS:  I would say there would be a 
breach of covenant of faith and fair dealing under the 
affiliation relationship in some of those situations; 
and of course if a union used an illegal basis for 
determining whether it would provide services to the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.  Are you saying you 

could bring a lawsuit or not?

 MR. COLLINS:  You could bring a lawsuit 

alleging that the union violated its covenant of good 
faith and fair dealing to its affiliates, if the union 
acted on the basis of say, race, for example, you could 
certainly bring a lawsuit then.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So either -- in these cases 

everybody in the union whether they're forced or not, 
has this kind of remedy or nobody does?  That's your --

MR. COLLINS:  Right.  And the reason for 
that is -- what we always have to understand here, is 
the interest in seeing to it that a local union that 
pays an affiliation fee will receive services in a fair

way from the national is an interest that's shared 
equally by the members and the nonmembers.  It's not 
something that creates a First Amendment concern.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's not 

right.  Again we have to postulate that we are dealing 
with members who don't like unions at all.  So while the 
members may think this is perfectly fair, the nonmembers 
whenever their money is forced to be used for union 
activities, it's unfair.

 MR. COLLINS:  But a -- a member equally with 
a nonmember would, Mr. Chief Justice, have the view that 
if it's predictable year after year that for some reason 
his local doesn't get services from the national union, 
the national union sends it elsewhere, that member is 
going to be no more happier -- happy than the nonmember. 
That's why those things don't happen in the real world. 
That's why we certainly don't need a prophylactic rule 
and there would certainly be no First Amendment basis 
for a prophylactic rule that requires the union to 
establish what no union in this country to my knowledge 
has, which is either a clear guarantee or specific 
standards for providing services.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF W. JAMES YOUNG

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. YOUNG:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  I 

think it's appropriate to note the apocalyptic 
predictions that are suggested from the rule that the 
Petitioners are advancing are avoidable by easily --
readily available alternatives.  International unions 
would of course be free to make loans to local 
affiliates engaged in massive litigation or other speech 
activities where they think it's appropriate.

 But the alternative is not between 
prohibiting pooling arrangements which have no 
standards, no enforceability and no predictability, and 
allowing the nonmembers to become free riders on 
legitimate litigation expenditures funded through the 
international affiliate.  The choice is between a 
malleable -- a malleable unpredictable and ultimately 
unenforceable agreement and a standard which would allow 
the international to subsidize such litigation and allow 
the true -- only the costs of that litigation to be 
extracted from nonmembers.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And the case -- the case 
that says that a union member, person forced into the 
union agency shop -- and I guess a lawyer who has to pay 
to be an integrated bar and I guess a doctor who has to

join a medical association -- the case that says that 
these people have a First Amendment right to get back 
money that's being wasted, is what?

 MR. YOUNG:  We don't suggest that there is 

such a right, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So unless it's political in 

your view, you don't have that right?

 MR. YOUNG:  Unfortunately no, Justice 

Breyer.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The test is not 
whether it's political, is it?  It's not a negative 
test.  It's an affirmative requirement in which the 
burden is on the union that they have to show the 
expenditure is germane to the particular collective 
bargaining agreement?

 MR. YOUNG:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that's 

exactly correct, and -- and the test in determining 
whether or not it is a -- can be charged across 
bargaining unit lines is a bright-line test of whether 
it is a speech activity.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, do you have a 

response to Justice Kennedy's concern?  Do you have a 
fallback position or are you also in the all or

like to address one more point.  I think it's 
appropriate to recall, get us back again to the focus on 
this is compelled speech subject to the Court's strict 
scrutiny jurisprudence.  The test suggested by MSEA is 
that a union's activities are subject to a, subject to 
the duty of fair representation and to the covenant of 
good faith and fair dealing under the duty of fair 
and/or under the duty of fair represent which of course 
is that wide range of reasonableness cannot be sustained 
where this court's standard is the least restrictive 
means.  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:08 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
