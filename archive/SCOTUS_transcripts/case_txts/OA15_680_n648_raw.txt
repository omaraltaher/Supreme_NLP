CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

  

 

 

 

 

argument first this morning in Case 15-680, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bethune-Hill v. The Virginia State Board of Elections. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Elias. 

 

             

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARC E. ELIAS 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The district court created out of whole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cloth a new legal standard that permitted Virginia to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply a one-size-fits-all, 55 percent racial floor to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

all 12 of its predominantly black districts.  Virginia 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied this 55 percent rule to move voters in and move 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voters out of districts on the basis of race, regardless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the differences in voting patterns, geography, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demographics, or the actual interests of black voters in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each of those districts. 

 

 

 

            

This actual conflict test, which the D.C. --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which -- I'm sorry -- which the district court invented 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for predominance has no basis in this Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisprudence.  Instead, it confers a sort of judicial 

   

  

 

 

 

 

immunity to visually appealing districts that 

 

 

 

 

 

nevertheless were drawn with the predominant purpose of

placing voters within and without based solely on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

color of their skin. 

 

 

 

4 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm -- I'm not quite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure I understand how you assess predominance, which I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

think is the challenge here. 

 

 

 

 

            

And to take a hypothetical, let's say you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

trying to select people for a particular board or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

something; and you say they have to come from a city 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with more than 500,000 people, absolutely.  And then you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, and they have to come from such a city in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California.  Can't be anywhere else. 

  

 

 

 

            

Now, which is the predominant factor?  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

500,000 or California? 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  Well, in this case, under the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisprudence of -- of --

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't really 

    

 

 

 

care -- I'm not talking about this case.  It's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical. 

            

MR. ELIAS:  I think that you -- you can set 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aside the -- the population center, and you would look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the State of California as the predominant factor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it is the criteria to which all others must 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yield, and in this --

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, how do you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

know that?  I mean, it seems to me that the 500,000 is

the criteria which -- to which all others might yield. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

MR. ELIAS:  In -- in -- in that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical, each of them might be an unyielding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criteria. 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

  

 

 

MR. ELIAS:  In this case, there is only one. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, no, I know. 

   

  

 

 

 

That's why I'm looking -- that's why this is called a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical, because it's not about the particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

But I -- I -- obviously, what I'm trying to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

highlight is, "predominant" means one that dominates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over all the others. 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  Right. 

  

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And it's easy to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

imagine situations where you cannot say that one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dominates over all the others. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  I think --

    

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So what do you do in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a situation like that? 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  I think I now understand your --

    

   

 

 

 

 

your question. 

 

            

In that case, neither criteria would 

 

 

 

 

 

predominate, because, in fact, neither one controls the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other.  And in that case, we would not have met our

burden of predominance; and as a result, we wouldn't --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we -- we wouldn't get to the second step of strict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

scrutiny. 

            

Where you have one criteria, though, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can fairly say there was predominance, because --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if you're 

  

 

 

 

 

still -- you're trying to figure out which -- which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predominates.  And I think this is where the inquiry or 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the test that you challenge comes from. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

One way to tell which is the predominant is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to see if they conflict.  And if they conflict, then how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do you resolve it?  And whatever trumps the other, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the predominant one. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. ELIAS:  That -- that --

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right? 

  

 

 

MR. ELIAS:  Your Honor, that is one way that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence is adduced to determine predominance. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

 

MR. ELIAS:  But it is not the only way.  If, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in fact, to use your hypothetical, the legislature of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California -- let's assume that they're the ones setting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these criteria -- says, our predominant factor, the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the dominant and controlling factor, is that it has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come from the State of California, the fact that it may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also come from a -- the members may also come from a

city with more than 500,000 members doesn't mean that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the first criteria didn't predominate.  We know it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the legislature told us, this is the dominant --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

this is the dominant criteria.  And that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Finish. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What if the -- I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. ELIAS:  I -- and that's what this --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's what happened in this instance. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What if the legislature 

  

 

 

 

 

says, look, we want to follow all the traditional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districting, applying all the traditional districting 

 

 

 

 

 

factors.  However, one thing we absolutely do not want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is to be held to have violated Section 5 or Section 2 of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Voting Rights Act.  So we have these 12 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority-African-American districts, and we don't want 

 

 

 

 

 

to do anything to them that results in liability under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Voting Rights Act. 

 

 

 

            

            

Is that predominance? 

 

 

MR. ELIAS:  It is predominance if race was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- was the controlling factor in -- that could not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yield in the drawing of the districts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, it may very well be that when the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then completes its inquiry, there will be a strong basis 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in evidence that -- that drawing the districts that way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was to comply with a good faith understanding of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

8 

Voting Rights Act, and then the -- the State wins. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In this case, though, what the State did is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it started with an --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I didn't really understand 

    

 

 

 

the answer to the question. 

 

 

 

 

            

If the court says -- if the State says, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one thing we absolutely do not want is to be found to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violate the -- the Voting Rights Act, that is not --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that is not necessarily predominance, in your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view? 

            

MR. ELIAS:  That is not necessarily 

  

 

 

 

 

predominance.  It is when that is -- because there are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any number of ways to comply with the Voting Rights Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that do not require race to be the dominant and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controlling factor. 

 

            

For example, you -- you have any number of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts -- I would hazard to guess -- and it is only a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess -- a majority of the districts in this country --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are drawn by legislatures that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority-minority, where they start with traditional 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting criteria and the district is over 50 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent or over whatever the -- the applicable threshold 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, and they never need to trump the traditional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting criteria with race. 

 

 

 

            

In this instance, they trumped -- and I use

that word --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What -- what is your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

evidence of that?  I mean, look, which I'm sure you've 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read, in -- in the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which I had hopped would end these cases in this Court, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which it certainly doesn't seem to have done -- all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  But if you make the comparison, it isn't enough, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I don't think, for you to say that they just saw some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional factors; and they didn't take into account 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other evidence that they were using race predominantly. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Well, if you look at the other evidence on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 1271, you know, the west thing, it was pretty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strong evidence.  They added 15,785 new voters; and of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those, precisely 12 were white.  Right? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. ELIAS:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, is there -- and when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you looked at their use of the factors, of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional factors, they were pretty irrelevant. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. ELIAS:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It makes a point of that in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the opinion, and that -- that that's meant to guide the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district judges.  And so what -- what's the equivalent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here?  What's the equivalent if -- assuming he didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say exactly the right words, no one can say exactly the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right words, what's his mistake?

JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  What is the evidence 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that you say would show that, in fact, they did use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race?  What's your strongest one or two pieces of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence? 

            

            

MR. ELIAS:  I think --

    

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You saw the 17 -- 15,785. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's pretty strong. 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  I think if you look at 

    

 

 

 

 

 

District 71 --

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 

  

 

MR. ELIAS:  Okay.  What you find is this is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an inner city -- just to orient to the Court, this is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inner city district at the core of Richmond. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And this is a district that had a 46.3 

   

   

 

 

 

 

percent BVAP, and because of the 55 percent rule that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had been set out, and there's really no dispute, the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court agrees that that was a rule that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guided the drawing of districts, all of the districts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result of that rule, we -- what you see is a racial 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gerrymandering.  You see that that district went from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

46.3 to 55.3 by essentially raiding every other district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around it, essentially the suburbs and the exurbs, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raiding those districts and bringing black voters in,

notwithstanding the fact that it was a classic crossover

district.  It was a district in which, essentially, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

white liberals in -- who had moved to the city were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voting in harmony --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What was the number, 

  

 

 

 

 

roughly, of the new people in the district?  How many 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are black?  How many white? 

  

 

 

 

            

Of the people who were moved out of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district, how many were black, how many were white, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approximately? 

            

MR. ELIAS:  They -- they -- the -- I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the precise number that were moved in and out, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there were a significant number, in the -- in the many 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thousands of voters who were moved in and many thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who were moved out. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But giving a number 

   

  

 

 

matters, because, after all, the -- the -- that was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

key factor in Swann. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. ELIAS:  Right, and I think that --

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  How do I find that? 

   

  

 

 

 

MR. ELIAS:  I think it's on -- it's in the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Joint Appendix on 669.  It has the -- has the movements. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I just -- as I stand here, I don't know them, but it's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for all 12 districts.  But it is a significant number. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's not -- it's not two or ten or even a hundred.  It's

several thousand in a district that is only --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

know. 

            

            

to look. 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I found what I wanted to 

    

   

 

 

 

MR. ELIAS:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I just wanted to know where 

    

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Elias, could I make sure 

   

  

 

 

 

 

I understand:  What's your view of -- let's -- let's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the policy here says 55 percent, and it says that across 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the board as to each of these 12 districts, and it says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effectively, this is the most important criteria, in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense that it will trump other things.  All right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So -- but -- but as I understand your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument, you're not resting your case on that fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alone; is that correct? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. ELIAS:  That is correct. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And why is that?  When would 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

such -- when would such a policy not have the requisite 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impact on a voting district? 

   

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  Right.  Justice Kagan, I think 

   

  

  

 

 

this gets, actually, to Justice Breyer's exact point. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If -- if you had a district where it had no impact, it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually didn't cause voters to be moved in significant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

numbers, then -- then we agree with -- with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solicitor General's office and this court in Alabama

that, if a significant number of voters are not moved as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a result of that racial threshold, then -- then strict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scrutiny is not triggered. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So we really are looking to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

what Justice Breyer suggested, which is, we're -- we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking to the movement of voters in and out of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular district? 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  Yes, and I don't think that that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

is at -- at -- in dispute.  We will hear from my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

colleague, and maybe I'll be surprised, but I don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that's the dispute.  I think that the issue here 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the legal error that was -- that was committed by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court in saying that, if we find a district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that looks like it's abided by traditional districting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criteria, that's the end of the inquiry.  That's the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Even -- even if we concede 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there were -- you know, essentially, all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

African-Americans were moved in and all the -- the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the whites were moved out.  It's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  And even if it was done by an --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for an avowedly racial reason.  But under the -- under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the trial court's test, a -- a -- the legislature of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Virginia could say, we want to corral all of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

African-Americans we can because we think they all vote 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alike and we don't want them infecting the neighboring

districts, and so we want to get 70 percent of them into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

a district.  And if, lo and behold, they then draw a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circle, right, and visually, the most compact district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can, under Judge Payne's opinion below, we don't ask 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the question about race.  We never get to the evidence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you're saying --

  

 

 

 

 

 

yeah.  So you're saying you do not need a conflict 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

between traditional criteria and race? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. ELIAS:  Correct. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But do you agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with the Solicitor General that say -- who says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonetheless, that -- that -- quoting on page 8 of their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief -- in the vast majority of cases, a conflict may 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be necessary evidence to establish racial predominance? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  I think that that overstates it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

slightly.  I'm not sure that I'd say "in the vast 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority of cases." 

 

 

            

In many cases, you're going to have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correlation; I agree with the Solicitor General. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, even if you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

saying not in the vast majority, but in the majority, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or -- why is that? 

 

 

 

 

            

Based on -- on your answer to Justice Kagan, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why is it that you're almost -- almost always or vast 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

majority for the SG, or something less than that in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

your --

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  I -- I -- I think the reason is 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

because in the real world, the way in which population 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distributes, you're going to need to create bizarre 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts in many instances, in many parts of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country.  You're going to need to have visually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unappealing districts in order to conduct what is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially a Shaw violation. 

   

 

            

But that's -- the reason why I pointed to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Richmond is that Richmond is exactly the instance of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place where that's not going to be necessary, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you do have a crossover district.  You have a district 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

where you have white college students and white young 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

professionals moving into an urban -- a prior urban 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

center, voting in harmony and reinforcing with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

African-American population in that area.  So it won't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily be visually bizarre, but it is nevertheless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the destruction of that crossover district to create a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 percent for the sake of 55 percent is -- is not going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be -- even be a --

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  We haven't said that for a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason.  We haven't said just the use of race is wrong. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We've said it has to predominate, as you know. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  Correct.

JUSTICE BREYER:  And -- and my problem with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

your argument here, if you want to go on the -- what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court said there, which you may be right, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is such a complicated area that it's the easiest 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing in the world to go through a district court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lengthy opinion and to find a sentence that's not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly right. 

 

            

            

MR. ELIAS:  I -- I --

    

   

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's why it seems to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

me, if we're going to have a -- ever have districting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done back in the legislatures, rather than in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts, you've got to prove your case that, not only did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what he say was wrong, but it mattered, with pretty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strong evidence. 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  I -- I agree, Justice Breyer. 

    

   

 

 

 

I -- but -- but I'd make two points in response. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Number one, this was not a stray sentence. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

This is the -- the -- in every one of those hundred-plus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pages, this is the test he applies, over and over and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over again.  You look at the -- page 111 to 115, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he -- there is a -- which is a discussion of this --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this -- this same Richmond district, and read that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis.  And he says, well, it's visually appealing; 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore we don't need to -- we don't need to address 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it, and, by the way, district courts, we shouldn't be in

the business of assessing credibility between witnesses. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We shouldn't be in the business of assessing credibility 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between -- between two legislators, because after all, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

it's visually appealing, and why would we want to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that? 

            

This was rife through the opinion, not an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isolated statement.  It was his holding that where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional redistricting principles can explain, can 

 

 

 

 

 

explain, then we don't need to actually look at other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence of what the real motive was, and that error is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not something that comes up over and over and over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again.  That is a unique error in this case. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So are you proposing that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we remand, we tell the district court, you applied the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong standard, and that the right standard is race can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predominate, even if there's no distortion of the shape 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the district?  Is that -- is that the relief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're --

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  I think that -- I think that 

    

   

 

 

 

 

that is -- that is an appropriate relief, Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg.  I think with respect to some of these 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts, the Court can simply reverse. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think with respect to that Richmond 

 

 

 

 

 

district, the analysis is the -- the facts are not

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's kind of --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I was going to say: 

    

 

 

 

 

 

It's kind of hard to do it just with respect to one, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't it?  Because that means, okay, you can't pull 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these voters in, so you've got to push them back, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now all of a sudden that other district has an issue. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  I -- I -- I think, 

    

   

   

 

Mr. Chief Justice, that's a -- that's a fair point.  I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

think if you look at the map, what you'll see is, we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually talking about four geographic pockets. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There is a Richmond pocket of districts; 

   

 

 

 

 

there is a south side Virginia, which is up against 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the border of North Carolina, there are two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts; then there is a Lower Hampton Roads and an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Upper Hampton Roads.  And each of those pockets really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't impact the other. 

 

 

 

            

So, yes, I -- I -- I agree with you, in 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

general, it would cause redistricting around the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Richmond area, but if -- if you recall the -- in the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Personhuballah case, which this Court heard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

last -- last term, we dealt with a single district, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bobby Scott's congressional district, which had been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racially gerrymandered by the same legislature using the

same 55 percent floor, and when they did the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting it only affected the two neighboring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

districts. 

            

That -- I'm sorry -- that district and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- and the -- really, the district next to it, so --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but I -- but I understand the point, and it's -- and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a fair one.  And in that sense, remand would not be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an unreasonable step to take to apply it correctly. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Just if I -- so I can 

   

   

  

 

 

 

understand your sense of the relative strengths of your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments, if we did remand, say, this is the wrong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard, go apply the right standard, and -- and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was done fairly, where do you think he would have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change his view, where do you think that there would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a question, and where do you think the same result would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably obtain? 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  So I'd like to say there would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be new results everywhere.  But to answer your question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fairly, as I try to always do, I think in the Richmond 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

area, there is no question that a fair application of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the standard would lead to a new districting in -- I'm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorry. 

            

In the Richmond area, which are 

 

 

 

 

 

Districts 71, 69, 70, and 74, I think there is no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question that it would lead to a -- a new -- it would

lead to a -- a different map, a different result. 

   

   

   

 

 

 

20 

              

I think in the south side of -- of Virginia, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is two districts, 75 and 63, this was a curious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one, because he actually found race did predominate in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

75 by splitting Dinwiddie County -- Dinwiddie County 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being a border county of North Carolina -- on a validly 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial grounds, but yet did not find race predominated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with respect to 63. 

 

 

 

            

It's difficult to understand how race could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have predominated in the racial division of voters on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one side of the line, but not predominate in the racial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

division of voters on the other. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but as to 75, did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he not say that strict scrutiny was met, because other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimate and -- and conventional factors were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered and were present? 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  He did find --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me that 75 is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- is the strongest case for the district court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  I think 75 is the strongest case 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the sense that the application of the wrong legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test, he still found that we met -- that we met our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden of -- of -- of predominance. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think it is a weak finding on the part of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court in this regard, Your Honor.  If you

look at what the actual evidence was to meet the strong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

base of evidence -- because once -- once we found --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

once predominance was found and strict scrutiny applied, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

now the burden shifted to the government to explain why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they had a strong basis of evidence in doing what they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did. 

            

Their strong basis of evidence was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following:  Number 1, that the elected official felt 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

like she would want more -- she -- she needed more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

African-Americans in her district.  Well, with all due 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to Delegate Tyler, most incumbents feel like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they would like more voters in their district who -- who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are going to support them.  And that's not a -- that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not a -- that -- that -- it can't be a strong basis in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence. 

            

The second is they alluded to the fact that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there were prisons in the district.  And this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interesting, because this is, Your Honor, exactly the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of racial stereotyping that the Voting Rights Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is intended to avoid.  There is nothing in the record as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the racial demographics of those prisons.  There is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing to believe that those prisons included or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excluded, raise or lower, the overall black voting age 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

population of the district.  They assumed that if a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prison had 8,000 people, it had 8,000 black people.  And

that is -- that is exactly the kind of racial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stereotyping that cannot form the basis. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Wasn't there a primary in 

   

  

 

 

 

2005 in that district where Representative Tyler won 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

over a white candidate by less than 300 votes? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  Yes, Your Honor.  And I'm glad 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

you raise that, because that's the third one, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the most important one. 

 

 

 

 

            

Let us take a step back, because it's --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's interesting that he -- that he -- he won by more --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she won by more than -- by -- by only 300 votes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The districts were drawn in two thousand --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in -- in two -- following 2000.  In 2001, there was an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incumbent who had been there 30-some-odd years who was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- a candidate of choice of the African-American 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

community who won.  That candidate won again in a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

landslide in 2003.  That candidate then retired, and it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was then an open primary.  And in that open primary, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Delegate Tyler won by five percentage points. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, what's interesting is that 300 votes is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

five percentage points.  This was a 6,000-vote primary. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Five-way.  So to say she won by 300 votes and that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proves predominance, well, she won in a landslide.  She 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

won five -- by five percentage points as a non-incumbent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a multiple-primary field.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I thought she won by only, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

like, 1 1/2 percentage points in the general. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. ELIAS:  In the general. 

  

 

 

 

So what happened next is that the incumbent, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who had retired, whose son had run against her in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

primary, who she had beaten, he then endorses the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Republican opponent.  So you have this long-time 

  

 

 

 

 

 

incumbent who endorses the Republican opponent, and she 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wins by 1.3 percent of the vote in the general. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But these -- these districts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are going to last for a decade, are they not? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. ELIAS:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And -- and there's no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

guarantee that these same candidates are going to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

running throughout that decade. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. ELIAS:  I agree. 

    

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So you think they have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

take into account this very complicated analysis:  Well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was the -- the person is an incumbent, and therefore 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is going to have the incumbent's advantage, and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  No, Your Honor, I'm saying the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

complete opposite. 

 

            

I'm saying that in 2001, 2003, 2007, 2009, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this was -- this performed without a close election.  In 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2005 the primary was not close; it was a five-point 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

election.  So that leaves us one election, which was the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

2005 general where she won by 1.3 percent of the vote. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Which you're saying, 

  

 

 

 

essentially, is idiosyncratic. 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  It's -- it's an idiosyncratic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

one election.  But also, this Court has never said that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is a guarantee that they will win.  It -- in fact, in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gingles itself, there was a statement that it is not a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantee -- that no one election controls. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I mean, that gets to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

an interesting point.  What -- to what -- what degree of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confidence that it will remain a -- a majority-minority 

   

   

 

 

 

 

district is necessary to have a strong basis in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence? 

            

            

response. 

            

            

MR. ELIAS:  I think it -- yeah, I --

    

   

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't want to take up your 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. ELIAS:  I think it is likely. 

    

 

 

 

 

If there are no other questions, I'd like to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reserve the remainder of my time.

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it please the Court: 

 

 

 

25 

            

The district court was right to hold that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the use of a racial target is not sufficient to trigger 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strict scrutiny, but it was wrong to hold that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conflict with traditional redistricting principles is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essential element of a racial gerrymandering claim. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

On the use of a racial target, the Court's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases have drawn a distinction between the use of race 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a factor and the predominant use of race in drawing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district lines, and the use of a racial target shows 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that race was used.  But as the Court explained in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alabama, the -- when -- the critical question is whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was predominantly used.  And as to that, evidence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that a racial target is used is evidence, but not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusive proof. 

 

            

To take one example that I think you asked 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

for, if a district starts out 75 percent black voting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

age population before it's redistricted, and that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on general demographic patterns, and then the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

target is set at "don't drop below 50 percent," then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's just not the case that district lines that are then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawn to bring the district into compliance with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one-person, one-vote are necessarily going to be based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predominantly on race rather than traditional

districting principles. 

 

26 

            

And if a racial target was alone sufficient 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to trigger strict scrutiny, it would deprive the States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the flexibility that they need to comply with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Voting Rights Act.  So it's --

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maybe I missed 

   

  

 

 

your -- you're saying, if it was 75, and it's down to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50, that does not necessarily mean --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  No, I -- I -- I did not say 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

that.  I -- I said if the target was that it shouldn't 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go below 50, not that the target was it had to get to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So it's at 

  

  

 

 

 

 

75.  And they say, what we're going to do, we draw this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as not yet below 50 --

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Right. 

  

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And then they --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  And so they could end up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

anywhere between 70 and 50.  So it's just -- they could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end up right at 70, or at 65, or at 60, or at wherever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is in between. 

 

 

 

            

So it's just not necessarily the case that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the use of a target may have had little or nothing to --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a target that that's -- that's so low at 50 percent when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you started up here at 75, then this -- the lines that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

you're drawing are probably likely to be drawn based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predominantly on traditional districting factors.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

27 

just not necessarily the case that you're going to have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to predominantly use race, because no matter what you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do --

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So are those --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. GORNSTEIN:  -- you're going to end up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

above 50 percent. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Are these the only kind of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts where you would say that a target would not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have an impact on district lines?  In other words, where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district has a population that's so far above the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

target that nothing that they're doing on the margins is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affected by the target, are those the only kind? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  No, I would not say that, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

because I -- I would say districts, for example, like in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case where you start at 60, there's no -- no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason, necessarily, to think that race is going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predominate in order to bring the districts into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compliance with the Voting Rights Act.  They started out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at 60.  And let's assume, based on traditional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting factors and not on race, there's no reason 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it couldn't end up on -- at 60 for the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What if you started at 53

and you brought it up to 55? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Again, I -- I'm -- I'm with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you on there.  It doesn't necessarily -- you would need 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 

more evidence than that. 

 

 

 

            

Now, the one that raises the biggest --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  More evidence of what? 

  

 

 

 

 

That --

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well, so -- so the most 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

important evidence, Justice Alito, would be a conflict 

   

 

 

 

 

 

with traditional redistricting principles.  And if you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

could establish that and -- and that it went up to that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

degree and it affected a substantial number of voters, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

then I think you could make out a case. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What if they said, well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we're at 53; we have a 55 percent floor.  We want to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring this up to 55, and we can do that by drawing a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district that's even more compact than the district that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we had before? 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  So, ordinarily speaking, 

  

 

 

 

it's going to be very difficult to show that race 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predominated without showing a conflict with traditional 

   

 

 

 

 

redistricting principles.  But there's no hard-and-fast 

  

 

 

 

 

rule that says -- that -- that prevents a plaintiff from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying.

would be a case in which that might be possible?  Not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theoretically possible, but you can imagine it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happening? 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  So I -- I we have two 

   

   

  

 

 

 

29 

examples in our brief, and -- and most of the cases I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can think of are -- are -- are but variations of those. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So the first relies on direct evidence from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the mapmaker himself, and the second is where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State's nonracial explanation is discredited by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence to be more concrete.  If you have ten -- tens 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of thousands of predominantly white voters moved out, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tens of thousands of predominantly minority voters moved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in, and the mapmaker says, I did that to hit the target, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then a finding of racial predominance could be made even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if, Justice Alito, the -- the district was reasonably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compact. 

            

And the -- the second example that I -- I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would -- from the brief is, if the State says politics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is what explains that, and then you look at the evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and they used racial data rather than political data, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then a finding of racial predominance could be made even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if politics is also playing a role; and there's no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conflict with politics in the drawing of the district --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  There's no way --

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  -- lines. 

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And -- and maybe there's no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

way around this; but this is all, as you -- as you lay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it out, very, very complicated.  And the State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature has to redistrict a huge -- a large number 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

of districts in a short amount of time using a very --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- a multifactor, vague predominance standard.  And if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

it turns out that there is predominance, what -- when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they will be deemed to have had a strong basis in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence to -- to -- that there would be a Voting Rights 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act claim is also quite unclear. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So it's just -- maybe there's no way around 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it, but it -- isn't this just an invitation for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation --

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  So --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- in every one of these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

instances? 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  So we're very sympathetic to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the interest of the State in being able to comply with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Voting Rights Act while simultaneously pursuing its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional redistricting policies.  And, in fact, we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

proposed a version of the conflict case test to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court in Miller. 

 

 

            

But we read Miller and Shaw to -- to have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rejected this conflict requirement and -- and, instead, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to replace it to what a -- as you said, is a complicated

district lines, even if traditional factors also played 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31 

a role. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is it still the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

office's position that it would preferable to have the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test that was adopted by the district court here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requiring a conflict before you find that race 

   

 

 

 

 

 

predominated? 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  So putting aside the 

  

 

 

 

 

question of whether it would -- you would -- overruling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court's --

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I --

    

 

 

MR. GORNSTEIN:  -- decisions, yes, except 

  

 

 

 

 

that we wouldn't want that to bleed over into racial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vote dilution claims. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- so your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

objection to the court below is that it required a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conflict? 

            

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Correct. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And in your brief, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you say, in the vast majority, your words, of cases, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will need to show a conflict? 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Correct. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you think 

  

 

 

 

 

showing a conflict should be the correct legal standard,

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well, I wouldn't want to 

   

  

 

 

 

urge the Court to overrule its decisions in --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I know.  Putting 

   

  

  

 

 

those cases --

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  -- those cases -- for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that -- but putting aside, that is the position that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advocated in -- in -- or a version of it in Miller. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But in -- in -- in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alabama case, certainly what I tried to do, changing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

what my position had been previously, in order to get a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court that would have a clear set of standards, on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 1271 there are two paragraphs that address the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue you're talking about, and they virtually say what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you say.  And then at the end, to deal with the problem 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're -- you're -- you're raising, we say that it has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be a strong basis in evidence.  That's because you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't want to put the district court in a position, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the legislature, to do the impossible, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So it tries to do that.  That is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision of the Court.  I had thought, that having done 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, there would be lots of lower courts that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rely on that decision. 

 

 

 

            

Is it a good idea now suddenly to change and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go to some different test? 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  No.  I'm -- I'm not saying 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

you should go to a different test.  I think that the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

stare decisis considerations are what they are.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's Alabama approach is the right approach, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under that approach, Justice Breyer, you did not say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it's an essential to show a conflict --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Right, correct, exactly. 

  

 

 

 

It's predominant.  And then it has the two paragraphs 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that I've talked about, which are meant to illustrate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what that predominance means.  And they are pretty much 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what -- I think pretty much what you said. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

that. 

            

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Yes.  We would agree with 

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Pretty much. 

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is it -- what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is it -- what is it that you said? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  I think that what we said --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

things. 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  I think what we said are two 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

One, that there -- that simply because you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use a racial target, you're not in strict scrutiny, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's from Alabama; and, two, a conflict is not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

essential to prove a claim; but, three, there has to be

34 

Mr. Gornstein, the -- the same question I asked 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Elias.  If we did vacate this on the grounds that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the correct standard, what you just said, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is not the standard that the district court used, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what do you think would happen?  You know, if -- if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard that you just stated was fairly applied, would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything change? 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  So we've only done a close 

   

  

 

 

 

 

analysis of three districts, as you can see from our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief.  And in -- in two of those three districts, we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought there was a pretty strong case, but not one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where we could say it definitely would come out one --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one way or the other. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But a strong case that it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

would change? 

 

            

            

            

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  It would change. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And those districts are? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Those are 71 and 95.

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The 2011 redistricting of the Virginia House 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Delegates was a bipartisan success story.  There was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

wide agreement that the 12 majority-minority districts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that existed in the benchmark plan should be preserved, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and there was a consensus on the Bipartisan Privileges 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Elections Committee that a 55 percent BVAP level was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the appropriate level to assure that African-American 

 

 

 

 

 

 

candidates in those 12 districts had an opportunity to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elect the candidates -- elect the candidates of their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choice. 

            

arrived at? 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How was the 55 percent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. CLEMENT:  55 percent, the testimony in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the record, Justice Ginsburg, shows that was arrived at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the members of the bipartisan Privileges and Election 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Committee.  It was principally done by the principal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

architect of the plan, Delegate Chris Jones, by talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to members of the public and members of, particularly, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the African-American Caucus.  And they told Delegate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Jones -- and then they reinforced this on the floor, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the floor debates in the House of Delegates are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that's on the CD in the Joint Appendix, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Volume 1 of the Joint Appendix.  And it is worth a look 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the African-American members of the House of

Delegates testified that -- based on their knowledge of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their districts, that African-American voters did not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vote in the same numbers as -- as -- as white voters. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Therefore, to simply have 50 percent --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I thought, Mr. Clement, that 

    

 

 

 

 

the -- the 55 percent was based on a single district, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

75; and that they said, okay, we've looked at 75.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need 55 percent there.  And then it was applied across 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the board to every other majority-minority district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without any granular analysis. 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think the record would 

    

 

 

 

 

 

support that characterization of the evidence, Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kagan.  I think it was certainly based predominantly on 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

HD75, but it was also based on the testimony of Delegate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dance, who's from -- from District 63.  She testified, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as well, that it has to be north of 50 percent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It was also done in consultation with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Delegate Spruill, who's the delegate from District 77. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And it was based on not just the demographics in HD75, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though that was essentially the starting point, but also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on the characterizations of the districts and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voting tendencies --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Isn't there something a bit 

   

  

 

 

 

strange about this kind of rule?  And it's not to say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this kind of rule is the end all and be all.

You -- it might be that you can have this rule and still 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37 

be absolutely fine in the way that Mr. Gornstein 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested.  But the idea that you would look at 12 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts and say that every single one of them ought to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meet the same BVAP standard without looking at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

characteristics of those districts, who's in them, how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they vote, I mean, it just -- it sort of defies belief 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you could pick a number and say that applies with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to every majority-minority district. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Kagan, I think 

   

  

 

 

 

that maybe if you were picking one number for every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district in the state, from Big Stone Gap to Arlington, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe that would be the case.  And if you're trying to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply one number to Latino districts in one part of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State and African-American districts in another part of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State, you might have a point.  But although these 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are 12 districts, and there are four subregions, these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are all pretty much in the same part of the State.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all started on a benchmark map as somewhere between 46 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and about 62 percent for starting.  So it's not like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this number comes out of thin air. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

With respect to nine of the 12 districts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are already north of 55 percent and between, like, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 and 62.  Two of the other ones are very close.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are at, like, 54 and 53.  And then one is a little bit 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

lower, like 46, which is District 71, which I hope I'll 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38 

get a chance to talk about, because there, there is very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strong evidence that the redrawing was not done solely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the basis of race. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Let's talk about 71. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. CLEMENT:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, I have a particular 

   

   

  

 

question on 71.  Remember what I was trying do. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  At least in Alabama. 

  

 

 

 

 

The -- the Court's cases, at that moment, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pre-Alabama, I -- I'm one of the problems.  Okay? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I am trying to reflect what is actually 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there in Miller, for better or for worse, and to make it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear. 

            

The column I've referred to talks really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about evidence showing predominance.  Does it or doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it?  And there are two things there that are crucial in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- I think, in those two paragraphs.  One, there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was direct evidence that they moved 70 -- or 50,000 --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15,000 people are all black.  Okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Two, when you look at the three districting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional criteria, they are pretty weak as applicable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to that case.  They just seem not to have much relevance 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to what they are talking about.

MR. CLEMENT:  Right. 

  

 

39 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, let's look at 71. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Same kind of thing they are arguing.  Same kind of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing.  They moved -- I don't know, you have it in the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SG's brief too.  They moved 11,293 people out and 17,000 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in.  So let's look at those people.  The ones they moved 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out were three-quarters or something white, and the ones 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they moved in were three-quarters or something black. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So that's pretty similar.  It seems to me they paid a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot of attention to race. 

 

 

 

 

            

Then they say, let's look at the traditional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criteria.  The one they mentioned, which is this horn 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing, they said that they -- they did it to keep it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preserved Richmond centered.  But it already changed it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

so it wasn't Richmond centered at all, and the changes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had nothing do with it. 

 

 

 

 

            

So what they are saying is in that case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at that specificity, and you will see that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mistake of the judge in listing the criteria, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his statement, overly broad or whatever, made a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference, send it back, get him to do it right. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, that's a long question, but that's 

   

 

 

 

 

designed to focus you. 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  And I'm -- I'm glad to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focused on District 71, because what the district court

did is not apply any sort of cartoonish analysis.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked at the district as drawn.  The first thing he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

noticed is that it preserves 78 percent of the core of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district, which is higher than the statewide average 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

of 70 percent.  So you have the core of the district is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being preserved, which is a traditional districting 

   

 

 

 

 

principle. 

            

He then looks at those horns, and he looks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at them, and he doesn't just look at them and say, well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they look a little funny.  He has direct testimony from 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Delegate Jones, who drew the district, and he realizes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the horns were drawn in order to preserve an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incumbent in the neighboring district so that that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incumbent could stay in her district. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

He then looks at Precinct 207, where he says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he doesn't want to get into conflicting testimony 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between two -- two -- two delegates, and what he says, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think absolutely correctly, is, this is a contiguous 

   

 

 

 

 

 

precinct.  It's 207; it's right on the border.  So 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it's in or out, it conforms with traditional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districting principles. 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose you have two 

  

 

 

 

 

district -- or two possible districts.  Each of them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look conventional.  Each of them are conventional in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same sense that you've been describing these multiple

41 

factors. 

            

But the stated reason, the stipulated reason 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for choosing District A over District B is because it 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

has more voters of a certain race, black, Latino, white, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever.  Is that a predominant motive based on race? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  I would say that the right 

    

 

 

 

 

 

answer to that in -- when -- for predominance within the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning of your Court's cases is no.  And I think there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are two reasons --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That -- and that's what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the district court says, and I have -- I have problems 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

with that, because predominance is designed to measure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intent when there are multiple causes, and in my -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my hypothetical, the hypothetical is, the -- the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tipping point, the principal motivating factor was race. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And you say that because -- and the district court I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think said because the districts are conventional in all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other respects, strict scrutiny doesn't apply.  I have a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem with that. 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Okay.  Justice Kennedy, I -- I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

thought you might, but I'd like to say three things to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

try to convince you in defense of the district court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First of all, the -- when this Court says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"predominance," I assume they mean predominant over 

   

 

 

 

 

something else.  And I think the "something else" is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

42 

traditional districting principles.  So when race 

  

 

 

 

 

predominates over those principles, those principles are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sacrificed.  They are subordinated.  I think that's the 

    

  

 

 

 

 

way to make sense of this Court's cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second of all, I think that if you apply the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test that way, what you are doing is you are mapping on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the test to the theory of a Shaw claim.  Now, you may 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagree with me on this, but I think the -- what makes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a Shaw claim a Shaw claim is not that somebody is kept 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a perfectly formed district in a community of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

interest based on race.  It's the particular injury in a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shaw claim is that people from different parts of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State who would share nothing in common except the color 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of their skin are grouped together in the same district. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's what makes a Shaw claim different from other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

kinds of claims. 

 

 

            

And I completely agree with the Solicitor 

   

 

 

 

 

General's office that in thinking about this question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you should be thinking about Shaw claims and thinking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about them separately from vote dilution claims. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think there's a real problem in this 

   

   

 

 

 

 

area of the law is what's happened is that Shaw, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

started as a doctrine for outlying districts in outlying 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims, has become the weapon of choice in redistricting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation, and people see Shaw violations everywhere.

43 

And that's just not the way that Shaw was originally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constructed.  It ignores that there is a separate vote 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

dilution claim that can be brought that has a much 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

higher standard of proof, and people are essentially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to evade that --

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Clement --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. CLEMENT:  -- by bringing junior 

  

 

 

 

 

varsity -- I'm sorry. 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, please. 

  

 

 

MR. CLEMENT:  People are bringing junior 

  

 

 

 

 

varsity dilution claims under the guise of calling them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shaw claims, and I think it's really distorted the law. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The third point, just to put it on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

table, is that at some point then you have to ask the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question -- if -- if you disagree with me on those first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two points and you actually think you have a different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conception of what a Shaw claim is, there still has to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be the question of is the game worth the candle given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the stated need to defer to State legislatures.  And 80 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members of the House of Delegates voted in favor of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan because they -- it comported with traditional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districting principles and everybody wanted to preserve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority-minority districts. 

 

            

I'm sorry, Justice Kagan.

back to Justice Kennedy's question, it seems pretty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear to me that in the cases after Shaw -- because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44 

Shaw, you could have looked at it as, this is all about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way the district looks, and then in the cases after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shaw, in Shaw II, and in Miller, the Court makes very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear that it's not all about the way the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looks, and indeed --

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  But can I -- can I stop you 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

there, though, and say:  In Miller, what this Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confronted was an argument that bizarreness is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element of the claim.  And I think, you know -- and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nobody, I think, thinks that's the right answer. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  If you look at Shaw and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shaw II and you look at Miller, and then you think about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the hypothetical that Justice Kennedy gave you, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is essentially -- maybe I'll change it a little 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bit -- it's essentially a mapmaker who says, look, we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really want to do race-based districting here.  We can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manage to do this in a way where the maps look kind of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contiguous and kind of regularly shaped, but what we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing is race-based decision making. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, it seems pretty clear to me that if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at Shaw II, if you look at Miller, that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forbidden.  And -- and -- and that's exactly the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposite of what the district court said here.

MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think that you have to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

45 

read those decisions in that way.  I think if you're 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to read those decisions in that way, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate to pause and reflect where it's gotten us. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I think that every one of those decisions starts out 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by saying this is a very difficult task for State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislatures.  It's hard enough to draw districting --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts without the Voting Rights Act, but to draw 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them in compliance with the Voting Rights Act is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exquisitely difficult.  And we want to have deference to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State legislatures. 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, then I'm with 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice Breyer, who suggested that a few years ago we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

took those concerns into account and we tried to figure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out a test that was responsive to those concerns, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is not the test that the district court used here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  I -- I beg to differ.  I think 

    

    

   

 

 

 

you have to, as Justice Breyer was suggesting, at least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the first 25 minutes, give the district court a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little more credit than that. 

 

 

 

 

            

The district court had Alabama in front of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him.  He also had the arguments of the parties, and I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think if you go back and look -- I mean, with all due 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to my friends on the other side, they did not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argue this in terms of, let's look at all the people

moving in and out.  That was not the thrust of their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  They really argued that this was a direct 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

46 

evidence case based on the fact that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's -- that's what I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have to do after this argument, isn't it?  I mean, you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gave me exactly what I needed.  You -- you gave me the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things to look up.  He gave me the things on the other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side, and -- and they -- they didn't use exactly the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right test, but does it matter? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And -- and -- and I -- I think the -- the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason I approach it that way is because this is such 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- the reasons you said.  Okay.  You have to give 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leeway here; leeway, leeway. 

 

 

 

            

But the government makes a pretty good point 

   

 

 

 

 

 

here that it -- that really was important evidence he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't look at.  And -- and that's -- that's my job, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't it, to go back and read these things and figure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out how they -- the -- the evidence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely.  But I think you 

   

  

  

 

 

should -- I think you should look at the evidence in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case, and you shouldn't look at the evidence that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could have been mounted.  You should look at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence as it actually came in, the way it was argued 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the district court. 

 

 

 

              

I think if you go and look, for example, at

the closing arguments of this case, you will see that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

the other side did not say, this is a case about moving 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too many people in and out of a particular district. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They said, this is a direct evidence case.  They told 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you what the problem was.  They told you they were going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to apply a 55 percent BVAP floor. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

And that -- and so really, they tried to get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not just some tailwind from the fact that there was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

BVAP floor; they tried to make -- essentially rest their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case below on that proposition.  And as a result of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, it left them with a vacuum in the evidence, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because we had extraordinarily good evidence on our side 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this case, because the principal map drawer, Delegate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jones, testified for hours and hours about why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular lines were drawn.  And in every case, he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided explanations for why they comported with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional principles. 

 

            

But not just that, he told you why the lines 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were there.  The lines weren't there because, oh, we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have this 55 percent BVAP target and everything had to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go out the window.  He said, well, you know, down here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Southampton Roads, we have three incumbents that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all close together because this part of the state lost a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot of population.  So I drew some zigs and zags here to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

keep the three incumbents separate, which I think is a

perfectly nonracial explanation for it. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, down in Delegate 77 -- in District 77, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

that looks a little funny, but I got together with 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Delegate Spruill, and Delegate Spruill said he wanted to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reunite the old city of South Norfolk, so we did that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And that required to us move a couple of districts 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around, and there it is. 

 

 

 

 

            

There's -- there's reams of evidence of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  And there's really a vacuum of evidence on the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other side of this. 

 

 

 

            

And I do want to sort of rewind the tape a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little bit, too, here, which is the reason it's so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problematic, I think, to think that just because they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied a BVAP floor, you're, like, already 

   

 

 

 

 

three-fourths of the way to applying strict scrutiny is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what else is a State legislature supposed to do?  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think in this context a BVAP floor is inherently 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sinister. 

            

And, I mean, one way of thinking about this, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kagan, is the Voting Rights Act itself is a BVAP 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

floor.  I mean, in those situations where it -- it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires a majority-minority district, that's a 

   

 

 

 

quantitative floor of at least 50 point --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plus .01 percent.  But everywhere, it's a qualitative 

   

  

 

 

 

 

floor, that you have to preserve the ability -- ability

to elect. 

 

            

And so there's nothing in this context --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

and I think that's exactly why this Court has gotten 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where it's gotten.  And I'm not so sure that you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't even further refine what you said in Alabama to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make it a little bit closer to where I think the law 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be in this area. 

 

 

 

 

            

But here's the point:  I mean, the reason 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that, in this area uniquely, the Court allows race to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered is in part because the Voting Rights Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes the consideration of race absolutely necessary. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I don't want -- think you want to send the signal --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I mean, unless you want to take the first steps towards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declaring the Voting Rights Act unconstitutional, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't want to send the signal that when legislatures 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach this in a way that I think is perfectly 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate to what's going on.  I mean, Virginia's got 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You absolutely don't, 

  

 

 

 

Mr. Clement.  But it's one thing for a legislature to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, we view it as a core priority up there with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one-person, one-vote to comply with the Voting Rights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act.  That's a terrific thing.  It's another thing for 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

the legislature to do what it did, for example, in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alabama case, which is to just say something about there

can't be any retrogression from whatever there is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding that that's just not Section 5 law, and, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

50 

similarly, it's another thing for the legislature to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just pick a number out of one district, apply it to all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 districts, and say that that's compliance with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Voting Rights Act. 

 

 

            

Now, I agree with you and with Mr. Elias and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with Mr. Gornstein:  That does not get you all the way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there.  But there's something about -- this is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alabama suggested this was evidence.  When a State says 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

across the board we're going to do something that just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on its face you know is not required by the Voting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rights Act, that's a problem. 

   

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I'm with a lot of what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you had to say, Justice Kagan.  I think where I'm not 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with you is that there is something particularly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problematic about picking a 55 percent number and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

applying it in Richmond and south and in the Hampton 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Roads area.  And I think -- I mean, I'd say two things 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about that. 

 

              

I mean, in the universe of possible numbers, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 percent's about the best number you could come up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with, because -- I mean, my friends on the other side 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree these all need to be majority-minority districts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So if the whole debate is it's got to be somewhere north

of 50 percent, I mean, 55 percent, which gives you a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51 

little bit of margin for the fact that there may be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differentials in -- in -- in turnout.  And where the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rubber's going to meet the road, remember, is on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases where -- I mean, you know, the incumbents are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to always win.  And most of these districts are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority-minority, but they're way majority Democrat. 

 

 

 

 

 

So where the rubber is going to meet the road about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity to elect is going to be in the open 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

primaries.  That's when you're really going to tell 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the African-American has -- community has the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity to elect the candidate of their choice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, those are relatively rare.  And so the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

idea that, you know, it's -- it's somehow presumptively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional for the State to look at one of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most recent open primaries in HD75 and say, well, yeah, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 percentage points, but 5 percentage points in a badly 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

splintered primary, it's only 300 votes.  And Delegate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tyler herself is saying, you know, these need to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

north of 50 percent.  Everybody is basically saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

You know, I don't think it's fair to put 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this -- and I guess this is where I really take issue. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I don't think it's -- I think it's a mistake to put this 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the same basket as Alabama.  The idea that you can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

go from 80 to 79 percent is a cartoonish version of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Voting Rights Act.  To say that in an area where 9 of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52 

the 12 districts are already north of 55 percent, to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that 55 percent is a pretty darn good threshold for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compliance with the Voting Rights Act just isn't in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same category at all. 

 

 

 

            

And I know they try to get a lot of sort of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mileage out of the idea of, well, it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one-size-fits-all.  But the two things I would say about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that -- what I sort of already said -- which is we're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about the same part of the State, and there's no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason to think there's a different dynamic in this --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and all of these districts are majority-minority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts, African-American districts.  It's not like 

  

 

 

 

 

they're applying one rule and trying to say that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fits, you know, for the -- for the complicated districts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Northern Virginia with multiracial groups and those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts down in the South.  They're all very similar 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts.  That's one thing. 

  

 

 

            

The second thing is -- I mean, keep in mind, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever rule you adopt here is not just for relatively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sophisticated State legislatures.  It's going to apply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to all sorts of school boards and sewer districts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There has to be -- I mean, I -- you know, I just don't 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think the analysis is that you have to go district by

district with regression analysis in order to comply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the Voting Rights Act.  I don't think that's the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule you want to lay down. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I also think -- and this is, I think, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

responsive to Justice Kennedy's earlier question -- I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, the -- the -- the idea that they have on the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side, it's -- they're not against racial targets.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree these need to be majority-minority districts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Here, they agree they need to be north of 50 percent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The real beef is with the legislature making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a sort of commonsense judgment based on the evidence in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

front of them that it should be 55 percent.  What they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want is more use of race in more minute detail where you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go district by district and say, all right.  As to 75, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's going to be 55.  As to 63, it's going to be 74.  As 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to 77, it's going to be 56.  I don't think that gets us 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further along the lines of compliance with the Equal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Protection Clause.  I also don't even think it's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

practically possible. 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think the -- the real 

    

 

 

 

 

 

difference between your standard and the SG's standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that in your standard, the shape of a district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functions as a threshold inquiry such that if the shape 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is okay, we don't look at anything else, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly we don't look even if the districting was

completely race-based in motive.  And that's just what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

54 

the -- that three-part test does.  It sets up a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

threshold inquiry about -- about how the district is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shaped in a way that some people thought Shaw was when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shaw was first announced and that this Court in one, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two, three subsequent cases made clear it wasn't. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Kagan, first of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

all, I think the real difference between our position 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the SG's position is a difference in the real world, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is, they admit it's not going to make a difference 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 99 percent of the cases.  All right.  Maybe they had 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something else in mind by vast majority.  But in a lot 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of these cases, it won't make any differences. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But given the stakes, it's going to mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that lots more State legislatures get sued over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts that don't even look particularly suspicious. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And this case is the perfect example.  These districts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existed for four years and two complete election cycles 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before anybody perceived there was a racial gerrymander 

   

 

 

 

 

 

lurking here.  And what changed in 2014 was the resident 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Governor's Mansion in Richmond.  And what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened is these guys realized that if we can get these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts thrown out and they have to redraw the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district, we'll now have a veto power that we didn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have before.  That explains why lines that looked

perfectly square relatively and were approved 80 to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 

like, 9, with a majority of Democrats supporting them, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

all but two members of the African-American Caucus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supporting them, with one of the two members of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

caucus opposing because the numbers weren't high enough. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's the dynamic that was 2011. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You go from a bipartisan success story where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

everybody points to the House and said, these guys did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it right; the Senate, not so much.  The House, these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guys did it exactly right.  They did everything they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were supposed to do. 

 

 

 

            

Four years later, they can still draw a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial gerrymandering charge and have to litigate for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years based on this theoretical possibility that maybe, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just maybe, in drawing these square lines, someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

took --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it's more than a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

theoretical possibility.  And Mr. Gornstein says -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

he seems to be pretty sensitive to the idea of giving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States latitude.  But he looks at this and says, this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard actually did make a difference on the ground, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there were districts kicked out and said, oh, this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't race-based because it looks good, even though it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was race-based.

representing the State Legislature of Virginia, my bona 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fides in looking out for the State's even ahead of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Gornstein's.  And it's easy in the Solicitor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

General's Office to throw out a standard that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

theoretically pure and that's going to force lots of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other people to litigate for years. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

These districts were good enough for 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody for four years.  They were good enough to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pre-cleared by the Justice Department.  Having this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

detailed inquiry out there to have them invalidated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years later does not seem to me to have a lot to

Mr. Elias, you have two minutes left. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

           

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARC E. ELIAS

MR. ELIAS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

              

I want to clarify a few factual points and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

obviously answer any questions you have. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The first is, the timing of this case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

followed the Page decision.  It was the Page III court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that ruled on the congressional map that then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was the -- it had nothing to do -- that case was filed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when there was a Republican in the Governor's Mansion.

It had nothing to do with who was in the Governor's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mansion, that just as a factual matter. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Justice Breyer, to your -- the question that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you posed to me earlier, and which is at the heart of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57 

this, we completely agree with the analysis in Alabama 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that there needs to be a -- that you need to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show voters moved in and out on account of this rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And if you look at JA672, you will see there is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50.8 percent differential between the white voters moved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out and the black voters moved in.  As you point out, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three-quarters of the -- of the -- of the voters moved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in were black, and --

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You make a point of that. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

MR. ELIAS:  Yes.  That --

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I think I heard 

    

   

   

 

the -- Mr. Clement say that, well, no, this has all been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought up after the case was over, and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ELIAS:  Your Honor, it's in our expert's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

report from trial.  It's just not true.  You can find it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the JA, because --

 

 

 

 

            

attention --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You called it to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. ELIAS:  -- we called it -- it was in our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert's report at -- at trial.  Point number one.

in Shaw v. Hunt specifically dealt with Justice Stevens' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58 

dissent, saying there should be an actual conflict test. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And what this Court said is, in his dissent, Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Stevens argues that strict scrutiny does not apply where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State respects or complies with traditional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districting principles. 

 

            

That, however, is not the standard 

 

 

 

 

 

allowed -- announced and applied in Miller.  Shaw II 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolved for -- for this three-judge court well before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alabama that an actual conflict test was not the law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the district courts here simply -- simply ignored 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.
