CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-1541, Iowa v. Felipe Edgardo Tovar.


General Miller, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. MILLER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. MILLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The modern guilty plea colloquy, by focusing on


and clearly articulating the consequences of pleading


guilty, paralleling the Patterson case, clearly constitute


the -- the intelligent and knowing waiver of counsel in


this particular context. 


In the modern guilty plea 

context, among other things, the defendant is told the


elements of the crime, the range of the sentence, the


factual bases developed between the judge and the


defendant to assure that his guilt, and in addition,


the --


QUESTION:  Well, if someone is going to plead


guilty, I guess the question may boil down to whether he


has a right to be told the he could be represented by an


attorney in making the decision to plead and that it might


be useful to him to have an attorney's advice in making


that decision.

 MR. MILLER:  Yes, Your Honor.  You know, we --


QUESTION:  It's a guilty plea.  It wasn't a


going to trial and he was told certainly of all the things


that could be involved in a trial and how an attorney


would be helpful but was not told, I guess, expressly that


if you plead guilty, you can be represented by counsel and


the attorney might give you useful advice.


MR. MILLER:  Separating the -- the two issues,


first, the question of whether he was explicitly told in


this proceeding that he had a right to counsel at this


proceeding.  He was not told in that many words.  But, you


know, there's -- there's a presumption of regularity here


based on the Johnson case.


QUESTION:  My goodness, he wasn't told.  You're


conceding that he wasn't told he had a right at the plea


stage.  I thought what they said to him right off the bat


was, Mr. Tovar, you're without counsel.  I see you waived


application for a court-appointed attorney.  You want to


represent yourself at today's hearing.  So what I thought


the State was saying is that that's sufficient.


MR. MILLER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And I didn't even think that was an


issue in this case.  I didn't see it in the petition.  I


didn't see it in the response to the petition.  Maybe it


would be an issue for the lower court.  So I'm not sure

what to do with that.  I can see it's ambiguous, but if


you want to concede it, that's fine with me.


MR. MILLER:  What -- what I'm saying, Your


Honor, is -- is this, that in -- in the total context, he


clearly knew that he had a right to counsel and, indeed,


that really is the -- the words that submit that --


QUESTION:  I mean, nobody is really -- at least,


is that an issue in front of us?


MR. MILLER:  You know, I -- I don't -- I don't


think -- I don't think it should be, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  I thought it was very much the issue


before the Iowa Supreme Court because that court said what


was missing here was information about the utility of a


lawyer at the plea stage before you enter the plea with 

you at that hearing.  And here, all of the statements made


relate to what you're giving up by pleading guilty and not


going to trial.


Now, I thought, as Justice Breyer did, from that


opening colloquy there was information to the defendant


that he could consult with a lawyer before entering the


plea.  And I wondered particularly about the form that he


signed.  Tovar signed a form waiving counsel before the


plea hearing, but that form is nowhere in the record or


the lodging.  Does it exist?


MR. MILLER:  Your -- Your Honor, I -- I don't

think he actually signed a form.  What -- what did happen


is that he was informed at the -- informed at the arrest


through the Miranda warnings that he had a right to


counsel.  And then he went for a initial appearance, and


this is -- this is the part that -- that I think we focus


on.


At the initial appearance, the judge marked the


form saying application for court-appointed counsel, and


then wrote waived.  In other words, he had given the


opportunity at this initial appearance for counsel.  Going


forward, there -- there was no reason to -- to interrupt


the initial appearance and having to have counsel at -- at


initial appearance.  It was going forward. 


And then the words that Justice Breyer referred 

to, when he went to -- went to the plea hearing, the judge


said, you know, I see that you've -- you've waived


counsel, and then he says I assume that you want to


proceed to represent yourself. 


So we think that -- that that really satisfies


the requirement --


QUESTION:  But do we have the transcript of the


-- of that initial hearing where he waived counsel?


MR. MILLER:  The initial hearing -- the


checklist is in -- is in the documents that -- that were


given -- given to this Court.

 QUESTION:  Well, that wasn't the basis.  I -- I


didn't understand that to be the basis of our decision


here.  The -- the Supreme Court of Iowa did, indeed, focus


on whether he was advised at -- about how useful counsel


could be --


MR. MILLER:  Yes, Your Honor, that --


QUESTION:  -- in -- in connection with the


guilty plea --


MR. MILLER:  Yes, Your Honor.  That's --


QUESTION:  -- not that he wasn't advised that he


had a right to counsel.  The problem here is he was told


he had a right to counsel, but it wasn't said, boy, you


know, you'd really be stupid to turn it down.  That --


that wasn't done.  Right?


MR. MILLER:  That -- that's exactly right.


That's what the Iowa Supreme Court held.  You know, it


wasn't -- it wasn't raised at the district court level. 


It wasn't raised in the opposition to the cert petition.


QUESTION:  So what is your -- what everybody I


think is trying to do is ask you what is your argument on


the point that we thought was why we granted the case, or


at least I thought why.


MR. MILLER:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  What -- what is the reason that the


Iowa court is wrong --

 MR. MILLER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- on -- on the point just as Justice


Scalia put it?


MR. MILLER:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think -- I


think the -- the point is this, that in the plea setting


it is very analogous to the Patterson setting and not


analogous to the Faretta setting at -- at going to trial


without counsel.  And -- and the reason for that is, Your


Honor, that going through the plea and hearing the


elements and going through the factual basis and knowing


the punishments, that's something a person can comprehend


and can make a decision on, just like the Court held in


Patterson that the decision to answer a question under


interrogation or not under interrogation is something 

someone could do. 


But in -- in the trial setting, it is just so


difficult for a person to represent himself in terms of


the rule of evidence, in terms of strategy, witnesses,


choosing the jury.  Those are the kinds of things that it


is just so difficult.  What we do is two things.  We


inform the defendant of all those difficulties and by


informing him as -- with a -- with an authority figure


like a judge, we're -- we're pushing him towards counsel.


QUESTION:  Well, but -- but in -- in the context


of entering a plea, it certainly would be useful for the

defendant to know that if he had an attorney, the attorney


might take a look at -- at the sobriety tests.  He might


talk with the prosecutor about a plea to the lesser


charge, reckless driving.  He might talk to the judge


about a reduced sentence.  It didn't happen here because


he got the minimum. 


But just as -- as a general matter, your brief


seems to suggest that there's -- there's not really much


role for the attorney at -- in entering a guilty plea.  I


-- I suggest that there -- there's a very important role


for him.


MR. MILLER:  Well, Your Honor, I think -- I


think there are a number of useful -- useful functions,


the ones you described, also collateral consequences. 

QUESTION:  And collateral consequences, yes.


MR. MILLER:  But -- but generally in exercising


these rights and describing these rights, you give the


general -- the general right, not -- not the specific


services.  The -- the Ruiz case indicates that.  And in


the Patterson setting, the -- you know, the things that a


lawyer could do about strategy on the questions or make


sure that you weren't tripped up on the questions, that


was not required by Patterson.  It's the -- it's the main


consequences.  It's the direct consequences that Patterson


requires and that this requires.

 And, Your Honor, if we go into all the useful


things that an attorney can do -- and -- and certainly


there are many -- then it's -- it's almost an endless


list.  It's a fairly long list.  And then we're cluttering


up the -- the colloquy.  It's already a -- a rather long


colloquy.


QUESTION:  This -- this comes after, I take it,


General Miller, the discussion between the judge and the


defendant as to whether or not the elements of the offense


are present?


MR. MILLER:  It would -- it would have -- I


guess it would have to come after that.  I mean, I think


-- I think the factual basis is really the key here.


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. MILLER:  The -- because that's -- that's the


-- that's our -- that's our real assurance that guilty --


QUESTION:  Well, and if -- if the defendant


represents to the court that the factual basis for the


plea is there, that he committed the offense charged, why


is there any great interest in trying to persuade him not


to do that?


MR. MILLER:  You know, I -- I don't think there


is a great interest, Your Honor, and I don't -- I don't


think -- I don't think the -- the system is served here


particularly what -- what the Iowa Supreme Court required

that, you know, a -- and a lawyer can give you an


independent assessment of -- of whether it's wise to plead


guilty.  Obviously, that's something that -- that we know


about lawyers.


And also really subsumed in that, to some


extent, is the -- the question of defenses, but it's not a


-- it's not a particularly helpful litany that they


developed. 


QUESTION:  I --


QUESTION:  Well, the Iowa court made rather a


long laundry list of requirements.  I suppose you wouldn't


have to go along with all of those things, but I am


interested to know whether you think there is a baseline


requirement that the court advise the defendant in making 

a plea that he has a right to counsel and the attorney


could be helpful in making that decision. 


MR. MILLER:  Well, I -- I think that -- that he


has to know that he has -- has the right -- right to


counsel.  But --


QUESTION:  You don't think he has to know that


counsel would be helpful.


MR. MILLER:  The -- he knows that counsel is --


would be helpful. 


QUESTION:  He doesn't have to be told that


counsel would be helpful.

 MR. MILLER:  He doesn't have to be told.  An


individual knows that -- that -- it certainly follows much


like in Patterson -- knows that the counsel would advise


him whether to ask -- answer the questions or not.  But


that's something someone --


QUESTION:  But you do agree that he's -- you do


agree that the advice should include explicit advice that


he has a right to counsel at the plea hearing.


MR. MILLER:  He should -- he should know at the


plea hearing that he had a right to counsel.


QUESTION:  But he doesn't have to be told by the


judge that he has a right to counsel at the -- he was not


-- this -- in this case he was not told by the judge he


had a right to counsel at that hearing.


MR. MILLER:  The -- the judge said, you know, I


-- I see you -- you made application, which would have


been for this hearing, for -- you -- you did not make


application --


QUESTION:  Well, why -- why is it clear that it


would be for this hearing because the judge followed up,


after saying that, did you want to represent yourself at


today's hearing, which would seem to me to imply that the


judge did not know whether or not he had already decided


not to have counsel at that hearing?


MR. MILLER:  Well, I think that question was

really did you change your mind.  I mean --


QUESTION:  Well, of course --


MR. MILLER:  -- you made -- you made a decision


at the initial hearing going forward towards this hearing


that you wouldn't have counsel.  Have you changed your


mind?


QUESTION:  Maybe -- maybe you -- you should say


that he should be advised of his right to counsel, but if


he isn't, it is a harmless mistake if it is clear from the


record that he knew it.


MR. MILLER:  That -- that certainly would --


QUESTION:  Even -- even if there is a -- a -- an


absolute right to have the judge tell you you're entitled


to counsel, if it's clear on the record at least that you 

were told, there's -- there's no foul.


MR. MILLER:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  But it's not clear on this record,


though. 


QUESTION:  But that you knew.


MR. MILLER:  Yes.  You know, I -- I think it is. 


You know, this -- every -- every presumption is -- is in


our favor in this kind of collateral setting.


QUESTION:  Well, if you draw -- draw


presumptions, maybe it is.  You presume everything was


regular.  Why sure, then it is.  But if you just look at

what was said to him at the hearing itself, it's not clear


that he knew that he had -- he had waived application for


a court-appointed attorney.  He didn't necessarily say he


wanted to represent himself.


MR. MILLER:  Well, I -- I think, Your Honor, in


-- in the context of the discussion at the initial


appearance and then drawing that towards the -- forward


into the -- the plea -- plea hearing, that -- and -- and


certainly indulging the -- the presumptions here, that --


that that -- that he did know.  And indeed, to this date


he's not asserted that he didn't know.


QUESTION:  Well, but the -- all I'm saying is


the record doesn't establish it, and we've been -- in some


situations been rather meticulous about what ought to be 

on the record because then you solve all the problems of


collateral attack if the record does disclose it rather


than relying on presumptions and inferences.  That's the


point. 


MR. MILLER:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Where did this case come out of?  A


justice court?  It was a misdemeanor, wasn't it, an OWI,


operating without a --


MR. MILLER:  It -- it was, Your Honor.  It would


be associate district court.  It would be a situation


where there -- there would be a -- would be a judge and --

who, you know, went through a -- you know, a long colloquy


with the -- with -- went through a colloquy concerning


representation. 


QUESTION:  But that was basically the rule --


what would be in the Federal system, a rule 11 colloquy,


and it's all canned.  I mean, the -- as the transcript


shows, he -- he went through the -- almost precisely the


same litany on both times.  So --


MR. MILLER:  Yes, Your Honor.  It -- it


parallels rule 11.  It's -- our rule 8 is -- is very


similar to -- to rule 11.  And at the -- at the plea


hearing, of course, he was asked three times whether he


wanted to plea or whether he wanted to -- to go forward


and -- and contest the case and that's -- in that setting. 

QUESTION:  He does have a right to counsel at


the plea hearing.  He does have a right if he asserts it


to consult with counsel before the hearing takes place,


but I -- I think your argument is he doesn't even have to


be told that bare information, never mind the -- the


continuing spiel about how much a lawyer would be worth to


him, but just the simple statement before you enter this


plea, you're entitled to consult a lawyer.  And if you


want a lawyer to be with you at the hearing, you're


entitled to that too.


MR. MILLER:  What -- what we're saying, Your

Honor, is that -- that that was covered by the -- the


words that Justice Breyer mentioned at -- at the outset,


that you know, I -- I see you waived application for


counsel at -- at the prior -- it would have been at the


prior proceedings, which would have been for this


proceeding, and do you -- you know, do you continue to


want to represent yourself.


QUESTION:  But I think there's something


important afterwards.  It's or did you want to take some


time to hire an attorney to represent you, which --


QUESTION:  That was at the sentencing.


QUESTION:  -- certainly one inference is that to


represent you at this kind of proceeding. 


MR. MILLER:  Yes, yes, Your Honor.  The --


the --


QUESTION:  That -- that was not said at -- at


his plea hearing.  That was said at his sentencing hearing


when he pled to another crime that he had committed in the


interim.


But at -- the lines of what went on at the plea


hearing is I see, Mr. Tovar, you waived application for a


court-appointed attorney.  Did you want to represent


yourself at today's hearing?  Period.  That was it.


MR. MILLER:  That -- that was at -- at that


proceeding, and -- and we argue that that -- those are the

-- those are the key words that really -- really wrap up


this issue, that he was told before he had a right to


counsel at this hearing.  There's a referral back.  It was


reaffirmed that he wanted to represent himself at -- at


the hearing. 


As I say, that -- that -- you know, it was not


raised by the -- by the defendant at the trial court level


or in the -- or in the resistance to the cert petition. 


And to this day, they -- they've not asserted that he

QUESTION:  The States seem to take various


positions on this.  Do you know if any of them have taken


it as a matter of their own constitution rather than the


Federal Constitution? 


MR. MILLER:  The State has -- has not on this --


on this particular issue.

MR. MILLER:  Not -- not that I know of, Your


Honor. 


QUESTION:  This -- this being?  This being the


issue on which we granted cert or the issue of whether you


have to advise him of his right to counsel?


MR. MILLER:  I -- I was assuming on -- on the


matter that was before the Court as -- as a matter of the

Your Honor, I'd like to reserve my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, General Miller.


Mr. Stewart, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The plea colloquy conducted at respondent's 1996


prosecution adequately informed respondent of the dangers


and disadvantages of proceeding without counsel. 


Respondent's waiver of counsel and the guilty plea itself 

were therefore knowing and intelligent.  The judgment of


the Iowa Supreme Court should be reversed. 


I think it may be helpful to look first at the


precise language that the Iowa Supreme Court employed in


announcing the warnings that it thought were


constitutionally required, and if the Court looks at page


18 of the appendix to the certiorari petition, that's the


paragraph of the Iowa Supreme Court's opinion that's


entitled Summary and Disposition.  And it --


QUESTION:  Page 18 of what?


MR. STEWART:  Of the appendix to the certiorari

petition.


And if you -- if you look in -- in the middle of


the page, the Iowa Supreme Court in summarizing its


holding said, rather, the trial judge need only advise the


defendant generally that there are defenses to criminal


charges that may not be known by lay persons and that the


danger in waiving of the assistance of counsel in deciding


whether to plead guilty is the risk that a viable defense


will be overlooked.  The defendant should be admonished


that by waiving his right to an attorney, he will lose the


opportunity to obtain an -- an opinion on whether under


the facts and applicable law it is wise to plead guilty.


In addition, the court must ensure the defendant


understands the nature of the charges against him and the 

range of allowable punishments. 


But the third paragraph is -- is more -- the


third sentence is more or less irrelevant because there's


no dispute here that the defendant was informed of the


nature and -- of the charge and the applicable


punishments, and that would be done in any standard plea


colloquy.  So it's really just the previous two sentences


that are at issue, and I think there are some noteworthy


points about these. 


The first is that the warnings mandated by the


Iowa Supreme Court don't contain any declarative sentence

to the effect that you have a right to represented by


counsel at this plea proceeding.  The Iowa Supreme Court I


think took it as given that respondent had been made


adequately aware that he had a right to counsel and that


what was missing was adequate information about the


services that counsel could perform in connection with the


plea decision. 


The second thing is that there's no reference in


these warnings to case-specific issues such as possible


suppression of evidence or the potential for plea


bargaining.  The -- the warnings are designed to be


warnings that could be given in every single case.  And in


our view, the warnings are either vacuous or misleading,


depending on how they're interpreted.


If they are accurately interpreted as


generalizations about the criminal justice process, they


really say nothing more than that as a class lawyers know


more about the law than people who are not lawyers, and


it's at least possible that consulting with a lawyer would


improve your chances in this criminal prosecution.  And I


think any defendant who is aware that he has the right to


counsel would be aware of those facts, would be aware of


at least the possibility that a lawyer could help him and


the certainty that a lawyer would know more about the


charges than he would.

 On the other hand, if the defendant


misunderstands these warnings as directed to him


personally as availed suggestion that there is actually a


meritorious defense in his own case, then the defendant


may be given an artificial disincentive to plead guilty


and in the case of a non-indigent defendant may be led to


spend his own funds consulting with a lawyer when in fact


no valid defense exists.


QUESTION:  Would a Miranda warning be sufficient


to advise the -- the defendant that you have a right to


counsel?  Period.  It's pretty obvious to me that if you


have a right to counsel at interrogation, you certainly


have a right to one at the plea bargain.  Would that be


sufficient?


MR. STEWART:  I think it would be


constitutionally sufficient, but it's certainly better


practice to make sure that the defendant understands that


the right extends beyond the questioning itself.  And I


think that was done in the initial appearance.  The


defendant -- there's -- there's a form.  The defendant is


represented as having waived his right to application for


appointed counsel.  I suppose that still leaves open the


possibility that he could have retained counsel if he had


chosen to.  But I think that certainly apprised the


defendant of the right -- of -- of the fact that his right

to counsel extended beyond the initial questioning itself


and would continue for the duration of the proceedings. 


And we'd also point out that because this is a


collateral challenge, the defendant bears the burden of


establishing that no knowing and intelligent waiver


occurred.  And to the extent that there's a gap in the


record on this point, I think the defendant is properly


chargeable with that.


I'd also like to return to the point that


Justice Kennedy made earlier about the possibility that in


some cases an attorney might be able to obtain suppression


of incriminating evidence or might be able to negotiate


with the prosecution about possible plea bargains.  I


think first it's noteworthy that the standard rule 11 

colloquy mentions several constitutional rights that an


individual gives up by pleading guilty, but it doesn't


mention the possibility of suppressing evidence and it


doesn't mention the possibility of plea bargaining.  So it


would be odd to think that you could have a


constitutionally valid waiver even though the defendant


was not informed of those substantive possibilities but


would, nevertheless, have to be informed of the assistance


that a lawyer might provide in connection with those --


QUESTION:  Mr. Stewart, do you know what the


general practice is in Federal courts?  Are there

instructions given to prosecutors to make sure, for


example, that the defendant at a guilty plea is told that


maybe the -- that he has a right to a lawyer and he might


be helpful?


MR. STEWART:  Well, as to the -- it does --


Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 in its current form


says that if the defendant appears at the plea hearing


without counsel, he is to be informed that he has a right


to counsel at trial and at every other stage of the


proceedings.  So there's clearly a requirement that the


defendant be made aware that he has a right to counsel at


the plea hearing.


Neither the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure


nor the bench book for U.S. district judges requires that 

the defendant be given additional information about the


services that an attorney might provide or the likelihood


that an attorney could be helpful by --


QUESTION:  Do you know the practice in -- in


other States generally? 


MR. STEWART:  My sense is that there is probably


a great deal of variation not only from State to State,


but among different courts within different States I


think, and I think that's probably the -- the likelihood


in the Federal system as well.


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I suppose my comment was

in response to the argument that, well, it really doesn't


make any difference, which is the -- the intimation I -- I


saw in -- in the brief.  And I suppose it doesn't make any


difference because we assume that anybody knows this


stuff?


MR. STEWART:  I don't think we would assume that


any -- necessarily any layperson would be aware of the


potential for suppressing evidence or the possibility of


negotiating a plea arrangement.  I think any defendant


knows more generally that lawyers have legal expertise


that lay people lack. 


But I think if -- if we try to -- to think about


how warnings about suppression and plea bargaining might


work, I think we realize why the Iowa Supreme Court shied 

away from something like that because, on the one hand, if


this Court instructed, as a matter of constitutional law,


that whenever an uncounseled person pleads guilty, he has


to be informed that in some cases it may be possible to


suppress incriminating evidence and in some cases it may


be possible to negotiate with the prosecution for a


reduced charge, a lot of defendants are going to be given


false hope because the possibility that those modes of


procedure might succeed would vary enormously.


QUESTION:  Why -- why wouldn't the same argument


apply to all of the rights that you're going to lose if

you plead guilty?  Why -- why wouldn't rule 11 be really


largely unnecessary under your view?


MR. STEWART:  Well, I -- I think those rules


really do focus on things that will actually happen in any


criminal trial if the defendant decides not to plead


guilty.  That is, the defendant is informed if you plead


guilty, you are waiving the right either to testify or not


testify on your own behalf.  You're giving up the right to


counsel.  You're giving up the right to cross-examine


witnesses.  The defendant really is being told about


things that are likely to occur in virtually any criminal


trial, and I think that's -- that's the idea of a


standardized plea colloquy.


On -- on the other hand, if you're talking about 

suppression of evidence or talking about plea bargaining,


if you give that advice in every case, it's often going to


be misleading.  A trial judge is going to find himself in


the position of saying you might be able to bargain with


the prosecution over a reduced charge even though he knows


that the policy of the prosecutor is not to engage in plea


bargaining with respect to a category of cases that


includes that one.


QUESTION:  Mr. Stewart, as I understand your


argument, you're -- you're arguing not only are these


warnings not constitutionally mandated, you're also saying

they're probably unwise in a number of situations.  Are


you arguing that they're so unwise that we should tell, as


a matter of Federal law, a State judge could not give


these warnings?


MR. STEWART:  No, I don't think there would be


any Federal law barrier to States requiring warnings such


as these.  And I -- I think the -- the vacuous warnings,


the warnings we regard as vacuous, that were mandated by


the Iowa Supreme Court are less likely to be harmful than


more specific warnings about --


But the other point I wanted to make is if the


Court decided that it wouldn't be a good idea to warn


about suppression of evidence or plea bargaining in every


case but maybe it would be advisable to do that in some 

cases, that would really be thrusting trial judges in an


untenable position because the point of having a


standardized plea colloquy is to give judges a -- a safe


harbor, to give them some assurance that if they provide


standardized advice in every case, that's going to be


enough.  And if a trial judge had to decide is the


likelihood of a successful plea negotiation sufficiently


great in this particular case that the defendant should be


advised about it or do I see a viable basis for asking for


suppression of evidence, it would really make the trial


judge's life much more difficult.  And if the Court were

to hold, as a matter of constitutional law, that the trial

failure to, it would really cause disruption.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Stewart.


Ms. Wilson, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THERESA R. WILSON


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. WILSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Before a court may accept a guilty plea from an


uncounseled defendant, the Constitution requires that the


defendant be advised of the following:  of his right to


have counsel present prior to and during entry of the


guilty plea, including appointed counsel if necessary; 

that by waiving counsel, he will lose an independent


opinion of his case and on the wisdom of pleading guilty;


and that by waiving counsel, he risks overlooking


potential defenses that he as a layperson may not


recognize.  These are the minimal standards required for a


waiver of plea counsel.


QUESTION:  Where is it --


QUESTION:  That -- that isn't what the Supreme


Court of Iowa required in this case, is it?  I mean, the


-- their warning, as read by Mr. Stewart, was not nearly


that specific.

 MS. WILSON:  Correct.  The Iowa Supreme Court


applied the rules of Patterson and Faretta, determining


that a uncounseled defendant who chooses to plead guilty


must be given a meaningful discussion regarding the


usefulness of counsel at the plea proceeding and the


dangers of proceeding pro se.  The court determined that


the best way to fulfill that obligation is to advise the


defendant of the risks of overlooking potential defenses


and of the loss of an independent opinion regarding his


case.


QUESTION:  My -- I guess the difficulty that I


have with that is no -- no question about the -- the


soundness of those general statements, but they are so


general that they -- they raise the question whether there 

are really very many defendants that don't know that to


begin with and whether there is a real utility in


requiring those warnings and hence paying the price in the


mistaken cases when they're not given.  Do -- do


defendants really need this?


MS. WILSON:  Yes.  We simply cannot infer from


the fact that a defendant is told that he has counsel or


has a right to counsel that he necessarily understands the


sort of assistance counsel could provide.  The American


Bar Association has discussed this particular problem in


their criminal justice standards, specifically part 5,

8.1.  The American Bar Association recognizes that to many


defendants the word counsel may not necessarily have any


clear meaning.


QUESTION:  Did they say how they knew that?


MS. WILSON:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Did they say -- did they -- I mean,


I'm -- I am impressed by the fact that rule 11(b), which


is a product of the rulemaking process and presumably, I'm


sure, it reflects the experience of trial lawyers, which


is not my experience, and -- and they try to get in things


like the ABA.  Yet, they do not require that you tell the


lawyer how useful -- you tell the -- the individual how


useful the lawyer will be.  They do require that you tell


the defendant how -- that he has a right to a lawyer at 

every stage of the proceeding.  So I took from the fact


that the ABA and everybody else lobby nonstop for this


kind of thing that they felt it was very desirable but not


so important that you had to actually include it in the


colloquy.  Otherwise, it would be there in rule 11(b). 


So now, what -- what does the ABA say?  Do they


say it's a constitutional requirement?  Do they try to


change even the rule?  No.  I don't think they do.


MS. WILSON:  No.


QUESTION:  But you're -- you're saying that the


Constitution requires the thing that the lawyers

themselves through their groups have felt is desirable but


not important enough to put in the rules.  Wouldn't we go


to the rules first?


MS. WILSON:  Not necessarily.  Under -- under


Patterson, under Faretta, even as -- back as far as


Johnson v. Zerbst, this Court has required that any waiver


of a constitutional right be a voluntary, knowing, and


intelligent abandonment or relinquishment of a known right


or privilege.


QUESTION:  But, Ms. Wilson, you know, as to how


much that requires, when we invented the Miranda warning,


we -- we simply required that -- that the defendant be


told you have a right to counsel.  We didn't -- we didn't


say that he be told, and by the way, the first thing 

counsel will tell you is to shut up, which would be very


good advice. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  We didn't require that.  We just said


you have a right to counsel.  And -- and you want us to --


to elaborate upon the Miranda warning as well?


MS. WILSON:  The -- those particular warnings


were used both in the Miranda case and in the Patterson


case, Sixth Amendment right to counsel at post-indictment


questioning.  In both of those cases, a defendant still


has other alternatives even if he does make statements to

the police.  He can attempt to recant his statement.  He


may have other available defenses.  If a defendant appears


before a court to enter a guilty plea uncounseled, that


admission is going to be conclusive proof of guilt,


leading to a final conviction that isn't revocable.


QUESTION:  Why -- even on this very record, when


he came for the sentencing, the judge did say, as Judge


Kennedy -- Justice Kennedy pointed out, that are you sure


you don't want more time to consider having counsel.  And


one of the questions I was going to ask you is given that


the judge was so solicitous at the sentencing hearing,


could the defendant at that point have said, judge, I've


thought about what I did at the plea hearing and I'd


really like to withdraw my plea? 


I think you're right. 

I 

need more time to consult a lawyer.


MS. WILSON:  He -- the defendant would have been


able to file a motion in arrest of judgment.  I do not


recall off the top of my head if that deadline had passed


by the time of his sentencing.  I believe it needs to be


filed within 5 days of sentencing.  So he may not have


been able to do that procedurally.


QUESTION:  But the judgment is entered only


after the sentence, I would assume.  Is that correct in


Iowa?


MS. WILSON:  Correct.

 QUESTION:  So it -- it just seemed to me that a


judge, being so solicitous about this crime that didn't


carry any jail time, would -- would certainly say the one


that does carry jail -- jail time, yes, you think you want


to talk to a lawyer?  It's okay.  We'll hold it in


abeyance and you talk to your lawyer.


MS. WILSON:  Correct.  The -- the discussion


that the court had with Mr. Tovar was very abbreviated at


the arraignment.  At the time the court gave its


discussion, I see you're appearing here today without


counsel, do you wish to proceed pro se, the district court


had no idea whether Mr. Tovar was going to enter a plea of


guilty or not guilty.  And unfortunately, a defendant in


that situation may come into a court believing that he 

does not have a right to counsel simply because he's going


to plead guilty.  Nothing that district court would have


told him up to that point would have dissuaded him from


such a belief.


QUESTION:  Is -- is there any allegation in this


case that the defendant didn't know he had a right to


appointed counsel for the plea?  That allegation has not


been made before, has it? 


MS. WILSON:  No, and I do want to address that.


QUESTION:  Are you making it now?


MS. WILSON:  I am indicating that the record

simply doesn't show whether the defendant had any


knowledge of the right to plea counsel, and


unfortunately --


QUESTION:  No, but that's not an issue in this


case, is it?


MS. WILSON:  It is and -- and the -- the State


did say that this issue was not addressed in the Iowa


Supreme Court.  And it may be an error on my part I did


not raise it as a denial of counsel case.  But in fact, in


the brief filed before the Iowa Supreme Court and the Iowa


Court of Appeals, I did raise the fact that Mr. Tovar was


not informed that he had a right to plea counsel, that the


only discussion of the right to counsel at that plea


hearing was in the context of the right to counsel at 

trial he was waiving.


QUESTION:  But in any case, you -- you didn't


cross petition and you didn't raise this in the brief in


opposition I take it.


MS. WILSON:  Correct.


QUESTION:  We're -- all of this -- it goes back


to a prior conviction not his most recent one I take it,


and all the facts we're talking about were at -- those


associated with the prior conviction, not this more recent


one.


MS. WILSON:  Correct.

 The -- the reason that the issue of whether he


was informed of plea counsel is important is because that


is the first requirement for a valid waiver of counsel. 


The first requirement is an intentional relinquishment of


a known right.  This means that a defendant must be made


aware that he has a constitutional right.  According to


Miranda v. Arizona, the only way to ensure that is to tell


the defendant that he has the right.


QUESTION:  All right.  So if we agree with you


about that, the thing to do is send it back. 


MS. WILSON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Is that right?


MS. WILSON:  Yes. 


QUESTION: 


And they can decide it. 

MS. WILSON:  Correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  I mean, we can't decide it.  I mean,


we could decide it but I guess it's not really fairly


raised, is it?


MS. WILSON:  Correct.  That -- that is an option


for the Court, Your Honor.  Correct. 


QUESTION:  Send it back.


QUESTION:  Do we usually do that, send -- say,


you know, search the record for other possible failures of


the lower court --


MS. WILSON:  No, Your Honor.

 QUESTION:  -- that haven't been raised and then


send the thing back?


MS. WILSON:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Why should we do it here?


MS. WILSON:  Again, it -- it was raised below. 


Unfortunately, the Iowa Supreme Court did not directly


address it.  And it is part of the waiver analysis. 


QUESTION:  Well, but you didn't cross -- as


Justice Souter --


MS. WILSON:  No.


QUESTION:  -- you didn't cross-petition.


MS. WILSON:  No.


QUESTION:  You didn't put it in your brief in


opposition.


MS. WILSON:  No.


QUESTION:  Well, I guess if we just -- what we'd


normally do here is we say -- suppose we didn't agree with


your -- on your basic argument.  We say, well, you lose on


that one.  Now we send it back from appropriate


proceedings, whatever is appropriate.  I don't know.  At


that point, I guess you'd go back to the Iowa court and


you'd say you didn't address this other issue which I had


in my brief.


MS. WILSON:  Correct.


QUESTION:  Is there a reason we can't do that?

I don't know. 


MS. WILSON:  No, Your Honor.  There -- there's


no -- I don't see any reason why this Court couldn't do


that.


QUESTION:  The -- the Court usually remands for


proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. 


MS. WILSON:  Correct.


QUESTION:  And -- and if the Court just


addresses what's before them, whether the sentences that


Mr. Stewart read to us whether the -- if the Court decides


it, that's not what the Constitution requires, then it


vacates or reverses and remands and Iowa could take it


from there.


MS. WILSON: 


Correct, Your Honor, but the -- the 

point at which the Iowa Supreme Court did decide is -- is


still a valid point, that regarding whether there needs to


be a brief discussion regarding the usefulness of counsel


and the dangers of proceeding pro se.


QUESTION:  So how do you deal with the question


that was posed that it raises a false hope, and if you


tell a defendant a lawyer might know defenses that you


don't know, but wouldn't the defendant then ask the judge,


Judge, would you please tell me what those defenses might


be?


MS. WILSON:  And then the appropriate response

from the court would be, I can't advise you.  I'm not your


attorney.  If you believe anything I've said here raises


some doubts, speak with an attorney.  Otherwise, we could


proceed with the guilty plea if you wish.


QUESTION:  But the attorney is going to cost me


$200 an hour.  Give me a break.  Let me know whether it's


going to be worth it or not.  And the judge will say,


sorry, I can't say anything about that.


MS. WILSON:  That's exactly correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  You ought to know that attorneys are


useful.  That's -- that -- do you think that's a


considerable help?  You ought to know that attorneys are


useful?


MS. WILSON:  It at least indicates that the


defendant has been given some warning regarding how an


attorney may assist him.  And again, the -- the ABA says


that the fact that you just merely tell a defendant that


he has a right to counsel, it doesn't necessarily help.


QUESTION:  Was it in this case that the judge


told the defendant he was not entitled to free counsel


because he was dependent on his parent where he was going


to Ames or something like that?


MS. WILSON:  That was at the sentencing hearing. 


Mr. Tovar did make an application for court-appointed


counsel that was denied because he was dependent upon his

parents as a college student.


This case essentially falls into a -- a gap


between Patterson and Faretta.  Both of those cases


require some discussion regarding the usefulness of


counsel and the dangers of proceeding pro se.  The Iowa


Supreme Court attempted to fill that gap by requiring


these particular admonishments.  But these admonishments


reflect the core responsibility of defense counsel at a


plea proceeding and also are responsibilities this Court


has recognized in previous cases.


QUESTION:  Do you know any other jurisdiction


that has required such a -- a litany of warnings before a


plea could be accepted?


MS. WILSON:  Specific litany?  No.  I do believe


Pennsylvania rules do provide a -- a six-point litany, I


believe. 


But I would direct the Court's attention to the


brief filed by the National Legal Aid and Defender -- yes


-- National Legal Aid and Defender Association in this


case that outlines the various requirements in both the


circuits and the States.  The majority -- about half of


the jurisdictions in this Nation have not discussed this


particular issue, waiver of counsel at a plea proceeding. 


Of those that have, the majority have either required or


preferred a Faretta type colloquy for waiver of counsel at

a plea proceeding.  All the Federal circuits that have


discussed this issue have applied that standard.  18


States --


QUESTION:  You say applied that standard.  You


mean imposed it as a constitutional requirement? 


MS. WILSON:  Have either required or preferred a


discussion of the dangers of proceeding pro se at a plea


proceeding. 


QUESTION:  When you say preferred, what do you


mean by that? 


MS. WILSON:  It -- the failure to use those


particular standards may create a rebuttable presumption,


but the other factors in the case may show that a


defendant did validly understand or did understand the 

right to counsel.


QUESTION:  And did the -- you're talking about


now Federal courts of appeals? 


MS. WILSON:  Federal circuits.


QUESTION:  And -- and they held this as a matter


of Federal constitutional law?


MS. WILSON:  I -- I believe so.  I believe the


Ninth Circuit did.


QUESTION:  Any other circuits?


MS. WILSON:  I can't remember off the top of my


head.  Again, I would -- I would direct the Court's

attention to that brief. 


Only 10 States that have considered this issue


do not require a Faretta type colloquy.  Some of those do


use the -- the plea colloquy. 


But I guess it -- it's -- this issue, though it


hasn't been directly addressed in the brief, but obviously


it's a concern of the States whether this may have


retroactive effect or whether it's prospective effect as


far as its effect on recidivist statutes.  Mr. Tovar would


argue that these standards, if adopted, could be applied


prospectively because they do create a new rule.  Although


they are certainly inspired by Patterson and by Faretta,


these particular admonishments are not required by those


cases, and again, those cases do not address the 

particular context of a plea proceeding. 


It --


QUESTION:  In your brief, Ms. Wilson -- let me


make sure I've got the right one.  Yes.  In your table of


authorities, you have a number of cases from this Court


and then you have a number of State cases which seem to be


mostly Iowa cases. 


MS. WILSON:  Correct.


QUESTION:  And then you don't cite any Federal


-- Federal cases such as the ones I presume you were


referring to.  Was there some reason, if -- if they

support you, why you didn't put them in your brief?


MS. WILSON:  It was a cooperative effort between


my office and the National Legal Aid and Defender


Association. 


QUESTION:  And which one dropped the ball? 


(Laughter.) 


MS. WILSON:  I -- I can't honestly answer that,


Your Honor. 


But even assuming other jurisdictions do not use


these particular standards, the burden upon the State will


be alleviated for a number of reasons. 


First, if for example, Iowa wanted to use a


guilty plea from another jurisdiction for enhancement, a


defendant would have the burden of proof on a collateral 

attack.  If these standards were not used, that may create


a presumption that the waiver was invalid.  However, the


State could certainly attempt to prove the validity of the


waiver through other means.


In addition, if the other jurisdiction does not


use these standards -- some of the claims are simply going


to be time-barred.  For example, in Iowa after direct


appeal, there is a 3-year window of opportunity for a


defendant to apply for post-conviction relief.  So Mr.


Tovar, who did not apply for a direct appeal of his guilty


plea and did not for a post-conviction relief, would be

time-barred from challenging it now. 


The --


QUESTION:  Now, what if under -- under Iowa law


you have a case like the present one?  When this case --


the -- Tovar pleaded -- rather, he -- he pleaded not


guilty.  He went to trial, didn't he?  And supposing that


the prior conviction is 4 years old, can he not challenge


that under Iowa law when he appeals as -- as an enhancing


factor?


MS. WILSON:  Do you -- can you rephrase the


question.  I'm not quite sure.


QUESTION:  Yes.  What -- what I'm concerned


with, take the -- the present case.  The defendant pleads


not guilty, goes to trial, the jury finds him guilty.  And


one of the bases for sentencing is that 4 years ago he


pleaded guilty to a similar crime but didn't get these


waivers.  Under Iowa law, could he challenge that 4-year-


old conviction as an aggravating -- or whatever you want


to call it on appeal from his present conviction?


MS. WILSON:  I -- I would assume so, Your Honor. 


There's also a procedure in -- in Iowa law, Iowa Rule of


Criminal Procedure 2.19(9) that would actually permit a


defendant to challenge the use of that prior conviction


prior to the sentencing enhancement.  Now, the State may


have an argument if he did not do that.  Then the argument

would be waived.


QUESTION:  Is there any limit on how many years


back you go for enhancing prior convictions?


MS. WILSON:  It depends on the particular


statute, Justice Ginsburg.  In -- in Iowa for the OWI,


it's 12 years.  For domestic abuse, it's 6 years.  For


harassment, it is 10 years.  There's habitual offender


sentencing enhancement that does not contain any deadline


for use of prior convictions.


QUESTION:  What was the sentence imposed in this


case for the -- for the third offense?


MS. WILSON:  Third offense.  It's -- the -- the


particular sentence in this case was 180 days, all but 30


suspended, and a $2,500 fine. 


The maximum permitted by 

statute would be 5 years in prison.


Also, I do want to address a point that I


believe Justice Kennedy raised earlier regarding how


counsel may have been useful here given that he -- given


that Mr. Tovar received the mandatory minimum for a


conviction in his 1996 guilty plea.


It is true Mr. Tovar did receive the mandatory


minimum for his conviction for OWI first.  Unfortunately,


under the statute in effect at the time, Mr. Tovar also


would have been eligible for a deferred judgment.  This is


something apparently the prosecutor did not offer to Mr.

Tovar and it's something the district court did not advise


him regarding.  It is something that had counsel been


present, it would have benefitted Mr. Tovar who would have


been a prime candidate for a deferred judgment. 


Also, I want to address the contention that a --


the factual basis discussion inherent in a guilty plea


helps to ensure that a defendant is pleading guilty to the


correct crime.  Unfortunately, that's not always the case


and I can provide an analogy. 


Defendant is charged with forgery for writing


checks on another person's account.  The district court


holds a factual basis colloquy with the defendant, asks


the defendant did you make out these checks, and before


doing this, advises the defendant that it cannot accept 

his guilty plea unless it has a factual basis to support


the conviction.  The court asks the defendant, did you


make out these checks?  Defendant says, yes. 


Minutes of testimony don't indicate whether he


signed his name or the other person's name.  The defendant


himself does not say at the guilty plea whether he signs


his name or the other person's name.  Under Iowa law, in


order to be guilty of forgery, a person must do an act


purporting to be the act of another.  If defendant signs


his own name to that check, it's not forgery.


QUESTION:  Well, that would be the judge's fault

then in -- in not assuring that he was aware of all of the

MS. WILSON:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  I mean, all you're saying is the


judge can make a mistake.


MS. WILSON:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  But I mean, even if we grant what you


want in this case, judges will still be able to make


mistakes.


MS. WILSON:  Correct, but unfortunately --


QUESTION:  If he doesn't make a mistake, he


would know all the elements of the crime.  Right? 


MS. WILSON:  Um-hum. 


And unfortunately, in -- in the situation of an 

uncounseled defendant, as in that case, the defendant


wouldn't know that he's not legally guilty, that there was


no factual --


QUESTION:  But in this case -- this case I don't


think you can raise any such --


MS. WILSON:  No.


QUESTION:  -- thing because it was a -- a blood


alcohol test that did him in, and he didn't dispute the


results of that test.


MS. WILSON:  Correct.  There may have -- in an


OWI case, your mostly likely defenses are going to be

suppression, implied consent.  Mr. Tovar didn't make any


of those challenges in this case.  He may have had them.


QUESTION:  Well, I'll ask you the same question


I -- I asked of General Miller.  If in fact the defendant


here, Mr. Tovar, says, yes, I was guilty of driving under


the influence and I know that the test said that and I


don't disagree with it, what public policy is there to try


to get him to change his mind because you might have


suppressed some of that evidence? 


MS. WILSON:  We're not attempting to make


defendants change their mind.  What Mr. Tovar and the Iowa


Supreme Court is hoping to do is to ensure that a


defendant knows exactly what they're getting into when


they plead guilty, that they know that they have the 

availability of counsel and the basic services counsel can


provide, and therefore they will be pleading guilty


uncounseled with their eyes open.


The -- the plea colloquy suggested -- or the


waiver colloquy suggested by the Iowa Supreme Court is not


unduly burdensome.


QUESTION:  Can I ask?  Like the Chief, I'm --


I'm not sure that as a matter of public policy I -- I even


-- even like what -- what you're suggesting even if it


were made very, very simple.  That is to say, we've gone


through the elements of the crime and you acknowledge that

you've committed all of them.  What you ought to know,


however, is that if you got an attorney, he might find


some gimmick that would allow you not to be convicted of


this crime even though you have committed it.  You should


know that because it's your right, you know, to know that


you can get off even where you're guilty.  Now, is this


something that we really want to encourage? 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  So long as you've told the individual


these are the elements, are you sure you did it, why --


why isn't that all that the State should require?  We want


to encourage people to -- to confess.  We want to


encourage people, when they're guilty, to pay what used to


be called their just debt to society. 


Why do we want to 

encourage them to -- to hire a lawyer so that they'll get


off on a -- on an irrelevancy?


MS. WILSON:  It is doubtful that these -- these


-- well, I'll rephrase that.


The colloquy suggested by the Iowa Supreme Court


is certainly not going to prevent anyone from pleading


guilty.  The State speaks of the defendant who wants to


expeditiously accept responsibility.  That person is more


than likely going to plead guilty regardless of the length


of the colloquy given by the court.  However, what -- the


only person that may possibly be deterred by this sort of

a colloquy is the defendant who's already experiencing


doubts as to -- to his decision of whether to plead


guilty.


QUESTION:  Do you think it would be valuable in


California to have somebody there to say, by the way, this


is the second time you've stolen a chicken and if you


plead guilty and do it again, you may go to jail the rest


of your life?  Or if you're in, say, Alaska, this seems to


be an assault case but it's connected, in fact, with the


charge of sexual assault.  So if you plead guilty, the


rest of your life you're going to have to be registered as


a sex offender.  Or to say, for example, if you're


immigrant, you know, it may not seem to be important to


you because it just happened to be hitting your child or 

something, you know, a slap or something like that, but


you're going to be deported likely if you plead guilty. 


Would it be useful to have a lawyer there to tell them


that?


MS. WILSON:  Absolutely, Your Honor, because the


district court isn't necessarily required to tell the


defendant such things and we're seeing in cases like


Lockyear v. Andrade, Ewing v. California where petty


offenses, because they are tied in with recidivist


statutes, are creating life sentences.  And it would make


sense to have an attorney.  If we're going to have this

robust system of recidivist statutes, then we should also


have a robust system of safeguards to ensure that a


defendant's due process rights are protected.


The -- the plea -- the waiver colloquy suggested


by the Iowa Supreme Court is not going to inhibit the plea


process.  Again, it's adding a few lines to the colloquy


that's already required for the acceptance of guilty


pleas.


Furthermore, such a standard would actually


assist the State in the long run.  These standards places


the waiver colloquy on the record for all to see.  This


assists not only the initial court in making the waiver


decision as an initial decision, but it also assists any


future court that may have to make a determination of the 

validity of the waiver.


QUESTION:  Well, if the Iowa Supreme Court


thinks so, it could put it in the Iowa rules.


MS. WILSON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And that -- that's how it would be.


MS. WILSON:  Correct.  They could do that.


QUESTION:  In this case, the Iowa Supreme Court


is projecting what it would be law for the Nation.


MS. WILSON:  Correct.  It was making an


interpretation of -- of Patterson and Faretta to the plea


context.  That's correct.

of usefulness of counsel, there's a -- you know, we've


explored a lot of difficulties and cross currents here


today.  What should happen is the States, as a matter of


-- of the legislature or as a matter of the -- the court,


making rules that -- that deal with these issues, rather 

than having a constitutional mandate for the whole


country.


With that, I would close except if there are


other questions from the Court.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, General


Miller.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
