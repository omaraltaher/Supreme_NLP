 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

this morning in Case 11-161, Armour v. City of 

 (10:09 a.m.)

Indianapolis.

 Mr. Stancil.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. STANCIL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The city chose a method for abandoning its 

sewer funding mechanism that left Petitioners paying 30 

times more than their next-door neighbors to connect to 

their neighborhood sewer project simply because 

Petitioners had paid their tax bills in full.

 Mere timing of payment does not render 

similarly situated taxpayers into separate groups.  And 

that is particularly true here where the taxpayers are a 

discretely defined group of homeowners sharing equally 

in a common specific benefit and State law explicitly 

defines them as similarly situated.

 The city's principal contention is that 

jettisoning the Barrett Law, the way they funded the 

initial taxation, was itself an end for this 

justification and itself justified the gross disparity

imposed on Petitioner -- on Petitioners.  That does not. 

The fact that an arbitrary classification may yield a 

desirable result does not render it any less arbitrary. 

The city must have a reason for drawing the distinction, 

but paying one's taxes in good faith does not eliminate 

a taxpayer's right to equal treatment.

 Indeed, State law here makes clear that 

delaying payment by choosing an installment plan does 

not put a taxpayer on special footing.  For example, the 

Barrett Law declares that installment payments, quote, 

"shall be collected in the same manner as other taxes." 

And installment payments are automatically secured by a 

lien against the property.

 Taxpayers who select the installment plan, 

which they may do for any reason or no reason 

whatsoever -- and, in fact, if they make no choice, they 

default into the installment plan.  They are required, 

if the city asks as it did here, to sign an agreement, 

agreeing to pay the installments in full with interest 

and not to contest the validity of the underlying 

assessment.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I understand 

your arguments.  Your adversary raises a point that 

concerns me, which is what happens to all other amnesty 

programs like parking ticket amnesties?  And if you take

your logic to an extreme, how about something that 

doesn't involve money but immigration status amnesty, 

illegal aliens who can apply for citizenship and be 

forgiven their illegal entry?

 Doesn't the logic of your theory basically 

mean that there are no circumstances in which the 

government could treat people differently?

 MR. STANCIL:  No, Your Honor, for several 

reasons.  For starters, this Court's equal protection 

and rational basis cases in particular make clear that 

context is key.  So, forgiving a penalty imposed on a 

speeder, for example, who has an overdue ticket or a 

parking ticket is a qualitatively different judgment 

than forgiving the underlying tax liability of a broad 

swath of -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Every time a police 

officer stops me for a traffic violation, I get angry 

when he lets somebody else go.  So, you're suggesting 

that there is a difference between that and this case 

where the government is basically saying you owe me 

something and I'm going to forgive you what you owe me?

 MR. STANCIL:  Yes, Your Honor.  The Chief 

Justice's opinion in Engquist took that specific example 

on, not with you in mind presumably, but took that 

example on specifically, and it said:  This is the kind

of action itself that is inherently a subjective 

individualized determination.  It's not irrational to 

pull over one traffic violator and not another because 

that's the nature of -- of the enforcement action.  That 

is qualitatively different from a tax imposed on 181 

homeowners who live next door to each other, and then 

12 months later saying, you know, 31 of you are going to 

pay 30 times as much in reality as the other 150, even

JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought there were a lot 

more than -- there are 20 different lots, 20 

different -- there are -- I mean, when -- what's your 

view of -- of how the cutoff should work?  Do they have 

to refund all the money, everybody who, in fact, ever 

paid a Barrett Law assessment?

 MR. STANCIL:  No, Your Honor, and State law 

on this is quite clear.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't care what the State 

is; I'm saying a matter of constitutional law.

 MR. STANCIL:  Well, constitutional law looks 

to State law.  That's what we took out of Allegheny 

Pittsburgh and Nordlinger.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  All right.  So what?

the following taxpayers are similarly situated, your

guaranteed equal treatment.  It isn't that you're

this law.  It's -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why can the State, when 

they have, let's say, 10,000 people who have already 

paid their assessments -- well, why doesn't it have to 

give them back their money, on your theory?  That's my 

simple question.

situated.  Because -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why aren't they?

 MR. STANCIL:  Because your -- the States 

have flexibility to define at the outset who is 

similarly situated.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Fine.  They define 

here who is similarly situated, and the people who 

aren't are the ones who are on the installment plan.

 MR. STANCIL:  No, Your Honor, but they still 

have to have a basis for saying that.  They don't -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  They do.  They do.  The 

reason is because they think it's unfair to give the

so, if we're going to free them, we don't want to go 

back into history and then suddenly give back all the 

people who've ever paid their assessment.  I mean -- so, 

we draw the line somewhere.

making it clear.  My point is that what's less rational 

about saying, if you paid, too bad; we're having an 

amnesty for the future?  What's less rational about 

doing that than saying some of the people who paid in 

full will get their money back, and some will not? 

Which is the line you want to draw.

treatment or roughly equal treatment.  So -- that's 

under State law.  So, they've already committed to who 

is and who is not similarly situated.  So, all you need 

to decide in this case -- and this is brought as an 

as-applied challenge by -- by these homeowners -- is: 

Are these people who are promised you will pay the very 

same as your next-door neighbor for this pipe that 

you're going to flush your toilet into -- are they 

allowed to then change their mind and say actually 

you're going to pay 30 times as much?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Stancil, who are 

"these people"?  We have the plaintiffs in this suit, 

and there's a judgment -- there was a judgment in the 

court of first instance and the appellate court for a 

dollar amount, but we're told that there are many more 

of these Barrett Law projects and that they all operate 

the same way.

 So, the result is a lot more money than 

these plaintiffs are claiming; is that not so?  If your 

position on the law is right.

 MR. STANCIL:  If we're -- if we are correct, 

the city will end up paying a little more than in our 

specific case, but I'd like to explain why and how much 

because it's an important distinction.

 There are about 21 Barrett Law projects that

still have balances outstanding.  Many of them are 

almost paid off.  So, it -- in -- there are only three 

that have the 30-year option.  The rest have the 10-year 

option.  Anything from 2001 prior.  So, in fact, I think 

I can give you specific numbers.

 There are seven projects that are less 

than -- that are half paid off or about less than -- or 

less than half paid off.  Because the equal protection 

violation is only triggered by gross disparity between 

equally -- similarly situated taxpayers, the city may or 

may not have to refund in each project down the line. 

If you're in year 9 of 10 of repayment, that's not a -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That counts as a gross 

disparity?

 MR. STANCIL:  If you're in year 9 of 10, I 

don't think that counts as a gross disparity.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  What does, is my question. 

How -- how do you separate a gross disparity from a 

non-gross disparity?

 MR. STANCIL:  Well, start with this case, 

which is easy.  It's 10 to 1 and 30 to 1.  It's the same 

number as in Allegheny Pittsburgh.  But even if you drew 

4 to 1 or 5 to 1 as a line, as the Court has done, say, 

in punitive damages cases where it suggested outer 

limits, that -- I think those are easy lines to draw and

certainly lines that the lower courts could draw.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  If -- if you win, does -­

does the city just have to give you enough to bring it 

down to 5 to 1 so that it's no longer a gross disparity?

 MR. STANCIL:  I don't think so, Your Honor. 

I think triggering -- the gross disparity triggers the 

violation.  And the question is, well, what's the remedy 

for a violation?  I think they'd have to have a reason 

for saying we're going to -- it would be the very 

definition of arbitrary to say, well, even though you're 

entitled to equal treatment as a matter of law, you 

know, and even though we're not -- it's not -- liability 

isn't triggered except for gross disparities, I think 

they would have to give us that -- that figure.

 And, Your Honor, if I could, I'd like to get 

back, Justice Ginsburg, to your question about how these 

other projects -- there's a suggestion by Respondents 

that there's a terrible line-drawing problem in how do 

we calculate these benefits.  It's simply not the case. 

We have this Federal class action in the Cox case, which 

is every other Barrett Law project that's active except 

ours.  We opted out.

 The damages question was before that court, 

because -- because the court ruled in favor of the 

position that this is an equal protection violation.

The city put together a damages pleading, and it -- and 

it produced to the dollar a calculation of every 

overpayment in every Barrett Law project.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But that isn't the 

administrative -- the administrative -- well, maybe 

that's one of them.  The administrative problem is, I 

thought, the following:  Imagine that you are the city 

mayor.  All right?  And suppose the mayor does what you 

want.  The mayor says I'll give all these people in 

their project back their money.

 The next day in my office, there show up 15 

people who say:  Last month, we happened to be in 

project 2, and we paid all our money.  Why don't you 

give us back our money?  You just gave it to the people 

in project 1.  Give it to us.

 And the next day after that, there are 14 

people from project 3 and from project 4.  What is your 

answer to those angry taxpayers who have said we don't 

understand why you refunded the money from project 1 but 

not for us?

 What's your answer?

 MR. STANCIL:  Two reasons.  One, you were 

not promised equal treatment under State law to those 

other projects; you were promised equal treatment with 

the people you live next door.  Two, you use a different

pipe.  These pipes cost different amounts of money to 

put in different places, and they're done over time.

 Your Honor's hypothetical -- actually, if I 

could tweak it a little bit, it -- the question is not 

who comes in for somebody -- who comes in from a project 

last month.  The only question is who comes in from a 

project 11 or more years ago, because those are the only 

ones that'll still be in repayment.

 The Cox -- if we win -- well, there's a 

repayment plan.  That's the only thing that creates 

this -- this asymmetry.  The only people who are going 

to come in and say, well, you refunded some people on my 

project but not me are people in repayment.  So, it's 

only going to be from a project '95 -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You see, the problem 

that I have is that you're trying to lop off half of the 

project, which is what was the Barrett project, without 

looking at what the new project is.  And that goes to 

what Justice Breyer's point was.  Moving forward, every 

old project and every new project is going to pay more 

money than they did under the Barrett Law because I 

think, if I understand correctly, the city is raising 

a -- essentially not a flat fee, but a fee, assessing a 

flat fee across all taxpayers so that these sewer lines 

can be built.

Am I correct about that?

 MR. STANCIL:  No, Your Honor.  For future 

sewer projects that they start, each person who connects 

to that new pipe pays a $2,500 flat fee.  Every resident 

citywide who uses the municipal sewer -- new, old, or 

whatever -- pays an extra about $10 a month under the 

new system.  So, what they did is they decided this 

program, the Barrett Law, is politically very unpopular; 

we would like to get rid of it.  Fair enough.  But they 

chose a way to do it.  They said well, we're going to be 

completely ignorant of -- of the effects.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But it -- but it says 

that new people are going to pay a flat fee.  Old people 

are going to pay $10 more a month that they didn't have 

to pay.

 MR. STANCIL:  Right.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so, why can't they 

come in, and why don't they come in, and say exactly 

what Justice Breyer said:  You forgave the payments of 

taxes for hooking up to the sewer system of these new 

people coming in.  You're treating me differently.

 MR. STANCIL:  There's -- there's nobody who 

will pay more under the new system than my clients 

because the new people pay $2,500 and the same monthly 

fees that now every Indiana resident pays.

with the fact that this was one decision tied to others. 

It was a package deal and -- so that the rationality of 

this package deal has to be seen in context.  You want 

to lop it off and say all I'm looking at is how much 

these taxpayers paid for this old system, not what the 

new system is creating.

 MR. STANCIL:  But that's because, under this 

Court's equal protection cases, they have to have a 

reason for this particular line.  They can't say we have 

a general objective, and it doesn't matter if we pursue 

it -­

20 who still have money outstanding, or are they all 

paid off?

various states of repayment.

Okay.  What happened to the taxpayers who still owe

prevail, if the taxpayers prevail on this claim.

 MR. STANCIL:  That's -- that's what they

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Could the city cure the 

problem by rescinding the forgiveness for those who paid 

under the installment plan -­

MR. STANCIL:  No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why not?

 MR. STANCIL:  This was specifically 

addressed in Allegheny Pittsburgh.  That's exactly what 

the West Virginia Supreme Court said.  They said, well, 

if you have any remedy, it's only to raise the taxes on 

other people.  And this Court specifically rejected 

that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You wouldn't have any 

incentive to bring a lawsuit if that were the remedy, 

would you?

 MR. STANCIL:  Right.  I'm already unpopular.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why isn't that a choice 

for the legislature?  Because everybody could be treated 

equally by getting their money back, or nobody gets out 

from under the old system.  So, why shouldn't that be -­

the decision is you can't treat these two groups of 

people differently.  So, I think the Court has said in a 

number of cases you can equalize up or down.  That is a 

legislative choice.

 MR. STANCIL:  It was a legislative choice, 

Justice Ginsburg, but having now made a choice that 

inflicts a constitutional violation, this Court's cases 

are clear, that the correct and the default rule is 

refunds, because -- for exactly the reason 

Justice Scalia raised.  Even if it's possible to go back 

and do that, which -- it isn't always the case, but even 

if it's possible, that just means the equal protection 

cases and tax cases don't get brought because the most 

you can hope to get is -­

there are many, many, many more open projects, involving 

much, much more cost than you're saying is true here. 

And the mayor looks at this and says:  You know what? 

Unless I can just draw the line here, I'm not going to 

be able to change this financing system, either unless I 

can draw the line here or unless I can say, you know, 

nobody gets any money.

 What's a mayor to do?

 MR. STANCIL:  Well, again, I agree with 

Justice Scalia that making a big mess isn't a 

justification for arbitrarily ending it.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but I -- I guess what 

I'm asking is we have this terrible program; everybody 

hates it; it's not fulfilling its intended purposes; the 

mayor and everybody else wants to change it:  How is the

when unwinding that program.  This Court in Plyler has 

said resources are not sufficient.

 And any tax case could be justified.  If 

the -- if the city says, well, you know, we want to 

have -- we want to refund X dollars to our taxpayers, 

but we only have enough to refund to the blonde people 

and not to brunettes, that's arbitrary, even if they 

couldn't afford to do it other ways -- another way.

 So, they can't just pick a method that sort 

of where the math works out or is convenient, and just 

say, well, that's the way we could have done it.

 I would, if I could, just return to the 

practical ways they could have done this, And I think 

that highlights just how arbitrary this line was.  They 

could have increased those monthly fees under STEP, the 

new program.  I mean, that's how they paid for the rest 

of these projects.  They're paying off the bonds of the 

old projects by charging everybody in Indianapolis $10 

more a month.

 They could have just collected -- in our 

project, they could have collected for 2 more years. 

They could have said you'll be forgiven -- I think it's 

about 27 months.  You will -- we're going to forgive 

your balances as of, you know, whatever that would be --

June of 2010, whatever it would be, 2007 -- collected

that money, and then they would have had the cash to 

refund to the people who had paid in an equal amount 

that they were forgiving to the others.  So, I think --

I think that's sort of -- it's a red herring to say, 

gosh, we had no other way, or we only had these options 

A, B, and C.

 I'd like to -- I really want just to drill 

down on the illustration of just how crazy I think this 

is.  Suppose that the United States decides tomorrow to 

go to a national sales tax instead of the Federal income 

tax.  It's February 29th; millions of people have paid 

their taxes for 2011; many, many -- most of us have not 

yet paid.  Could the IRS come in and say:  Well, if 

you've already filed and paid your taxes for 2011, too 

bad.  But lucky you, if you're a late filer; you're 

going to get your entire tax bill forgiven.

 I don't think that's remotely close.  I 

think that is arbitrary, and I'll give you a couple of 

reasons.  One, absolutely no notice.  So, the timing of 

payment, the method of payment that was selected, gives 

those taxpayers absolutely no notice as to some 

constitutional significance that attaches to it.

 And I don't think -- and I can tell you from 

talking to my clients, they don't -- they didn't think 

that by paying up front in full that they had -- they

were somehow sacrificing their chance to equal treatment 

or that the city might some day wipe out 97 percent of 

their neighbors' tax obligations.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That is the parking 

amnesty example that you have said wasn't the same. 

Because if an individual taxpayer has filed late, it's 

like the parking guy who didn't file his ticket, either.

 MR. STANCIL:  Well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, you really are 

saying that amnesty programs are out of the question if 

the risk is imposed equally on everyone.

 MR. STANCIL:  No, Your Honor.  In the 

parking ticket example, forgiving a penalty for late 

payment is a qualitatively different -- to borrow from 

Engquist again, a subjectively individualized 

determination designed to achieve another goal, a 

legitimate goal in itself.  Pay your parking ticket, and 

we'll let the penalty go.  That is different.

 So, if my clients were here saying, well, 

you're not charging me -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, but you're saying if 

you forgive the parking ticket, that's an equal 

protection violation.

JUSTICE BREYER:  The goal here is very 

simple.  They say we have hundreds or dozens or 20 

different programs anyway, and once we start getting 

into the business of distinguishing among people who are 

already paid up, it's going to be a nightmare.  And so, 

the only clear line we draw is between the people who 

are already paid up and the people who haven't paid. 

And we don't want those people who haven't paid to have 

to pay because that's going to be another 20 years of 

administrating $33 a month.

 Okay.  That's their rationale.  Now, that

really thought that this case was going to foul up the 

tax code or forgiveness, I think the IRS would be here 

or the United States would be here saying this is very 

similar to what we do on a daily basis in compromising 

debt on an individual basis.

thing to administer than the system that was struck down

be a contract clause sort of argument against what 

happened here?  In other words -- and if we could

you.  First, it says installment payments shall be 

collected in the same manner as other taxes.  It 

actually says "shall collect" two other times.  Requires 

a lien.  It says that municipal officials who don't 

collect installment payments can actually be held 

personally liable and removed from office for failing to 

discharge their duties.  That's on pages 2a to 3a of the 

appendix to the blue brief.

 So, I don't think there's any sensible way 

to read the Barrett Law as saying it doesn't require 

payment.  And none of the State court judges who've 

looked at this have suggested that.  And -­

be that there will be no forgiveness?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. CLEMENT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 In 2005, the City of -- the City of 

Indianapolis decided that it wanted to abandon its 

reliance on the Barrett Law, a program that had proved 

unpopular for financing public improvements.  In doing 

so, they decided to make a clean break and forgive the 

outstanding balances that were due under the Barrett Law 

program.  The alternative of maintaining those accounts

and maintaining the tax liens associated with those 

accounts for nearly three decades was particularly 

unattractive.  Now, the -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  I think you've put your 

finger on the reason for this, which is that the city 

calculated that what it did would be more politically 

acceptable than treating the people who paid up front 

equally on an economic basis with the people who paid in 

installment plans.  Now, if that's the reason for this, 

is that rational?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Alito, it -- it 

might well be rational.  I mean, sometimes things that 

make policy sense that the public likes also make good 

government sense.  And in this context, what they wanted 

to do is they wanted to get out of the Barrett Law 

business.  That's the exact words -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  But what does that mean, 

they wanted to get out of the Barrett Law business?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Can I put it very concretely? 

I mean, before this -- you know, when they used to have 

the Barrett Law and used it on an ongoing basis, within 

the controller's office, they had a Barrett Law office. 

They wanted to get rid of the Barrett Law office.

 How do you get rid of the Barrett Law 

office?  You get of the obligation to continue to

collect these payments for 30 years; you get rid of the 

obligations to keep all these files together and see 

whether you're in a position to enforce a tax lien.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  That really doesn't seem 

very complicated, to collect payments that people have 

agreed to pay.  And if they didn't want to do it 

anymore, I bet they could have contracted that out for a 

very modest fee to any number of private entities that 

would have done it for them.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Alito, of 

course, they could have continued to collect.  I think 

that's common ground here, which I think ultimately 

shows why this is a very curious equal protection 

theory, because if the city would have continued to 

collect these, you know, for 30 years, then they agree, 

there's no Equal Protection Clause problem at all.

 Now, I think as Justice Kagan was 

suggesting, if you now create a rule that says when they 

do forgive, they actually have to provide refunds and 

face Equal Protection Clause violations, then in the 

future, nobody is going to ever forgive.  What they're 

going to do in the future is, even though they're trying 

to move away from this policy, even though they're 

trying to get out of the Barrett Law business, they're 

going to be stuck.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So, I think maybe if you 

prevail in this opinion, we should say the principle we 

are adopting in this case is:  Don't trust the 

government.

 MR. CLEMENT:  No, Justice Kennedy, I don't 

think that's right.  But the fact that that's your 

reaction I think shows that this is not really an equal 

protection claim, and it's not really like Allegheny 

Pittsburgh because, as your colloquy with Mr. Stancil 

suggested, they would admit that if the government said, 

as part of the Barrett Law, look, you know, we reserve 

the right to abandon the Barrett Law, and if we do so, 

we -- you know, we may forgive installment payments -­

if they said that, the equal protection claim would go 

away in their view.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's simply 

because, as we said in Allegheny Pittsburgh, the basis 

for considering the equal protection claim is the rights 

that you're given under State law.  In Allegheny 

Pittsburgh, it says you have the right to be treated 

equally with respect to assessments.  And you weren't.

 Here the law says you have the right to be 

treated equally, or whatever it is, the apportionment, 

and they weren't.  All that you're saying there is that 

State law gets to set the base.  And if the State law

says we don't treat people the same in extending sewer 

hook-ups, then that takes away your Equal Protection 

Clause.  But it just sets the base.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Two differences, 

Mr. Chief Justice.  First of all, you know, there's 

no -- there's no real analogue to Allegheny Pittsburgh 

because Allegheny Pittsburgh is a one time in time case. 

There the problem was that statute was very different. 

It was facially neutral, and it was being applied in an 

unequal way.

 Nothing, not one word, in Allegheny 

Pittsburgh suggests that if the State of West Virginia 

wanted to change its policy and adopt proposition 13 as 

the law of West Virginia, that it couldn't do so.  And 

that's the anomaly here.  This equal -- this equal 

treatment requirement they get, they get it from the 

Barrett Law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The change in 

policy -­

MR. CLEMENT:  That's the exact law that -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The change in 

policy is from treating people equally to treating 

people unequally.  I don't see how the fact that they're

to the same assessment to a system where some pay 

something and other people pay 30 times that.  Yes, it's 

a change, but it's the change that presents the problem.

 MR. CLEMENT:  No, I -- with respect, I think 

it's the change that makes this case different from 

Allegheny Pittsburgh.  It's the change that makes this 

government action rational.

 This would be a different case if they 

didn't change the Barrett Law program, and they just 

stuck by it and said, you know, we're going to forgive 

some people.  But here they decide they're going to -­

Justice Alito.  If you want to hear -- I mean, I'll go 

through them.  One is what I call making a clean break, 

having not to deal with the vestiges of the old program. 

You may call it political expedience.  I don't think it 

is.  I think that's, you know, a good government 

concern.

 The second is avoiding the administrative 

burdens of particularly the refund process.  And I think 

it's worth recognizing that -- you know, they say, well, 

what could be simpler; just cut a check.  But to whom 

and for what amount?  I mean, you know, if you're going 

to go back to close accounts, the first thing you're 

going to have to confront is what do we do with the 

people that have sold their house?

 Well, I mean, you know, we've got to figure 

out where they are now.  We've got to figure out, I 

mean, do we -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Those are reasons for not 

giving refunds, but what are the reasons for forgiving 

the debt that people agreed to?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well -- okay.  But, if I 

could, they don't challenge the forgiveness.  So, the 

reason that I'm trying to explain that there are 

rational bases for not giving refunds is because the 

challenge that's really brought here is to Resolution

refunds.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You don't dispute that the 

city would have that option if we rule against you.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Would have the option what, 

Mr. Justice Kennedy?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just not to forgive the 

unpaid balances.  The city has the option, I assume.

 MR. CLEMENT:  They certainly have the option 

in the future.  I think it's a dispute between the 

parties whether they have the option as a part of the 

remedy.  I would say, not to get ahead of myself, but to 

address the remedy, this is very different from 

Allegheny Pittsburgh.  And it has to be that one option 

is to simply invalidate Resolution 101.

 I'm not -- I don't -- I'm not aware of any 

other area of the law where you can have a statute or an 

ordinance that draws an invalid distinction, and one 

remedial option is not to invalidate the statute or the 

ordinance.  And that's the position.

 Their position is, you know, if you would 

have put something in there that said we're not going to

do anything, you'd be fine.  But having given 

forgiveness and said we're not going to give refunds, 

you're stuck not only with the forgiveness but also with 

giving refunds.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's a -- that's a big 

difference.  In one case, there's an expectation; in the 

other case, there isn't.

 MR. CLEMENT:  No, Mr. Justice Kennedy, 

because the expectation here is at the time of 

Resolution 101.  At the time of Resolution 101, I think 

it's common ground.  The city was under no obligation to 

provide forgiveness.

 So, if in 101, by providing forgiveness 

without refunds, they violated the Equal Protection 

Clause, why isn't the logical remedy for that to simply 

invalidate Resolution 101?  No forgiveness; everybody 

gets equal treatment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because you would -- you 

would eliminate all litigation on Equal Protection 

Clause grounds if all that the plaintiff is going to 

achieve is not any benefit to him but harming somebody 

else.

 That's -- the classic case is -- is the sex 

discrimination case, where a State had a drinking law 

which said that -- that men could drink at the age of 18

men will be able to drink at 18.  No, that's -­

There's no violation, and the law creates the violation.

MR. CLEMENT:  Right.  So, then you -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- I think you're 

dealing with an entirely different case.

 MR. CLEMENT:  If the law that created the 

violation is Resolution 101, than the remedy in every 

other area of constitutional law, including sex 

discrimination, is clearly that the State has the 

option.  They can level up or they can level down.  The 

only case that's different is Allegheny Pittsburgh and 

the assessment cases it relies on.  But there's an 

important difference.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Then you're saying that the 

difference between the two classes is that if you 

continue to have the tax apply to the people who haven't 

paid it yet, there is a large administrative expense. 

And if you -- as an expense that does not exist in 

respect to the class that has already paid it.

 So, the question, I would have thought, in 

our Court is whether that's a rational distinction.  And 

I think contrary to what was suggested, administrative 

expenses, of course, make a difference where the Equal 

Protection Clause is concerned because they 

differentiate between the two classes.  And trying to 

avoid an administrative expense is a rational reason, 

normally, for making the distinction.

Now, I mention that because I know -- what 

-- it can -- does that bring to mind any authority which 

would be helpful?  Because there was a question that 

there is no such authority.  It makes sense to me, but 

is there some authority for that?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Sure, there is, Your Honor. 

I 

mean, you look to a number of places.  I would look to 

Carmichael v. Southern Coal where, you know, this Court 

is confronting a case where the State says, you know, 

we're not going to tax employers -- employers who are 

smaller than eight, because, you know, the game is not 

worth the candle.  And in a similar way here, they say 

we want to get out of the Barrett Law business.  We want 

to make a clean break.  And they say, you know, we don't 

want to keep this office in the controller's office.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But here -- here the State 

has defined the class.  That's the difference.  I mean, 

to say employers with less than eight is a separate 

class, that's fine.  But -- but here, the State said 

we're creating this class of -- of people who have to 

pay for sewer assessments, and we're going to treat them 

equally.  That's what the law required.

 MR. CLEMENT:  I would have thought, Justice 

Scalia, if this was an equal protection case, not a 

contracts case, not a Winstar case, not an estoppel

case, if this was an equal protection case, the relevant 

time period would be the time period of the ordinance 

that's challenged, Resolution 101.  At that time, there 

is a difference already in real-world fact between those 

who've paid in full and those who have outstanding 

balance, and are going to keep the city in the Barrett 

Law business for three decades.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, you're saying that any 

future law which -- which disregards an equal 

classification that a prior law established is okay?  So 

long as it's a future law that does it.

still has to be a rational basis for it.

that's going to cost us $200,000 to upgrade and maintain 

this system.  We really don't want to spend that.

don't see the answer -­

MR. CLEMENT:  Now, is that $200,000

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Excuse me.  I don't 

see the answer to Justice Scalia's question.  You're 

saying this would be a rational system going forward, 

but you also promised the people that they would be 

treated equally over a certain period.

 When you start out it's not equal because 

somebody pays $400 and somebody else pays 10,000, and -­

but over the 30-year period, it's the same.  That's why 

it's equal in the beginning, even though somebody pays 

400 and somebody pays 10,000 because they're going to 

pay the same over the period.

 Then you lop off the period.  So, you're not 

treating them equally.  Go -- when you started.  You can 

no longer say don't worry about the inequality; it will 

sort out in 30 years.  Now you can't -- you have no way 

of telling them why it's not unequal.

estoppel case, like it's a Winstar case.  It's not a 

broken promise case.  This is an equal protection case. 

And the reason there's a rational difference at the time 

Resolution 101 is, is because that point in time has 

passed and they're in an different position.

 But I also do want to make clear that you 

will look in vain in the Barrett Law for this stern 

promise that no matter what happens, we will eventually 

collect the same amount from everybody.  What there is, 

is there is a requirement for equal assessment in the 

first instance -- nobody says that was violated -- and 

then, if you elect four installments, there's a 

provision that says you shall collect.

 The irony of their position is they say it's 

perfectly okay for the city to break that promise.  It's 

perfectly okay to give forgiveness.  They don't have a 

quorum -- a quarrel with forgiveness.  They want 

forgiveness.  They just want to get some refunds, too, 

as a result.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, they want forgiveness, 

but you outline correctly in your brief the fact that 

the city had three options.  One of the options was to 

hold everybody to what they understood when they signed 

up under the Barrett Law.

 And I -- I do not understand how your

administrative convenience argument fits in with the 

decision to forgive the debt of the people who agreed to 

pay on the installment plan.  When the city was 

collecting those payments was that a net loss?  Were the 

administrative costs of making those collections more 

than the amount of money that was brought in?

 If not, then I don't see how administrative 

convenience justifies a rejection of that option.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Alito, as I hear you, 

you've switched from rational basis to it has to be, you 

know, a net -- unless we can show a net loss, we lose. 

Why can't we make a rational judgment that there's a 

unique $200,000 cost associated with maintaining this 

program?  We don't want to maintain the program.  It's 

tremendously politically unpopular.  We've moved away 

from it.  We don't want to -- I mean, can you imagine

JUSTICE ALITO:  It's rational for a city to 

say that it costs us $100,000 to collect this money, and 

if we do collect it, we're going to bring in $500,000; 

so, we don't want to pay the $100,000; so, we're going 

to get rid of the program?  That's rational?

trying to take somebody's home by imposing and then 

trying to enforce a tax lien based on a program that 

they walked away from 27 years earlier?  They'd get

small group, a small interest group that is able to

 MR. CLEMENT:  Yes, that's the -- I -- I -­

that's the provision I already mentioned about 

appraisals.  That's talking about the costs -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It says "costs."

 MR. CLEMENT:  The costs of the project when 

they are doing the appraisal.  When they're coming up 

with the cost for how much it's going to cost to stick 

the pipes in the ground, they have a law that says it 

has to be divided equally among the lots.  That's an 

assessment.  There's a specific provision that you can 

challenge the assessment if you don't like it.  Once you 

don't challenge it, it's final.

 There's actually two provisions in the 

Barrett Law that you won't search in vain for that talk 

about the interest of finality, which is yet another 

reason that justifies the differential treatment here 

between people who have paid in full, their accounts are 

closed, and people who have ongoing outstanding 

balances.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where -- where do I

apportioned equally, they are not referring to the

project are funded by the -- the sewer hook-ups, and 

some people pay 400 and some people paY 10,000.

 MR. CLEMENT:  No, but it's the costs that 

are then reflected in the assessment on each lot.  And 

there's then a process for challenging that assessment 

on the assumption that the costs are allocated equally 

to each lot, and then when that's done, the finality 

provisions kick in.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that just -­

MR. CLEMENT:  And nobody says there was 

anything wrong.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That just underscores the 

promise of the State -- or the city that all owners will 

be treated equally.  That just underscores the point 

that that was the understanding and the commitment.

 MR. CLEMENT:  With respect, that's not. 

The original idea is, sure, you know, we're going to 

assess the costs of the project equally among everybody 

whose benefiting from the project.  And then we're going 

to have an assessment, and if the Barrett Law doesn't 

change, the assumption is everybody's going to pay the 

same amount.

I'm not here to tell you otherwise, but the 

point is the Barrett Law, like most laws, doesn't have a 

clause that plans for its own demise.  It doesn't say, 

well, you know, if -- if we get rid of this law, we 

either will or will not enforce the installments.

 And I think the question here is at a 

different point in time when they've made a different 

judgment -- we don't like the Barrett Law.  It's proven 

unpopular.  It's proven unwieldy.  It's not just 

popularity or political.  It's that, you know, they're 

facing lots of low-income subdivisions with septic 

tanks, and, you know, they're forcing the prospect of 

trying to get people to pay $10,000 to improve a -- the 

sewer on a house that's worth $50,000.  They realize 

that's a non-starter.  We've got to get out of this 

business.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You just said it's 

not popularity.  In page 1 of your brief, you say, "The 

Barrett Law method eventually proved to be politically 

unpopular."  Sounds like it's popularity to me.

 MR. CLEMENT:  It's not just popularity.  You 

know, every once in a while the people have a point. 

And it's not just that they don't like something; it's 

their right to not like it.  And they're very much right 

to not like a law that says you got a $50,000 house and

we're going to make you pay for a $10,000 sewer hook-up.

 They were right to get out of the business. 

Having done that, I don't understand why they're saddled 

with a provision of law that exists in the old law that 

they're trying to get away from.

 And just to be clear -- I mean, if you want 

to look at a case that I think shows you why the State 

law is not as equality über alles as they're presenting, 

take a look at an old Indiana case called Allendorf, 176 

N.E. 240.  That's a case where some people in the 

project challenged the -- the assessment, said, you 

know, that's unfair; it's too much.  Other people paid 

in full.

 The people who challenged it went to court. 

They eventually settled with the city for a reduced 

amount.  Then later on the people who had paid in full 

went into court and said we're entitled to pay no more 

than those guys.  You know what the Indiana appellate 

court said?  No dice.  That doesn't work.  You 

basically -- you either waived your right in express 

waiver or if you paid in full, it's -- you know, it's 

too late.  It's too late.

 So, the -- and this is, with respect, I 

think part of the problem with the Allegheny Pittsburgh, 

and particularly this extension of it.  You're putting

so much weight on the State law, and it gets you in this 

business of flyspecking the Barrett Law.

 I mean, you know, this -- I mean, Justice 

Thomas made this point very well in the Nordlinger case, 

that there's an anomaly here, which is you're looking -­

supposed to be looking at Federal law, and the violation 

seems to be tied to potentially a violation of State 

law.

 If I could focus on that for a minute, 

because this is another really important difference 

between Allegheny Pittsburgh and this case, which speaks 

right to the remedy.  In Allegheny Pittsburgh, it's a 

facially neutral statute.  And so, it would be an 

anomaly there to say that when there's a facially 

neutral statute, you're going to invalidate the -- the 

statute.  The statute's fine.  The problem is you've 

been assessed at 100 percent; everybody else has been 

assessed at 50 percent.  The Court in that unique 

context says, you know, there's no obligation to go and 

sort of mandamus the assessor, to bring everybody else 

up.  You get to sort of go back to that level.

 This is very different.  The challenge here, 

like in Nordlinger, is a challenge to a distinction 

drawn in a law.  Resolution 101, unlike the law in 

Allegheny Pittsburgh, is not facially neutral.  It draws

a distinction.  So, the relevant question is the 

rationality of that distinction.  Is it rational?

 We submit there are multiple reasons why it 

is rational.  But if you disagree with me, the obvious 

remedy is to strike down the statute or at least remand 

to the State court with express instructions that they 

have the option, which is exactly what happened in the 

sex discrimination cases.

 And, Justice Scalia, if you're worried about 

incentives and standing, look at Heckler v. Mathews, 

another sex discrimination case.  This exact issue came 

up.  And what the Court said is standing is based on 

your right to guaranteed equal treatment.  Whether or 

not it's a pocketbook injury, you have standing if 

you're denied equal treatment.

 Now, these guys may have been denied equal 

treatment on the assumption they're right.  But they can 

get equal treatment restored just as easily by 

Resolution 101 being invalidated in full as they can by 

getting an additional windfall by getting a refund.  And 

as Justice Alito -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, why is that -- why 

is that a big deal for us?  I mean, that's the law.  You 

get your -- your choice.

big difference because that's different from what 

they're saying.  They're saying there's no remedial 

option.  They're saying we are stuck now.  We -- we have 

to give refunds.  That's the only permissible 

constitutional remedy.  And, obviously, the city would 

prefer to get out of the Barrett Law business and to 

provide these forgiveness, but it would certainly be a 

lot better for the city if they would at least -- this 

Court made clear, they have the option of leveling up or 

leveling down.  I do think, though, that gets to Justice 

Kagan's -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that -- if I 

could -- you mentioned Heckler v. Mathews.  In Heckler 

v. Mathews, the Court said, quote:  "Ordinarily, 

extension" -- of the withheld benefit -- "rather than 

nullification is the proper course."

 MR. CLEMENT:  Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, while it is true 

that you can cure a violation by leveling up or leveling 

down, ordinarily, extension of the benefit is the proper 

course.  And that's for the reason Justice Scalia gave, 

because, otherwise, there would be no equal protection 

case brought.

 MR. CLEMENT:  If that were the rule, Heckler 

v. Mathews would have come out the other way.  The Court

Official 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what -- what 

did the Court mean when they said, ordinarily, extension 

is the proper course?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, they were talking about 

a specific situation (a) under Federal law.  So, I don't 

know why the rule would be the same.  And the sex 

discrimination cases are much more on point for purposes 

of this.  But they're also talking about a very specific 

context where you have a limitation on a benefit.  And 

the idea is, if you strike down the limitation, the 

default option is everybody gets the benefit.

 This is different.  I mean, you know, really 

what Heckler is talking about is severability concerns. 

There's no severability that works here.  Resolution 

101 -- if you look at it, it doesn't say anything about 

refunds.  It simply says we're going to forgive the 

balances on the outstanding accounts.

 If that's somehow impermissible, then the 

law goes.  There's nothing to sever.  There's nothing -­

there's not one word in the statute about refunds.  And 

that's different from the context where you have a 

general extension of benefits and you have some 

limitations on the benefits.

really want to give refunds or cut off -- we want to 

stop collecting the money, period?  Then to make it fair 

on this hypothesis, the city would have to go back and 

refund money.  To whom?  And how many?

 MR. CLEMENT:  And -- and in what amount?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And you heard your -- your 

friend try to make a distinction between this project, 

and you wouldn't have to give the money, he said, to 

every other person, whoever back in 1850 or 1890 or 

whenever it was began to make Barrett Law payments.  But 

you would with this one.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Surely, the city has 

records.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Let me try to get my 

question, which is, I'm not -- I'm thinking this is 

project 1.  So, certainly, on the hypothesis, you have 

to pay back the people who already paid up for project 

1.  But in your brief, you say there's project 2 through 

20.  And is there, in your opinion, a basis for 

distinguishing all those people who have paid up in 

those projects, or would you have to give them their 

money back, too?

 Now, you heard your friend's statement -­

explanation of why you wouldn't have to give them the 

money back, and I want to get your response to that.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, with respect, what I 

heard him say is we probably would.  And I think we 

certainly would as to most of the projects.  There might 

be a couple of the projects where the differences are so 

small that he would say there's no gross inequality 

there.  But as to most of the other projects, there are

Official 

JUSTICE BREYER:  How many people does that 

involve, about?

 MR. CLEMENT:  It involves -- you know, I 

don't -- I know the number of projects.  It's like 20 

projects.  So, I'm guessing it's at least 1,000 people. 

And then, of course, somebody's going to come in if we 

do that, as you suggested, and say wait a second -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Was his figure of 

2 million accurate?  As the stake -- in the other case.

 MR. CLEMENT:  The stakes in the other case 

without interest I think are $2.7 million.  So, you 

know, I think the -- the ballpark figures are right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When you say "the 

other case," you mean every other project?  Because 

that's -- that's, what, a class action; right?

 MR. CLEMENT:  It's -- it's a class action, 

the Cox -- the Federal litigation.  But still, that's 

not a -- that's not an insubstantial amount.

 Of course, the relevant question is not, you 

know, are the damages a set figure after you've had 

litigation in Federal court?  The question is what is 

the city administrator, at the time he's trying to 

decide whether he has a refund obligation, to do?

about gross inequality?  What, are they supposed to run

there's not a discrete obligation?  I don't know how --

I would not know how to advise them as to which of the 

other 21 projects they owed a refund to and which they 

didn't.  I would be at a complete loss.

 And the reason -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if 

everybody -- if everybody entitled to a refund came 

forward, it would cost you $2.7 million.  And it -­

MR. CLEMENT:  No, actually it would -- plus 

this one.  So, it would be a little over 3.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Three -­

$3 million.  And you say the real problem is the huge 

administrative cost in trying to figure out who you owe 

it to.  If it's that huge, all they do is somebody who 

comes forward, asks for a refund, verify that they're -­

and the law that you develop here is not going to be 

limited to this case; it's going to apply in other 

contexts as well.  Heaven knows where it stops.  As I 

said, Allegheny Pittsburgh -- it was at least limited to 

a particular context.  Now, I mean, I don't know why any 

city ever -- I mean, maybe this is the limiting 

principle that no city ever again will provide amnesty 

or forgiveness under any circumstances.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Amnesty -- I don't 

get -- amnesty is entirely different.  Amnesty is for 

people who did something wrong.  Nobody did something 

wrong here; it wasn't wrong to pay with installments.

 MR. CLEMENT:  But, Mr. Chief Justice,

we're going to getting out of the parking ticket 

enforcement business, and we're going to forgive 

everybody their parking tickets.

constitutional right to get my money back.  And that's 

the difference -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What do you do with the 

hypothetical about the income tax and the sales tax? 

So, you don't pay any income tax if the sales tax had 

gone into effect.

 MR. CLEMENT:  I think if they really got rid 

of the -- the Federal tax forever, I don't think there 

would be an equal protection violation.  I think there 

might be a different constitutional violation.  If you 

listen to him, the first thing he ticked off about why 

that would be so horrible is there was no notice.  Well, 

that sounds like a due process concern to me, not an 

equal protection concern.

 And that's really what's happening here. 

When they transport Allegheny Pittsburgh from the 

context it arose in to this very different context, 

they're converting it from an equal protection case to 

something more like a contract clause case or to a 

Winstar case or something like that.  And not one word 

in that opinion suggests that once a State adopts a 

certain policy, that it's trapped.  It can't make a 

reasonable and rational transition away from that policy 

to a policy that better serves the citizenry.

groups that either justifies or could on -- on a remand 

justify the different treatment?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think the one -- I 

don't think there's a demographic difference.  I think 

the one concrete difference that really is a difference 

is, from the city's perspective, they're looking at two 

groups, all of whom are going to have to pay a new 

higher monthly fee.

 And I think they can make a rational 

decision that says, look, you know, one of these groups 

has to make two monthly payments to the city for sewer 

and water.  That seems a little crazy.  So, why are 

we -- what we'll do is we'll just make everybody in the 

city in terms of their ongoing payments to the city for 

sewer and water -- we will treat them all exactly the 

same.  One fee.

pick up right there.  What they're actually saying on 

these two monthly payments idea is that it's rational 

for somebody who's just paid $300, and now everybody 

pays an extra $10 a month -- we don't want them to have 

to make their $30 a month Barrett Law payment having 

paid $300 and the extra 10.

 My clients still have to pay the extra $10 a 

month, but we're out of pocket $9,300.  I think that is 

-- I think that's patently irrational, to say that we're 

trying to help people who are out 300 bucks from having 

to pay an extra $30 a month going forward.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Stancil, here's what 

worries me about this case:  To me, this is a case about 

transition rules.  All legislation creates classes of 

citizens, and some are -- and -- and puts them all in a 

group and says you're going to be treated in the same 

way as long as this legislation exists.  And then a 

legislature comes along and changes that piece of 

legislation, and different people are affected 

differently by it.

 And to me what you are suggesting is that 

when that break is made and when that transition occurs, 

the -- I don't know how you would apply the rule that 

you're suggesting, which is that everybody in the former 

class has to be treated the same as a matter of

transition policy.

Official 

 MR. STANCIL:  If you've promised equal 

treatment -- and we're talking about a -- this is a -- a 

specific case.  A specific commonly shared benefit among 

people who are indistinguishable on any rational basis. 

They live next door to each other; they flush into the 

same pipe; and they paid and were promised equal 

payment.  In that instance, you -- then there has to be 

a rational method.  You have to treat them equally when 

you transition.

 So, there may be times where the city has 

promised and committed, and there is no independent 

rational basis for distinguishing.

 It's not that -- if we want to go forward 

and we want to tax blondes instead of brunettes, well, 

the fact that we're going to start doing that 

prospectively doesn't make that okay.  And, moreover, 

this isn't prospective.  We're talking about an 

assessment historically imposed on the very same day for 

the very same.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But time is usually a 

rational reason for doing it.  If -- suppose everybody 

paid on the installment plan.  The city could say as of 

a certain date we're -- no more installment payments. 

And the people who paid up previously, would -- would

they be -- would they have an equal protection claim?

 MR. STANCIL:  If we -- I'm sorry.  I 

thought -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose that there had never 

been the option of making the lump-sum payment. 

Everybody paid on installment plans over a 10-year 

period, and then the city decided January 1, 2012, no 

more installment plans; everything that's still due is 

forgiven.  That would be rational, wouldn't it?

 MR. STANCIL:  Right.  Because we'd all be 

treated equally.

 Could I quickly get to the administrative 

nightmare?  In -- if you go to the Cox litigation and go 

on Pacer and you pull up document number 98, you'll find 

the city's filing in the Cox case, in which they give 

the name and address and amount of -- owed to every 

taxpayer under any of these 20 other Barrett Law 

projects.  This is -- I think it's -- I think it's 

ludicrous to say there's some Gordian knot that would 

have to be cut to issue refunds.

 But, more generally, I think this is part of 

the city's argument.  They say, well, perfection may be 

difficult to achieve.  Well, so be it.  It always is; 

but that does not justify gross disparities and 

"anything goes."  You may want to make a clean break and

way that treats the same people the same.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  The argument isn't that 

it's expensive to administer as much as it is there are 

1,000 people in all these projects who are already paid 

up.  We don't have enough money to pay them all back. 

That's why we don't want to pay them back.  At the same 

time, we don't want to collect the money for 30 years 

from these other people who aren't fully paid yet.

 MR. STANCIL:  No, Your Honor.  Simply 

sending in your tax bill -- again, if you sent in your

think that's rational.
