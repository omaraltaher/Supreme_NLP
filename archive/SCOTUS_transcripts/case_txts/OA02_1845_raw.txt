 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We will hear argument next in

4  HealthCare versus Calad.

 Mr. Estrada.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR. ESTRADA:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


9  please the Court:


10

 The issue in these consolidated cases is whether


11  participants and beneficiaries of ERISA plans may seek


12  consequential and punitive damages in state court under state


13  tort law for the allegedly wrongful denial of ERISA health care


14  benefits.  The Fifth Circuit answered that question yes,


15  reasoning that completely -- that the complete preemption under


16  the Federal statute applies to contract claims that essentially


17  duplicate what's available under Section 502 of the Federal


18  statute, but not to tort claims, which give supplemental remedy


19  for consequential and punitive damages.


20

 For two principal reasons, the judgment of the Fifth


21  Circuit should be reversed.  First, this Court has consistently


22  held that all challenges to the propriety of benefit


23  determination, whether couched in tort or in contract, are


24  completely preempted by Section 502 and therefore are removable


25  and governed solely by Federal law. 


4

1

 Second, the fact that the welfare plans at issue in 

2  these cases provide benefits for medical care, as opposed to 

3  disability, death, or some other welfare benefit, does not alter 

4  the analysis under the Federal statute or give the states any 

5  more power to supplement the remedies that Congress included in 

6  Section 502. 

7

 QUESTION:  Now just to be clear, Mr. Estrada, you take 

8  the position that ERISA Section 502(a) completely preempts the 

9  Texas scheme here? 

10

11

 MR. ESTRADA:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  And we don't have before us any conflict 

12  preemption under Section 514? 

13

 MR. ESTRADA:  That is - that is right, Justice 

14  O'Connor.  That is our position. 

15

16

17 

--

 QUESTION:  Okay. 

 MR. ESTRADA:  And turning to Section 502(a) and to the 

18

 QUESTION:  Mr. Estrada, can I just raise a question? 

19  I'm sure you'll cover it in the argument and I want to get it on 

20  the table.  On your first point, that our prior cases have said 

21  that 502 is the exclusive remedy for actions to acquire benefits, 

22  is there a distinction?  Some of your opponents argued between 

23  denials based on the terms of the plan, that this just doesn't 

24  qualify for some reason, on the one hand, that you just should 

25  get the answer out of the plan, and denials based on a 

5


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  discretionary decision as to whether the medical treatment was


2  appropriate or not, which would require the exercise of some kind


3  of professional judgment.  The nurse might think he doesn't need


4  an extra day in the hospital or something like that.  Is that a


5  valid distinction or not?


6

 MR. ESTRADA:  No.  And let me turn to that -- that was


7  my second point, but I'll turn to it now.  The use of medical


8  criteria, whether discretionary or not, is inherent in health


9  care coverage and usually is also inherent in - - in disability


10  coverage.  Yet, last Term, in the Black & Decker case, this Court


11  held that the -- that a claimant's treating doctor gets no


12  special deference in a claim for the benefits where the issue is


13  whether the medical factors warrant a disability finding.  Under


14  the theory being advanced by Texas and the respondents in this


15  case, however, Black & Decker needn't, and maybe even couldn't,


16  be an ERISA case because a state of the union could regulate the


17  medical component of the disability finding under the guise of


18  regulating the practice of medicine and could give tort remedies


19  and consequential and punitive damages whenever the plan


20  disagreed with the -- with the claimant's doctor.


21

 QUESTION:  Yes, of course they could, but the fact that


22  if we held there was no preemption, it wouldn't necessarily mean


23  they would win on the merits.  I mean, you are -- your drug


24  formulary may be absolutely defensible, even though it could be


25  tested in a state court proceeding.


6


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 MR. ESTRADA:  Well, I didn't understand the claim as to


2  the Aetna case necessarily to be a challenge to the promulgation


3  of the formulary, which is expressly authorized by the


4  prescription drug writer of the plan.  I understood the challenge


5  to be to a particular benefits decision that was made when Aetna,


6  as the insurer and plan administrator, concluded that the benefit


7  was not covered in the circumstances because of the step therapy


8  requirement.


9

 QUESTION:  I don't want you to go too long on point two


10  without getting back to point one, but as long as we're here, it


11  does seem to me that the dichotomy, the duality you propose


12  between a decision about benefits and medical treatment might, at


13  the edges, blur into each other.  If I say, as Aetna or CIGNA,


14  you're not authorized to seek this treatment and the person has


15  no other funds, basically, that is a treatment decision, in a


16  sense.


17

 MR. ESTRADA:  No, it is not, Justice Kennedy.  The


18  purpose of employee benefits plan -- benefit plans is to cover


19  some things for the employees.  If the plans in these cases said


20  that the benefit was $100 for each hospital stay or that you got


21  $20 for your drugs, whatever they may be, no one would deny that


22  that was a -- that that was a benefit determination.  As I said


23  earlier, with respect to medical care, it has always been the


24  case that in determining the scope of coverage, medical factors


25  have always been used and that factor is imbedded into the


7


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  background understandings of how this very statute works.


2

 For example, Section 503 of the statute allows the


3  Department of Labor to promulgate regulations to deal with how


4  claims are made and the like.  One of those regulations by -- by


5  the Department of Labor expressly contemplates that if a claimant


6  has a proposed treatment turned down, he may appeal to a named


7  fiduciary who is required, under the DOL regs, to consult with an


8  -- with an appropriate medical hair -- care professional and -­


9

 QUESTION:  I guess my point was, at some time, and even


10  in these cases, there -- that there was a component of what we


11  might call medical judgment involved.


12

 MR. ESTRADA:  That is undisputed, Justice Kennedy, and


13  I think that our position is that there is a fundamental


14  difference between a claimant who has a doctor patient


15  relationship with his doctor and a claimant who has an insuretal


16  coverage relation with his insurer.  Just to put it into context


17  of legal practice, if the person reading the plan documents and


18  denying a claim -- the claim, excuse me, uses medical training to


19  conclude that the plan documents did not cover a treatment, I


20  think few people would think that that entitled the claimant to


21  sue the person who turned it down for legal malpractice.


22

 And the same is basically true here, too, because the


23  plan's -- the plan's role, as is very clearly expressed, for


24  example, in the -- in the text of the Monitronics plan, is to


25  deal with the question, shall we pay or shall we not pay.  And


8


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  that's actually precisely what Texas has targeted here.


2

 If I could direct the Court's attention to the petition


3  appendix in the Aetna case, 02-1885, the relevant parts of the


4  Texas statute are set forth in page 59a and -­


5

6

 QUESTION:  59a of what?


 MR. ESTRADA:  Of the Aetna petition appendix, 02-1885,


7  Mr. Chief Justice.  And as -- and there are three that are


8  relevant here.  Two of them are on page 59 and one of them is on


9  page 58a.


10

 The first one that I want to point out is close to the


11  top of the page.  It is an affirmative defense under the Texas


12  statute that the managed care entity did not deny or delay


13  payment.  This is not about treatment.  It is a defense that it


14  did not deny or delay payment.  And of course delay may be a bid


15  for - of what a -- of what the role of the administrator is.


16

 The second aspect of the statute is that the statute


17  makes very clear, once again on page 59a, that the managed -­


18  that the liability -- oh.  This is subsection d, Mr. Chief


19  Justice, which is the next following -­


20

21

 QUESTION:  Oh.


 MR. ESTRADA:  -- you know, the one that I read.  And it


22  says the act creates no obligation on the part of the health


23  insurance carrier, moving down a little, to cover a -- to provide


24  a treatment which is not -- which is not covered by the health


25  care plan or entity.  Once again, this is targeting the coverage


9


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  aspect, not the treatment. 

2

 QUESTION:  Yes, but let me just focus on the case 

3  involving the woman who may have needed a second day in the 

4  hospital.  Is it correct that they -- an agent of the HMO had 

5  discretion to grant that second day if the nurse thought it was 

6  really medically required? 

7

 MR. ESTRADA:  I don't -- I don't know if there's 

8  anything in the record about that.  What is clear from the record 

9  and from Federal law, Justice Stevens, is that somebody in the 

10  plan would have discretion to hear her appeal, even if the nurse 

11  that -- that turned the request down -­

12

 QUESTION:  So the decision as to whether she would have 

13  the second day in the hospital would depend on a medical judgment 

14  made by an agent of the plan.  Is that correct? 

15

 MR. ESTRADA:  It would -- it would ultimately -- it 

16  would ultimately turn on -- on a coverage decision that may 

17  include medical criteria. 

18

 QUESTION:  But the coverage is if it's medically 

19  needed, it would -- she would get the second day.  But whether or 

20  not it's covered then turns on a medical judgment, does it not? 

21

 MR. ESTRADA:  But the question of medical necessity is 

22  a coverage term.  It is not a medical term, Justice Stevens, and 

23 

--

24

 QUESTION:  Yes, but is not correct, to make the 

25  coverage decision, one has to make a medical decision? 

10


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 MR. ESTRADA:  It -- one has to make -- one part of the


2  coverage decision is the medical decision.  In the Aetna case,


3  for example, the plan sets forth a definition of medical


4  necessity which -- which sets forth, I do point out, is that you


5  have to need it -- to need the care -­


6

 QUESTION:  Well, I was focusing on the CIGNA case,


7  because it seemed to me that it's a little clearer there that


8  there would be a medical judgment required.


9

 MR. ESTRADA:  Well, once again, Justice Stevens, we do


10  not contend that health insurance does not involve the


11  consideration of medical factors.  And, as I said, it is almost


12  inherent in the nature of the product that it would, just as I


13  never had car insurance before I actually owned a car.


14

 QUESTION:  But it's a little -- it's a little like -­


15  if you're telling doctors what's medically necessary under the


16  plan, it's in effect maybe defining the basic standards of


17  medical care, in a way.


18

 MR. ESTRADA:  That is not right, Justice O'Connor, for


19  the following reason.  The plan documents here, and the


20  background understanding of all of the parties, is that it is for


21  the treating doctor to chart the course of treatment for the


22  patient and, in fact, under the AMA's old code of ethics, which


23  we cite on page 6 of the Aetna reply brief, a physician is not


24  allowed to sway his judgment as to treatment by the existence or


25  non-existence of coverage.  In many cases, unfortunately, there


11


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  will be people who have no coverage or no insurance, or may be


2  under-insured.


3

 But just to bring back the case to what the statute is


4  about, this statue is about encouraging employers to make hard


5  choices to give coverage to employees to the extent they can. 


6  There is no requirement in Federal law that requires employers to


7  give -- there are very few requirements in Federal law that


8  require employers to give particular benefits if they choose to


9  have a plan.  And, as this Court has said, most recently in the


10  Rush case, this is about a bargain with employers that seeks to


11  encourage the formation of these plans and the provision of


12  benefits to the extent possible by assuring employers of limited


13  liabilities under predictable standards.


14

 QUESTION: If you are correct that Section 502(a)


15  preempts, is it possible that under ERISA 502(a)(3), that the


16  plaintiffs might recover some money, for example, for pain and


17  suffering or things like that?


18

 MR. ESTRADA:  I would think not, Justice O'Connor.  Our


19  amicus, the Department of Labor, may take a slightly different


20  view of that.  Our reading of the Mertens case and the Great West


21  case, which seemed very clearly, to us, at least, to stand for


22  the proposition that equitable is to be determined by reference


23  to a historical examination of all that is available in equity -­


24

 QUESTION:  Yes, but if you make an analogy to a trustee


25  in equity, I think this is a different case than Mertens or Great


12


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  West, because here, the Aetna and CIGNA are fiduciaries, are they


2  not?


3

 MR. ESTRADA:  Aetna is -- and CIGNA is for purposes of


4  claims processing.


5

 QUESTION:  Yes.  And so, as a fiduciary they're -- they


6  are analogous to a trustee, at least, the government said, if I


7  read their footnote 13 right, that back in the old days when


8  there were -- was a division of the bench, that one of the


9  remedies available against a trustee would be in the nature of


10  make whole relief that would put the beneficiary in the position


11  he would have been in if the trustee had not committed the breach


12  of trust.


13

 MR. ESTRADA:  That was the view to which I referred to


14  earlier, Justice Ginsberg, and it is possible that it may be


15  right.  It seems to me, based on Great West and Mertens, that it


16  would be a tough case to make, but it is not the issue in this


17  case.  Now -­


18

 QUESTION:  No, but the whole thing would work if we


19  could do that, wouldn't it?  I mean, if we could get Mertens


20  consistent with what Justice Ginsberg just read, then you would


21  provide people who are hurt, in the way these plaintiffs were


22  hurt, with a remedy.  It wouldn't be punitive damages, but they


23  would be made whole.  So, if you are right in that this is


24  basically a -- this is basically a claims decision and you


25  shouldn't give punitives and others for the incorrect making of a


13


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  claims decision.  But the hole in this is that then the woman


2  gets nothing or virtually nothing and, if we could reconsider


3  that part, it would all work, wouldn't it?


4

 MR. ESTRADA:  Well, it might, but it also works in the


5  way it currently is for the following reason.  The interaction of


6  the structure of Section 502 and Section 503 is intended to set


7  forth a mechanism, under the DOL regs under Section 503, to


8  encourage the expedis -- the expeditious resolution of claims


9  disagreements.  And this is -- the statute contemplates


10  litigation but is not about litigation.  This is all about giving


11  the benefit when it is needed and not about waiting until it no


12  longer helps you, having bypassed all avenues you had at the


13  time, external review, plan appeals, or maybe an action for an


14  injunction and then suing for relief, make whole or otherwise.


15

 If I could, Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to reserve


16  the remainder of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Very well, Mr. Estrada.


 Mr. Feldman, we'll hear from you.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A FELDMAN


 FOR UNITED STATES, AS


 AMICUS CURIAE


 QUESTION:  Mr. Feldman, will you tell us what the


23  government thinks can be recovered under 502(a)(3) in the way of


24  damages or other recoveries?


25

 MR. FELDMAN:  Yes.  As Justice Gin -- as Justice


14


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Ginsberg said, our position, I think, is in footnote 13 of our


2  brief, and it's a position the Department of Labor has taken in


3  cases and number -­


4

5

 QUESTION: Pretty big point to be in a footnote.


 MR. FELDMAN:  Well, it's -- it really isn't the issue


6  in this case because our position in this case is that the claims


7  are preempted by 502(a)(1)(B).  But, in a case where there was a


8  fiduciary involved, in the days of the divided bench, when a


9  beneficiary sued a fiduciary, they weren't -- they could -- were


10  able to get make whole relief.  And the -- by the same -­


11

 QUESTION:  Lest we be too sanguine about the


12  application of that law in this context, I don't know any


13  equitable cases that would consider make whole relief to be


14  giving -- where what is at issue is merely the payment -- the


15  failure to pay money, refusal to pay money.  Make whole relief


16  would give you what you would have done with that money if you


17  had gotten it.  That's very strange.


18

 MR. FELDMAN:  You get -- there were -- there are cases


19  that I -- I don't want to get too deeply into 502(a)(3)(B),


20  because I don't think it's what's at issue in this case.  But


21  there are cases in which, for example, a trustee doesn't buy an


22  insurance policy that they're supposed to buy and then the


23  beneficiary can get, as a relief, whatever the value of that


24  insurance policy would have been and -­


25

 QUESTION:  Sure.  But all that's going on here is that


15


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  the claimant was perfectly able to buy Vioxx with his own money,


2  but when it was said by the insurer that they wouldn't pay for


3  Vioxx, the claimant went and -- went with the drug that was


4  covered.  I have serious doubts whether we can take comfort in


5  the fact that even if we deny relief here it'll all be okay


6  because under traditional equity law, in a situation like that,


7  you can -- you can get whatever you would have done had you been


8  given the money.  I don't know that that principle washes.


9

 MR. FELDMAN:  Well, 502(a)(3) -- I mean, ERISA does set


10  up a beneficiary trustee -- a beneficiary fiduciary type of


11  relationship that does have analogies in traditional equity.  But


12  in any event -­


13

 QUESTION:  And the government has taken position -­


14  this is -- the footnote was not the easiest to read, but I take


15  it the Department of Labor has taken the position, in some ERISA


16  cases, that there would be just the kind of relief that Justice


17  Scalia mentioned.  Would this case fit that pattern?


18

 MR. FELDMAN:  I -- it's not clear to me whether it


19  would, because it's not clear to me whether there was a fiduciary


20  involved in this case.  Neither of the claimants in this case,


21  neither they -- the people who denied the benefits on behalf of


22  the plans may or may not have been fiduciaries.


23

 QUESTION:  But, as Mr. Estrada just told us that, for


24  these purposes, both Aetna and CIGNA would be fiduciaries.


25

 MR. FELDMAN:  They -- well, whether the -- you know, I


16


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  frankly haven't thought about whether the plan itself would be a


2  fiduciary.  Ordinarily, the way the ERISA scheme is supposed to


3  work is, if you have a denial of benefit, you have a right to


4  appeal to an appropriate named fiduciary, and at that stage,


5  departmental regulations give you kind of very substantial


6  procedural rights to make sure that benefits determination gets


7  made very quickly and appropriately, in light of the medical


8  exigencies of the case.


9

 QUESTION:  I would like to hear your arguments on the


10  preemption issue.


11

 MR. FELDMAN:  Thank you.  Our argument is that the


12  Texas law provides an additional remedy to that in Section


13  502(a)(1)(B), because respondents' right to recover compensatory


14  and punitive damages in this case depends on their showing that


15  they had a right to the benefits under the plan -- under the


16  terms of their plan.  The state law provides that plaintiffs must


17  prove that the plan's failure to exercise what the state law says


18  is due care, that their failure to exercise due care is the


19  proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury.  The only way that


20  that could be true is if the plan didn't pay benefits that it was


21  obligated to pay under the terms of the plan.  The plan -­


22

 QUESTION:  Yes, but in the situation in the hospital


23  case, there was no time to get relief.  How could they -- how


24  could they get relief from the denial of the extra day in the


25  hospital between midnight and the next morning?

 MR. FELDMAN:  Well, I -- in the first place, she was


2  told before -- I think the complaint says she was told before she


3  entered the hospital that she would have only one day in the


4  hospital.  But in addition -­


5

 QUESTION:  Unless it was medically necessary to stay an


6  extra day.


7

 MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  And I would just say there's


8  about three backstops there.  One is Department of Labor


9  regulations say you have to make determ -- these determinations


10  as soon as possible considering the medical exigencies of the


11  case and she didn't -­


12

 QUESTION:  And what does that mean in the hospital


13  setting?  And what -- was she going to file a complaint with the


14  Department of Labor?


15

 MR. FELDMAN:  These claims can be made orally, again,


16  if the exigencies require, and she could -- she didn't try -- as


17  far as we know, no one made a phone call to the insurer and said


18  can I get the extra benefits; she needs it.  We don't know what


19  the results of that would have been.


20

 QUESTION:  Well let's assume the case -- because your


21  preemption argument would cover even the most extreme case. 


22  Assume the case in which the patient and the doctor both called


23  the agency and appealed and they said we're too busy, we can't


24  handle it and it later determines they were -- did not exercise


25  due care.

2

 MR. FELDMAN:  But then -­


 QUESTION:  Why are you preempting the state providing a


3  remedy for that situation?


4

 MR. FELDMAN:  That would have been itself a denial of


5  their obligations under the Department's claim processing -­


6  claims processing procedures.  But let me say there's also -­


7

 QUESTION:  It would have been a denial, but it wouldn't


8  have given her the extra day in the hospital?


9

 MR. FELDMAN:  Right, but there are other backstops for


10  her getting the extra day in the hospital.  She is, at that


11  point, in the same position as anyone else who can't pay for


12  another day in the hospital but they need it.


13

14

 QUESTION:  I understand.


 MR. FELDMAN: It's up to her doctor, with whom she has a


15  doctor patient relationship that's a consensual relationship for


16  providing medical treatment.  It's up to her doctor to decide


17  when she should be discharged from the hospital and when she


18  shouldn't.


19

20

 QUESTION:  But she can't -­


 QUESTION:  But the question we really are facing is


21  whether the State of Texas is denied the authority to provide a


22  remedy in that situation.


23

 MR. FELDMAN:  Yeah, but the State of Texas has many


24  remedies to make sure the hospitals don't discharge people who


25  need an extra day in the hospital and medical ethics provides


19


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  additional reasons why doctors have -- cannot discharge patients


2  who need an extra day in the hospital.


3

 QUESTION: If you take the -- the drug case, the man


4  couldn't pay for the more expensive drugs.  He didn't have the


5  means and so he took the drug that the HMO approved with


6  disastrous results.  There was no -- window -- there was no time. 


7  He was in intense pain.  He had to take something to deal with


8  the pain.


9

 MR. FELDMAN:  There was -- he took the drug, I think


10  that -- the record actually shows, I think, that he took the drug


11  for several weeks before he had -- before he had the problem with


12  it.  He could have been pursuing the plan remedies all throughout


13  that.  In addition, Texas law, like the law of 44 other states,


14  provides for an independent review mechanism which is also


15  designed to decide at the front end whether -- what benefits


16  you're entitled to.  And under that mechanism he could have


17  sought independent review from somebody who's independent of the


18  plan, not subject to any bad incentives he might have thought the


19  plan might have, to make an accurate determination of what is -­


20  what he's entitled to and what he's not entitled to.


21

 It's -- there are -- there are a number of remedies


22  that people can -- that people have in order to make sure they


23  stay in the hospital.  What the ERISA plan is doing here is


24  simply making a benefits determination.  It's a pure


25  determination under ERISA and it's not based on the formation of


20


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  a doctor patient relationship which the patient has with their


2  doctor.  It's based on their determinations under ERISA, under


3  Section 502(a)(1)(A) -- Section 502 of ERISA, Congress drew a


4  very careful balance between the needs for a prompt and quick


5  claims processing procedure that will be effective and will


6  decide in advance whether you get benefits and the public


7  interest in encouraging the formation of employee benefits plans


8  and encouraging the provision of benefits under those plans.


9

 To allow states to essentially say, as the state has


10  said here, well, we're going to provide an additional remedy that


11  Congress rejected when it drew that careful balance, would be an


12  -- as the Court said in Pilot Life, to completely undermine


13  Congress's decisions about how this system should be structured. 


14  The state has ample authority to address medical malpractice in


15  the state in between -- between doctors and patients where that


16  doc -- consensual doctor patient relationship has been formed. 


17  What it doesn't have authority to do is to take its -- that


18  medical malpractice law and extend it, not to the normal doctor


19  patient situation, but to a situation that is governed by Federal


20  law under Section 502 and by the remedies that Congress chose


21  where appropriate.


22

 QUESTION:  Is there any indication in the record


23  whether these individuals did not have the funds to stay in the


24  hospital another day or to buy Vioxx?


25

 MR. FELDMAN:  There's -- I don't think there's any


21


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  indication of whether they did or not.  And, in fact, I don't -­


2  I think that under the co-payment of the Aetna plan, Vioxx


3  wouldn't have been terribly expensive because Aetna would have


4  picked up some of tab for that.  But all of those would be facts


5  relating what's in the plan.  I think they all just point out


6  that the question in this case is what the plan provided and did


7  the plaintiffs get what the plan provided.  And this Court


8  decided, in Pilot Life and in Metropolitan Life against Taylor,


9  and it reaffirmed two terms ago in the Rush Prudential case, that


10  those questions are ERISA questions and Congress decided that -­


11  set in place a set of remedies that allow for very substantial


12  rights to determine whether you're entitled to the benefit, but


13  limited your rights to sue for pun -- for compensatory and


14  especially punitive damages afterwards, because there's also, on


15  the other side of the balance, the need to encourage employers to


16  provide healthcare and to create ERISA plans.


17

 And, as I said, to allow states to interfere in that


18  balance and, as Texas has done here, to create a cause of action


19  which is essentially for the denial of a plan benefit, and that's


20  something that the plaintiffs, I think, have to prove in order to


21  prevail, is to directly interfere with that decision that


22  Congress made.


23

 QUESTION:  But is it not correct that those cases did


24  not involve treatment decisions, Pilot Life and Metropolitan?


25

 MR. FELDMAN:  Those cases involved disability

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Feldman. 

 MR. FELDMAN:  Thank you. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Mr. Young, we'll hear from 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE P. YOUNG 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 MR. YOUNG:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 

 I want to focus on the narrow Federal jurisdictional 

11  issue because this case -- these two cases come to the Court 

12  based on the Federal removal doctrine that goes under the rubric 

13  of complete preemption.  In each of this Court's cases on 

14  complete preemption, the plaintiff's cause of action, while not 

15  citing to the Federal statute, almost exactly duplicated the 

16  Federal remedy.  Here we don't have that. 

17

 Here, what Texas has done is to fill a vacuum and say 

18  we are going to set out a professional medical standard of care 

19  when HMOs make medical necessity decisions.  Under the HMO's 

20  position, they would be free to say we're going to use the 

21  medical necessity standard of a witch doctor or whatever we 

22  decide it is on today's basis without any reference to objective 

23  medical standards.  Now, their medical necessity statement 

24  doesn't say that, but under their argument today, they would be 

25  free to do that. 

23


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION:  What do you mean free to do it?  They would


2  be subject to -- to an appeal and an appeal to an independent


3  authority.


4

5

 MR. YOUNG:  Yes, Your Honor.  They -- yes, Justice.


 QUESTION:  And if they didn't pay up, they would be -­


6  would be liable to damages.


7

 MR. YOUNG:  If there is time for an appeal and if the


8  circumstances would permit an appeal.  An appeal is a great thing


9  in these cases.  Independent review is a great thing -­


10

 QUESTION:  No.  What I'm -- I'm just speaking to your


11  point of whether they're Scott free to do whatever they want. 


12  They surely aren't, you know.  Even if the appeal comes


13  afterwards, the claimant can get the money that's owed and the


14  relief provided by 502(a).


15

 MR. YOUNG:  But, Justice Scalia, in these two cases,


16  the patients did what the HMO wanted and when, under their


17  argument, if the patients do what the HMO wants and it turns out


18  those were bad medical decisions, there is no remedy.  ERISA -­


19

 QUESTIONS:  They don't do what the HMO -- all the HMO


20  said is, look, under the plan, as we understand it and as we


21  judge medical necessity, we don't have to pay for Vioxx.  Now, if


22  you want to have Vioxx, buy it yourself, and I gather there was


23  some co-payment that would have been given, and if their doctor


24  thought that Vioxx was really essential, surely the doctor would


25  have abided, you know, pony up the money.


24


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

2

 MR. YOUNG:  Well -­


 QUESTION:  But to say that the plan condemned them to


3  not using Vioxx is simply not true.  All you're talking about


4  here is money.  The claimant didn't want to lay out the


5  additional money for the Vioxx.


6

 MR. YOUNG:  Well, the truth is, Your Honor, that


7  neither of these claimants would have needed health insurance if


8  they had the independent means to just whip out a gold card and


9  pay for the drug.


10

 QUESTION:  See, that's why I'm thinking that Vioxx is


11  not that -- you know, on your argument you were just making, and


12  I'll only lead you into this red herring once.


13

14

 MR. YOUNG:  Okay.


 QUESTION:  But it would all work, you see, if I have a


15  trust, the trust is supposed to buy me an insurance policy, and


16  through total fault of the trust it doesn't, and the house burns


17  down, that equitable relief appropriate would be consequential


18  damages of the value of the house.  Now, if that were an


19  appropriate case, other equitable relief, this whole thing would


20  work and you wouldn't be having to fill a vacuum.


21

 MR. YOUNG:  But under this Court's opinions previously


22  under 502, that remedy and those kinds of relief are not


23  available.


24

 QUESTION: So you see then the logical point where I'm ­


25  - I'd like to say modify those perhaps, but, well, the very fact


25


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  that you're trying to fill this hole here proves the point,


2  because if there is a hole, it's because the court has


3  interpreted this statute perhaps wrongly as the Federal relief


4  being A, B, and C.  Maybe it should be A, B, C, and D, and so


5  what the state's trying to do here, is add D.  And the one thing


6  they can't do, is add D to A, B, and C.


7

 MR. YOUNG: It's true, Your Honor, that there is this


8  hole, but that is not the reason that we should prevail on this


9  narrow jurisdictional issue, because it's the source of the duty.


10  The duty that arises here is not based on what is in the plan


11  document on medical necessity.  It comes from the external duty


12  that is imposed by Texas statute to meet the professional medical


13  standard of care.


14

 QUESTION: Well, how different is the question of the


15  merits here, whether you should prevail and the question of


16  complete preemption which is raised in the removal issue?


17

 MR. YOUNG: Mr. Chief Justice they are different. 


18  Because, in this narrow issue, the complete preemption issue,


19  especially when one looks at Pilot Life and Taylor.  Those two


20  decisions relied very heavily on section 301 cases, the Labor


21  Management Relations Act cases. But if you look at those cases


22  since Pilot Life and Taylor, every time the duty arose from


23  something separate than the collective bargaining agreement,


24  every time this Court has said that there is no complete


25  preemption.


26


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION: So your view is you could prevail on the


2  propriety of removal, because there's not complete preemption,


3  and yet go back and lose on the issue of whether your claim is in


4  fact preempted?


5

 MR. YOUNG: Yes Your Honor, that is the way complete


6  versus conflict preemption can work and the way that the fifth


7  circuit said it could work.  Now I want to be clear, we don't


8  think that we lose on Section 515 preemption either.  And in fact


9  every time this Court has gone through an ERISA analysis and


10  found Section 502 preemption, every time, it first goes through


11  the Section 514 step.  Now that brings me to something that may


12  be sensitive in light of one of the opinions issued today.  But I


13  want to talk a little bit about the insurance savings clause


14  under Section 514, because it's very important.  This Court, in


15  Rush Prudential said, that when a state regulates medical


16  necessity, as Texas does here, that falls within the insurance


17  saving clause.  Clearly this statute falls within the insurance


18  saving clause, especially as applied in these two cases.


19

20

 QUESTION: Well that's contrary to Pilot Life, isn't it?


 MR. YOUNG: No, Your Honor, and for this reason.  While


21  Pilot Life has a statement in there, that --


22

23

 QUESTION:  A very definite statement.


 MR.  YOUNG:  that 502, might trump and probably


24  according to Pilot Life could trump the insurance saving clause,


25  the Court also found very clearly that the insurance saving


27


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  clause wasn't met in that case.  And this Court has never faced


2  what this Court, the majority in Rush Prudential called the


3  forced choice, between an insurance saving clause and Section


4  502.  And it's very important to look at the plain text of


5  Section 514.  Because Section 514 (b) the insurance saving


6  clause, says very clearly nothing in this sub-chapter can be


7  construed to preempt.


8

 QUESTION: The strangeness of your argument is that


9  you say all right, Pilot Life faced that issue, and says the


10  savings clause doesn't apply in the complete preemption


11  situation.  Your argument is that in effect by defining the -­


12  the benefit -- by Texas' act of trying to define the benefit


13  denial as equivalent to the practice of medicine, it therefore


14  gets us back into the insurance saving clause.  It seems to me an


15  irrational logical leap.  502 says we get out of the insurance


16  savings clause because of complete preemption, Texas says by


17  saying what you're really doing in denialing -- denying a


18  benefit, is practicing medicine.  We get back into the business


19  of insurance, and the insurance savings clause applies.  I just


20  can't follow that.


21

 MR. YOUNG: Your Honor, the confusion arises because we


22  don't write -- we don't write the terms of the HMO's coverage if


23  you will.  They're the ones that say, in determining what we will


24  pay for, if you will, we are going to make medical decisions.


25

 QUESTION: Well they're the ones that -­

 MR. YOUNG: They're the ones that can -­


 QUESTION: is there any insurer that does not at some


3  point incorporate some issue of medical judgement in it's


4  coverage? 


5

6

 MR. YOUNG: Yes.


 QUESTION: If it does not, then in effect it is giving


7  carte blanche to any medical decision by a doctor without right


8  of review. 


9

 MR. YOUNG: Yes, Your Honor, in fact, some HMO's in the


10  last two or three years have abolished this second guessing of


11  the physician, this medical necessity step.


12

 QUESTION: But let's -- but if suppose they don't, do


13  the agents of the insurers who make these determinations do they


14  have to be admitted to the practice of medicine in Texas?


15

 MR. YOUNG: Not in Texas, but they have to be medical


16  professionals according to the Texas statute.  And the Texas


17  statute says, when you make these deci -­

 QUESTION: What is a medical professional?


 MR. YOUNG: Well, in the case of a nurse, nursing


20  judgment.  In the case of a -­


21

22

 QUESTION: But they don't have to be doctors?


 MR. YOUNG: They do if they're making a medical decision


23  that a doctor would make.  Under Texas law they do, and they're


24  held to that standard.  And that's all we're doing here.  Is


25  we're holding them to that medical standard.

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  ERISA says nothing, Justice Scalia, about what standards the


2  HMO's or deciders have to meet.


3

 QUESTION: But you talk about the standard of care, but


4  they're not giving care.  They're giving out money. 


5

6

 MR. YOUNG: Your Honor.


 QUESTION: They're not giving care at all, the caregiver


7  was the individual's doctor who said stay in another day or take


8  Vioxx.  The care -- all this company was doing was looking at the


9  contract, do we owe any money. 


10

11

12

 MR. YOUNG: Justice Scalia -­


 QUESTION: That's not giving care.


 MR. YOUNG: Justice Scalia I think it would be very


13  helpful to look at when a payment decision could be made and when


14  it is made in these cases.  You start an episode of care here,


15  you finish it.  The bill comes due to make the payment.  Here the


16  HMOs don't wait until the bill comes due to make the payment


17  decision.  They make the decision as part of a medical necessity


18  determination, in here, earlier in the middle, concurrent review,


19  or prospective review is the technical term.

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION: It's both.  It's both and the trouble with it


2  is, if you -- you could have marvelous laws in Texas governing


3  pension trustee behavior, governing all trustee behavior.  But


4  Congress says well you can't apply your marvelous rules to ERISA


5  plan trustees.  And now it seems to have said, and you can't


6  apply your marvelous medical rules, even to a doctor, where what


7  the doctor is doing in that instance is not acting as a doctor


8  for treating the patient, but rather acting as a determiner of


9  whether he will get the ERISA plan payment.  And what we have in


10  your case I guess is a person who does both.  He does something


11  of both.  But where they are inextricably mixed and where there


12  is a very large share of making the benefit determination, is it


13  fair to say that Congress would have wanted the Texas law to


14  apply?


15

 MR. YOUNG: Yes, because of Pegram, this court in Pegram


16  said very clearly -­


17

 QUESTION: In Pegram you were dealing with the doctor


18  who was the treating physician, that is precisely what Justice


19  Bryer has just defined as not being the case here.

21  majority said there's no basis to distinguish an HMO where the


22  decision's made -­

24  physician, we're not dealing with a treating physician here.

 MR. YOUNG: But here Your Honor, you're dealing with a

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  medical judgment that's not made at the end when the bill comes


2  due, it's made early on with the sole purpose of influencing the


3  medical treatment, the course of treatment.  If this were only


4  about payment -­


5

 QUESTION: Why do you say that?  I don't think AETNA


6  cares whether this individual took Vioxx, or whether this patient


7  stayed in the hospital for another day.  I don't think AETNA


8  cared a bit.  All AETNA cared about was whether it had to pay for


9  it.  That's all.


10

 MR. YOUNG: Justice Scalia, if that were true then they


11  would make these decisions at the end.  Because by shifting -­


12

 QUESTION: It's important to the patient to know. 


13  Because the patient when -- when the patient finds out that if


14  you take Vioxx, you'll have to pay for it yourself, the patient


15  can then ask the doctor, look doc, is it really important that I


16  take Vioxx or is this other stuff in your judgment as the


17  treating physician, is this other stuff good or not -- good


18  enough.  It seems to me you want that decision to be made early. 


19

 MR. YOUNG: Well, the truth is that making the decision here


20  shifts the risk.  If it's made at the back end the risk is


21  shifted to the pharmacy, or the doctor, or the hospital.  When


22  it's made here, it puts the risk squarely on the patient. 


23

 QUESTION: Well except that you say when it's made here


24  it is the choice of the doctor, the pharmacy or the hospital to


25  seek that judgment early, isn't it.  In other words in the -- the


32


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  doctor could have gone ahead and prescribed Vioxx, and sent the


2  bill in.  The doctor could have kept the patient in the hospital


3  another day, and sent the bill in.  The insurance plan didn't


4  force an early decision.  It gave an option of an early decision,


5  so they would know where they stood.

 MR. YOUNG: According to the documentation the HMO has,


7  Your Honor, the two HMOs require that those decisions be sought

 MR. YOUNG: It's not just that they could deny it, they


12  -- there could be consequences to the provider. They could be


13  deselected from the network, they could be told you're not going


14  to get to see anymore of our patients. 


15

16

 QUESTION: So, they do force it.  My premise was wrong.


 MR. YOUNG: They do force it, Your Honor.  And that's


17  the reality.


18

 QUESTION: Well, I really thought the train left the


19  station in Pilot Life.  I guess you don't agree with Pilot Life.


20

 MR. YOUNG: Well no, Your Honor, we are not here to


21  disagree with Pilot Life.  Pilot Life works in the narrow


22  circumstances in which it's been applied.


23

 QUESTION: Well I thought that this was that


24  circumstance of benefits.


25

 MR. YOUNG: I was afraid you might.  I was really afraid


33


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  you might.


2

3

 QUESTION: Yes.


 MR. YOUNG: Then could we talk about Taylor a little


4  more, because that's really the complete branch -­


5

6

 (Laughing)


 MR. YOUNG: I guess I come back to the Chief Justice's


7  point which is we could have a situation where Pilot Life


8  preemption could occur, but the Taylor holding is the one we're


9  most concerned about, and here we are not trying to duplicate a


10  claim that would be made under ERISA, under an ERISA duty. 


11

 And that leads me back to something else that's come


12  up.  The ERISA and it's regulations say nothing about setting a


13  medical standard of care, when these medical judgments are made. 


14  That's an indication that it was left to the states, and should


15  be left to the states.  But this Court could certainly indicate,


16  well this may still be preempted, but it shouldn't be removed to


17  Federal court, under complete preemption doctrines. 


18

 QUESTION: Well how would that advance the general law


19  at all?  I mean, if the merits are decided against you, you know,


20  I don't think we took this case to decide some question of


21  removal jurisdiction, but I -- perhaps my colleagues don't agree


22  with me.


23

 MR. YOUNG: Well, that is the very narrow issue that in fact


24  certiorari was granted on.  And it is an issue that this Court


25  last ruled on in the Anderson case last Term, and that case is


34


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  illustrative of why complete preemption shouldn't apply here. 


2  There the majority found that the claim, while not citing to


3  Federal usury law duplicated precisely and exactly Federal usury


4  law.  And it was in essence, a Federal usury claim.  Here our


5  claim is not one for benefits.  It couldn't be, there's no claim


6  for benefits to be made.  But more importantly we are not relying


7  on a term -­


8

 QUESTION: It's a claim that depends on a denial of


9  benefits, and isn't that the touchstone under Pilot?


10

 MR. YOUNG: In fact Your Honor, you could have a situation


11  where the medical necessity decision is made prospectively or


12  concurrently and that's not a payment denial, in fact that's what


13  we have in most circumstances of these kinds of cases.


14

 QUESTION: But it is the predicate for a payment denial,


15  or a payment granted.


16

 MR. YOUNG: Really Your Honor, in truth these decisions are


17  never expressed by the utilization nurse at the hospital as a


18  payment issue.  She says you've got to go home now.


19

 QUESTION: Well let's go back to my question -- I didn't


20  mean to go off on a tangent.  My question was, doesn't Pilot


21  Life, turn on a determination which governs the payment or non


22  payment of benefits?


23

24

 MR. YOUNG: Yes, Your Honor.  Here -­


 QUESTION: Then this it seems to me is such a


25  determination.


35


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 MR. YOUNG: Well, but here Your Honor, you could have a


2  payment determination that complied completely with their


3  internal document -- documents.  Their definition of medical


4  necessity, what they say they will and won't do.  And still


5  violate the Texas standard for medical judgments and that's the


6  problem. 


7

8

9

10

 QUESTION: It is indeed.  That's why it's preempted.


 MR. YOUNG: Well -­


 QUESTION: You've described it very clearly. 


 MR. YOUNG: Well -- Your Honor, except we're confusing


11  remedies, and duties.  The Texas duty is found no where in ERISA.


12

 QUESTION: May I ask this question.  Could you ever


13  recover under the Texas statute without proving that you were


14  entitled to have the benefit paid?


15

16

 MR. YOUNG: It would not -­


 QUESTION: It wouldn't be phrased in those terms. 


17  Wouldn't it be part of -- wouldn't it be a necessary element of


18  your claim, that part of what you're -- that you did have an


19  entitlement to have that benefit paid. 


20

 MR. YOUNG: It would be an undisputed fact.  It would be


21  for example in these two cases.  It's undisputed that Ruby Calad


22  could get unlimited days in the hospital.  The only issue is the


23  medical judgment that she had to go home.  Same with Mr. Davila. 


24  The medical judgment was that he would not get the Vioxx; he


25  would get the cheaper generic drug.  And -­

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION: But for you to prevail in Texas, it seems to 

2  me you have to be able to prove that they had a duty to pay for ­

3  - to provide him with the payment for Vioxx. 

4

 QUESTION:  But the statute says this, it says that it 

5  shall be a defense to any action that one -- neither the health 

6  insurance carrier is -- didn't control the health care treatment 

7  decision.  Which it wasn't here.  And two, the health care 

8  insurance carrier did not deny or delay payment for any treatment 

9  prescribed, or recommended by a provider. 

10

11

 MR. YOUNG: But that doesn't -- that's -­

 QUESTION: So it is clearly a condition of recovery that 

12  you show that they were in violation of the ERISA plan. 

13

 MR. YOUNG: It's an affirmative defense they may be able 

14  to come in with.  It's not a prerequisite to my case.  CIGNA 

15  admits it is free. 

16

 QUESTION: Oh I see.  Well that's a matter of who has to 

17  prove it.  I mean if -­

18

 MR. YOUNG: But that's very important especially Your 

19  Honor when we're talking about a complete preemption issue.  Is 

20  the Federal statute a prerequisite to my claim?  All I have to 

21  prove and show Your Honor, is a medical judgment was exercised by 

22  a nurse, at CIGNA, or a physician or medical director at AETNA, 

23  and that they violated the Texas standard for those kinds of 

24  decisions. 

25

 QUESTION: So long as you frame it as an affirmative

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  defense, rather as part of the cause of action, you can avoid


2  preemption? 


3

 MR. YOUNG: No I'm not saying that Your Honor, but the


4  gravamen of my case for purposes of looking at complete


5  preemption, the issue you were concerned about in Anderson, is


6  what are the elements of my claim.  They do not duplicate an


7  ERISA claim, they don't even duplicate an ERISA duty.  Now it may


8  be at the end of the day Section 514 kicks in.  We don't think it


9  does for a lot of reasons, most importantly the insurance saving


10  clause.  Which clearly the Texas -­


11

 QUESTION: Which -- This is one item I meant to ask. On


12  the other side they said that you never made any noises about the


13  savings clause in the Fifth Circuit, that it entered the case


14  just at this level, Is that so?


15

 MR. YOUNG: No Your Honor, that's not correct.  While it


16  was not a feature argument with a heading in our briefing, we


17  clearly pointed out to the Fifth Circuit the Moran decision by


18  the Ninth Circuit, and that the Moran decision relied on the


19  insurance saving clause.  Then after oral argument -­


20

 QUESTION: That's in your brief before the Fifth


21  Circuit?


22

 MR. YOUNG: Yes it's a footnote in our brief. And then


23  Your Honor, in -- after this Court decided Rush Prudential which


24  occurred after oral argument in the Fifth Circuit, both sides


25  submitted extensive letter briefs.  And those are documents, 18

 CHIEF JUSTICE: Thank you, Mr. Young. 


 Mr. Mattax we'll hear from you.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. MATTAX


 FOR TEXAS, ET AL., AS AMICI CURIAE


 MR. MATTAX: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the


10  Court.  The Texas legislature has imposed a duty of ordinary care


11  on managed care entities that insert themselves into health care


12  treatment decisions by exercising medical judgment to decide


13  medical necessity.  It is important to recognize at the outset as


14  this court recognized the managed care entity is not the ERISA


15  plan. 


16

 Our statute does not impose liability on the ERISA


17  plan.  Our statute does not impose liability on an employer.  As


18  Mr. Estrada said in his argument, the whole point of the complete


19  preemption and the exclusive remedies provision Section 502(a),


20  is insuring employers that will have limited liabilities.  Our


21  statute explicitly excludes employers from liability.  And


22  therefore the concerns of Section 502(a) are not at play in the


23  Texas statute.  The reason the Texas statute was passed was


24  because managed care entities, HMOs and other varieties and


25  forms, had decided to exercise medical judgment.  And it is that


39


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  duty that the state is regulating.  Which is what I think


2  distinguishes this case from Pilot Life.  Going back and looking


3  -­


4

 QUESTION: How does it distinguish it from Pilot Life? I


5  mean Pilot Life is talking about the insurance part, wasn't it. 


6

7

 MR. MATTAX: Yes, Your Honor.


 QUESTION: And then they said that even though


8  apparently on it's face had to do with insurance and you'd think


9  it would have been taken out, it wasn't taken out because of the


10  fact that it interfered with the basic purposes of the act. 


11

 MR. MATTAX: Pilot Life was based on the Court's


12  complete preemption decision in Allis-Chalmers versus Lueck.


13

14

 QUESTION: Uh-huh. 


 MR. MATTAX: And in that case the Court recognized that the


15  tort claim that was being alleged was derived from the general


16  proposition to perform contracts in good faith.  And the duty


17  that the Court was looking at in Allis-Chalmers, and also Pilot


18  Life, was the duty to enforce the contract that was the ERISA


19  plan therefore implicating complete preemption.  However the


20  Court explicitly said in Allis-Chalmers, that Congress did not


21  intend to give substantive provisions the force of Federal law,


22  ousting any inconsistent state regulations, because such a rule


23  would allow labor unions, and unionized employees the power to


24  exempt themselves from whatever state labor standards they


25  disfavored.  And again the Texas statute is not imposing any duty


40


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  on the plan.


2

 QUESTION: Yes, but is it not true that in order to


3  recover under the Texas statute, not only do you have to prove a


4  violation of the duty to use the due care and so forth.  But you


5  also have to prove a violation of the plan?


6

 MR. MATTAX: No I disagree.  The revision in the act is


7  setup such that if a managed care entity were to come in and say


8  well I did not exercise any medical judgment, or I did not make


9  any decisions that affected the treatment, they could come in as


10  a defense and say, the reason I did not make any medical judgment


11  was because the plan didn't allow me to.  The plan simply


12  excluded that completely in a pure eligibility decision in the


13  court's words in Pegram.  So the cause of action that's alleged


14  in the state statute is that particular managed care entity,


15  exercised medical judgment.  And that medical judgment resulted


16  in an injury to me, and I think -­


17

 QUESTION: But it's also a defense that I did not fail


18  to make any delay, I did not delay or fail to make any payment


19  due. 


20

21

22

 MR. MATTAX: And if -­


 QUESTION: Isn't that a defense?


 MR. MATTAX: The statute provides that as a defense. 


23  Again to make a reflection of, to show that in that particular


24  case, I as a managed care entity did not exercise any medical


25  judgments, because that's the defense -­


41


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION: But you exercise a medical judgment when you


2  refuse to make a payment.  You're deciding it's not medically


3  necessary.


4

 MR. MATTAX: Correct.  And if they're making a decision


5  with regards to medical judgment.  And they are exercising that


6  judgment not according to our standard of care.  We are imposing


7  that on the managed care entity.


8

 QUESTION:  No you're not.  You're saying even if it's


9  not according to your standard of care, if it is not due under


10  the plan you're not liable. 


11

12

13

 MR. MATTAX: And what I'm saying there is -­


 QUESTION: Have you said that?


 MR. MATTAX: That is a defense to the claim.  And under


14  this Court's decision in Caterpillar versus Williams a defense


15  being raised to a claim does not create complete preemption. 


16

 QUESTION: Back to Pilot Life.  In my understanding of


17  the case, maybe I've got this wrong.  Tell me if I do.  There's a


18  plan that says, an ERISA plan says we pay you for a treatment


19  that's medically necessary.  Then there's a person, it may be an


20  insurance company, it may be a doctor, maybe somebody says it


21  isn't medically necessary.  The Plaintiff thinks it is medically


22  necessary, so the question is whether the plan did what it said. 


23  Now you have a way of -- I mean isn't that what this is about?


24

 MR. MATTAX: There's separate duties involved here. 


25  There is a duty under the plan, and the beneficiary can go to the


42


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  plan and say because you hired this managed care entity to make


2  this judgment, I would like to get the benefits under the plan


3  and that would be a claim against the benefit plan.  What Texas


4  has done has said, when a managed care entity, an HMO goes and


5  sells his products to a plan, or goes and sells its services to a


6  plan and is going to exercise medical judgment, then the state of


7  Texas will regulate the exercise of the medical judgment of that


8  managed care entity.


9

 QUESTION: It's not just an HMO, it's also a health


10  insurance carrier.  Here, AETNA.


11

 MR. MATTAX: It is theoretically anyone who exercises


12  medical judgment that influences care.  But I think it is


13  important to recognize that the reasons for managed care as


14  stated by both the Petitioners here, and I would briefly quote


15  from a CIGNA brief, page 44.  Utilization, review techniques are


16  designed to ensure that quality care is delivered as cost


17  efficiently as possible.  The letter to Mr. Davila's doctor,


18  specifically says - - this in AETNA's petition or Appendix 88 - ­


19  as part of our commitment to provide access to quality care. 


20  What the Court needs to recognize if I may, is that prior to the


21  rise of managed care, decisions were made on a retrospective


22  basis.  An insurer would say, well we've looked at this, we do


23  not believe it was medically necessary, we're not going to pay


24  for it.  The difference now is, managed care has taken on the


25  rubric of saying, we will manage care, we will determine what is


43


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  best for the patient and we will do that by dictating what is


2  going to be paid for, and not paid for.


3

 QUESTION: But it's just -- even at the early stage,


4  it's simply a statement, we will not pay for it.  That doesn't


5  mean that the patient can't do it other ways.  It just means that


6  this particular program won't pay for it.


7

 MR. MATTAX: Well respectfully the statement is we don't


8  think it's good for you.  We don't think this care is appropriate


9  for your particular situation.  And there's no reason -­


10

 QUESTION: Well isn't it more a question of medical


11  necessity.  That is the plan says we'll cover it in case of


12  medical necessity, and the plan says we don't think there's


13  medical necessity here.


14

 MR. MATTAX: Well the plan itself can put in as a term


15  medical necessity, but the plan is not making the determination


16  of whether it's medically necessary or not.  They have hired


17  someone to make that determination for them. They may -­


18

 QUESTION: Well then it's certainly it's by the plan. I


19  mean the fact that an agent makes it rather than the plan doesn't


20  make any difference.


21

 MR. MATTAX: But the reason to make that decision is


22  because the medical necessity decision is a result of a


23  determination by that managed care entity that they are going to


24  manage the care that's provided.  Again the letter that was sent


25  -­


44


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION: Well how much does that advance the argument? 


2  I mean it's still a decision we won't pay for it. 


3

 MR. MATTAX: But the decision is based on a


4  determination by a managed care entity that in their medical


5  judgment that the care is not necessary.  And what Texas has


6  said, with respect to that managed care entity.  Again not the


7  plan.  Is that when you are going to exercise medical judgment


8  and that is going to -- as a matter of practical reality, impact


9  the care a patient receives and potentially cause damage to that


10  patient, then we will regulate that as a separate duty, separate


11  and apart from ERISA.


12

 QUESTION: But you could say that in respect to any


13  benefit of a plan.  Let's imagine a plan with millions of


14  different benefits.  Whenever a benefit is turned down, there


15  will always be a human being who told the plan manager it isn't


16  called for.  Now a state could come in and regulate their human


17  being, those human beings in their capacity as professionals and


18  say whenever they make such a mistake, they've made a


19  professional misjudgment and we give you an extra remedy here. 


20  And that seems to be the thing that this statute forbids.  I


21  don't see how to get around it.  I'd like you to tell me how to


22  get around it.  But I don't see it at the moment.


23

 MR. MATTAX: And I believe the answer to that question


24  is what the statute is concerned about is limiting and defining


25  the liability of employers and plan sponsors.  And a statute that


45


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  regulates the conduct of a third party who sells their services


2  to that plan or plan sponsor, has no impact on the liability of


3  that plan or that plan sponsor.  And in this particular case, in


4  Texas we have made a determination that with managed care


5  entities as an entity, be it an HMO, be it a PPO, exercising


6  medical judgment, we are regulating the medical judgment of that


7  third party.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


 QUESTION: Mr. Estrada, you can address what you would


16  like but there are three points that have come up during the


17  Respondent's presentation that I'd be interested with a response


18  to. 


19

 Number one, is it true that the people who make the


20  decisions for your client must be medical doctors in Texas?


21

 MR. ESTRADA: Well it is true by virtue of DOL


22  regulations which provide that no claim may be turned down,


23  without input from a medical professional in the relevant area.


24

 QUESTION: My other two points are, what is your


25  response to the point that the plan is not liable under Texas law


46


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

4

 MR. ESTRADA: Well -­


 QUESTION:  -- just the insurance company here.


 MR. ESTRADA: That was going to be one of my points that


5  I deal with -­


6

7

 QUESTION: Just so you can -­


 MR. ESTRADA: That is consistent with every case, from


8  Pilot Life, Taylor, and Ingersoll-Rand.  Because in each of those


9  cases, you were dealing with an insurance company that was acting


10  as a claim administrator or insurer with respect to an ERISA


11  plan.  And if memory serves, the claim was made as well in


12  Pegram, and the Court dealt with it at the top of page 223 of 530


13  US. by pointing out that a contract between an HMO and the plan


14  may itself contain elements of a plan to the extent that it


15  governs the circumstances under which benefits may be obtained.


16

 QUESTION: Lastly.  Is there anything to the notion that


17  there is no preemption when the interference with the plan, if


18  there is any, only comes by way of an affirmative defense.


19

 MR. ESTRADA: No and in fact it is also not true in this


20  case that that's so.  Because you have been citing subsection


21  (c)(2) of the statute, here under Section (d) it is affirmatively


22  stated that nothing in the act shall be construed to provide -­


23  to require the provision of something that is not covered and


24  that is at page -- also 59 (a) of the AETNA... 


25

 Just let me take one second to make two points.  It is


47


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  of course open to Texas to have a law that regulates the practice


2  of medicine, by telling hospitals do not discharge somebody who


3  needs care.  And there is nothing in the Federal statute that


4  would keep them from doing that.  In fact we have a Federal


5  statute in PALA that does something similar with respect to


6  hospitals that take in medicare money.  With respect to how


7  quickly we could do these things Justice Stevens, the DOL


8  regulations say that consistent with the urgency of the situation


9  it must be done as soon as possible.  It can be done informally


10  and the doctor may act for the patient to pursue all of the plan


11  appeals and that is at pages 17(a) and 3(a) of the Appendix to


12  the blue brief. 


13

 Brief word about the insurance savings clause, I will


14  not belabor it.  There is a footnote in one of the briefs in the


15  Court of Appeals.  It doesn't raise the clause as opposed to the


16  section 502 issue, but the acid test is that there was no mention


17  of the clause, in the brief in opposition.  Under this Court's


18  rules and Oklahoma City versus Tuttle that is completely


19  reclusive.  Should we need to reach it I will point out that one


20  of the response -- one of the petitioners in this case is a self


21  funded plan, in the CIGNA case, which would be saved by the


22  Deemer clause even if the insurance clause did apply in this


23  case.  And that is to both of them, the question whether the


24  insurance savings clause does apply was conclusively resolved by


25  Pilot Life, has never been revisited by the Court, and that Pilot
