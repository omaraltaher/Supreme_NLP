(10:08  a.m.) 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  15­6092,  Mathis  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States. 

 

            

Mr.  Fleming. 

 

            

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MARK  C.  FLEMING 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  Iowa  statute  under  which  Mr.  Mathis  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted  defines  one  crime,  and  Iowa  does  not  need  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove  generic  burglary  to  convict  under  it.  The  Eighth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  below  and  the  government  here,  nonetheless,  want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  use  the  modified  categorical  approach.  Not  for  its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

usual  purpose,  which  is  to  identify  the  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction,  we  know  what  that  is,  but  rather  to  identify 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  means  of  commission.  That  is  contrary  to  ACCA's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorical  approach,  and  it's  irreconcilable  with  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  result  and  the  reasoning  of  this  Court's  decision  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Descamps. 

            

            

One  of  ­­

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Why  is  that  so?  I  mean, 

    

  

 

 

 

 

here  we  have  the  crime,  burglary,  and  there  are  two  ways 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  committing  it.  One  involves  a  structure;  one

involves  a  vehicle.  And  those  can  be  easily  divided. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

We  look  at  the  charge.  The  charge  is  for  a  structure, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  for  a  vehicle.  Why  ­­ why  is  it  not  divisible? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  For  the  exact  same  reason, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg,  that  the  California  statute  at  issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Descamps  was  not  divisible.  In  that  case  as  well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  indictment  charged  that  Mr.  Descamps  had  unlawfully 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  feloniously  entered  the  grocery  store.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor  stated  as  much,  that  Mr.  Descamps  had  broken 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  entered  into  a  grocery  store,  and  Mr.  Descamps  did 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  object  to  that. 

 

 

 

            

Nonetheless,  this  Court,  quite  properly, 

 

 

 

 

held  that  it  was  not  divisible  because  California  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  required  to  prove  unlawful  entry  in  order  to  get  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction. 

            

The  same  is  true  of  Mr.  Mathis.  Iowa  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  have  to  prove  the  type  of  occupied  structure  that  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposedly  burglarized. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  he  did  one  or  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other.  In  Descamps,  there  was  an  element  that  didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  be  proved  under  the  State  statute.  You  didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  prove  unlawful. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  The  ­­ the  ­­ California  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  had  to  prove  entry,  just  as  Iowa  would  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove  an  occupied  structure.  But  California  did  not

have  to  prove  whether  the  entry  was  unlawful  as  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  required  to  make  the  offense  a  generic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

burglary  offense. 

 

            

Similarly  here,  Iowa  did  not  need  to  prove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burglary  of  a  building  as  opposed  to  burglary  of  a  land, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

air,  or  water  vehicle  or  similar  place.  Those  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues  that  there's  no  dispute  a  jury  could  have  divided 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  or  Mr.  Mathis  would  not  have  had  to  admit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically  in  order  to  permit  a  conviction  under  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Iowa  statute. 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  they  have  to  prove 

  

 

 

 

 

 

one  ­­ they  define,  somewhere,  structure,  right,  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute? 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  They  do,  Justice  Breyer. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  don't  you  have  to  prove 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  definition  applies?  I  mean,  you  know,  suppose  it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  structure  for  ­­ for  an  animal  at  a  zoo  or 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something.  I  mean,  that  wouldn't  count,  would  it? 

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  It  might  not.  But  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Right.  Well,  if  it  does 

  

  

 

 

 

 

not,  don't  you  have  to  at  least  prove  that  it  falls 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  definition? 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  The  definition  of  occupied 

  

 

 

 

 

structure. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yes.

MR.  FLEMING:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay. 

  

 

MR.  FLEMING:  And  we  don't  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And,  similarly,  in  Taylor, 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

you  have  to  prove  that  it  falls  within  the  statute's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  boat  or  car  or  house.  Right?  You  have  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove  one  of  the  three. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FLEMING:  That  is  the  difference. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  you  don't  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

prove  ­­ you  have  to  prove  in  Massachusetts  if  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  indictment  which  says  it  was  like  a  houseboat,  so 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  not  certain  what  it  counts  as.  So  they  say, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  you  have  to  prove  our  prosecutor  says  it's  a  boat 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  a  house?  Now,  would  that  get  a  conviction  in 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts?  They  proved  that.  It's  either  a  boat  or 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

a  house.  Do  they  get  a  conviction  or  not? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

that  ­­

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  This  Court  in  Shepard  assumed

Massachusetts  law.  I'm  saying  under  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FLEMING:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ Massachusetts  law,  would 

  

 

 

 

 

you  be  able  to  convict  the  person? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  I  ­­ this  Court  assumed

no  and  that  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  answer  is  no?  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

cannot  convict  a  person,  say,  on  a  houseboat  in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts  where  the  prosecutor  says  it's  either  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

house  or  a  boat?  They  have  to  go  into  what  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  is? 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  As  this  Court  interpreted  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ in  Shepard,  house  or  a  boat  are  elements  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So,  in  other  words,  if  six 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  think  a  houseboat  is  a  boat  and  six  people  think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  houseboat  is  a  house,  the  guy  gets  off  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FLEMING:  If  ­­ if  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ in  Massachusetts?  Do 

  

  

 

 

 

you  have  any  case  on  that?  I  would  be  rather  surprised. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  Not  in  Massachusetts, 

  

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  but  this  is  an  Iowa  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  know.  But  what  I'm 

    

  

 

 

 

driving  at,  it's  the  same  thing,  the  same  thing.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've  made  up  a  very  ingenious  difference.  But  why 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  it  just  the  same  thing  here  as  was  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts? 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  Because  Massachusetts  and  Iowa 

  

 

 

 

 

have  chosen  to  define  different  crimes,  and  they  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  prerogative  to  do  that.  If  Iowa  says,  we  don't

care,  as  it  has  said,  ultimately  what  the  means  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  location  of  the  burglary  is  a  means  ­­ the  jury  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divide  on  that  and  still  convict  as  long  as  they  find  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occupied  structure.  State  v.  Duncan  holds  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

There's  no  dispute. 

 

 

            

In  that  circumstance,  one  cannot  be  sure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it's  a  jury  trial,  which  this  ­­ and  this  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  except  for  the  case  of  one,  as  revealed  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record,  or  a  plea,  if  Mr.  Mathis  had  been  told  you  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  charged  with  burglarizing  a  garage  and  he  said,  oh 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no,  I  didn't  break  into  a  garage.  I  broke  into  a  car 

    

   

   

   

 

 

 

parked  outside  the  garage;  that  would  have  made  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  under  Iowa  law  and  he  would  have  had  no  basis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  contest  the  means  of  commission.  A  judge  might  not 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  have  allowed  him  to  do  it,  and  certainly  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense  attorney  would  have  said,  let's  not  burden  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  why  I  asked  you 

   

  

 

 

 

about  Massachusetts. 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  Massachusetts  will  be 

  

 

 

 

different. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You  violated  Section  blah, 

  

 

 

 

 

blah,  blah.  Prosecutor:  You  broke  into  a  house. 

   

  

  

 

 

 

            

Defendant:  No,  I  broke  into  a  boat. 

   

   

  

 

            

Admitted?  Yes.  Guilty  or  not  guilty?

MR.  FLEMING:  It  ­­ in  Massachusetts,  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  itself  is  not  clear  on  the  point.  We  give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  example  of  Vermont  where  it  does  make  a  difference. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  reason  it  makes  a  difference  is  because  Vermont 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punishes  burglary  of  a  dwelling  more  severely  than 

   

 

 

 

 

 

burglary  of  a  boat.  And  so  a  Vermont  prosecutor  does 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

need  to  show  which  it  is  because  it  makes  a  difference 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  sentence.  And  in  that  circumstance,  the  statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  divisible,  and  it  would  be  proper  to  go  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modified  categorical  approach. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  there  are  a  lot  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

reasons  why  Iowa  might  want  to  take  the  approach  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ that  it  does.  Suppose  the  person  is  convicted  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppose  the  evidence  involves  the  burglary  of  a  trailer. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  you'd  have  the  rather  ridiculous  situation  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  ­­ if  that  was  ­­ if  those  are  separate  elements, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  if  six  of  the  jurors  thought,  well,  this  trailer  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  very  movable,  so  I  think  it's  a  house,  and  the  other 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

others  say,  well,  you  know,  it's  possible  you  could  hook 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  up  to  a  truck  and  move  it,  so  it's  a  vehicle.  So 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  couldn't  be  an  agreement,  and  the  defendant  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  acquitted.  That's  a  rather  strange  result  that  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Iowa  legislature  might  want  to  avoid. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  you  want  to  attribute  the  same  ­­ you

in  the  case  of  a  houseboat  would  permit  the  same  thing? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  have  no  Massachusetts  case  that  says  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  The  ­­ I  do  not,  Your  Honor. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

But  this  is  not  a  Massachusetts  case.  And  Vermont 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

clearly  does.  The  Vermont  legislature  has  made  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

choice. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  maybe  they  have  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

houseboats  in  Massachusetts  than  they  do  in  Vermont. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  But  the  ­­ the  point, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Alito,  is  that  the  State  is  free  to  define  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime  as  it  wishes.  You  are  absolutely  right  that  Iowa 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  decide  it  prefers  to  make  it  easier  for  its  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutors  to  get  convictions  so  that  they  don't  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  get  jury  unanimity  on  the  specific  location,  and  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  care  less  about  whether  their  convictions  are  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  used  as  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  the  point  is,  what  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  ­­ under  your  approach,  what  is  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  court  supposed  to  do  in  the  situation  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Massachusetts  situation  where  there  is  no  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  no  Massachusetts  case?  So  what  is  the  court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed  to  do? 

 

 

            

Now,  in  ­­ this  Court  has  said  it's  ­­ it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  simple  as  pie  to  determine  whether  something  is  ­­ is

an  element  or  a  means.  That's  your  view,  too.  But  just 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell  me  what  the  ­­ what  the  Federal  sentencing  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  do  in  that  situation. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  If  there  truly  were  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

situation  where  all  else  had  failed,  all  the  standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tools  of  statutory  interpretation  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

case. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Which  will  often  be  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  FLEMING:  Will  sometimes  be  the  case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

There  are  a  number  of  them  that  we  cite  where  State  law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  plain  on  the  point,  and  the  State  courts  have  had  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolve  this,  whether  in  the  context  of  the  double 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jeopardy  challenge  or  a  challenge  to  the  indictment  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

request  for  unanimous  jury  instructions. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  what  ­­ what  happens  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  that  State  case  that  says  whether  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definitively  an  element  or  a  means? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  In  the  situation  where  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

arises,  obviously,  the  sentencing  court  will  apply  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary  tools  of  statutory  interpretation,  looking  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  text  to  say  ­­ for  instance,  in  the  case  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Vermont  ­­ are  they  punishing  one  of  the  particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

locations  more  severely  than  another?  In  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance,  we  know  they  have  to  be  elements,  not  ­­

suppose  they  don't.  So  if  it  looks  at  a  case  like 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts,  what's  the  Federal  sentencing  court 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed  to  do? 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  Obviously,  one  would  look  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

authoritative  sources  like  ­­ like  jury  instructions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One  could  look  at  commentaries.  One  would  look  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative  history.  One  would  look  at  how  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts  courts  had  interpreted  comparable  statutes

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Isn't  there  also  something 

  

 

 

 

 

that  Descamps  says  that  ­­ that  can  be  done,  which  is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  maybe  you  have  a  case  and  it  just  gives  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  answer.  Maybe  you  have  jury  instructions  and  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives  you  the  answer.  If  they  don't,  Descamps  indicates 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  footnote  2  that  you  can  look  to  the  charging 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

documents  for  the  limited  purpose  of  seeing  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  prosecutor  is  treating  the  house  or  a  boat  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  means  or  as  an  element.  And  sometimes  that  will  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear. 

              

I  mean,  you  might  have  one  set  of  charging 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

documents,  and  it  will  say  the  person  burgled  either  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

house  or  a  boat.  And  then  it  will  be  clear  that  the  ­­

another  charging  document  can  say,  as  to  a  houseboat,

the  person  burgled  a  house,  and  then  that  indicates  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts  law  does  treat  this  as  an  element  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  to  prove  one  or  the  other  and  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor  has  made  his  choice.  Isn't  that  right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  It's  certainly  right  as  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  point,  and  I  ­­ I  think  certainly  looking  at 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Shepard  documents  to  determine,  for  instance,  if  house 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  boat  are  charged  in  the  same  count,  then  to  avoid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duplicity  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  These  documents  are  a  clue 

   

  

 

 

 

to  whether  something  is  an  element  or  instead  a  means. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FLEMING:  I  ­­

    

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Sometimes  they're  a  very 

   

  

 

 

good  clue.  Sometimes  they  won't  get  you  all  the  way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there,  but  they're  certainly  a  clue  as  to  whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  is  an  element  or  a  means.  And  so  you  can  look 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  Shepard  documents  to  try  to  figure  out  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question. 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  I  think  as  Your  Honor  has

that  was  done,  it  has  to  be  done  in  terms  of  the

position. 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  No,  Your  Honor,  that's  not  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  then  how  can  you  tell 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  ­­ from  the  charging  document  that  something  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  element  or  a  means? 

   

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  I  think  if,  in  the  limited 

    

 

 

 

 

 

situation  that  Justice  Kagan's  question  posited,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  when  you  have  a  situation  where  a  prosecutor  charges 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

house  and  boat  together  in  one  count,  that  would  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duplicitous  indictment  if  they  were  different  elements. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  that  is  a  clue  that  at  least  the  prosecutor  viewed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  as  different  means  of  commission  of  a  single 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense. 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  if  the  charge  is  one?

element  or  a  means? 

   

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  No,  your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It  is  very  clear  that

isn't  the  issue  here  what  we  left  off  ­­ open  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Descamps?  Iowa  calls  this  a  means,  but  if  I  read  the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

instrument,  it  seems  like  an  element. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  what  does  a  judge  do?  Give  me  the  steps 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  interpretive  principles  that  a  judge  would  do  with  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  like  this. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FLEMING:  Of  course,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  State  law 

  

 

 

 

dispositive,  that's  number  ­­ first,  let's  start  there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  State  law  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

dispositive,  because  States  define  the  elements  of  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes.  This  Court  made  that  very  clear  in  ­­ in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plurality  opinion  in  Schad.  It's  true  in  Richardson. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  State  is  defining  the  crime,  and  as  usual  in  matters 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  State  law,  Federal  courts  defer  to  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  of  their  own  laws. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  that's  your  entire 

  

 

 

 

 

case,  correct? 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  Well,  in  this  case  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Let's  assume  Iowa  was 

  

 

 

 

 

silent.  That  was  the  question  that  Justice  Breyer  ­­

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ with  Descamps  there 

  

 

 

 

 

is  that  "feloniously  entered"  had  two  potential 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meanings:  You  broke  and  you  entered,  or  you  remained 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawfully  and  committed  a  crime.  And  what  we  said  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Descamps  was,  reading  felonious  entry,  you  don't  know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  of  the  two  it  is  because  it  ­­ it's  not  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element.  You  just  have  to  do  one  or  ­­ it's  not  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element.  It's  a  means.  We  didn't  know  which  one,  but 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  sort  of  different.  This  is  the  indictment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  the  structure  you  broke  into  is  this  particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one. 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  If  I  may,  Justice  Sotomayor, 

   

  

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  ­­ if  you  ­­ if  Your  Honor  had  thought  that

dispositive  of  figuring  out  whether  the  generic  offense

unlawfully,  and  feloniously  entered  a  building."  And  at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  plea  hearing,  the  prosecutor  said,  without  objection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  Mr.  Descamps,  that  the  crime  involved  the  breaking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  entering  of  a  grocery  store. 

   

 

 

 

            

So  there  was  no  question,  if  you  were  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  at  the  Shepard  documents  in  Descamps,  that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set  forth  generic  burglary. 

 

 

 

            

Nonetheless,  that  wasn't  enough,  because  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

and  these  are  the  Court's  words  ­­ California,  to  get  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction,  need  not  prove  that  Descamps  broke  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entered.  And  it  does  not  matter  whether  he  did.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  matter  whether  the  prosecutor  said  he  did.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  matter  whether  he  admitted  that  he  did.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  ­­ the  elements  of  the  statute  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Do  you  see  a  difference

Descamps,  he  could  have  done  one  of  two  things.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  have  broken  and  entered,  or  he  could  have  stayed

MR.  FLEMING:  And  the  point  is  that

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  He  wasn't  pleading 

  

 

 

 

guilty  to  one  or  the  other.  He  way  saying,  I  did 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawfully  what  the  indictment  said,  feloniously

exactly  which  of  the  two  ways  he  did  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  But  the  ­­ the  nongeneric 

  

 

 

 

 

 

aspect  of  the  California  offense  was  that  you  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enter  lawfully  and  then  shop  with  the  intent  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shoplift,  and  that  could  still  be  punishable  under  this

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Go  back  to  my  ultimate

MR.  FLEMING:  The  steps  for  how  the

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You  say  State  law  is

MR.  FLEMING:  So  there's  a  general  answer  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  question  and  a  specific  answer  to  the  question.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  answer  is  that  the  Court  determines  the  elements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  State  crime  in  the  same  way  as  it  applies  State

jeopardy  challenge  or,  for  that  matter,  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorical  approach.  This  Court  did  it  itself  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Duenas­Alvarez,  in  James,  in  Johnson.  Federal  courts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ascertaining  the  State  ­­ State  law  components  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  statute  in  front  of  them  is  nothing  new,  nor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  it  particularly  difficult. 

 

 

 

            

The  specific  answer:  You  ­­ if  there  is  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  case  law  available,  you  look  at  the  text  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  as  always  to  begin  with.  It  may  be  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

text  of  the  statute  tells  you  that  a  particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative  is  punished  more  harshly  than  others. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  the  case  in  Vermont.  Then  you  know  that  they  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements. 

            

You  would  look  at  the  case  law  backdrop  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  enactment.  It's  possible  the  State  legislature  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reacting  to  a  particular  prior  decision.  The  Maryland 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Court  of  Appeals  did  that  in  the  Rice  case,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cited  in  the  American  Immigration  Lawyers  brief  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

They  looked  at  the  backdrop  of  the  enactment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  statute  and  determined  that  the  new  theft  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Maryland  had  amalgamated  larceny,  receiving  stolen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property,  embezzlement  as  different  means  of  committing

a  means  or  an  element?  Suppose  I  just  looked  at  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  and  I  said,  here's  a  statute,  punishing 

   

   

 

 

 

burglary,  and  it  tells  us  two  ways  in  which  this  offense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  be  committed,  one  way  or  the  other  way.  Why  do  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  type  it  an  element  or  a  means  rather  than  saying 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  it  is?  It  is  a  way  of  committing  the  offense. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  I  ­­ I  view,  Justice  Ginsburg, 

    

   

 

 

 

a  way  of  committing  the  offense  as  a  synonym  for  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means.  The  definition  of  an  element,  which  this  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  in  Richardson  ­­ and  I  don't  think  it's  disputed. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  the  government  uses  it  in  its  own  brief  ­­ is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  the  prosecution  must  prove  to  the  jury  beyond 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  reasonable  doubt  in  order  to  get  a  conviction  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime.  And  that  goes  back  to  the  Court's  opinion  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Taylor,  which  is  why  ACCA  is  a  categorical  approach,  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  turns  on  the  elements  of  the  statute  of

Kennedy. 

            

Congress  intended  that  a  ­­ that  a 

   

 

 

 

 

conviction  for  a  particular  crime  would  be  an  ACCA 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicate  offense  in  all  cases  or  in  none.  That  is  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  said  in  Taylor,  reaffirmed  it  in  Descamps;  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  an  on/off  switch.  And  a  conviction  for  Iowa  burglary 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Section  713.1  of  the  Iowa  Code  either  is  an  ACCA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicate  or  it  is  not  in  all  cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  does  not  matter  what  was  particularly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charged  in  a  particular  case.  It  does  not  matter  what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  plea  agreement  said.  It  doesn't  matter  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  instructions  said  because  the  crime  itself  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unitary.  This  is  not  a  statute  that  sets  up  multiple 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  crimes  with  multiple  different  elements  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  modified  categorical  approach  is  necessary  to  figure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  what  crime  he  was  convicted  of.  We  know  what  crime 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  was  convicted  of,  and  it  is  not  a  generic  offense. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  to  ­­ to  the  extent  there's  any  doubt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  that,  I  think  it's  important  to  go  back  to  the  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reasons  why  Mr.  Descamps  won,  and  why  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rejected  the  Ninth  Circuit's  approach  in  Aguila­Montes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

De  Oca,  which  is  essentially  what  the  government  is  now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguing,  which  is  that  you  can  go  to  the  Shepard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

documents  to  try  to  find  out,  not  the  offense  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction,  but  what  this  defendant  specifically  did.

And  this  Court  rejected  that  soundly.  And  there  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three  reasons. 

 

            

The  first  was  the  statutory  intent  behind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  Congress  enacted,  which  is  to  make  sure  that  each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction  of  a  particular  crime  is  an  on/off  switch  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

produces  the  same  results  all  the  time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

The  second  ­­

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  is  ­­ what  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  in  ­­ in  the  ­­ you  said  the  statutory  text. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  is  the  evidence  in  the  statutory  text  of  ACCA  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  what  Congress  intended? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FLEMING:  It's  the  ­­ it's  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Prior  to  Apprendi  and  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  other  stuff.  What  is  the  statutory  evidence? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  This  ­­ this  Court  in  Taylor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

relied  on  the  fact  that  Congress  used  the  word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"convictions"  as  opposed  to  someone  who  had  committed  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense,  and  also  looked  at  the  legislative  history, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  specifically  indicated  that  Congress  did  not  mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  conviction  for  a  particular  crime  to  sometimes  be  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

act  of  predicate  and  sometimes  not. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  if  someone  were 

  

 

 

 

 

explaining  what  ­­ what  your  client  pled  guilty  to,  they

MR.  FLEMING:  It  may  ­­ I  mean  an  ­­ an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary  person  may  well  use  that  description.  He  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  may  also  say  he  was  convicted  of  breaking  into  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

garage  at  123  Main  Street,  but  that's  not  an  element 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Wasn't  Congress  interested 

  

 

 

 

in  what  the  person  did  rather  than  what  the  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said? 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  On  the  contrary,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

That's  exactly  what  Taylor  and  its  progeny  say  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case.  And  Descamps  says  that  too.  They're  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

interested  in  what  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It's  ­­ it's  not  the  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that's  what  Congress  wanted? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  Congress  was  not  ­­ by  ­­ by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passing  ACCA,  Congress  was  interested  in  what  the  person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  convicted  of,  which  is  why  they  use  the  word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"convictions."  They  did  not  use  the  language,  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance,  of  the  statute  in  Nijhawan,  which  is  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  does  not  trigger  a  categorical  approach  because  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

looks  to  conduct.  Congress  could  have  passed  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute. 

            

After  this  Court  decided  Taylor,  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

could  have  amended  ACCA  in  order  to  make  it  conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based.  It  hasn't  done  so.

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  you're  ­­ you're 

  

 

 

 

 

entitled,  probably  required,  to  argue  the  cases  as  ­­ as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've  written  them,  and  you're  ­­ and  you're  doing  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FLEMING:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It  does  seem  to  me  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  ­­ we're  living  in  a  very  artificial  world. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Does  ­­ does  Judge  Kozinski's  approach,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set  forth  in  the  Ninth  Circuit  in  his  separate  opinion, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  would  be  the  result  in  your  case  if  we  used  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach? 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  We  would  prevail,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Judge  Kozinski's  approach  is  exactly  the  same  as  one  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  questions  Justice  Kagan  asked  earlier  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Right. 

  

 

MR.  FLEMING:  ­­ which  is  you  can  look  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Shepard  documents  for  the  very  limited  purpose  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figuring  out  what  the  elements  of  the  State  crime  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  extent  there  isn't  dispositive  State  case  law  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  interpretive  aids  that  the  Court  can  use.  In  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  we  have  dispositive  State  case  law,  so  Judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kozinski's  approach  would  ­­ would  work  exactly  the  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  think  it  should. 

 

 

 

            

He  was  very  clear  that  the  modified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorical  approach  only  works  in  the  circumstance  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  it  works  in;  namely,  when  the  State  defines  more

than  one  crime  in  a  single  statute.  He  did  not  say  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  could  look  for  means  of  commission.  That  was  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  of  the  ­­ the  other  judge,  Graber's,  dissental 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Rendon  case,  and  it's  the  one  that  the  Ninth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  rejected  en  banc  in  the  Almanza­Arenas  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  This  case  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'd  like  to  try  with  one  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  ­­ what  I'm  trying  to  do  is  get  the  essence  of  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument. 

            

            

MR.  FLEMING:  Trying  to  get  it  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  so  you  can  just  say  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  have  it  or  I  do  have  it.  If  I  don't  have  it,  I'll 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  back  and  read  it,  I  promise,  and  I'll  get  it  before  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide  this. 

 

              

I  think  you're  looking  at  Descamps.  And  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

say,  look,  the  word  in  the  statute,  "Federal,"  is  crime. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  doesn't  mean  what  a  person  does  on  a  particular 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

occasion;  it  means  the  kind  of  thing  in  a  statute. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  imagine  we  have  the  word  "burglary,"  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  all  the  statute  said.  And  then  a  court  said  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  commit  this  in  any  one  of  five  ways:  A  boat,  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

house,  a  car,  et  cetera.  Now,  even  if  the  charging 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

document  there  said  "house,"  that  wouldn't  be  good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough  because  the  crime  is  what  the  statute  says.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  start  there.

And  you  say,  now,  what  difference  could  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibly  make?  If  in  a  different  section  of  the  statute 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  some  statutory  words  but  they  say  just  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  just  said  in  the  other  case,  now,  okay,  I'll 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  back  and  read  it.  I  mean  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

your  ­­

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  No,  no.  I'm  waiting  for 

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  that's  what  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

saying.  You're  saying  that  in  both  cases  the  key  point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  the  ­­ the  court  was  telling  you  in  the  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  that  the  burglary  can  be  comitted  in  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways,  which  means  you  don't  have  to  charge  it,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  doesn't  have  to  be  unanimous  in  respect  to  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  if  you  take  those  same  words  out  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  court  said  and  put  it  in  the  statute,  which  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  happened  here,  then  those  words  don't  require  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  ­­ they  either  charge  it  or  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  find  it  unanimously,  so  it's  not  an  element.  And  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  good  enough  to  get  my  client  out  of  the  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  first  case,  it  should  be  good  enough  when  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  thing  appears  in  a  statute. 

   

 

 

 

            

            

argument? 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  And  the  reason  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Is  that  your  basic 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  FLEMING:  It  is.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Thank  you.
 

  

 

 

MR.  FLEMING:  And  the  reason  for  that,
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Justice  Breyer,  is  that  it  does  not  matter  from  ­­


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

the  crime.
 

 

            

            

was  crimes.
 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Because  it's  not  part  of
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  FLEMING:  It's  not  the  crime.
 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  what  Congress  wanted
 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  FLEMING:  Was  the  crime.
 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  Got  it. 

  

  

 

 

MR.  FLEMING:  And  the  difficulty  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

government's  position  ­­

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No.  Just  trying  to  get  it. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  FLEMING:  No,  I  appreciate  it,  Justice 

   

  

 

 

 

Breyer.  And  I'd  like  ­­ I'd  like,  if  I  may,  to  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  question  tees  up  the  difficulty  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  position,  which  is  the  government  says  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes  all  the  difference  in  the  world  whether  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  uses  the  word  "or." 

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  the  California  statute  in  Descamps 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  been  phrased 
 

 

 

instead  of  saying  every  person  who 

 

 

 

 

 

enters,  had  said 
 

 

 

every  person  who  enters  lawfully  or 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawfully,  then 
 

 

the  outcome  would  have  been  completely 

 

 

 

 

 

different  in  the 
 

 

 

government's  mind,  even  though  it  would 

 

 

 

 

 

not  have  changed

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  NICOLE  A.  SAHARSKY 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

From  Taylor  forward,  this  Court  has  never 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted  a  means­elements  distinction  that  turns  on 

   

 

 

 

 

parsing  State  law.  In  fact,  it's  done  and  said  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposite.  And  adopting  such  an  inquiry  now  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

highly  disruptive  and  detrimental  to  the  uniform 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administration  of  Federal  law. 

 

 

 

              

I  want  to  start  where  Petitioner's  counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

ended,  which  was  saying  that  what  we're  doing  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  is  the  same  as  Descamps,  et  cetera.  I  think  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor  correctly  identified  the  difference 

 

 

 

 

 

between  this  case  and  Descamps.  In  Descamps,  there  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  component  of  generic  burglary  that  was  just  not

present  in  the  State  statute.  You  didn't  have  statutory 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternatives.  And  as  a  result  of  that,  you  couldn't  do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  matching  that  happens  under  the  modified  categorical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach.  The  approach  is  all  about  trying  to  match, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  the  defendant's  conviction  under  this  State  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  ­­

 

            

            

or  not.

MS.  SAHARSKY:  ­­ was  it  a  federal  offense 

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ sure  that  that's  true, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Ms.  Saharsky.  I  mean,  you  could  take  that  Descamps  law, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  as  Mr.  Fleming  did  or  some  other  way,  essentially  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  exact  same  thing  with  an  explicit  disjunctive.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  Mr.  Fleming  did  it,  he  said  lawfully  or  unlawfully, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  could  say  breaking  and  entering  or  not  breaking  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entering.  I  mean,  there  would  be  a  zillion  ways  of 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

phrasing  the  exact  same  thing  disjunctively  on  the  face 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  statute.  And  I  think  Mr.  Fleming  is  right  that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  not  have  made  a  difference  to  our  analysis. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well,  I  think  that  it  did 

   

  

 

 

 

 

make  a  difference  to  the  Court's  analysis,  and  what  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  give  you  is  an  example.  And  this  was  in  the

imagine  an  assault­with­a­weapon  statute  that  just  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"a  weapon"  and  doesn't  specify  any  weapons.  And  then

weapon"  and  specifies  eight  individual  weapons.  Is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  a  difference  between  those  two  cases? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  Court's  opinion  says  yes.  The  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  does  not  have  a  component  of  generic  burglary,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  you  cannot  match  it  with  the  Federal  offense.  It

assault  ­­ but  you  do  have  a  component  that  you  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

match  with  the  Federal  offense.  And  so  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Assuming  that  the  component 

  

 

 

 

 

is  an  element.  So  that  gets  you  back  to  your  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement,  which  is  that  it  didn't  matter  whether  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  element  or  something  else.  A  means  was  just  as  good 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  long  as  it's  phrased  in  the  disjunctive. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And,  you  know,  all  of  our  cases  ­­ it's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  Descamps  ­­ it  goes  back  to  Taylor  and  Shepard  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Johnson.  They  all  use  the  language  of  elements. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Descamps  in  the  introduction  uses  the  word  "elements" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ten  times.  So  if  we  really  meant  elements  or  means  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever,  it's  a  funny  thing  ­­ it's  a  funny  way  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

write  all  of  our  opinions. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well,  two  ­­ I  think  this  is

a  critical  question,  and  there  are  really  two  responses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  it.  The  first  is  when  describing  divisibility,  which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  this  question  of,  can  you  divide  up  the  statute  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matching  purposes,  the  Court  said  "element,"  and  it  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equated  that  with  the  statutory  alternatives.  It  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  throughout  the  opinion. 

 

 

 

            

The  second  point  is  that  there's  a  reason 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  when  the  Court  ­­ the  Court  could  say  "element"  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"statutory  alternatives"  interchangeably,  because  a 

 

 

 

 

distinction  between  means  and  elements  doesn't  matter  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divisibility.  I  think  really  the  heart  of  the  modified 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorical  approach  is  ­­ if  I  can  just  explain  as  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  explained,  is  you  need  to  make  sure  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  was  convicted  of  the  generic  offense,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  jury  or  the  fact­finder  necessarily  found  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generic  offense  and  not  something  else.  And  you  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell  that  from  the  ordinary  application  in  the  modified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorical  approach  using  the  Shepard  documents. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  you  see,  Descamps  makes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  quite  clear  that  there's  two  different  kinds  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  ­­ what  Descamps  says  is  you  have  to  be  able  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  a  person  was  necessarily  convicted  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

something. 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Okay.

requires  him  to  be  convicted  of  something.  It  is  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good  enough  to  look  at  the  course  of  proceedings  and  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infer  that  a  jury  or  a  judge  actually  did  find 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

something.  Descamps  says  this  in  no  uncertain  terms, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ you  know,  I  mean,  sometimes  those  inferences  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  very  powerful.  And  Descamps  says  it's  not  enough. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  what  you  have  to  find  is  a  necessary  finding  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense  that  a  statute  makes  something  necessary  in  order 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  a  conviction  to  occur.  And  that's  the  distinction 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

between  elements  and  means. 

 

 

 

            

And  I'll  just  say  one  last  thing.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  I've  been  talking  for  a  while,  so  I'll  let  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talk.  But  the  entire  discussion  between  the  dissent  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  majority  was  about  this. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  The  ­­ the  dissent  said, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  really  terrible  what  the  Court  just  did.  It  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

created  this  distinction  between  elements  and  means. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  majority  said,  yes,  that's  exactly  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction  we're  using,  and  we  think  it's  the  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  ­­ distinction. 

 

 

            

So  nine  members  of  this  Court  thought  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  distinction  that  we  were  using  was  a  distinction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  elements  and  means. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Okay.  Well,  a  few  responses

to  that.  I  think  you're  ­­ you're  pointing  to  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  footnote  2.  And  when  the  Court  was  talking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  means  as  a  general  matter  in  Descamps,  it  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  things  not  specified  in  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because,  of  course,  the  statutory  term  was  overbroad  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Descamps. 

            

But  if  we  look  to  what  the  Court  meant  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

footnote  2,  you're  right.  It  talks  about  a  distinction 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

between  means  and  elements,  but  the  Court's  ultimate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  It's  not  just  footnote  2,  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  could  just  interrupt.  I  mean,  the  footnote  2  comes  as 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  substance  to  the  dissent,  and  the  dissent  says,  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  problem  with  the  entire  opinion,  is  that  it  keeps 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  talking  about  elements,  but  it's  hard  to  distinguish 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  elements  and  means.  And  we  shouldn't  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguishing  between  those  two  things. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  whole  opinion  is  this  elements  focus, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  then  the  dissent  attacks. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Right.  I  understand  the 

    

  

 

 

question,  and  I  will  talk  about  both  footnote  2  and  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rest  of  the  Court's  opinion. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  we  look  at  this  discussion  in  footnote 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2,  I  think  the  Court's  ultimate  conclusion  is  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

telling  and  important  to  us,  because  the  Court  says

there's  no  real­world  reason  to  worry  about  the  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussion  with  State  law  that  we're  having  today.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  says  whatever  a  statute  lists,  whether  elements  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

means,  the  Court  need  not  parse  State  law  when  State  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  drafted.  In  the  alternative,  you  resort  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shepard  documents.  And  I  think  your  ­­ one  of  your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

earlier  questions  suggested,  can't  we  look  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shepard  documents  to  see  whether  something  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element?  And  we  think  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  If  you  need  to. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Okay.  Well,  we  think  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that  general  approach  is  correct,  which,  to  us,  we  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  we  understood  this  to  say,  just  look  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  of  conviction  in  the  Shepard  documents. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  when  ­­ when  only  one  thing  is  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue,  like  in  this  case,  which  is  burglary  of  a  house, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  I  don't  think  you  necessarily  know  whether  it  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  means  in  a  different  case  where  two  things  are 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

charged.  But  I  think  you  confidently  know  that  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

person  was  convicted  of  burglary  of  a  house  in  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  The  statute  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  here,  you  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

particular  statute,  a  particular  State  ­­ excuse  me  ­­ a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  State  court  decision  that  says  exactly  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  an  element  and  what  is  a  means  and  that  this  is  ­­

this  is  not  an  element. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Right,  but  I  don't  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  you  don't  need  to  look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  further  than  a  dispositive  State  court  decision  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  subject. 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  A  couple  of  ­­ a  couple  of 

    

   

 

 

 

 

responses.  The  first  is,  is  that  these  decisions,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  ­­ these  questions  don't  arise  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  courts  very  often.  I  think  between  all  of  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resources  and  the  parties  in  this  case,  we've  only  found 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  State  court  decisions  that  address  a  place  being 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

burgled.  And  I  think  that's  problematic  in  light  of  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  this  burglary  of  a  building  or  a  boat,  this 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts,  is  really  a  paradigmatic  example  that 

   

 

 

 

 

this  Court  has  always  offered  of  a  divisible  statute. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  to  not  know  now  under  State  law  whether  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divisible  is  particular  problematic  under  Petitioner's 

 

 

 

 

 

approach. 

            

But  just  to  get  back  to  what  I  think  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  ­­ your  central  question,  because  I  think  this  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  important  about  Descamps  and  why  we're  reading 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  opinion  our  way:  Aside  from  this  conclusion  at  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end  of  footnote  2,  which  we  think  essentially  says  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  ACCA  purposes,  when  you  have  something  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shepard  documents,  it  is  ­­ it  functions  as  an  element

in  that  case. 

 

 

            

But  aside  from  that,  I  think  there  are  two 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  very  telling  parts  of  the  Court's  opinion  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Descamps.  One  is  that  the  Court  starts  its  opinion,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throughout  its  opinion  says,  that  settled  law,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  20  years  of  precedent  up  to  that  point,  pretty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  resolved  that  question,  all  but  settles  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question.  The  Court  was  not  purporting  to  change 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

settled  law.  It  wasn't  purporting  to  do  something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraordinary  like  require  a  State  law  inquiry. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

In  fact,  the  whole  Petitioner's  argument  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Descamps,  why  you  couldn't  do  the  thing  the  Ninth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  wanted  to  do  was  because  this  whole  thing  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settled.  You  just  look  at  the  text  of  the  statute,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Ninth  Circuit  is  really  doing  this  kind  of  outlier 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach  and  you  shouldn't  do  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  we  read  the  opinion  in  Descamps  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole  to  say  we're  just  applying  settled  law.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  our  position  in  this  case,  is  we  just  want  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  the  settled  law  in  divisibility. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Applying  your  approach 

  

 

 

 

now,  how  does  Descamps  come  out?  How  does  Descamps  come 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out? 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Same  result.  Same  result, 

  

  

 

 

 

because  I  think,  as  your  question  suggested,  there  is  a

critical  difference  between  Descamps  and  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because  there,  there  was  an  overbroad  statutory  term, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  there  just  was  nothing  in  the  statute  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corresponded  to  generic  burglary.  So  you  can't  do  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  said  is  what  you  have  to  do.  Which  version  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  offense  was  the  person  committed  ­­ convicted  of, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  does  it  correspond  to  generic  burglary?  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  make  that  inquiry  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That  ­­ that's 

  

 

 

 

stretching  things.  I  think  99  percent  of  the  courts 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

across  the  country  would  have  looked  at  the  plea 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  and  said,  the  prosecutor  said  he  broke  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entered  a  garage.  We're  going  to  find  he  broke  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

entered  a  garage. 

   

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  he  didn't  stay  a  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

I'm  sorry,  a  grocery  store  ­­ and  he  didn't  stay 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawfully.  So  how  do  we  get  courts,  assuming  we  accept 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  argument,  not  to  do  the  kind  of  inferential 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retrying  of  the  case  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ that  often  happens 

  

 

 

 

 

when  you're  relying  on  Shepard  documents?

Descamps  the  way  that  it  did,  was  the  difference  between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  statute  like  one  that  just  prohibits  assault  with  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weapon  and  one  that  prohibits  assault  with  one  of  eight 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specified  weapons.  When  it  just  says  "assault  with  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weapon,"  the  Court's  opinion  in  Descamps  says  you  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infinitely  divide  up  the  terms  of  the  statute  to  imagine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  number  of  subcrimes  and  then  try  to  match  them  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  offense. 

 

 

            

When  you  don't  have  a  statutory  alternative, 

   

 

 

 

 

the  Court's  opinion  in  Descamps  says  what  you're  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  is  just  matching  the  facts  of  the  defendant's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction,  if  you  can  find  them  in  the  Shepard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

documents,  with  the  generic  Federal  offense?  So  it  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  case  where  there  is  no  statutory  alternative, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  you  said,  you're  just  kind  of  combing  through  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

documents,  and  the  court  in  Descamps  said,  don't  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  But  we're  not  doing  that  here.  We  don't  need  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

try  to  comb  through  the  facts.  All  we're  saying  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  statute,  like  many  burglary  statutes,  including  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example  the  Court  has  given,  covers  burglary  of  multiple 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

places,  right?  It  covers  burglary  of  buildings  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

boats  and  whatever  else.  And  you  just  need  to  see  which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

version  of  the  offense  was  this  person  convicted  of. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Was  it  the  burglary  of  a  house,  or  was  it  the  burglary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  boat?

And  so  you  look  at  the  conviction  documents 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  it,  and  you're  just  matching  the  offense  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defined  by  the  legislature  in  that  case  with  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generic  offense.  You're  not  trying  to  just  match 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Here's  what  the  statute 

  

 

 

 

 

doesn't  do.  The  statute  doesn't  make  it  necessary  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anybody  to  convict  you  of  any  single  one  of  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things.  And  one  of  the  points,  since  95  percent  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  end  in  pleas,  the  statute  doesn't  make  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary  for  you  to  plead  to  any  one  of  those  things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  whatever  information  is  floating  around 

 

 

 

 

 

in  these  opinions,  nobody  has  had  to  find  ­­ and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  has  not  had  to  plead  to  a  particular  offense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  one  of  those  alternative  means. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  that's  the  critical 

  

 

 

 

 

thing  under,  not  just  Descamps,  under  all  of  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements­based  decisions,  is  that  it  doesn't  matter  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  did.  It  doesn't  even  matter  that  you  say  you  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something.  What  we  have  to  be  able  to  say  is  that  under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  law,  you  absolutely  ­­ the  law  required  a  particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding  that  matches  the  generic  crime.  And  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  that  finding  is  not  there. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well,  I  think  that  there  are

two  different  ­­ I  think  it's  important  to  divide 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  the  two  different  parts  of  the  inquiry.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  two  questions,  right? 

 

 

 

            

The  first  is,  is  this  statute  divisible, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning  is  there  an  alternative  in  it  that  corresponds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  generic  burglary.  And  then  the  second  is,  was  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  actually  convicted  of  generic  burglary. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  your  question  gets  to  the  heart 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  we  need  to  make  sure  this  person  actually  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted  of  generic  burglary,  and  I  don't  think  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

need  to  do  a  separate  State  law  inquiry  to  answer  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  because  that's  really  what  the  modified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorical  approach  was  designed  to  do,  that  you  look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  Shepard  documents  and  see. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Can  we  tell  that  the  person  was  convicted  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  form  of  burglary  or  not?  And  you  do  ­­ you  look  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  modified  that  ­­ the  Shepard  documents  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

combination  with  the  statute  that  sets  out  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternatives. 

            

Just  to  give  you  ­­ just  to  give  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example,  right?  In  a  case  where  we  have  a  defendant  who 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  convicted  of  burglaring  ­­ burglaring  a  building, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

whether  by  guilty  plea  or  by  a  jury  trial,  the  only 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing  that's  ever  at  issue  is  a  ­­ is  a  building.  And 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  one,  I  think,  ever  asks  the  question,  well,  in  a

separate  different  hypothetical  case,  could  a  defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

who  was  charged  with  a  building  and  a  boat  be  convicted 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  they  didn't  find  if  it  was  the  building  or  find  if  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  one  thinks  about  it,  because  in  this  case  where  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  building  is  at  issue,  you  have  to  find  the  building 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  convict  it. 

 

 

              

I  mean,  it's  functioning  as  an  element  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  case.  Either  you  find  building  and  the  person  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted,  or  you  don't  find  building  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual,  as  a  matter  of  law,  can't  be  convicted. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  we  think  that  the  modified  categorical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach  resolves  and  answers  this  concern  that  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested  about  the  Court  ensuring  that  the  person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  was  convicted  of  generic  burglary.  And  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  approach  would  do,  even  though  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modified  categorical  approach  already  answered  that 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  would  try  to  ingraft  this  State  law  inquiry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

onto  divisibility.  And  it's  one  that,  you  know,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  opinions,  regardless  of  what  the  Court  said  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Descamps,  the  Court's  opinions  definitely  have  not  done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before. 

            

And  I  think  this  goes  back  to  Descamps  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  we  think  it  goes  our  way  is  that  the  Court  provided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  examples  in  Descamps,  and  it's  provided  them  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  cases  too.  And  those  examples  just  didn't  depend

on  parsing  State  law.  Those  examples  for  ­­ I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  most  paradigmatic  was  the  one  Justice  Breyer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested,  which  was  a  burglary  statute  that  covers 

   

 

 

 

 

 

buildings  and  houses,  that  covers  houses  and  boats, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

et  cetera. 

 

            

And  the  Court  has  said  on  at  least  five 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occasions,  I  mean,  Descamps  says  this  twice,  that  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  is  divisible,  and  it  ­­ it  just  would  be  odd  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  to  have  said  so  many  times  that  the  statute  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divisible  if,  in  fact,  it's  divisible  in  some  cases,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can  find  a  case  under  State  law,  but  it's  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divisible  in  other  cases,  if  you  can't  find  the  case

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  was  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  think  ­­

    

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  was  the  purpose  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

which  the  State  may  classify  this  as  a  means  rather  than 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  element?  What  was  the  context  in  which  the  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  that  determination? 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  This  question  only  arises 

  

 

 

 

 

when  a  person  has  been  charged  with  more  than  one  thing, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  a  burglary  of  a  building  and  a  boat,  for  example. 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

And  then  the  question  is,  if  this  goes  to  trial  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  ­­ and  it  goes  to  the  jury,  does  the  jury

boat,  or  can  the  ­­ can  six  members  find  house  and  six 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members  find  boat? 

 

 

            

And  so  this  ­­ this  question  actually  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  arise  very  much  under  State  law.  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

frankly,  I  was  kind  of  surprised  when  we  started  looking 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  this  case.  I  thought  I'd  be  able  to  look  at  all  50 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  and  find  one,  and  we  just  couldn't.  Between  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties  in  this  case,  I  think  we  found  cases  in  two 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States. 

            

And  I  think  another  example  that  ­­ that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

illustrates  how  this  doesn't  come  up  very  often  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drug  statutes.  I  think  this  Court  knows  from  other 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

prior  cases  that  some  State  drug  schedules  list  a  lot  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drugs  that  aren't  on  the  Federal  schedule.  So  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mellouli,  the  Court,  you  know,  had  to  figure  out,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  like  the  Federal  offense  or  is  this  not  like  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  offense?  And  the  Ninth  Circuit  justices  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked  at  this  or  judges  who  looked  at  this  said,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  it's  amazing  because  there  are  so  many  California 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drug  convictions,  and  there  is  just  no  law  in  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  drug  is  ­­ has  to  be  ­­ the  type  of  drug  has  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proven  unanimously  in  the  case  where  more  than  one  is  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue. 

            

And  when  you  talk  about,  you  know,  things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  that  where  the  Court  in  itself  has  assumed  that  the

drug  statutes  would  be  divisible,  and  we  don't  know  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer  for  a  case  like  California,  I  think  it  ­­ it 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  really  be  a  remarkable  change  to  what  the  Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  done  so  far  with  the  modified  categorical  approach. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  really  not  something  that  the  Court's  opinions  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  in  any  meaningful  way,  and  I  think  it  would  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unfortunate  when  the  Court  has  provided  examples  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  burglary  of  a  building  or  a  boat  and  the  Court's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

relied  on  those  examples.  Like  the  district  court  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  and  the  Court  of  Appeals  both  relied  on  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples  and  said,  this  is  the  exact  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Is  this  right?  Is  this 

  

  

 

 

 

 

like  ­­ like  even  with  the  Massachusetts  statute,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  has  never  come  up.  So  we  don't  really  know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  jury  has  to  find  in  the  case  of  a  houseboat. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  where  there's  a  word  in  the  statute, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

like  Descamps,  and  that  alternative  thing  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

houseboat,  da  da,  da,  is  not  in  the  statute,  but  rather 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  judge­made  interpretation  of  the  statute,  and  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  say  there  is  several  different  categories,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  virtually  impossible  for  a  court  under  those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  to  say  that  the  A,  B  and  C,  which  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divided  the  statute  into,  that  they're  elements.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  to  say  they're  means.  Do  you  think?

that  has  to  be  defined,  and  then  B  is  a  different 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

element  of  a  different  crime. 

   

 

 

            

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Is  that  ­­ is  that  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  no  idea  of  the  answer  to  that  question.  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  for  ways  of  simplifying  this  case.  And  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knew  the  answer  to  that  question,  it  would  help  me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well,  I  think  there  are  two 

   

  

 

 

 

 

answers  to  that  question.  The  first  is,  we  do  think  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  this  is  ­­ the  Court  left  this  question  open  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Descamps  about  the  extent  to  which  you  could  use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicial  decisions.  But  we  do  think  that  in  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  a  judge  could  or  a  court  could  define  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

crime.  I  mean,  they're  common  law  crimes  that  are  just 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defined  by  the  courts  and  that  those  could  be  divisible, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  that's  not  ­­ that  was  ­­ that  was  reserved  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Descamps.  That's  not  something  the  Court  had  to  answer. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  think  the  second  answer,  which 

   

 

 

 

 

hopefully  gets  to  your  question,  is,  you  know,  can  we  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either  rules  of  thumb  or  something  with  the  State  courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  can  try  to  figure  out  whether  something  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means  or  is  an  element  based  on  how  the  statute's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

written?  And  I  think  the  real  trouble  is  that  we  can't.

I  mean,  we've  looked  to  try  to  find  a  source 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  law  in  Massachusetts,  and  we've  also  looked  to  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ what  the  State  courts  have  told  us  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approaches  are,  and  this  is  in  our  brief.  But,  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example,  they  say,  you  know,  we  don't  have  bright­line 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules.  We  have  to  use  a  multi­factor  test.  We  set  out 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules,  but  they're  mind  bending  in  their  application. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  what  one  of  the  State  courts  said.  You  know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  not  a  predictable  area.  And  I  think  actually 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  Court  recommends  the  same  thing.  And  this  was  a  key 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

component  of  the  Court's  reasoning  in  Schad. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Schad  was  the  plurality  opinion  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking  if  ­­ are  there  constitutional  limitations  on  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  court  ­­ how  a  State  legislature  can  define  "means" 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

versus  "elements."  That  was  a  case  in  which  the  State 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature  had  said,  the  jury  doesn't  unanimously  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  agree  on  whether  murder  is  premeditated  murder  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

felony  murder.  And  the  defendant  came  in  and  said,  wow, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  you  really  say  that  the  jury  doesn't  have  to  agree 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  that?  There  should  be  some  constitutional  limit. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  one  critical  part  of  the  Court's  opinion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  that  there  aren't  any  bright­line  rules  about  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutes  a  means  or  what  constitutes  an  element. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

It's  a  matter  of  State  law,  and  there  is  wide  variation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  that.

So  as  much  as  we  have  looked,  we  don't  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  is  an  easy  answer  to  the  State  law  questions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  we  think,  you  know,  it's  really  asking  a  lot  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  Federal  courts  are  going  to  be  doing  those  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  first  instance.  I  mean,  these  are  questions  about 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  legislature's  intent,  and  you're  talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about,  you  know,  either  taking  those  questions  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away  from  the  State  courts  and  having  Federal  courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

start  to  do  them  on  a  routine  basis  or  ­­ we're  talking 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  what  one  judge  in  the  Ninth  Circuit  suggested, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  we're  never  going  to  find  out  these  answers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless  we  certify  these  questions  to  the  State  courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  if  you're  talking  about  sentencing  judges  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  every  day  and  have  to  use  the  modified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorical  approach,  you  know,  certifying  to  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts,  I  think  that  really  would  be,  you  know, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  extraordinary  intrusion. 

 

 

            

So,  you  know,  at  the  end  of  the  day,  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  think  that  the  Court  really  has  a  choice  in  this  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  the  approach  that  it's  used  for  25  years  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples  that  it's  given  and  Petitioner's  approach,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  think  that  Petitioner's  approach  really  would  up  end 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  modified  categorical  approach.  It  would  require  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law  question  to  be  answered  in  lots  of  cases.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  first  instance  by  Federal  judges,  we  think  that  it

would  create  a  lot  of  uncertainty.  The  ACCA,  as  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  said  in  Descamps,  is  supposed  to  function  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  on/off  switch,  and  it  certainly  wouldn't  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  Tell  me  what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

your  approach  is  that  you  think  is  our  approach? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Sure.  Yeah.  I'm  glad  to. 

  

  

  

 

 

 

            

That  a  statute  is  divisible  when  it  sets  out 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  alternatives,  one  of  which  corresponds  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  generic  offense,  that  you  don't  need  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undertake  a  State  law  inquiry  into  whether  something  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  means  or  element. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Which  is  to  say  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

elements  don't  matter,  and  that's  the  thing  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary  to  25  years  of  this  Court's  precedents,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  this  Court's  precedents  say  anything,  they  say  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  an  elements­based  inquiry,  which  means  that  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  decide  whether  something  is  an  element. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  I  ­­ and  that's  ­­ that's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

really,  I  think,  the  next  thing  I  was  ­­ I  was  hoping  to 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  which  is  that  the  reason  that  the  Court  has  talked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  elements  as  well  as  the  statutory  alternatives  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  wants  to  have  an  assurance  that  the  person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  was  convicted  of  generic  burglary.  And  the  way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  get  the  assurance  is  not  through  this  State  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry  into  whether  something  is  a  means  in  a

hypothetical  case.  You  get  the  assurance  through  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

review  of  the  Shepard  documents. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  think  that  the  courts  ­­ the  aim  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  courts  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  that  sounds  ­­ that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sounds  very  fact­based.  You  look  at  the  Shepard 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

documents  and  you  see  what  they  actually  did.  But  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  said  in  no  uncertain  terms  that  that's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  we  do. 

 

 

            

Much  as  ­­ much  as  some  people  think  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  an  intuitive  way  to  decide  these  questions,  much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  some  people  think  that  maybe  we  should  have  done  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25  years  ago,  but  we  don't  do  that.  We  don't  look  at, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's  look  at  the  documents  and  see  what  the  guy  did. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  say,  let's  look  at  the  documents  and  see  if  he  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily  convicted  of  something,  meaning  that  the  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  him  ­­ the  law  required  that  a  particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding  be  made  in  order  for  this  conviction  to  occur. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that's  where  your  approach  is  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  different  from  what  we've  ever  done,  because  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  that,  notwithstanding  that  the  law  did  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require  that  a  particular  finding  be  made,  we'll  take  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  the  documents  and  decide  that  that  finding  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made. 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well,  maybe  I  should  clarify

a  little  bit  and  say  that  we  think  that  we  look  to  see 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  law  required  that  this  finding  be  made  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reality  in  this  case,  not  hypothetically  in  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  case.  And  what  I  mean  by  that  is,  we  are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using  the  Shepard  documents  in  conjunction  with  the  fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  statute  lists  alternatives. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  what  we  are  doing  ­­ the  reason  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  not  looking  at  facts  is  because  the  alternatives 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show  that  the  legislature  has  defined  this  thing,  entry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  a  building,  as  part  of  the  offense,  as  a  way  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commit  the  offense. 

 

 

            

And  then  the  question,  the  whole  point  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  modified  categorical  approach,  is:  Can  we  know  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  person  was  convicted  of  that  thing  or  something  else 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  certainty  using  the  Shepard  documents? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  the  point  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

modified  categorical  approach  is  to  take  a  truly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

divisible  statute  ­­ in  other  words,  a  statute  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

three  separate  elements  in  it,  of  which  you  only  need  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  convicted  of  one  ­­ and  to  figure  out  whether  the  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  were  convicted  of,  the  one  particular  element, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matches  up  with  the  generic  offense. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It's  not  to  do  anything  more  than  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Descamps  is  quite  clear  on  this  ­­ on  this  matter,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  takes  ­­ it's  ­­ it's  three  separate  elements.  Do

you  ­­ does  what  you  were  convicted  of,  is  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  element  to  match  the  generic  offense? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  I  think  that  we're  in 

    

 

 

 

 

agreement  to  the  extent  that  we're  talking  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matching  the  statutory  alternatives  with  the  generic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  offense. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Except  that  you  say 

  

 

 

 

 

"statutory  alternatives,"  and  I  say  "elements,"  because 

   

 

 

 

 

for  25  years  we've  been  saying  "elements,"  and  that  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  do  this  inquiry  if  we're  in  the  world  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonelemental  facts. 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well,  frankly,  I  think  the 

   

  

 

 

 

Court  has  said  both  things.  You  know,  in  the  opinion  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Descamps,  there's  actually  a  part  of  the  Court's  opinion 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  equates  the  two.  It  says,  "Sentencing  courts  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  only  at  the  statutory  definitions";  i.e.  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Elements  are  what  defines 

  

 

 

 

 

the  crime. 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Right.  But  I  think  that  the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

­­ the  court  used  "elements"  to  mean  the  statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition,  because  the  alternatives  set  out  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  do  define  the  crime. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  ­­ I  take  your  point,  that  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

ultimate  concern  of  the  modified  categorical  approach  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ensuring  that  the  individual  actually  was  convicted  of

generic  burglary.  But  I  don't  think  that  we  need  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  to  the  separate  State  law  question  about  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happens  in  a  different  defendant's  case.  I  mean,  that's 

    

   

 

 

 

 

what  the  means  analysis  that  ­­ that  was  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg's  question,  right,  goes  to,  which  is:  What

out,  this  is  a  form  of  burglary,  and  the  Court  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talked  about  different  version  of  the  offense,  a  version 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  offense  is  burglary  of  a  building,  and  so  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature  has  defined  that  as  an  offense.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  is:  Did  the  defendant  ­­ was  he  convicted  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  offense? 

 

              

I  think  ­­ and  this,  I  think,  goes  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  part  of  your  question,  which  is,  you're  asking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  how  is  that  any  different  from  fact­finding, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  That's  just  fact­finding.  And  I  think  the  Court 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

answered  that  question  in  Descamps  when  it  gave  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example  of  a  statute  that  doesn't  have  the  alternatives, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  the  weapons  one,  as  opposed  to  a  statute  that  does 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  the  alternatives.  Because  when  the  statute  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  the  alternatives,  you  don't  have  an  option  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified  by  the  legislature  as  part  of  the  definition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  crime  that  you're  trying  to  match  to  the  Federal

offense. 

            

You're  not  just  ­­ you're  not  looking  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that  the  legislature  has  defined  and  saying, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  did  the  Shepard  documents  show  that  or  do  they  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show  that?  What  you're  doing  is,  there's  ­­ there's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hole  in  the  statute,  right?  It  doesn't  tell  you,  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example,  in  Descamps,  the  different  types  of  entries. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  you're  just  filling  in  that  hole  with  facts.  You're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  looking  at,  what  are  the  facts  of  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  did?  Can  I  clean  them  from  the  Shepard 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

documents?  And  then  you're  trying  to  match  them  up  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  generic  offense. 

 

 

 

            

And  at  that  point,  you  know,  the  opinion  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Descamps  says,  you  know,  it's  not  a  categorical  approach 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

anymore.  The  Ninth  Circuit  ­­ one  judge  in  the  Ninth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit,  and  the  court  called  it  a  modified  factual 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach  at  that  point,  right,  because  you're  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  match  the  facts  of  what  the  defendant  did. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's  no  statutory  basis  for  calling  this  building  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  type  of  burglary,  you  know,  burglary. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  here  we  have  that  statutory  basis.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  those  statutory  alternatives.  And  the  Court  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  on  so  many  different  occasions,  and  the  lower 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  have  relied  on  it,  that  it's  the  presence  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  or  alternatives  that  are  critical  because  when

you  have  that  ­­ those  in  combination  with  the  Shepard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

documents,  you  can  make  the  decision  of  whether  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  phrase  was  the  basis  for  the  conviction, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  person  was  convicted  of  that  version  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burglary  or  not. 

 

 

            

But  when  you  don't  have  that  statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phrase  there  ­­ the  Court  said  this  on  page  2287  of  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion  in  Descamps  ­­ you're  just  asking  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  actually  did.  And  then  once  you're  doing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  when  you're  not  looking  at  the  way  the  legislature 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  defined  the  crime,  there's  really  no  stopping  point, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  And  I  think  that  was  the  ­­ the  ­­ one  of  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern  of  the  Court's  opinion  in  Descamps,  is  that  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  have  been  convicted  of  something  that  has  nothing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  with  burglary,  and  we'll  just  try  to  look  through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  facts  in  the  Shepard  documents  and  see  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  really  burglary.  The  Court  said  don't  do  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  here,  the  legislature  has  defined  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense  so  that  it  ­­ the  ­­ all  components  of  generic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burglary  are  in  the  offense.  And  I  understand  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  instinct,  to  think,  well,  we  said  "elements," 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  elements  means  we  have  to  make  sure  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  ­­ that  this  actually  was  proven.  But  we  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  modified  categorical  approach  itself,  by  taking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  and  then  looking  at  the  Shepard  documents,

does  that,  that  it  really  satisfies  the  concern. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  frankly,  that's  ­­ that  ­­ that  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

message  that  we  got.  And  of  course,  the  Court  knows 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

best  what  its  opinion  in  Descamps  meant,  but  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  message  we  got  from  the  end  of  footnote  2  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Descamps,  which  says,  you  know,  whether  something  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means  or  elements,  you  shouldn't  parse  State  law.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  just  look  to  the  Shepard  documents.  And  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  we're  saying,  is  just  to  look  to  the  Shepard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

documents,  and  if  something  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  the  end  of  footnote  2 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  in  some  cases  you  won't  need  to  parse  State  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  you  can  figure  it  out  from  the  Shepard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

documents,  because  Shepard  documents  are  a  clue  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

whether  something  is  a  means  or  an  element. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  in  the  situation  in  which  State  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not,  as  it  is  in  this  case,  utterly  clear  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject,  you  won't  have  to  go  1,000  layers  down,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Descamps  ­­ the  ­­ the  Shepard  documents  will  tell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you,  because  of  the  way  the  prosecutor  has  charged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something,  looks  like  this  is  just  a  means,  or  looks 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  this  is  really  an  element. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well,  I  mean,  we  don't  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you  need  to  do  the  State  law  inquiry  in  the  first  place, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  Shepard  documents  will  tell  you  that  the

person  actually  was  convicted  of  that.  And  I  just  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  question  about  whether  it  was  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  why  wouldn't  you  look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  State  law?  You  have  a  State  law  that  says  exactly 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  is  not  an  element.  Why  wouldn't  you  just  take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that? 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Because  ­­ because  it  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

matter  that  that  case  is  about  what  would  happen  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  defendant  in  a  case  where  more  than  one  thing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  charged.  And  it  doesn't  matter  for  our  purposes  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happens  in  that  hypothetical  case  because  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual,  and  the  individuals  where  we're  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  the  Shepard  documents  to  actually  enhance,  have  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  thing  charged,  right?  Like,  it's  burglary  of  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

building,  and  burglary  of  a  building  is  generic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

burglary,  and  there's  no  dispute  that  the  ­­ the  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  burglary  of  a  building,  and  this  is  burglary  of  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

building,  and  it  would  be  odd  to  give  that  defendant  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pass  because  ­­

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  The  only  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Why  is  it 

  

 

 

 

conviction­based  not  ­­ rather  than  conduct­based?  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

conviction­based,  it's  okay;  conduct­based  isn't. 

 

 

 

 

Conduct  charge  is  burgling  a  house.

conviction­based,  the  Court  said  in  Taylor,  because  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  have  uniformity,  right?  Congress  said  burglary, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  you  want  to  make  sure  that  everyone  who's  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted  of  the  same  type  of  offense  actually  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treated  the  same. 

 

 

            

And  I  think  that  the  problem  with 

   

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  approach  is  that  you  could  have  defendants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted  in  two  states  that  have  the  exact  same  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  their  Shepard  documents  could  look  exactly  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same,  and  then  this  answer  might  turn  on  whether  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  find  some  sort  of  State  law  that  would  say  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  happen  in  a  different  case  where  defendant  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

charged  with  more  than  one  thing. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  we  think  that  the  Court's  approach  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  ­­ come  from  this  concern  about  uniformity.

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Just  ­­ just  one  other  point, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is:  I  think  it's  really  telling  that  the  reason 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Court  adopted  ­­ and  let's  go  back  to  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  started,  right?  It's:  What  does  burglary  mean 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  ACCA?  And  the  Court  adopted  the  burglary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  it  did,  which  is  generic  burglary,  because  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

encompassed  the  definitions  in  most  States.  The  Court

wanted  to  reach  the  common  denominator  in  most  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  effect  of  Petitioner's  position,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  we  all  agree,  is  that  it  would  not  ­­ the  modified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorical  approach  would  not  reach  burglary  in  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most  States;  that  the  ACCA  would  have  a  very  limited 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application  at  best  under  Petitioner's  approach. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  of  course,  you  know  the  modified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorical  approach  is  used  in  so  many  different  areas, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  so  these  problems  with  parsing  State  law,  et  cetera, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  just  be  multiplied  through  all  of  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  statutes  in  which  the  Court  has  used  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modified  categorical  approach. 

 

 

            

So  we  really  think  that  Petitioner  is  ­­ is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  what,  you  know,  was  the  outlier  approach  in  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Descamps,  which  is  trying  to  change,  you  know,  20­plus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years  of  settled  law  and  start  having  this  new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional  inquiry.  We  just  think  you  shouldn't  do  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Here  you  have  a  State 

   

  

 

 

 

statute  that  specifically  tells  you  that  this  is  not  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element  of  the  offense.  And  you  were  saying  why  it  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  thought  that  you  could  ignore  that  ­­ excuse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me,  not  a  State  statute,  but  a  State  judicial  opinion  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  it  was  that  you  could  ignore  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  only  reason  you  could  ignore  that  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicial  opinion  is  because  if  you  don't  care  it's  an

element.  And  that's  very  much  against  what  we've  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  since  Taylor. 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Could  I  respond? 

   

  

 

              

I  ­­ I  don't  think  that's  true.  The  reason 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  you  don't  care  is  because  you  can  tell  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shepard  documents  that  the  individual  in  this  case,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  some  similar  cases,  actually  was  convicted  of  generic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burglary. 

            

And  that  defendant  doesn't  care  whether  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  means  or  an  element,  because  it  had  to  be  proven  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  case  for  him  to  get  convicted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  think  the  judgment  should  be  affirmed.

this  Court's  statement  in  Taylor  that  the  categorical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach  turns  on  "the  elements  of  the  statute  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction."  Or  as  the  Court  put  it  in  Moncrieffe, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"what  facts  are  necessarily  established  by  a  conviction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  State  offense." 

 

 

 

            

It's  been  very  clear  from  my  colleague's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  that  the  government  is  interested  in  what

Mr.  Mathis  did,  and  that  is  not  what  ACCA  looks  to.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  the  categorical  approach.  The  government  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

offered  no  reason  of  principle  to  distinguish  this  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  Mr.  Descamps'  case.  The  only  distinction  between 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  two  cases  is  that  Iowa  statute  uses  the  word  "or" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  a  disjunctive  list,  and  California  does  it  by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

silence  by  simply  using  the  word  "enters"  without  adding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"lawfully"  or  "unlawfully." 

 

 

            

There  is  no  reason  to  treat  those  situations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently,  given  that  both  California,  through 

 

 

 

 

 

silence,  and  Iowa,  through  an  express  list,  are  setting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  only  the  means  of  commission.  And  they  have  nothing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  with  what  Taylor  calls  the  focus  of  the  ­­ of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modified  and  the  traditional  categorical  approach,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  elements  of  the  statute  of  conviction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  drug  statutes  in  California  are  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example  of  the  workability  of  the  position  that  we  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Ninth  Circuit  and  the  Fourth  Circuit  have  set  out. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  have  ­­ there  have  been  many  decisions.  We  cite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  in  our  reply  brief,  finding  that  the  drug  statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  indeed  divisible  by  drug  type,  and  so  the  modified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorical  approach  does  apply. 

 

 

 

            

There  are  numerous  other  decisions  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modified  categorical  approach  will  continue  to  apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  obviously  can  also,  if  they  want  their

convictions  to  qualify  as  ACCA  predicates,  can  make  sure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  have  a  generic  offense  where  the  conviction  clearly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires  proof  of  generic  burglary.  The  government's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

position  will  ­­ will  cause  a  significant 

   

 

 

 

 

Sixth  Amendment  problem  because  sentence  enhancements 

 

 

 

 

 

are  going  to  be  based  on  something  beyond  the  mere  fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  conviction.  It  would  require  this  Court  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

consider  whether  to  expand  the  Almendarez­Torres 

 

 

 

 

 

exception. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  You're  seriously  arguing 

  

 

 

 

that  ­­ you're  seriously  arguing  that  all  of  the  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  or  should  go  back  and  reformulate  their  burglary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes  so  as  ­­

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  No,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  ­­ to  make  the  conviction? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

Well,  that's  what  you  just  said.  So  if  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  them  to  count  as  ACCA  predicates,  no  problem.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  just  go  back  and  change  their  burglary  statutes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  As  ­­ as  some  States  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

generic  burglary  statutes  that  do  require  proof  of  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  elements  of  generic  burglary,  if  Congress  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dissatisfied  with  the  reach  of  ACCA,  it  can  amend  ACCA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ACCA  used  to  have  a  definition  of  burglary  in  it  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1984.  It  said  burglary  involves  a  building.  Congress 

   

  

  

 

 

 

could  very  easily  say,  you  know  what?  That  was  too

narrow.  We're  going  to  overrule  that  aspect  of  Taylor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  we'll  say  burglary,  for  purposes  of  ACCA,  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include  boats  and  houses. 

 

 

 

            

Nothing  prevents  themselves  from  doing  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

They  could  amend  ACCA  so  it  focuses  on  conduct  instead 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  convictions.  There  have  been  many  calls  for  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  that.  But  for  25  years  ­­ and  stare  decisis  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly  important  ­­ in  this  statutory  area, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  has  let  this  Court  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  do  you  make  of  the  fact 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  until  this  case,  the  Court  has  never  analyzed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  something  was  an  element  or  a  means? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  The  ­­ the  same  point  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  made  in  Descamps.  And  Descamps 

  

 

 

 

 

 

specifically  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  you  said  this  has  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

established  for  25  years  and  the  Court  has  used  the  term 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element,  element,  element,  but  has  it  ever  before  gone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  the  question  of  whether  what  it  was  talking  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  that  particular  case  was  in  the  technical  sense, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either  an  element  or  a  means? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLEMING:  May  I  respond,  Mr.  Chief 

   

  

 

 

 

Justice? 

            

The  issue  did  not  come  up  before  Descamps. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  as  the  previous  cases  came  to  the  Court,  the  issue

either  did  not  matter  or  it  was  not  disputed.  And  it  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  uncommon  for  this  Court  to  take  as  assumed  issues 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  parties  are  not  disputing.  In  Descamps,  it  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disputed;  in  this  case,  it  is  disputed.  And  for  it  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  resolved  consistently  with  what  the  Court  has  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  ­­ for  25  years,  it's  important  that  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintain  the  focus  on  the  elements  and  not  on  the  means. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Otherwise,  Descamps  would  have  come  out  the  wrong  way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  submit  it  came  out  the  right  way,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  should  come  out  the  same  way.  We  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respectfully  submit  the  judgment  should  be  reversed  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case  remanded  so  Mr.  Mathis  can  be  resentenced 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  regard  to  ACCA. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

The  case  is  submitted. 

 

 

 

            

(Whereupon,  at  11:09  a.m.,  the  case  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above­entitled  matter  was  submitted.)
