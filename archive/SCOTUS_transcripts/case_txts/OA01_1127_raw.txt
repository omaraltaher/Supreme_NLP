CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 01-1127, Bill Lockyer v. Leandro Andrade.


Mr. Danzig.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS P. DANZIG


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. DANZIG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The Ninth Circuit's grant of habeas relief in


this case should be reversed for two reasons.  First, the


court erred in setting aside the State court judgment


because it did not properly apply the principles of habeas


corpus review to cases that are considered under the


AEDPA. 


As confirmed in two concurring opinions issued by 

this Court yesterday, Early v. Hill and Woodford v.


Visciotti, this case is resolvable on AEDPA grounds and


therefore the Court need not address the constitutional


issues in this case.


In any event, independent of the habeas corpus


aspects of this case, the sentence in this case is not


grossly disproportionate and therefore does not violate


this -- the Eighth Amendment.


Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2254(d), a Federal court


may not grant habeas relief unless the State court

determination on the merits was either contrary to, or


involved an unreasonable application of this Court's clear


controlling precedent.  In this case, the Ninth Circuit


held that the State court determination involved an


unreasonable application.  Despite the Ninth --


QUESTION:  Is this the case in which the Ninth


Circuit first decided for itself the constitutional


question, and then decided whether the State court had


reasonably applied it?


MR. DANZIG:  Yes, that is correct, Your Honor.


Despite the Ninth Circuit's holding in this


case, a careful analysis of the Ninth Circuit's opinion


here reveals that although they reversed, or granted


habeas relief, reversing the district court on


unreasonable application grounds, the fact of the matter 

is this, all of the reasoning lends itself to a contrary-


to analysis rather than an unreasonable application, and


opposing, or the respondent has, in fact briefed the


contrary-to prong of the 2254 as well as the unreasonable


application prong.


For example, the -- and for the most part the


circuit court held that holding was based on the


conclusion that the State court merits determination erred


because it did not consider the three-case triumvirate of


Rummel, Solem, and Harmelin, and faulted the State court

for failing to apply, or essentially disregarding Solem,


but as Early v. Packer made clear yesterday, on -- when we


are talking about a contrary-to application, it's not


necessary for the State court to have cited this Court's


controlling authority, and it's not even necessary for the


Court to be aware of it, and in fact the State court in


this case cited, or provided what we call a Lynch analysis


under California law, which incorporated virtually every


aspect of the Solem analysis that the State court said --


pardon me, that the Ninth Circuit said the State court


disregarded.


So on that basis alone, and I think Early


makes -- the per curiam opinion in Early makes clear that


that's okay if you have an application of State law, or


you rely on State law that provides even greater depth of 

analysis than the Federal rule would require, and that's


what happened here.  The Lynch analysis requires what


would be comparable to the second and third prongs under


the Solem analysis, which, following Harmelin, are deemed


no longer required unless -- and serve only to validate an


initial inference on the first prong, so this was clearly


not a contrary-to case.  The court -- the State court --


QUESTION:  May I just ask on that point, do you


think there was not even the need to look at the second or


third elements of the test because there is not even a

basis for saying this sentence was grossly


disproportionate?


MR. DANZIG:  Yes, Justice Stevens, I agree with


that.  I think that there is no inference --


QUESTION:  In other words, the case could be


decided on the ground that there's -- an inference of


gross disproportionality should not be drawn in this case?


MR. DANZIG:  That's correct, Your Honor, I do


agree with that, and on the Eighth Amendment, the pure


Eighth Amendment question, that there was no inference of


gross disproportionality here, and therefore the second


and third prongs were not required, but the State court


did, in fact, apply a second and third prong analysis, and


that leads into the only portion of the Ninth Circuit's


opinion that really addresses the reasonableness of the 

State court's decision.


The Ninth Circuit disposed of the unreasonable


application analysis in a footnote, and it basically said


that the State court's reliance on State law is irrelevant


because it didn't cite Federal law, and I think that the


decision yesterday in Early v. Hill kind of renders that


particular portion of the analysis --


QUESTION:  Would you just refresh my


recollection on the facts of this case, because the prior


argument, the argument was made that violence was the

critical matter in the prior conviction.  Were there


violence in the earlier, in the priors in this case?


MR. DANZIG:  The record does not indicate


whether there were or not, Your Honor.  The priors that


were the predicate for the three strikes sentence were


both residential burglaries, and there -- we have no facts


concerning them in the record, but the gravamen, as we all


know, of a residential burglary is the potential for


danger and violence that comes from invading someone's


home, and also subsequent to this case being decided quite


recently, the California legislature amended its statute


and now includes a residential burglary where the house is


occupied in its articulation of violent felonies.  It's no


longer just confined to the serious felony --


QUESTION: 


Do you agree with your colleague in 

the prior case that violence is a critical element in the


priors or not?


MR. DANZIG:  No, I do not, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. DANZIG:  Not to be overly inconsistent


between our mutual arguments, but I think this Court has


held that the presence or absence of violence does not


necessarily dictate the proportionality analysis.  There


may be circumstances where a crime is of sufficient


gravity that doesn't involve violence, such that extremely

long sentences are appropriate.


QUESTION:  I agree on the merits that we can't


convert this Court into a sentencing commission, but it's


also true, I guess, that there must be some way of


deciding when a State has gone too far, and I don't know


any way that's other than highly subjective, except to


look at data that would show what happened in the past,


but if you take that, how do you give the State the right


to become harsher in the future?


Now, you're going to say, well, it has that


right, and of course it does to a degree, but is there a


way to say that it has to meet some burden, or that it has


to show something if it's going to change dramatically


what was the consensus in the past --


MR. DANZIG: 


I don't think that --

QUESTION:  -- in a harsh direction?


MR. DANZIG:  I don't think that the fact that


it's going to change dramatically is determinative or


dispositive, but I do think, Justice Breyer, that there


are a couple of responses to that question.


First of all, turning back to one of the


questions Justice Souter asked in the prior argument, I


believe that when the State is going to define certain


felonies as being sufficiently serious to trigger the


imposition of the three strikes, or three strikes approach


8

or harsher sentencing, I think a rational basis -- the


courts may be required to engage in a heightened scrutiny


analysis to determine whether there's a rational basis for


that in the first place.


But I think that's distinct from any


proportionality analysis, and the problem with the


hypothetical that you pose is that, while you are correct


that there is a subjective prong to this, the question is,


where does that subjectivity belong?  Is it within the


particular personal subjective views of the reviewing


court, or is it within the confines of the subjective


views as reflect -- that the legislature represents of the


subjective views of the citizenry?


QUESTION:  It has to be the latter, but still


there has to be a way of deciding when they go too far. 

MR. DANZIG:  In other words --


QUESTION:  And that's what I'm looking for, and


I look to -- you know, what I've said before as a way of


isolating the problem, and then -- and I think here you


might say that on the merits of your case, it'll -- you'd


be hard-pressed to find many examples outside of the three


strikes laws where there were such sentences given for


such things.


MR. DANZIG:  I --


QUESTION:  I think so.  I mean, there are a

handful in the SG's brief, that's true.


MR. DANZIG:  I understand your question, Justice


Breyer, to basically go to what is grossly


disproportionate.


QUESTION:  That's right.


MR. DANZIG:  And the Court, this Court has not


defined that term, or given us any clear guidelines, but


we do know that by the very nature, grossly


disproportionate implies an extreme situation, and --


QUESTION:  Suppose we were to find -- and


there's argument in this about the briefs both ways, but


suppose we were to conclude that this has likely been a


most effective scheme, that it's reduced the crime rate in


the State of California.  The prisoners talk about it all


the time.  They know what three strikes means.  It's a


simple thing that they can understand, and that it works.


If we made that finding, and there -- your


adversaries will disagree that that's true, but if we made


that finding, does that bear on whether the sentence is


disproportionate?


MR. DANZIG:  Not really, because I suppose -- I


mean, in an extreme example, Justice Kennedy, we could


lock up everybody for extremely long periods of time, and


it could still go past that point of proportion, of gross


disproportionality.  I think there has to be a more clear

definition than simply the impact of the sentencing


statute, and --


QUESTION:  Well, what's your limiting principle


here?


MR. DANZIG:  The limiting --


QUESTION:  Is there one?


MR. DANZIG:  The limiting principle we offer is,


or we urge upon the Court is the one that's been mentioned


in a -- or has been used as related to an example


mentioned in a couple of the Court's opinions, when they


refer to lifetime for parking, and the reasonable mean --


understanding of that example is often cited as a life


sentence for a first-time parking --


QUESTION:  But that --


QUESTION: 


Excuse me, what is your limiting 

principle?  I haven't heard it.


MR. DANZIG:  The limiting principle would be


that those are, that sentences are grossly


disproportionate when they are not reasonably susceptible


to debate amongst reasonable minds.


QUESTION:  But --


QUESTION:  You seem to be --


QUESTION:  -- in this particular case it's 50


years for stealing some tapes, right?


MR. DANZIG:  No, Your Honor, I -- Justice

Stevens, I disagree with that.  It is not a 50-year


sentence for stealing tapes, it is two 25-years-to-life


sentences.


QUESTION:  But they're consecutive.


MR. DANZIG:  They are consecutive.


QUESTION:  Well, why isn't that 50?


(Laughter.)


MR. DANZIG:  Because I think it's important to


bear in mind two things in reaching that conclusion. 


First of all, they represent independent episodes of


criminal behavior.  They are not connected.  They may have


the impact of resulting in a 50-year sentence, but it --


but they do reflect the fact that the -- Mr. Andrade in


this case demonstrated beyond any question that he is a


habitual offender. 


He was arrested and either cited and 

released, or booked and released and 2 weeks later he went


right back out and did the same thing.


Not only that, he told the probation officer


that he stole the tapes in order to sell them to buy


heroin, not as gifts for his children, but to buy heroin


with.  He also indicated he was a hopeless heroin addict,


and that he always does something stupid when released


from prison, and I think the reasonable inference of what


he meant was, he always goes out and recommits crimes, so


I think that's part of why it's not a 50-year --

21

22

23

24

25

 QUESTION:  Well, is he being punished because


he's a heroin addict or because he stole these tapes?


MR. DANZIG:  He's being punished because of his,


of a combination of his record of recidivism and his -- or


his habitual criminal behavior.


The other reason I think it's important to make


the distinction between the two 25-to-life sentences


versus characterizing it as 50-to-life for receiving, or


for stealing some tapes is because of the ameliorative


effects of the California sentencing structure.


QUESTION:  But in light of the answer that you


gave to my question, and then to Justice O'Connor's about


what is the standard, I'm now at somewhat a loss as to how


to defend your statute under the incapacitation and


deterrence theory. 


That doesn't bear on proportionality? 

That's quite a surprising answer to me.  I thought the


whole point of this statute was that we wanted something


that works.


MR. DANZIG:  And I agree, Your Honor, and if I


misstated that, I did not mean to.  I think that the --


QUESTION:  Then proportionality has to be judged


against the legislative objective, I should think.


MR. DANZIG:  Absolutely, Justice Kennedy.


QUESTION:  Well, then, then the question that I


put to you does bear on proportionality.  The premise I

put to you does bear on proportionality, that we need a


system that's simple but works, that reduces crime in the


State, and you told me, oh, well, that means we could lock


up everything, everybody so you can't use that.


MR. DANZIG:  No, I did not mean --


QUESTION:  But we don't lock up everybody. 


That's not the three strikes statute.


MR. DANZIG:  I did not mean to imply that it


doesn't bear on proportionality, I certainly believe that


it does.  I simply said that standing alone, without any


further consideration, that would also justify an extreme


example, but yes, I do believe that it does bear on


proportionality in light of the legislative purpose of the


statute, but in measuring that legislative purpose, I do


believe that what's reasonable -- sentences, evaluating 

sentences on whether they are reasonably susceptible to


debate also provides a framework or a lens with which to


look, to apply that analysis.


QUESTION:  Mr. Danzig --


QUESTION:  Okay, but if we do that --


QUESTION:  -- if we can just back up, I think


you started out by urging that we not do what the Ninth


Circuit did in terms of the order.  It first made a ruling


that there was a violation of the Eighth Amendment, and


then it determined whether we had clearly established law.

 MR. DANZIG:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  You are urging that we not reach any


ultimate decision on the Eighth Amendment question, but


simply decide that however you come out on that, the --


there was no violation of clearly established Federal law.


MR. DANZIG:  Not exactly, Justice Ginsburg.  We


are saying that the case is disposable on AEDPA grounds,


but if the Court found that the State court merits


determination was unreasonable, it necessarily would have


to turn to the Eighth Amendment issue.


QUESTION:  Yes, but which -- the Ninth Circuit


said it's appropriate in these cases to decide the Eighth


Amendment question first.  What is your view on that? 


Should we follow in line with what the Ninth Circuit did,


or should we say the proper thing to do is to find out 

whether it's an unreasonable interpretation of clearly


established Federal law, and if it isn't, that's the end


of it?


MR. DANZIG:  The latter, Justice Ginsburg.  The


methodology that the Ninth Circuit has developed as


articulated in Van Tran is inconsistent with the very


spirit of the AEDPA.


QUESTION:  Well, it's also inconsistent with our


idea that we try to avoid constitutional questions if we


can, isn't it?

25

 MR. DANZIG:  Yes, it is, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  But you said earlier that you thought


the proper analysis was contrary to, rather than


unreasonable application, and how can you decide whether


something's contrary to a rule unless you know what the


rule is?


MR. DANZIG:  I would like to clarify that,


Justice Stevens.  I didn't say that the proper analysis in


this case was contrary to.  I said that the Ninth Circuit


purported to reach an unreasonable application prong, but


when you look at their reasoning, it actually is a


contrary-to argument that they made, and I meant to say


that when -- if -- to the extent that it is a contrary-to


decision that they made, no matter the fact that they


ultimately labeled it unreasonable application, this 

Court's per curiam decision yesterday in Early v. Packer


has essentially resolved that question, because of what


they base their decision on.


QUESTION:  I'm not sure you've answered my


question.  It seems to me that we have to decide whether


or not -- regardless of what the Ninth Circuit did, I


think one of the things we have to decide is whether or


not the sentence in this case is contrary to a Federal


rule, and I don't know how we can decide that without


knowing what the Federal rule is, and I was asking for

your advice on that point.


MR. DANZIG:  The Federal rule I think is


articulated in Harmelin, and that is that grossly


disproportionate sentences violate the Eighth Amendment.


QUESTION:  But we have to identify that as the


Federal rule before we go on to decide whether it's


contrary to, I think.  Is that -- would you agree with


that?


MR. DANZIG:  Yes.  You're -- I would.


QUESTION:  That seems just the opposite of what


you responded to me earlier, that we don't have to decide


the Eighth Amendment question, that we can just decide


whatever the answer to that is, this was not off the


chart.


MR. DANZIG: 


I don't think that we have to --

that it's necessary to resolve the Eighth Amendment


question, but it may be necessary to know what the rule is


before we know whether the State court selected


the right rule or not --


QUESTION:  But if we know what the rule is --


QUESTION:  Well, precisely we have to ask


whether there is a Federal rule.  We don't have to know


what it is.  The question is, is there a clearly


pronounced Federal rule.


MR. DANZIG:  Correct.

 QUESTION:  And the answer to that may well be


no.


MR. DANZIG:  In many circumstances it may be.


QUESTION:  In which case we have no occasion to


pronounce on what the Federal rule is.


MR. DANZIG:  Correct.


QUESTION:  All we have to say is that there is


no clearly enunciated Federal rule here.


QUESTION:  Can I go back for a second to the


merits of this?


MR. DANZIG:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Because I -- we all have -- my


problem that I'm struggling with is, is there an objective


standard.  You're absolutely right about what the problem


is I'm having, and I tend to -- do look to this empirical 

stuff as a way of finding an objective standard, and if


here the empirical part suggests this is way out of line,


I'm now faced with the question, well, can't the State


make a harsher system if it has a reason for doing it, and


I think the answer to that question must be yes.


But then -- then I'd ask, very well, doesn't the


State have to come up with some reason that's persuasive


in this case that it makes a difference to extend the


three-strike thing with this kind of thing in mind, this


kind of case in mind, to the wobblers?

 I mean, is there some punitive purpose in terms


of incapacitation that's gained, of a significant kind, by


increasing the wobbler sentences by factors of, you know,


multiples of four or five or 10 or something, over what


they would have been before when committed by serious


criminals, and I guess the answer to that is, there's no


indication, or is there?


MR. DANZIG:  The -- I think you can't -- that


begs the question.  It cannot disassociate the wobbler


offense that's at issue in this particular case from the


recidivism.


QUESTION:  No, no, I'm not.  I'm only


considering the class of recidivists, and I'm saying --


let's call them recidivist plus wobbler, all right.  That


group of people, recidivist plus wobbler, is getting an 

enormous increase in sentence over what was or is any


other place, on average, and therefore I think, gee, maybe


this is really grossly disproportionate.


MR. DANZIG:  But it's a certain class of


recidivists.  It's not just recidivists in general.  It is


that class --


QUESTION:  No, that's right.


MR. DANZIG:  -- that's already demonstrated that


they are willing to commit the most serious and violent --


QUESTION:  That's right.

 MR. DANZIG:  -- potentially violent types of


crimes, and has now indicated that they are also unwilling


to remain law-abiding, and there comes a point at which


the State has a right to say, enough is enough.


QUESTION:  So jay-walking?


MR. DANZIG:  Well, I think that would probably


return to the rational basis, the -- analysis.


QUESTION:  Fine.  If jay-walking's not there,


and this is, the wobblers, why can the wobblers be there,


but not the jay-walkers?  That's what I'm -- that's what


I'm thinking about here.


MR. DANZIG:  There is a distinction between the


wobblers and the jay-walking.  There's the obvious


distinction that there's a longstanding historical


tradition between felonies and misdemeanors and 

infractions.  The infractions, the jay-walking doesn't


even present, for the most part, a property or personal


safety issue.


QUESTION:  Well, does California fine people for


jay-walking?


MR. DANZIG:  There is, I believe, a code on the


books that makes it an offense, or an infraction.


QUESTION:  Is it enforced at all?


MR. DANZIG:  I do not know the answer to that,


Your Honor.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Danzig --


QUESTION:  I don't understand why a parking


offense wouldn't qualify if a man is on parole, and any


breach of parole is always emphasized as being


particularly bad, and one of the things he can't do is


engage in parking in no-parking zones, and if he did that


in breach of a parole, and he had nine prior cases, I


don't know why you couldn't impose your three-strike


penalty on the overtime parker.


MR. DANZIG:  The -- if the California


legislature chose --


QUESTION:  It says, any violation -- it put it


in as a wobbler, any violation of a parole condition by a


person who's on parole.


MR. DANZIG: 


That is not a wobbler offense. 

It's a parole revocation issue.


QUESTION:  It would not, because the other, in


the other case they emphasized the fact he'd been on


parole a number of times, what -- his violations were


parole violations.  Is the fact that whether or not it's a


parole violation relevant to our inquiry at all?


MR. DANZIG:  It is in the sense that the Court


has held that when doing a proportionality analysis, his


entire criminal picture can be taken into consideration. 


We're not -- the Court is not required to confine the

analysis only to the predicate and triggering offenses, so


in that sense it does -- it is an indication of continued


habitual criminality and an unwillingness to remain


law-abiding.


QUESTION:  I think you're saying --


QUESTION:  Mr. Danzig, there is something


missing in this case that was present in the other.  That


is, the judge in the -- Mr. Ewing's case was asked to


reduce the wobbler to a misdemeanor, was asked to strike a


strike and she said no, it's not within the spirit of the


three-strikes law.


Here, the California Court of Appeals seemed


almost nonplussed that there had not been such requests


timely made to the trial judge, and twice the court of


appeal said it would still be open to Mr. Andrade to 

pursue on State habeas both pleas, that is, the wobbler


should be reduced to a misdemeanor, a strike should be


out.  Do you agree that that avenue of relief is open to


Mr. Andrade?


MR. DANZIG:  Yes, but it requires an


explanation, Your Honor.  He -- Mr. Andrade did, in fact,


ask the court for misdemeanor treatment under California


Penal Code section 17(b).


QUESTION:  He didn't repeat it at the time of


sentencing.

 MR. DANZIG:  No, he did not, Your Honor, but


there is an odd chronological history here that's just --


that distinguishes this case.


The California Court of Appeal, or -- pardon me. 


The judgment came down in this case a few weeks before the


California Supreme Court issued its decision in Romero


granting trial courts the discretion to dismiss priors, so


in the California Court of Appeals decision, they noted


that that Romero decision had said that if you got a


record that you can't determine whether the sentencing


judge knew whether he had or not -- he or she had


discretion to dismiss the strikes, then the proper basis


for addressing that is through State habeas.


Mr. Andrade then filed a petition for review to


the California supreme court which was denied, and without 

prejudice to file a State habeas corpus petition based on


Romero, which he did.  He went back to State court, filed


a habeas corpus petition -- pardon me.  He did not file a


State habeas corpus petition -- pardon me.  He did file a


State habeas corpus petition which was entertained by the


same sentencing court that had sentenced him, and that


court said that it did not find that he was appropriate


candidate for dismissing the strikes.


Curiously, though, that court also noted that if


it felt that it read the law as having discretion to


23

impose concurrent rather than consecutive sentences, it


might consider it.  That wasn't an issue at the time.  It


was just kind of dicta within the court's, the sentencing


court's decision.


Ultimately, though, about a year later, the


California supreme court issued another case called People


v. Garcia in which the supreme court said that sentencing


courts have a right to dismiss strikes on a count-by-


count basis, and Mr. Andrade has never asked by any


vehicle for a reconsideration of that issue, so in theory


he could go back at this point and file another State


habeas corpus petition and ask for what we would call


Garcia consideration, and -- which, based on what the


court, the sentencing court had previously indicated, the


court might be inclined to grant him, which would reduce 

this sentence if, assuming it was applied to one of the


counts, to a 25-year-to-life sentence. 


QUESTION:  Would you object to that relief?


MR. DANZIG:  We would not concede the issue,


but -- and I'm not saying that we would necessarily oppose


it, but it is available to him.  We'd have to consider our


position on that if and when it was -- he made that


application.


QUESTION:  Do you wish to reserve some time?


MR. DANZIG:  Yes, I do, Your Honor.

 QUESTION:  Very well.  Thank you, Mr. Danzig.


MR. DANZIG:  Thank you.


QUESTION:  Mr. Chemerinsky, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN CHEMERINSKY


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Today, the State of California asks this Court


to disregard and essentially to overrule a century of


decisions that have held that grossly disproportionate


penalties violate the Eighth Amendment.  If any sentence


is grossly disproportionate, it's that which was imposed


on Leandro Andrade.


QUESTION:  A century of decisions?  I thought we


decided this since I've been on the Court. 


I've been here 

longer than I thought, I guess.


(Laughter.)


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  I'm sorry, Justice Scalia, I


didn't hear the question.


QUESTION:  You say there -- for a century we


have been engaged in proportionality analysis?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Yes, Your Honor.  In Weems v.


United States in 1910, this Court said that sentences must


be graduated in proportion to the offense.  Most recently,


in Harmelin v. Michigan, seven Justices -- and Justice

Kennedy's opinion becomes the rule of Harmelin --


prescribed a three-part test based on Solem v. Helm for


deciding if a sentence is cruel and unusual punishment.


QUESTION:  Mr. Chemerinsky --


QUESTION:  I don't think that's quite accurate,


Mr. Chemerinsky.  I think if you were to take points,


decisional points, you would look at Rummel on one side,


and then Solem moves away from that, and then Harmelin


moves back towards Rummel.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Chief Justice Rehnquist, each


of the cases said it's consistent with all of the cases,


and each of these cases cites to Weems v. United States as


saying that grossly disproportionate punishments violate


the Eighth Amendment.


QUESTION: 


What do you do as a State court judge 

trying to apply our cases when you take those three cases? 


I mean, it isn't a very obvious answer, is it?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Your Honor, many State courts,


and virtually every circuit has said that Justice


Kennedy's opinion from Harmelin becomes the rule of


Harmelin, because in United States v. Marks it was the


narrowest ground that a majority agreed to, and of course


Justice Kennedy's opinion is simply a modification of the


three-part Solem test.


QUESTION:  Well, it -- Justice -- I've just read

it over, and it cites Rummel more often than it cites


Solem.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  So the point that I think you need to


address is the AEDPA point.  That is, is the supreme court


of California way out of line, or whatever the test is,


you know, improperly applied --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  -- in the light of these cases.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Yes, Your Honor.  Under this


Court's decision in Williams v. Taylor, in Bell v. Cone


and yes, in Early v. Packer, there are two ways in which a


Federal court can grant habeas relief.  One is to find


that it is contrary to clearly established Federal law. 


The other is to find that it's an unreasonable application 

of clearly established Federal law.  Both are present


here, and all --


QUESTION:  But one must find in either case


clearly established Federal law, and frankly that's my


problem when you cite Weems.  There are lots of grand


statements in our cases, but most of them come out


rejecting the claim, and you cited Weems.  That was an


extraordinary case because it involved not simply hard


labor, but hard and painful labor.  It was a kind of a


penalty that was foreign to Anglo-American law, and if

24

25

that's the one example before we get to Solem, you really


don't have anything concrete to go on.  You just have


grandly general statements.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Your Honor, there are cases


prior to Solem that found sentences to be cruel and


unusual punishment.  In Robinson v. California in 1962,


for example --


QUESTION:  That was a status crime.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Yes, Your Honor, and it did


find a violation of the Eighth Amendment.


QUESTION:  But you're not saying, are you, that


being an habitual criminal is like being a drug addict or


a drunk?  That is, just being drunk, just being stoned on


drugs is not a crime?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  No. 


My point, Your Honor, is 

that this Court has repeatedly said that grossly


disproportionate sentences violate the Eighth Amendment,


and the cases that I mentioned say that.  In addition --


QUESTION:  That's what they say, but you've


given Robinson as an example, and that's a case where I


thought the Court said there was no crime, not that it was


cruel and unusual punishment for a crime.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Yes, Your Honor, and what I'm


simply saying is, these are examples which the Court has


repeatedly said that grossly disproportionate sentences

violate the Eighth Amendment.


QUESTION:  Did the California courts contradict


that?  Did the California courts here say, grossly


disproportionate crimes don't violate the Eighth


Amendment?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Yes, Your Honor.  The


California Court of Appeals, and you find this in the


appendix to the cert petition, said it questioned whether


gross disproportionality analysis would be applied, and it


questioned whether Solem v. Helm analysis applied, and


therefore the California Court of Appeals did not apply


the three-part test from Solem v. Helm and the three-part


test that comes from Justice Kennedy's opinion in


Harmelin.


And in answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, it 

is those cases that announce the test that should have


been applied, and those cases are clearly established law.


QUESTION:  Your opponent says that the


California court relied on a Lynch analysis, which is a


State court doing much the same thing.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  No, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  Do you disagree with that?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  I do disagree.  First, the


California Court of Appeal expressly said it was not going


to do gross disproportionality analysis.  It did not do

Solem analysis.  It did not do Harmelin analysis.


QUESTION:  Well, I realize that, and my question


to you was, if the California court said we're going to do


a Lynch analysis, is that substantially the same thing?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  No, Your Honor.  The


California Court of Appeal said the test under California


law is whether the sentence, quote, shocks the conscience. 


That is a quite different test than the objective test of


Solem and Harmelin, which is carefully calibrated


determining whether a sentence is grossly


disproportionate.


Also, the three factors used by the California


Court of Appeal under the Lynch analysis were quite


different than the Solem analysis.  First, there was no


comparison of the gravity of the offense to the harshness 

of the punishment.  Second, the court did not look to


similar punishments in the same jurisdiction.


In California, the punishment for rape would


have been 8 years in prison, the punishment for


manslaughter would have been 11 years in prison, the


punishment for second degree murder would have been 15


years in prison, and he received 50 years to life.  In


fact, if his prior offenses had been rape and murder, he


could have at most gotten a year in jail.


This goes to Justice Stevens' question earlier.

His prior -- his crime here was the misdemeanor of


shoplifting.  Because of double-counting it was elevated


first to petty theft with a prior, and then it triggered


the three strikes law, but in order for it to be petty


theft with a prior, there has to be a prior property


offense.


If his prior crimes had been rape and murder,


then his maximum sentence for stealing these videotapes


would have been a year in jail.  It's because his prior


offenses were property crimes that the double-counting


could occur.  Additionally --


QUESTION:  I thought your opponent, or perhaps


the representative of the State, said that was not so.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  No, Your Honor.  The confusion


here is that with regard to petty theft, petty theft, the 

misdemeanor can become the wobbler petty theft with a


prior under California Penal Code section 666 only if the


prior crime is a property crime, and if you look at


California Penal Code section 66, it enumerates just


property crimes.


QUESTION:  Mr. Chemerinsky, I thought that what


made the petty theft in this case into a wobbler was not


the crimes that were listed as strikes, but another petty


theft.  Is that not true?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Yes, Your Honor.  They used a

petty theft, but they also used the burglaries to convert


the petty theft to a petty theft with a prior, and then


they used the petty theft with a prior to trigger the


three strikes law.


QUESTION:  I thought they used -- they didn't --


there was a second petty theft.  That was the crime of


conviction.  I thought there was an earlier one that made


the crime of conviction the petty theft with a prior.  Is


that wrong?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  That is correct.  However,


Your Honor, under California Penal Code section 667(g) any


prior felonies must be pled and proven, and the only prior


felonies here that were ever mentioned were the


burglaries, and as a result, simply because of stealing


$152 worth of videotapes in those burglaries, he received 

a sentence of 50 years to life, and under the third prong


of the rule of Harmelin.


QUESTION:  Well, is it not so that a judge


having the two strikes that are listed, and also having


the full record of the crimes that this person has


committed, that that's relevant to the discretion the


judge has to strike a strike, or to say I'm not going to


treat that petty theft as a felony, the petty theft with


prior as a felony.  I'm not going to do that.


There was in this case, was there not, in

addition to the two strikes, some serious criminal


activity?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  No, Your Honor, they played no


role in the sentence here, and the reason, as I said, is


the California Penal Code says any prior felonies must be


pled and proven.  If you look at the felony complaint --


QUESTION:  I didn't ask you about --


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  -- the ones that count as strikes. 


I asked you about the sentencing judge who has discretion


could say, looking at -- if that's all we had on this


record, I'm not going -- I'm going to exercise my


discretion to knock down the wobbler to a misdemeanor. 


I'm going to knock out a strike.  Isn't that in effect


what sentencing judges would do? 


They would look not 

simply to the two strikes that are formally pled, but this


person's entire record.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Your Honor, that not what


occurred here.  If you look at the sentencing transcript


on page 37 of the Joint Appendix, you'll see that the


sentencing judge made no mention to anything other than


the three burglaries.


QUESTION:  Well, isn't he presumed to know what


the record is?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  No, Your Honor, because

California Penal Code requires an order, for it to be


considered a strike, it has to be pled and proven.  The


criminal complaint here, the criminal information, the


jury finding was just as to those burglaries, and the


sentencing judge focused it just on those burglaries.


QUESTION:  Well, no.  No.  That's true as to the


strikes, but that doesn't mean that he didn't notice the


entire record in order to inform his discretion.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Your Honor, there's no --


QUESTION:  Or her.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  -- indication here that there


was ever any consideration other than the burglaries.


QUESTION:  But there's no indication that the


record was not before the judge.


QUESTION: 


Doesn't he have that record before 

him?  Isn't there a presentence or an equivalent of a


presentencing report?  Doesn't he get the record of what


this person he's about to sentence has done in the past? 


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  There was a probation report,


but because under California law prior strikes have to be


pled and proven, because only the burglaries were


mentioned, there's no reason here for the judge --


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  Only the burglaries were


mentioned in the presentencing report?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  No.  Only the burglaries were

proven.


QUESTION:  Were proven?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  The jury, on pages 18 and 19


of the joint appendix, found the burglaries, thus there


was no reason for Andrade to challenge the contents of the


probation report, and the judge never mentioned the


probation report.  He focused just on the burglaries.


And the other thing that makes this case, I


think, quite unique is no other State in the country would


impose a punishment like this on Andrade.  The Solicitor


General's brief points to some instances where in essence


grand theft, stealing more than $400 has led to a


sentence.  The State can't identify, and there is no


instance where anybody else has received this sentence.


QUESTION: 


They're saying, I take it, on this 

point that let's think of the class of serious criminals,


and we've decided in California to tell all people in that


class one more crime, you've had it.


Now, they have to define one more crime, and so


where they choose to draw the line is the line not before


you get to wobblers, but the line after you get to


wobblers, and they say that takes jay-walking and parking


offenses and everything and says, we're not talking about


those, we're talking about these, and what the other side


is arguing is, that's within the legislative discretion

that the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause must give. 


All right.  Why isn't it?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Justice Breyer, the reason


this case is different is the underlying conduct here is a


misdemeanor that's double-counted in order to become the


basis for a life sentence.  Earlier, for example, Justice


Scalia even invoked the distinction between misdemeanor


and felony.  A key point here is, there is no limiting


principle that --


QUESTION:  Well, no, they're saying on that


particular point, and I'm trying to get your response --


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- they say, there are felonies which


are not wobblers, and they're quite serious.  There are


wobblers which are medium-serious, and there are those 

things that can't even wobble.  They are trivial, and


where we choose to draw the line is between the last --


you know, between -- below the wobblers and not above. 


What's wrong with that?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Because that could lead to an


indeterminate life sentence for stealing a candy bar or


even a gum ball.


QUESTION:  Yes, it could.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  And that would violate --


QUESTION:  It could, and they'll say yes, that

is true in certain circumstances, and then they will


repeat the argument I just made.  I'm not holding him to


my argument.  I'm trying to push you a little bit, and to


say, if people are told, one more gum ball and you've had


it, that's a legitimate purpose of sentencing.


Now, how do I come back in some other than


purely subjective way and say, well, you know, you've gone


too far?  Is there anything one is to appeal to other than


a judge's subjective reaction?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  It is not subjective, it is


the three-part objective test that is the rule of


Harmelin.  It is first comparing the gravity of the


offense to the harshness of the punishment.


In Solem v. Helm, this Court said the courts can


evaluate the gravity of the offense, looking to see if 

it's a violent versus a nonviolent offense.  Leandro


Andrade never committed any violent offense.


QUESTION:  But in that, there's nothing in


Harmelin as I reread it that indicates that you must


preclude or prescind from that analysis, that initial


analysis, the fact that there is a recidivist element


here.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Of course.


QUESTION:  Recidivism is part of the analysis.

 QUESTION:  So we're not just talking about gum


balls.  We're talking about all of the offenses, including


breaking and entering with knives and so forth.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  But Leandro Andrade never was


accused or convicted of breaking and entering with knives


and in fact, Your Honor, even if you look at all of his


offenses, his criminal pattern is virtually identical to


that of Helm in Solem v. Helm.


I would go back to Chief Justice Rehnquist's


question --


QUESTION:  On that matter, what about what Judge


Sneed said in his dissent in the Ninth Circuit when he


pointed out that there was much in this criminal history


record in addition to the two strikes, including Federal


marijuana transportation offenses and a parole violation 

for escape from Federal prison?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  First, Your Honor, as I said


before, there's no indication that those were ever


considered, nor could they be by the sentencing court, but


second, Your Honor, even if you consider all of those,


then his criminal record is virtually identical to Helm's


in Solem v. Helm, and this does go to Chief Justice


Rehnquist's initial question.


One way that this Court has said that you can


find that a penalty or a sentence is contrary to clearly

established Federal law is if a State court ignores a


decision that is on all fours.  Solem v. Helm --


QUESTION:  Well, on all fours, on that point, is


there any decision where a term of years was struck down


as disproportionate?  Solem, I take it, was a life


sentence.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Your Honor, in Solem v. Helm


it was a life sentence, but there's nothing in Solem or


Harmelin that indicates that disproportionality analysis


is only where there's no possibility of parole.  If that


were the analysis, then a State could avoid


disproportionality review just by calling every life


without possibility of parole a 75-year sentence.


QUESTION:  If the question is what's clearly


established, and if I'm a trial court judge, I'll look to 

see what the court did, not grandly general statements


that it made about constitutional principle, and if I --


if my investigation led me to find that no, there has not


been a single case in which a term of years has been


struck down, then I might assume that the law for terms of


years is not clearly established.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Your Honor, Solem v. Helm


answers that question.  Here, Leandro Andrade received an


indeterminate life sentence with no possibility of parole


for 50 years.  That is the functional equivalent of the

sentence that Helm received in Solem v. Helm, and yet the


California Court of Appeal expressly said it would not


apply Solem v. Helm.


QUESTION:  Mr. Chemerinsky, the difficulty that


I have with your argument is, number 1, the point that


Justice Ginsburg made, but a further point that has come


out this morning.


When we are asking whether there is clearly


established law, I think we've got to take into


consideration something that has become clear from, I


think has become clear from this argument, and that is


that there is a question as to whether the test is


genuinely a proportionality or a gross disproportionality


test, or whether that is simply an example of a kind of


rational basis test, because we've had this difficulty in 

fitting the recidivism into the structure of


proportionality analysis, and I think what tends to come


out in the answers that we've gotten this morning is,


there's more than just proportionality which is being


considered here.


If that is true, if that is a fair


characterization of the way our reasoning is working, then


don't we have great difficulty in saying that there was


clearly established law simply by looking to Solem and to


Harmelin?

 MR. CHEMERINSKY:  No, Your Honor.  The reason


is, two things were clearly established at the time the


California Court of Appeal decision came down, first, that


grossly disproportionate sentences violate the Eighth


Amendment, and the court said it questioned it, didn't


apply it, and second, the test that's supposed to be used,


the objective test from the rule of Harmelin -- from


Solem v. Helm, and the court did not apply that three-


part test, and in that way the court acted contrary to


clearly established law.


Also, since Solem v. Helm is really factually


indistinguishable in this case, the court acted contrary


to in not following, and in addition --


QUESTION:  You're saying that if the law is


going to become unclear, it's going to be as a result of 

what we say this morning, as -- rather than what we have


said before.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Yes, Your Honor, at least


with -- insofar as gross disproportionality violates the


Eighth Amendment, and the test for gross


disproportionality being clearly established, and the


California courts followed neither of those.


QUESTION:  Well, do you -- Mr. Chemerinsky, do


you -- do you think that Solem v. Helm was as strong a


case after our decision in Harmelin as it was before?

25

 MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Yes, in two ways.  First, the


three-part test that it prescribes is still followed,


though Justice Kennedy's opinion from Harmelin says


there's only a need to consider the latter two prongs if


there is an inference of gross disproportionality


comparing the gravity of the offense to the harshness of


the punishment.


And second, no subsequent case, including


Harmelin, has ever ruled, overruled Solem v. Helm, so --


QUESTION:  Well, but do you think a State court


judge is acting unreasonably if he says we have three


cases, Rummel, Solem, and Harmelin, and it just isn't


quite all that clear?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  No, Your Honor, I think that


is unreasonable here, because the California Court of 

Appeal applied only Rummel, but in footnote 32 in Solem,


the Court said that Rummel is confined to its facts,


because it's before the three-part test.


QUESTION:  Yes, but then Harmelin goes ahead


and, as I say, cites Rummel more often than it does Solem.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  And Rummel remains good law


insofar as result, but Harmelin affirms the three-part


test.  This Court has repeatedly affirmed that three-part


test.


QUESTION:  Although it didn't apply it, although

it said, we don't have to go beyond the first step, and it


said, you might get to those others in exceedingly rare


cases.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  That's correct, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  And I suppose what you are telling us


is, this is that rare case.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  This is that rare case,


because in this instance, a man who had never committed a


violent crime received an indeterminate life sentence with


no possibility of parole for 50 years for stealing a small


amount of videotapes.


QUESTION:  May I ask this question that's -- is


a practical one, is, in view of what I referred to before


that Judge Sneed brought out in his dissent, if any of


those other activities could have been priors, wouldn't a 

resentencing here likely yield the very same result,


except that this time the prosecutor would spell out what


that entire course of conduct was?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  I think, Your Honor, that


there is very little likelihood, based on all of the


California cases, that a resentencing would lead to a


different result here, so in that sense I agree with you,


and that's why it really is a constitutional issue.  Does


an indeterminate life sentence for this conduct, even


taking into account his recidivism, justify the penalty

that was received here?


This Court has prescribed exactly the objective


factors to be considered, and to treat stealing $153 worth


of videotapes more seriously than second degree murder


doesn't even meet a rational basis test, and it is an


unreasonable application, and in that way, this case --


QUESTION:  Well, it wasn't that they were


treating this person as someone whose prior record


warranted incapacitating him.  They weren't merely


punishing a single offense.  They were punishing a person,


or they were incapacitating a person that they found to be


an incorrigible offender.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Based on three burglaries that


were 13 years earlier, and twice shoplifting a small


amount of videotapes, and that's why our argument is that 

this is that rare case where it is grossly


disproportionate punishment to in essence --


QUESTION:  But that case hasn't been seen yet. 


This would be it.  This -- there has been -- am I wrong in


thinking there has been no case since Harmelin where we


have said that a sentence is grossly disproportionate, and


no lower Federal court has struck down a sentence since


then?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  It is correct that this Court


has not found any sentence to be grossly disproportionate

since Harmelin -- you've not dealt with this issue since


Harmelin -- but there are lower court cases.  For example,


a year ago the Eighth Circuit in Henderson v. Norris found


a life sentence for possessing a small amount of cocaine


was grossly disproportionate, applying the rule of


Harmelin and also applying the Solem v. Helm test.


QUESTION:  Was that a recidivist case?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  I don't think it was a


recidivist case, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Has there been a recidivist case


since that trilogy that you recited?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  There are State courts that


have found recidivist sentencing structures to violate


United States Constitution, but there are not -- then


those would also involve recidivists, and those would have 

applied both Solem and Helm.


The West Virginia Court in State v. Deal, for


example, found a recidivist sentencing structure to be


cruel and unusual punishment.  The Colorado court of


appeals in People v. Gaskins came to the same result, and


that also explains why this case is different than Early


v. Packer, which you decided yesterday, and there the


criticism was that it was a situation where the State


court didn't cite to or mention the controlling Supreme


Court decision.

 Here, the California supreme court said it was


rejecting the test prescribed by this Court, rejecting the


test from Harmelin v. Michigan, which is a very different


situation than this case.


QUESTION:  What were the words that it used?  I


don't think it was that strong.  I thought it questioned


whether those -- that was still good law.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Yes, Your Honor.  The exact


wording from the court was the question.  The exact


wording was, and I quote to you from page 76 of the


appendix to the cert petition, however, to the extent that


the defendant suggests that proportionality analysis


applies under both the State and Federal Constitutions, we


must question that assertion, and then the court said, on


the same page, the current validity of the Solem 

proportionality analysis is questionable.


And having said it was questionable, the court


then did not apply the rule that grossly disproportionate


sentences violate the Eighth Amendment.  The court did not


apply the Solem analysis, the rule of Harmelin that the


court identified in Harmelin v. Michigan, and it was the


failure of the court to apply the controlling test, it was


the failure of the court to follow the controlling


precedent --

 MR. CHEMERINSKY:  -- that made the decision


contrary.


QUESTION:  -- they say, Mr. Chemerinsky, on that


same page, they say that the Solem proportionality


analysis is questionable in the light of Harmelin against


Michigan.  They certainly weren't saying they were


refusing to apply Harmelin.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  But Your Honor, they then did


not apply the three-part test that Justice Kennedy


articulated, which is the rule of Harmelin --


QUESTION:  But I thought you said they simply


refused to follow Harmelin.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Well, they didn't --


QUESTION:  I -- you're not meaning, then, that


they expressly refused to follow Harmelin, you're saying 

that, in fact, they didn't use the same formula as


Harmelin suggested?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Well, that's correct, Your


Honor, they didn't use in any way the three-part test from


Harmelin.


QUESTION:  But --


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  All they did was analogize to


Rummel v. Estelle.


QUESTION:  That was not the Court's test, that


was Justice Kennedy's test, which you say was the lowest

common denominator.  You think it's clearly established


law that where you have a split decision, the lowest


common denominator is the law of the land?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  In United States --


QUESTION:  I think that's a highly controverted


proposition myself.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Your Honor, in United States


v. Marks this Court described how to determine the rule


when there is no majority opinion, but especially here,


where Justice Kennedy is simply slightly modifying a prior


test from Solem v. Helm, the law is clearly established.


QUESTION:  Not an opinion of the Court, an


opinion of Justice Kennedy, and you say that all the


States' courts have to accept the proposition that that is


the law of the land?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Your Honor, virtually every


circuit has said that is the rule of Harmelin, but


especially so here, where it is simply slightly modifying


a test that's been on the books for 20 years, since


Solem v. Helm, that says three considerations are used to


calibrate whether a sentence is cruel and unusual.


QUESTION:  So Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke


is the law of the land, and you think that that is


generally accepted?

have occasion soon enough to deal with that issue --


QUESTION:  Understood.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  -- but --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  My point is that the proposition is


not, is simply not well-established, that you must accept


a less than majority opinion of the Supreme Court as being


the law of the land so long as it's the lowest common


denominator.


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Your Honor, I think there's


three reasons why it is.  First, this Court's opinion in


United States v. Marks describes how to determine what the


holding is.


Second, every circuit -- and we cite this in our


brief -- refers to the rule of Harmelin, and virtually 

every State that's considered it refers to the rule of


Harmelin, which shows that it's clearly established.


And third, the Solem v. Helm test was not in any


way overruled.  Seven Justices in this Court in Harmelin


adhered to the Solem test.


QUESTION:  But they split 4 to 3 as to what the


test required in that case, didn't they?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  But seven Justices --


QUESTION:  So you -- doesn't that throw some


doubt as to how closely you follow that?

 MR. CHEMERINSKY:  No, Your Honor.  Seven


Justices agreed that grossly disproportionate sentences


violate the Constitution.  Four would apply an even more


protective standard for criminal defendants, but seven


Justices clearly adhered to that.  Seven Justices adhered


to the Solem v. Helm test.


QUESTION:  But doesn't that suggest that the


test isn't that clear if they apply it and three come out


one way and four come out the other?


MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Your Honor, often Justices


will disagree, but the question here is, is the rule


clearly established, and the rule that grossly


disproportionate sentences violate the Constitution, the


rule that there's an objective three-part test, is what is


the clearly established law, and Your Honor, if any 

sentence is grossly disproportionate, it's this case.


The punishment here isn't just cruel and


unusual, it's cruel and unique.  The State can't point to


even one other person in the history of the United States


who has received a sentence of 50 years to life for


shoplifting a small amount of merchandise.  Even in


California this sentence would be regarded as quite --


much larger than, say, second degree murder, manslaughter,


rape, which shows that it is a grossly disproportionate


punishment.

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Chemerinsky.


Mr. Danzig, you have 4 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS P. DANZIG


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. DANZIG:  Thank you.  Given the limited time,


there are just a couple of brief points I would like to


make about respondent's argument.


I think it's clear that when he's arguing that


the proportionality analysis has to be confined to the


predicate offenses and the triggering offense, without


regard to the entire record, what he is essentially doing


is raising a facial challenge to the statute despite the


fact that the Ninth Circuit claimed that they were not


invalidating the statute, and to that extent that any 

facial challenge can be made, the ameliorating provisions


of the California scheme would result in a finding that


the statute is not -- in -- unconstitutional on its face.


Secondly, just as a points, a couple of points


of correction -- the Court has already touched upon it --


the court of appeal did not question whether the


proportionality analysis was correct.  It questioned


whether Solem's version of the proportionality analysis


was still correct.  That's what the State court did, and


it still went ahead and applied a proportionality analysis

via a State court decision of Lynch.


And in terms of whether gross disproportionality


was addressed or not, the State used, or the State court


used a standard articulated from Lynch, which is shocks


the conscience, and it is much stronger language and is at


least reasonably a euphemism for grossly disproportionate.


Also, I will find the page in just a moment, but


I believe at the sentencing hearing the judge did indicate


that he had considered the probation report.  It's in the


joint appendix, and I will find the cite in a moment.


Ultimately, if there's any doubt about whether


there's clear precedent or not, the -- I think that the


State court determination should be given deference in


this case, and almost finally, not -- Andrade did not


receive life for three burglaries and two petties, he 

received that because the ameliorating provisions go into


the analysis, and as he was not granted the benefit of any


of them, and in fact hasn't even asserted one of them, he


did not receive that sentence for that, for strictly life


for three burglaries and two petties.  He's received it


based on his overall record.


In terms of whether there are -- anyone else in


California has suffered a similar sentence, while we -- I


have no reference to any 50-year-to-life sentences based


on two convictions, there are 300 and -- approximately 344

defendants in California serving 25-year-to-life sentences


for petty offense, offense with a prior which constitutes


the one 25-to-life sentence.


QUESTION:  But that's under the three strikes


regime?


MR. DANZIG:  Correct, Your Honor. 


Finally --


QUESTION:  So that doesn't tell us much about


the constitutionality of the three strikes regime.


MR. DANZIG:  No.  It was simply a response to


respondent's assertion that we could not point to anyone


else serving a similarly severe sentence for a similar


crime --


QUESTION:  But we have the SG's footnote, which


does have a few.


MR. DANZIG:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  But not this serious.  I mean, not


this trivial.


MR. DANZIG:  Well, I don't think -- I would not


characterize it as trivial, but I understand --


QUESTION:  Not this -- I'm looking for the right


word.  Not this minor?


MR. DANZIG:  I think that under the California


scheme it's clear presumptively that theft is a felony


offense, and we simply grant -- and California simply


53 

grants the first-time offender an opportunity to reform. 


I don't consider it trivial or minor.


Ultimately, we would ask the Court to disapprove


Van Tran.  It's presenting significant problems.  It's


inconsistent with this Court's pronouncements in


Williams v. Taylor and in Bell v. Cone and Penry v.


Johnson.  It establishes a methodology that is simply


incorrect, and finally, in 1996, Congress limited the


scope of Federal habeas corpus review.


Here, the Ninth Circuit failed to properly apply


those, the principles guiding that analysis.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Danzig.


MR. DANZIG:  Thank you, Your Honor.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon at 12:10 p.m., the case in the above-

entitled matter was submitted.)
