 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument this morning in Case 08-1457, New Process Steel 

v. The National Labor Relations Board.

 Mr. Richie.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHELDON E. RICHIE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. RICHIE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The issue in this case is whether the 

National Labor Relations Board can continue to issue 

adjudicatory decisions when its membership falls to two. 

The National Labor Relations Act clearly states that at 

all times, a quorum of the board will be not less than 

three members.  The board's interpretation -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it your position that 

all of the actions of the board, including those taken 

by the regional offices and by the general counsel and 

by everybody else, is inoperative once -- once the 

membership falls below three?

 MR. RICHIE:  No, Justice Scalia, 

particularly with respect to the general counsel, the 

statute at 153(d) has a separate enumeration of -- of 

obligations and powers and authority, so we don't think

that that fails.

 We also think that, with respect to certain 

administrative type functions -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it has a separate -­

a separate authorization for these three -- three-person 

adjudicatory panels as well, doesn't it?

 MR. RICHIE:  It has -- it does, 

Justice Scalia.  It does have a separate authorization 

for panels of three or more members.  It does not have, 

as in this case, a separate authorization for panels of 

two members.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  But that's a 

different argument from the argument you were starting 

off with, which, as I understood it, was once the 

membership of the board falls below the quorum of three, 

by reason of that, the three -- former three-member 

panels, of which there are now only two left, cannot 

act.  Is that your argument?

 MR. RICHIE:  It is our argument that the -­

that once the membership falls below three, that the

board?

 MR. RICHIE:  When the membership of the 

board falls below three.  But we also believe that when 

the membership of the group falls below three, that the 

delegee group's authority to make adjudicatory decisions 

lapses.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understood that argument 

and I thought that was the only one you were making. 

But you are making a broader one, that it also happens 

whenever the -- whenever the board's quorum disappears.

 MR. RICHIE:  You are correct, 

Justice Scalia.  We are making that argument.  It's 

because of the first sentence of 153(b), which states 

that the delegations have to be to members of three or 

more members.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So the regional offices 

can't function, of the NLRB?

 MR. RICHIE:  Well, we believe they can 

function.  They can receive, for example, unfair labor 

practices complaints.  They can't make adjudicatory 

decisions.  And we think that that is exactly what -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can the board pay salaries?

 MR. RICHIE:  We believe they can, because 

there is probably a different statute that enumerates 

that, Justice Scalia, other than this statute with

respect to the authority with respect to adjudicatory 

decisions.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm really reluctant to 

rely upon this first argument that you are making, 

because I really don't know what it does to all of the 

functioning of the board.

 MR. RICHIE:  Well, one of the --

Justice Scalia, one of the things that we think is clear 

is that the remedy for fixing an undersized board is not 

for the board to redefine itself and to read the 

statute, but for Congress or the president to act.  And 

there are many ways in which the president and Congress 

could -- could fix the problem of an undersized board.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But here the court of 

appeals said that the Act does two things.  First, it 

said that the full board can delegate full powers to any 

three-member group.  That was step one, and that was 

done here.

 And then it says there's this rule that a 

quorum is three, but then it said:  Except as to one of 

these three-member groups that has been designated, 

except, and there the quorum is two.  So why doesn't the 

statute answer the question that, yes, a quorum is 

three, except when it's two?

 MR. RICHIE:  Well, I think there is two

answers to that, Justice Ginsburg.  One is here the 

government -- the board takes the position, as they say 

on page 29 in a footnote to their brief, that when a 

delegate group possessed of all of the board's power 

acts, it is acting as the board and not as an agent of 

the board.

 So first, we would say that the second 

quorum provision isn't even applicable to this group 

that was established -- of members Kirsanow, Liebman and 

Schaumber.  And so we think the three-member quorum -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I didn't understand that. 

Would you -- would you make that argument again?

 MR. RICHIE:  Certainly, Justice Scalia.  The 

government -- I'm sorry, "the government."  The NLRB in 

its brief in footnote 21 on page 29, as well as in the 

delegation, the minutes of the delegation in 2007, which 

are found in our brief in the appendix on -- I think 

it's pages 4a and 5a.  Both say that when -- the NLRB 

says in the footnote "When the delegee group possessed 

of all of the board's powers," which is what we have 

here, "acts, it is acting as the board and not as an 

agent of the board.  So our position is that when you 

become the board, as this group did, now you are subject 

to that minimum three-member delegee -- three member 

quorum requirement.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's not an agent of 

the board because the three-member group that has a 

quorum of two has the full powers of the board.  So the 

statute doesn't say anything about a three-member group 

that has a quorum of two being an agent of the board.

 MR. RICHIE:  It's a -- it's a group that is 

delegated authority, and therefore, whether it's a full 

delegation or partial delegation, we believe that the 

common law principles of agency and principal make that 

delegee group an agent.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But where does the 

statute make that three-member group with a quorum of 

two, a quorum of two, an agent?  It says they may be 

designated to exercise any and all powers?

 MR. RICHIE:  Justice Ginsburg, it does not 

say the word "agent" in it.  But the delegation that 

it's referring to is at common law a principal-agency 

relationship.  So it's our position that once that 

delegation occurs that the -- in a normal situation, 

because you could have a three-member group of four 

members, a board of four or a board of five, and you 

could have a group with three members.  When the 

delegation is made, it's our position and we believe 

that this is the position that the D.C. Circuit took as 

well, that that's an agent of the board.

JUSTICE BREYER:  You should -- you should 

have a very direct answer to this question.

 Were you finished, because I don't want to 

interrupt that train of thought?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The D.C. Circuit I think 

was the source of your opening argument because they 

said when the number drops below three there is no 

board, and I guess that's what your opening argument was 

based on.

 MR. RICHIE:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it did 

say that.  But it also went on to say that it was 

applying the rules, the common law rules of principal 

and agency, and that when the board without three 

members lost its authority to act, that the delegee 

group to which the delegation was made also lost 

authority to act.  And in this case that's exactly what 

happened.  We had a three-member board -- we actually 

had four delegate to three, and then two terms expired.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, just on this same 

point before Justice Breyer I think moves to another 

point.  The statute does use the word "quorum" twice 

and, as Justice Ginsburg has pointed out, except that 

two members -- in its last phrase it uses the word 

"quorum" twice:  "Except that two members shall 

constitute a quorum."  It doesn't say two members may

quorum."

 MR. RICHIE:  Justice Kennedy, I think we 

have to start first -- and you are correct, there are 

two quorum provisions, but "quorum" is not defined 

differently.  Quorum -- I think we agree within NLRB 

that a quorum is the minimum number of members of a body 

necessary to transact business.  We have two different 

bodies defined in this statute.  We have the board as 

one body and we have the group as a different body.  And 

so when the -- when the exception appears in the 

statute, we agree again with the D.C. Circuit's 

interpretation of that as simply defining two different 

numbers of people necessary to fill out a quorum of 

these two different bodies that are defined within the 

statute.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you -- can you -- if 

you are right, it seems to me you should have a very 

clear, concise answer to the question that I'm just 

going to ask you.  And this is the question:  Imagine 

that there was no delegation, none.  Now we have five 

members; is that right?  One of them dies.  So there is 

a vacancy.  Now, can the remaining four exercise the

board's power?

 MR. RICHIE:  Clearly.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Clearly.  Okay.  So what is 

the difference between the situation I just described 

and this situation where the Board simply delegated its 

power to three people and one of them dies?  What's the 

difference?  I can't find any difference in the 

language.  So what is the difference?

 MR. RICHIE:  Justice Breyer, the difference 

is that in this statute there is a clear statement that 

at all times the board must have a three-member quorum. 

In your hypothetical there were still four members.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Correct.

 MR. RICHIE:  The board was still in place.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Except that two members 

shall constitute a quorum of any group designated 

pursuant to the first sentence, which says "The board is 

authorized to delegate to any group of three all of the 

powers which it may itself exercise. " So, what's the 

difference?

 MR. RICHIE:  Well, the difference is that 

once the -- the difference between the hypothetical and 

the situation we are in is that there were four members, 

and the statute -­

asking why does that make a difference?

 MR. RICHIE:  It makes a difference because 

the statute requires that at all times the board shall 

have a quorum of three members, a minimum quorum of 

three members.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Except.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But isn't that tied to a 

quorum for the board as a whole to act?  Once it's 

delegated a responsibility to a three-member board, it's 

already said, unless it takes another vote, that it's 

going to let those three people decide.  It has -- I 

understand the word "delegated" to mean it's given over 

its power to a subgroup.  If it wants to take it back, 

it needs a quorum to do that.  That's what I understand.

 MR. RICHIE:  Well, I think the problem is, 

Justice Sotomayor, that the delegation to a group of 

three is indeed a valid delegation.  We don't contest 

that.  But what we have here is a phantom group.  And 

what the -- what the board said, because member 

Kirsanow's term expired in December, about 11 days after 

the delegation.  And if you look at the minutes of the 

board when they are delegating to the group, it says in 

the minutes that they "are continuing to be a two-member 

quorum of a three-member group," as if member Kirsanow 

is a phantom .  It's a fiction.  The group ceases to

exist and the board -- it's not just that the board 

falls below three and the board ceases to exist with all 

delegated powers to this group.  The group ceases to 

exist.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that brings you back 

to Justice Breyer's hypothetical.  There's five members 

on the board.  Clearly they can delegate under the 

statute.  Now there are only four members.  Something 

happens to the fifth.  Under your theory, the entity 

that originally delegated no longer exists and therefore 

the group, the entity that received the delegation of 

powers, must cease, must cease to act.

 MR. RICHIE:  Justice Kennedy, I -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If the quorum of three 

that authorized two to act disappears and that means the 

principal is no longer there, so the agent can't 

exercise the authority, why isn't it the same when five 

become four?

 MR. RICHIE:  Well, we believe that the 

reason that it isn't, Justice Kennedy, the same is -­

terrible sentence.  It's not the same because the 

statute contemplates vacancies on the board and multiple 

vacancies, so long as they don't go below three.  The 

statute -- the vacancy clause in the statute doesn't 

apply to a group at all.  So the delegating group in the

hypothetical clearly is still in place as the board 

because it's the board that delegated.  And the board 

still exists.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  As far as the interests of 

your client are concerned, is there any functional 

difference between what happened here and what could 

happen very routinely even if the board had five 

members, namely that after the case was assigned to a 

three-member panel one of the three members of the panel 

became unable to sit on that case, but the remaining two 

members were able to reach agreement so the case could 

be decided?

 MR. RICHIE:  Justice Alito, the difference 

is that here there was never a way to reconstitute this 

board -- I'm sorry, the group -- as three members.  When 

you have five or you have four members of the board and 

a member of a three-member group is unable to perform 

his or her function -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't there another 

difference?  Is it not the case that the decisions of 

these panels can be appealed to the full board?  Are 

they automatically final?  Can the board not revise the 

decision of one of its panels?

 MR. RICHIE:  Well, I believe that the board 

could revise the decision of one of its panels.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The adjudication is final.

 MR. RICHIE:  Of the three-member group.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  There is no appeal to the 

full board?

 MR. RICHIE:  That is correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Then what is the reason --

I now see.  Your answer to my question is that the 

vacancy clause applies to the full board but not to the 

group.

 MR. RICHIE:  That's correct, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Now, got that 

answer.  And now I see how you could read the statute 

that way.  So, now I would like -- and that would be in 

your favor.

 MR. RICHIE:  That's true.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And -- and, therefore, I 

would like to know, since you could also read it the 

other way, why should it be read your way?  I mean, I 

can think of a lot of reasons why not.  One is something 

that Justice Scalia was raising:  It may work havoc as 

to what remains effective, what doesn't, what about the 

board staff decisions, which are, which aren't.  I can

see a lot of reasons for not doing it.

 But what are your best reasons for reading 

that vacancy clause the way you want me to read it?

 MR. RICHIE:  Justice Breyer, we -- we 

believe that it is important to have a promote -- to 

have a robust debate and an expression of -- a potential 

for expression of dissent.  And what you have here is 

you have two members in a group and -- who have publicly 

announced that on more than one occasion over the last 2 

years plus 3 months when this board has sat with only 2 

members, that they have sometimes compromised their 

opinions in the interest of the institutional purposes, 

basically to keep the doors open.

 And so you don't have a full and robust 

debate.  You don't have the potential for an expression 

of a dissenting view, and that's the -- that's the 

distinction that we see.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the problem is that 

that exists whether we read your rule or not in the way 

you want.  You have -- you've conceded that a 

three-member board could lose a member, a three-member 

group could lose a member and its acts still be binding, 

as long as you say there is -- there is three members on 

the full board.  But this lack of opportunity for 

dissent exists any time there is a vacancy.  You just

don't like the system.

 MR. RICHIE:  Justice Sotomayor, if we 

consented that when there was an absence, a member who 

dies, retires, is incapacitated, that the two members of 

a properly constituted three -- three-member group could 

still function, I certainly did not mean to say that. 

We do not consent to that or agree with that 

proposition.  What -- what somebody -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  You are now 

saying that the group always has to be three members?

 MR. RICHIE:  Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That somebody can't die, 

leave, recuse themselves from that group without 

invalidating the actions of that subgroup.  Where in the 

statute do you read that limitation when it says a 

quorum of two is okay to act?

 MR. RICHIE:  The definition of a quorum, 

Justice Sotomayor, is the minimum number of persons of a 

body necessary to transact business.  The body here is 

defined as three or more people.  So, when the -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, I am talking about 

the group.

 MR. RICHIE:  I am, too.

The board is defined as three or more.  The group is 

defined as three.  So I'm -- I'm a little confused.

 MR. RICHIE:  In the statute, the group is 

defined as -- the board is authorized, and I'm reading 

from 153(b), Appendix 1a to our brief:  "The board is 

authorized to delegate to any group of three or more 

members" -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I see.

 MR. RICHIE:  -- "any or all" -- that is 

where we find it necessary that the group must contain 

at least three members.

board did was it reconstituted the panels any time a 

member died or retired.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There have been 

situations before where the board dwindled to two 

members.  Is this the first time that the board has 

continued to adjudicate the cases that they can, or when 

there were prior periods with only two did the board 

continue to adjudicate?

 MR. RICHIE:  This is the first time, yes. 

For over -- from 1947 through 19 -- up to 2007, any time 

the board fell to two members -- as far as we know, any 

time the board fell to two members, the board 

reconstituted -- I'm sorry.  Any time a group fell to 

two members, the board reconstituted the group to a 

three-member group.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  There is a well-established 

practice on the court of appeals that when a three-judge 

panel for some reason loses one of the members due to a 

death or resignation or recusal, the panel can continue 

to decide the case if the remaining two judges can 

agree.  And -- and do you see -- do you think the -- the 

situation is different with the NLRB for some reason? 

Or do you think that that -- that those decisions on the 

courts of appeals are unlawful as well?

it's a different statute.  But we also -- I also think 

the court of appeals, which is the delegating body that 

forms the -- the three-member courts, still is in 

existence.  And if we just -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you are shifting 

arguments.  You can't keep jumping back and forth 

between the two arguments.  The one is that the 

appointing body has to still be fully constituted, or at 

least have a quorum, and the other one, which I thought 

Justice Alito was addressing, is the quite separate 

argument that the recipient of the delegation has to be 

three.  And when it falls below three it's only two.

 And I don't know that you have a response 

to -- to -- to his point, with respect to the latter 

argument, except -- except that it's a different 

statute.

 MR. RICHIE:  Well, Justice Scalia, it's a 

different statute but it's also a very temporary and 

limited circumstance.  You have a panel that was formed 

to hear a case.  Here you have got a delegation of all 

the authority, the board has -- the group has become the 

board, and we effectively have a two-member National 

Labor Relations Board.

in for this kind of argument.  But in thinking of the -­

the -- the arguments in your favor, the one that sort of 

resonated a bit with me was that this is a very 

Republican Congress in 1947 that passed Taft-Hartley, 

and one of the things they were really aiming at was to 

move the board from three to five.  And this is a way so 

that that just doesn't happen.

 But I assume from the briefs filed that 

there is no supporting legislative history for that, 

what I've just said, so I better wipe it out of my mind.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  If there is no legislative 

history, it could be true.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. RICHIE:  Justice Breyer, the legislative 

history I think is -- there is no legislative history on 

what happens when the board falls below two members. 

But it is clear that from 1935 to 1947, the board was 

made up of three members, and the statute clearly said 

under the Wagner Act two members could be a quorum of a 

three-member board.

 In 1947 when Taft-Hartley was passed, 

Congress intentionally increased the quorum and 

increased the size of the board.  If it had intended to 

have only two members serve at any time as a two-member

board, they would not -- that would be a strange way to 

do it, in a statute that not only increases the size of 

the board, but changes the minimum quorum requirement 

from two to three.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I was surprised by your 

answer to -- I was surprised by your answer to one of 

the earlier questions, because one of your amici says 

that any member of the board, regardless of whether he 

or she sits on the panel hearing a case, may request 

that the case be heard by all five board members.  Is 

that -- is that not correct?

 MR. RICHIE:  That is correct, but that's to 

hear it as opposed to overturn it once the decision is 

made.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Heard an initial -- an 

initial decision.  But just -- the review of the panel 

is in the court of appeals, right?

 MR. RICHIE:  That's correct, 

Justice Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you could have 

initially a panel of five, but that would not be 

reviewing the panel of three?

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- I am really 

confused now.

 Is it or is it not the case that the full 

board has the power to review a decision of one of these 

panels?  Before you said no; before you said it's final.

 MR. RICHIE:  The decision is final once it 

is rendered.  They can review the decision in draft form 

before it is -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that is -- that is my 

question, whether they -- they can review it before it

ask to be included on the -- on the panel.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They can review it before 

it is rendered.  Okay.

 MR. RICHIE:  But they can't overturn it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is this different from 

the practice that some courts of appeals follow of 

circulating a panel decision to the full court some days

The practice of circulating the opinion does not put all

Justice Ginsburg.

opportunity for them to vote to hear the case en banc

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 We agree that the plain text controls this 

case and there are three features to that text.

 First, section 153(b) permits delegation of 

any or all of the board's power to three or more 

members.  Second, that section sets out a general quorum

rule of three members.  And third, as Justices Alito --

Justices Alito, Kennedy and Ginsburg have pointed out, 

there is the phrase "except that" in the rule, a special 

quorum provision that sets up panel quorums at two 

members.

 And in this case, faced with a vacancy 

crisis, the board validly delegated its powers in 

December 2007 to a three-member panel, and Petitioners 

have never contested otherwise.  Rather, they argue that 

when the board dropped it down to two members -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just before the third 

member no longer became -- no longer was a member of the 

board.

 MR. KATYAL:  That's true.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So knowing when it gave it 

to this three member panel that it would shortly become 

a two-member panel, and that thereby the board would be 

able to act with only two members instead of with three, 

which is what the quorum requirement for the board is.

 I must say that seems to be a very strange 

procedure when you have a statute that says the board 

has to -- has to have three for a quorum.  When the 

board sees, oh, God, we are about to lose our third 

member, let's set up a three-member panel with this guy 

who's about to go off.  It will immediately become a

two-member panel and then we can act with only two 

members.  That's wonderful.

 It doesn't seem to you like an evasion of 

the whole purpose of the -- of the quorum requirement?

 MR. KATYAL:  I don't think so.  I think it's 

precisely what was -- what the text allows, because it's 

not, Justice Scalia, simply a three-member quorum 

requirement.  It's a three-member quorum requirement, 

"except that."

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Except -- may I just 

interrupt a bit, just on the "except" clause at the very 

bottom.  When you are talking about individual cases 

it's easy.  Sure, one member dies; the other two can 

finish.  But you are talking about long-run governance 

of the board.  The two members -- two members shall 

constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to 

the first sentence.

 Now, 2 years later, after -- what is the 

group designated pursuant to the first sentence at the 

time of the decision 2 years later?

 MR. KATYAL:  It is the same group of people 

that were -­

constitute a quorum of any group that continues to meet 

the requirements of the first sentence thereof, or 

something like that.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  To read -- you can read the 

language the way you want, that -- because of the 

vacancy clause.  You see, there is a sentence there that 

says "A vacancy shall not impair the right of the 

remaining members to exercise the power."  That implies 

in the absence of that clause, five to four, they 

couldn't.  Okay?

 Now, you say that clause applies to the 

remaining members, i.e., to the three.  And now we don't 

have three.  And since we don't have three, there are -­

and you have to have three.  Because they're not -­

there's not -- there are not the remaining members, you 

see.

 MR. KATYAL:  Right.  So let me say a few 

things about that.  The first is -­

MR. KATYAL:  -- it is a totally different 

argument.  It really does rest on the first sentence of 

153(b).

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Yes.

 MR. KATYAL:  And my friend admitted, it's a 

totally new, different argument.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

 MR. KATYAL:  It's not in the question 

presented.  It's not before the Court.  But were the 

Court interested in it, I do think that the language of 

the quorum provision, "quorum" meaning a number 

sufficient to transact business, is the most relevant 

language, and that suggests that two is enough so long 

as you have that initial delegation to a group of three 

and then one member drops off.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, don't -- don't you 

think it is significant that the -- the vacancy clause 

that you were discussing -- where is it?  It's in (b). 

"A vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of 

the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of

group not impairing the power of the group.

 MR. KATYAL:  I don't think so.  The -- the 

language is "A vacancy in the board -- in the board 

shall not impair the powers of the remaining members of 

the board."

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of the board.

 MR. KATYAL:  Of the board.  And -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it doesn't say that 

about the group.  That's my point.

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, but by definition, 

Justice Scalia, the members that had been delegated this 

power on December 20th are members of the board.  And 

they are not -- they are not simply extraneous actors. 

And so the vacancy clause, I think -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  The -- this whole 

passage distinguishes between the board and the group. 

I mean, it's -- it doesn't -- it doesn't mean the group 

when it says "the board" and the board when it says "the 

group."

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think it -- I don't 

know that there is a distinction.  I think that there 

when they say the board, it by definition includes the 

group, because that is part of the board.  They aren't 

extraneous individuals.

our brief, was to increase efficiency and to have 

overlapping panels adjudicating cases.  I do think that 

there's a -- there's ways to prevent your situation from 

happening; that, and they include not just removal for 

cause, which I think this would be the paradigmatic case 

if three members of the body were trying to cut out two 

members from doing their job.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not trying to, but 

succeeding in doing so.

 MR. KATYAL:  Succeeding, absolutely.  And I 

think -­

depends upon who would remove them for cause.

 MR. KATYAL:  It would be the president.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what if he's 

perfectly content to have two Democrats?

 MR. KATYAL:  And then you would have 

other -- you would have other checks as well.  If you 

had one-party government and all of these factors 

aligning in the way you are suggesting, you would have 

the possibility that the circuit court's review under 

160(f) might come into play, I mean, because each board 

decision can be potentially appealed to a circuit court.

Democrats, three -- or two Republicans or, of course, 

the other way around, nothing to constrain them from

Democrats?

which the board -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there any other legal -­

this is what -- one thing, if I were thinking without 

the language for a moment, and I -- the Taft-Hartley 

Congress did, I think, want to limit the powers in a 

number of ways of the board, maybe expand the membership 

to be sure there would be both parties in larger 

numbers.

 If you could limit this to adjudications, 

you would say, well, then they can't set major policy 

with just two members.  But I don't see a way to do 

that, particularly since the board has often set rules 

in adjudication which have broad application.

 So am I right in thinking that we have to 

decide either, it is okay for two members to set the 

most major policies, or we have to say they can't even 

conduct adjudication, even the simplest adjudication, 

even the least significant?

 MR. KATYAL:  I think -- I think, Justice 

Breyer, that the board traditionally doesn't engage in 

much rulemaking.  It does make its decisions -­

MR. KATYAL:  And I do agree that -- that at 

stake here is the potential to decide cases.  Now, when 

you mention the Taft-Hartley Act, I think that that 

legislative history is important for a different reason, 

which is up in -- from 1935 to 1947, and this is set out 

in footnote 1 of our brief, that board decided over 

460 cases as a two-member body.  There was a vacant 

third position.

 And there were 2 years of debate, 

contentious debate, as you alluded to before, about 

Taft-Hartley, and yet they left that piece intact.  They 

permitted two-member bodies to decide these cases.  And 

so to the extent legislative history is relevant for 

members of the Court, we suggest it strongly suggests 

that what the board did here, faced with this vacancy 

crisis, mirrors what happened between 1935 and -­

first inquiry were agency law, and we concluded that 

under agency law when the principal ceases to exist the 

agent may no longer function.  Let's assume we conclude

a rationale for saying that agency law should not apply 

to a government agency, to a problem of this type, and 

if so, what is your authority?

MR. KATYAL:  Sir, they are set out at page 

28 of our brief.  They are United States v. Wyder, the 

two Donovan cases.  I think it is a long-established 

principle that principal/agent relationships, which we 

don't think necessarily apply to this case, but even did 

you -- even were you to disagree, as the premise of your 

question suggested, that government delegations survive 

the loss of that principal.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is your point that 

official acts done stay in effect even though the 

official is gone, until the official's successor in 

office is appointed and that successor can remand the 

instruction?

 MR. KATYAL:  That's -- that's precisely 

correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that is like the de 

facto officer doctrine.  It could be that, if the 

Petitioner prevails here, the de facto officer doctrine 

would leave in place everything that has been done.

that, for example, when an attorney general designates 

their power to -- the wiretap authority to a 

subordinate, an assistant attorney general, and then 

that attorney general leaves office, that wiretap 

authority nonetheless continues in the subordinate until 

it is revoked by a successor.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But hasn't the situation 

that has prevailed now for some time changed the -- the 

decision-making process of the board in at least two 

important ways?  First, there isn't any opportunity for 

full board review of cases.  But more important, if you 

have only two members on the board and only two members 

on the panel, the process is very different from a panel 

in which there were three members, or in which two 

members can be supplemented with an additional member if 

they can't agree.

 What are the two to do?  They have to -­

they have to split the difference all the time.  And 

there have been decisions in which the members have -­

continuing for these 800 or so days to decide these 

cases.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, not only is the 

two-member board not -- not ideal.  Do you think it is 

reasonably possible that Congress back in 1947 

contemplated this particular problem and would have 

solved it the way you suggest?

 MR. KATYAL:  I do think that Congress had 

before it a well -- it was well-known that over 460 

times the board had decided cases with only two members, 

with the third being vacant.  And I think that's what -­

just delighted to have only two Democratic members left 

on the board and all the cases decided by two Democratic 

members.  What possible incentive does that Congress 

have to increase the board to -- to the level that it 

should be?  None.

 If you want to solve the crisis that you are 

so worried about, the only way to solve it is to say: 

Boy, you know, there is -- it's Armageddon coming; we 

are going to not be able to act at all.  That would 

solve the crisis.

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think the politics in 

Armageddon could cut different ways, depending -- I 

mean, these are nomination battles that are focused on 

individual personalities.  And, Justice Scalia, the only 

empirical evidence we have -- this is not the first time 

the board has done this, contrary to my friend's 

suggestion earlier.

 In 2005, the board was faced with the exact 

same situation.  The board was going to go down to two 

members.  They decided to do the exact same delegation 

and give -- give all the powers to a group of three, and 

four days later, Congress fixed the problem with the

you have contradicted, that for many years whenever 

there was a death in one of the three-member panels, 

that panel was reconstituted.  A new person was 

appointed, instead of just letting it continue to 

operate with only two.  Doesn't that mean something? 

Doesn't that suggest that these panels were viewed by 

the board as requiring three people?

 MR. KATYAL:  No, it suggests that they 

thought three was optimal, where it was -- where they 

could get three bodies.  But here, when they only have 

two -- and again, faced with shutting down and not 

deciding the lion's share of cases, which aren't the

from 1935 to 1947, there were two-member panels and they

periods of time.  In 2005, they did do precisely what 

they did here, but Congress resolved the situation, so 

there are only about 6 cases decided in that 4-day 

period.  And now from 2007 to now, approximately

think that that is crucial language, because that is a

essentially modify that.  The two-member quorum language 

modifies what happens before, the "at all times" -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you need the "except 

that" once you have language.  You need it because now 

you have a bigger board and it says there is a 

three-member quorum.

 MR. KATYAL:  Precisely.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought they -- they 

simply are taking the earlier phrase, the earlier 

statutory phrase, and they are changing those words

grammatically because otherwise if you didn't have 

something like that, it would suggest that the panel 

quorum would be three as well.  But -- but the language 

is quite specific on this and, contrary to what the D.C. 

Circuit found, "at all times" is modified by that 

subordinating conjunction in the phrase that follows.

that the board, as I understand it, can approve or

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under the Petitioner's 

theory, if there is no quorum would those appointments 

then be invalidated, too?

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, I -- and this goes to 

Justice Scalia's first question of the argument, I -- I 

think that it's possible.  I think that there is -- the 

D.C. Circuit's reasoning is -- potentially could be read 

so broadly as to say that the entire board goes poof and 

everything under it, including the salaries.

 I think if the Court were inclined to -- to 

write a decision like that, we would try to look to, as 

you mentioned before, the de facto officer doctrine and 

the specific language of the delegations to the ALJ's 

and the specific language to the general counsels, to 

try to see if there is a way to preserve all of the 

board's action in this circumstance.

 Of course, that isn't before the Court at 

this point, but I understand that the dramatic 

consequences, potentially dramatic consequences of the 

D.C. Circuit's ruling, may inform the judgment.

 A modifying phrase such as -- as this, 

talking about the "at all times three members" denotes 

that there is no instance in which the board forum

times would in the same sentence allow the board to 

reduce its operative quorum to two without further 

congressional authorization."

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Except that it said 

"except."

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  At all times "except."

 MR. RICHIE:  And, Justice Ginsburg, that was 

what the D.C. Circuit was referring to was the "except 

that" language, and saying in that same sentence, where 

there is a requirement at all times of a three-member 

quorum of the board, that it is -- it defies logic that 

Congress would in that same sentence state except when 

there is three that falls to two.
