 Mr. and Mrs. Kawashima came here to the

 MR. WHALEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. WHALEN

9  please the Court:
10
11  United States as legal immigrants in 1985.  And later 
12  on, they pled guilty to filing a false statement under a 
13  corporate tax return.  The issue we bring to the Court 
14  is whether that conviction under 26 U.S.C. 7206 is an 
15
16  aggravated felony statute. 
17
 This Court many times has held that it is 
18  the elements of the crime of conviction that determine 
19  whether a crime is an aggravated felony.  And the 
elements of 7206 do not change when they go over to the 
20
21  immigration statute.  And the terms of that statute is 
22  basically as the Department of Justice has written in 
23  its Tax Manual.  It is basically a tax perjury statute. 
24  If you don't tell the truth, and you know what you're 
25

aggravated felony, specifically under (M)(i) of the 

saying is false, and you do it under oath, that's

Alderson Reporting Company

 There are other statutes, perjury statute, 

 MR. WHALEN:  It's the intention to deceive 

intentionally lying to convert that into fraud or 
deceit? 

1  perjury. 
2
3  which in essence says the same thing.  And 18 U.S.C. 
4  1001 is also a perjury statute.  And none of them 
require the Justice Department or a court to determine 
5
6  whether fraud and deceit was an element of that crime. 
7
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  How would you prove fraud 
8  and deceit beyond proving that the person lied, 
9  intentionally lied?  What -- what is added to 
10
11 
12
13  or the intention to defraud.  And simply --
14
15
16
17
18
19  are saying a false -- making a false statement, that 
20
21
22  definition of deceit is acting -- intentionally giving a 
23  false impression, intentionally giving a false 
24  impression with the intent that someone will act on it. 
So, it seems that's exactly what filing a false return 
25

 MR. WHALEN:  It does not, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't? 
 MR. WHALEN:  It does not mean, because you 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't intentionally 

lying -- doesn't that mean that you intend to deceive? 

that is evidence of an intent to deceive. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Whalen, the common

 MR. WHALEN:  Justice Ginsburg, the 

1  is.  You give a false impression of what your income is 
2  with the intent that the IRS will accept it. 
3
4  difference I'm trying to ask the Court to consider, it 
is the intent which is an element of fraud and deceit. 
5
6  Under section 7201, the tax evasion statute, that 
7  includes both a requirement or a finding of fraud and 
8  deceit.  Section 7206 does not. 
9
What proof would you need?  You submit a document 
10
11  because you want to convey a false impression for 
12  someone to act on.  Why do you have to have anything 
13  more than that to establish deceit? 
14
15
16  false statement.  That's all that's required.  The IRS, 
17  when they go after a taxpayer because they have not 
18  provided -- they have not disclosed all of their income, 
19  the IRS comes in, or rather the Department of Justice, 
20
21  don't have to prove --
22
23  And that it's willful. 
24
25

 MR. WHALEN:  Pardon me, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That it's willful. 

and all they have to prove is that it's false.  They 

 MR. WHALEN:  Because the requirements, Your 

Honor, of 7206 is a finding of -- of simply making a

 MR. WHALEN:  Yes, Your Honor, but as this
 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So, it's not correct.

 MR. WHALEN:  No, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, correct me if I'm 

indicating, would be a violation.  That's not the way I 
read it.  Now, have we said something other than that in 
later cases? 

1  Whoever willfully makes a false statement.
 
2
3  Court held --
4
5
6
7  wrong.  It would seem to me, just from reading the 
8  statute unless we have some gloss on, that if you think 
9  it's true but it's false, from the way you were 
10
11 
12 
13
14  Court has written in the Spies case, and specifically in 
15
16  tax offense under the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS or 
17  the Department of Justice must show it was done 
18  willfully.  Willfully is not intrinsic to any -- it's 
19  really intrinsic to all of the tax offenses. 
"Willfully"  does not mean deceit or fraud.  It simply 
20
21  means that the IRS cannot bring a criminal information 
22  or indictment against somebody who does something 
23  unintentionally.  They must do it willfully. 
24  "Willfully," as this Court defined in Bishop, is simply 
evidence that -- to commit any of these IRS crimes you

is false. 

 MR. WHALEN:  "Willfully" means 

1  must -- it must be shown to have been done willfully. 
2
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You must know that it's 
3  false when you say it.  Isn't that what "willfully" 
4  means?  You must know that the statement you're making 
5
6
7  intentionally.  The false, I submit --
8
9  adverb.
 MR. WHALEN:  No.  All right. 
10
11
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I want you to describe what 
12  it means in the context of a statement.  Doesn't it mean 
13  that you have to know that the statement you are making 
14  is false?  Isn't that enough for willfulness?
15
16
17  what deceit involves beyond that. 
18
19  induce somebody to act.  And what I'm arguing to this 
Court is that simply making a false statement under a 
20
21  tax perjury statute such as we have in this case does 
22  not meaning and does not evidence an intention to 
23  deceive or a finding. 
24
25

 MR. WHALEN:  That's what -- that -- yes. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  Now, you tell me

4  that the government is relying on your statement to
 
5
6  You don't see any reliance by the government on the 
7  truthful statements there and its collection of taxes? 
8
9  generally is what happens.  What I'm saying is that 7206 
is a perjury statute and the government does not have to 
10
11 
prove, and did not have to prove in this case, anything 
more than the -- the income was unreported or the tax --
12 
13 
the tax return was -- was false.  If --
14
15
16  the --
17
18  government was -- if the government wanted to prove 
19  fraud or deceit, they -- that would be an element of the 
20
21
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not even sure why, 
22  because under tax evasion you can be charged with tax 
23  evasion merely for avoiding the payment of tax.  You 
24  don't have to make a statement at all.  You can take the 
money from the bank, withdraw it openly, and stick it in 
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, it also had to prove 
that the government relied?  Is that what you're saying 

 MR. WHALEN:  I'm saying that the 

crime of tax evasion --

deceit in that? 

 MR. WHALEN:  And the --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where's the false and 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If there's a -- if there 
are cases that say otherwise, what does that do to your 

1  your mattress, refuse to pay, and if somehow they find 
2  your mattress, you can be charged with tax evasion. 
3
4

6
 MR. WHALEN:  The government would have to 
7  prove fraud or deceit, because an intent to evade is --
8  the Court -- the -- the government has to prove --
9
10
11  argument?  Of which there are many that say that the 
12  avoidance of taxes, tax payment, doesn't require an act 
13  of fraud or deceit? 
14

17  goes -- he goes to a country where we have no 
18  extradition treaty, takes all his assets and writes a 
19  postcard to the IRS every -- once a month saying

 (Laughter.) 
21
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, why wouldn't that 
22
23  be an attempt to evade?  That's why he went; he didn't 
24  like to pay his taxes.

ha-ha-ha. 

 MR. WHALEN:  I would be surprised by 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, suppose somebody 

 MR. WHALEN:  Then the government would bring

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, 7201.  Why can't 

false statement. 

1  an action under the --
2
3  you -- well, why doesn't that violate 7201?  I mean, my 
4  simple question really is you are a drafter, imagine you 
are a drafter, and you are charged with drafting section 
5
6  (43).  And you read -- you try to get the fraud and 
7  deceit crimes, okay?  So now we read 76 -- 7206(1) and 
8  (2).  And you see for both of those, you can't be 
9  convicted unless you materially and willfully make a 
10
11
 So, you think, hey, I don't need a special 
12  section on that one.  But then you go to 7201, and you 
13  say, oh, my God, I just thought, somebody might violate 
14  this by going off to some special country, taking all 
his assets and writing ha-ha-ha.  Now, there's no fraud 
15
16  and deceit in that.  He's totally open about it.  But he 
17  sure has evaded it.  So, therefore, I better write a 
18  special section. 
19
20
21
22  Honor, is that what we're talking about is the 
23  aggravated felony statute.  And the issue -- and it may 
24  be a narrow one for this Court -- is whether the 
25

conviction under 7206, which does not require anything 

 Now, that's the simple-minded argument, but 

what's wrong with it? 

 MR. WHALEN:  What's wrong with it, Your 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

aggravated felony. 

 If I may illustrate the point, if -- if a 

1  more than filing of a false statement without any intent 
2  to deceive or defraud -- whether that is an aggravated 
3  felony.  And this Court has said time and again that it 
4  is the elements of the offense that determines 
5
6
7  conviction under 7206 was viewed by this Court as 
8  including fraud and deceit for the reasons many of the 
9  Justices have indicated, that, you know, that when 
somebody writes a false tax return, it's got to be 
10
11 
deceit, what that does is that would collaterally estop 
a taxpayer from denying fraud and deceit in the civil 
12 
13 
collection action. 
14
concerned about, why he has filed his brief, that it in 
15
16  effect would undermine the ability of the government to 
17  get an easy conviction based simply on a false 
18  statement. 
19
evasion, the -- the tax evader cannot challenge fraud. 
20
21  He is collaterally estopped.  And as we know, when the 
22  government goes to seek recovery -- that is, getting the 
23  taxes back in a civil proceeding -- there's no statute 
24  of limitations.
25

 The intention of Congress is also reflected 

 So, this is what Commissioner Walters was 

 Similarly, if you are convicted of tax 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

conviction under 7206, the government has the burden of 

1  in the Internal Revenue Code section 6501, where if a 
2  person is convicted under 7206 and the government seeks 
3  to collect the unpaid taxes in an assessment proceeding, 
4  Congress particularly said that where there's a 
5
6  proving fraud, which seems to me to be evidence -- or 
7  rather, the government has the -- a duty to prove there 
8  was an attempt to evade the tax.  But the conclusion is 
9  the same.
 If Congress had intended that proof of fraud 
10
11  and deceit would be in 7206, there would be no reason at 
12  all for Congress to put that in 70 -- 6501. 
13  Therefore --

16
17  6501(c)(1).

 MR. WHALEN:  Yes.  I apologize for that, 

 So, in (M)(i), we have loss to victim or 

 I would like to move to the second part of 

my argument, if Your Honor please, that the -- this 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you have the text of it? 
 MR. WHALEN:  I --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't like counsel 

1

never put before us.  If you're going to rely on it, we

6  -- we would like to have the text somewhere. 
7
8  Your Honor. 
9
10
11  Court has been very clear on deciding statutes invoking 
12  canons of construction.  And one of the important canons 
13  is that different words have different meanings. 
14
victims in excess of $10,000, and in (M)(ii), we have a 
15
16  revenue loss to the government in excess of 10,000.  And 
17  as this Court said in Nijhawan, referring to (M)(ii), 
18  this is the Internal Revenue provision, a correct 
19  assessment I suggest, and that (M)(i) deals with 
injuries or damage to third parties, not to the 
20
21  government. 
22
23  fraud and deceit crimes are in -- fraud and deceit 
24  revenue crimes are in (M)(i), then (M)(ii) would be 
25

 If you take the government's position that 

worthless or pointless. 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, why?  Because it 

1
2  wouldn't be pointless if in fact an attempt to evade or 
3  defeat tax does not require a lie, does not require a 
4  willful lie.  It would be adding to the -- to the fraud 
and deceit offenses, 7201, which does not require a lie. 
5
6  It just requires, you know, going to Cuba and writing 
7  postcards saying, I know I owe money; I'm just not -- I 
8  just ain't gonna pay it.  There's no fraud and deceit 
9  there.  It's just what 7201 requires, an attempt to 
10
11
 MR. WHALEN:  Well, anyone who leaves the 
12  country with an intent to avoid tax is committing tax 
13  evasion. 
14
15
16
17
18  lying -- without making a single lie. 
19
such as you suggest, Your Honor, is going to be an 
20
21  aggravated felony.  It's the only one that Congress 
22  says -- only revenue offense, only offense under the 
23  Internal Revenue Code which Congress designated as an 
24  aggravated felony.
25

 MR. WHALEN:  And that is --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Without lying -- without 

 MR. WHALEN:  What I'm saying is that fraud, 

 What I'm saying is that if tax evasion were

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's right.  That's my 

very point.

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SCALIA:  An attempt to evade or 

 MR. WHALEN:  7201 involves, I'm suggesting 

1  also included in (M)(i), then Congress would have 
2  created a useless, pointless provision. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  And my point is that 
3
4  it would not have been included within (M)(i).  There is 
no way that it could be included with (M)(i), because it 
5
6  does not involve fraud or deceit.  It does not involve a 
7  lie, as 7206 does. 
8

10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
 (Laughter.) 
17
 MR. WHALEN:  Well, the point I am trying to 
18
19  make, Your Honor, is that if your example is an example 
of fraud and deceit, which I agree it is, then a crime 
20
21  of fraud and deceit would not be in (M)(i) because it 
22  would be -- it would already be captured in (M)(i) if 
23  the government's position was upheld. 
24
25

defeat -- "who willfully attempts in any manner to evade 
or defeat any tax."  And one can do that without lying. 
One can do that by simply not report income, for 
example.  Or in -- in Justice Breyer's more colorful 
example, by going to Cuba.  Was it Cuba or somewhere 
else? 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the point that was 

being made is not that it's fraud and deceit.  Quite the

 MR. WHALEN:  That would be a violation of 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would it be evasion 

 MR. WHALEN:  If the government chose to 

1  opposite.  I think Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor, 
2  Justice Scalia have tried to get you to focus on the 
3  evasion that involves no false statement at all, evading 
4  payment where you say nothing.  What would be the crime 
if you simply don't pay your taxes, and you don't file a 
5
6  return, so you are not filing anything that's false? 
7  Where would that come in the Internal Revenue --
8
9  one of the other Internal Revenue crimes.
10
11  simply not to report your income? 
12
13  prove that it was an attempt to evade the tax, it would. 
14  The Internal Revenue's statute and crimes all carry the 
15
16  reporting our income, our deductions, what have you. 
17  It's the same legal duty whether it's in 7201 or 7206. 
 The difference is, in tax evasion, there 
18
19  must be a proof of fraud or deceit.  That's inherent. 
20
21  of the tax statutes, Congress has always separated 
22  revenue statutes from other crimes.  In this case, 
23  (M)(i) deals with crimes involving third parties; 
24  (M)(ii) deals with revenue loss crimes to the 
government.  Only (i) is an aggravated felony.

From the beginning of this country -- rather, beginning 

duty to -- it's a legal duty we all have of fairly

 MR. GANNON:  Just not filing a return is 

evasion.  That would be an offense under 7203, which 
doesn't necessarily involve fraud or deceit.  The thing 
that distinguishes 7201 is the need for the government 
to establish that there is an attempt to evade either 
the assessment or payment of taxation.

1  of those cases will often involve some concealment along 
2  the way.  If somebody's taking more than $10,000 in gold

16  confuses me is that when somebody is convicted of 7201, 
17  they can't -- they're estopped from contesting a civil 
18  fraud suit; isn't that right?  And it also counts as a 
19  crime of moral turpitude, which involves fraud.  And all 
20
21  as a whole suggest, that tax evasion involves fraud. 
22
23  of the civil tax fraud penalty, the Tax Court has 
24  concluded that intent to evade is synonymous with an 
25

understatement due to fraud.  And the reason why it has 

of those things suggest, and I think kind of the cases 

 MR. GANNON:  Well, certainly in the context 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, I suppose what 

18
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 I'd also note that it's not at all clear 

begin with.  And so, there could not have been an 

1  refused to reach that conclusion in the context of 7206 
2  offenses, like the ones at issue in this case, is 
3  because the 7206 offense does not require the government 
4  to have proved that there was any understatement to 
5
6  understatement due to fraud. 
7
8  that in the context of the evasion of payment cases that 
9  I was just discussing in the context of tax evasion, 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19
20
21
22  any tax provisions that you think are not covered by the 
23  fraud and deceit section and the tax evasion section? 
24
25

that the same civil tax fraud penalty would be 
applicable there, because the civil tax fraud penalty is 
triggered by an understatement of an amount required to 
be shown on the return.  And, therefore, if it isn't --
if it isn't actually something that's done in the 
context of filing a tax return that understates how much 
you owe the government, then -- then that may well not 
trigger the collateral estoppel effect in the follow-on 
civil case. 

 MR. GANNON:  You mean --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Any tax crime.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does that fall under tax 

parts of 7202, which is the willful failure to collect 

 MR. GANNON:  Any tax crime --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Felonies, I should say. 
 MR. GANNON:  There are several tax offenses 

1
2
3
4  that don't necessarily involve fraud or deceit.  So, 
5
6  tax, would not necessarily involve fraud and deceit, but 
7  it also covers failing to truthfully account for 
8  collected tax.  So, some of those offenses would involve 
9  fraud or deceit, and it may be divisible.  7203, which I 
10
11
12  evasion, or that's a separate statute? 
13
14  only thing that counts as tax evasion is 7201.
15
16  are the other ones? 
17
18  mentioned to Justice Scalia that section 7203 -- all of 
19  these offenses I'm talking about are in 26 U.S.C.; 7203,

21  maintain records or supply information doesn't 
22  necessarily involve fraud or deceit.  Parts of 7204, 
23  which is failing to furnish a statement to the employee 
24  reflecting the amount of taxes, but not -- but then, 
again, I think it could be divisible because it would 
25

 MR. GANNON:  That's not tax evasion.  The

what is your answer to your friend's 6501(c)(i) 

it's only used when the tax deficiencies are de minimis. 

1  also apply to furnishing a false statement to your 
2  employee.  Even the misdemeanor offense under 7207 for 
3  presenting false documents might be covered for fraud or 
4  deceit, but in practice it's only used when there's --
5
6  And so, it would never trigger the $10,000 loss 
7  requirement that (M)(i) would also require us to 
8  establish in order to make it an aggravated felony. 
9
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, what --
10
11  argument? 
12
13  think it proves really any more than the collateral 
14  estoppel cases in the civil fraud context.  The 
provision that we're talking about is not reprinted in 
15
16  any of the briefs, but 6501(c)(1) is an exception that 
17  -- that lifts the limitation on when the IRS can levy an 
18  assessment or seek collection; and it refers to the case 
19  of a false or fraudulent return with the intent to evade 
tax.  And I think that in context, the reference to a 
20
21  false or fraudulent return with intent to evade tax is 
22  not something that clearly connotes that Congress is 
23  just speaking to 7206 offenses.  It uses not only the 
24  word "fraudulent," but also "the intent to evade tax," 
25

which I think --

21
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

have had to add "with the intent to evade tax," which is 

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I -- I think if you look 

Official 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, no, but I 

1
2  think your friend's argument, which has some appeal, is 
3  7206 is fraud and false statements.  And he said if 
4  you're right that that includes deceit, they wouldn't 
5
6  what they do in 6501(c)(1). 
7
8  to (c)(2), it also refers to a willful attempt in any 
9  manner to defeat or evade tax.  So, the next provision 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21 
22 
23 
24
25

also applies more broadly to 7201 and more closely 
tracks the definition in 7201.  So, I think just like 
the statute of limitations provision that we note, 
Congress is probably using a belt and suspenders 
approach there, that -- we noted that Congress may well 
have had reason to be concerned that 7201 offenses would 
not necessarily be seen as having fraud or deceit as an 
element of the offense in light of this Court's decision 
in Scharton, which was an old case, but it had said that 
in the -- in the statute of limitations context, that 
the -- the extended statute of limitations that apply to 
offenses in which fraud was an element was not triggered 
by the statutory predecessor to tax evasion.  And so, to 
the --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But Scharton was a very old 
case which had been distinguished away by many courts. 

22
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. GANNON:  Well, to this day section 6531, 

do reprint in our appendix, includes provisions that 

offenses but also tax evasion offenses in 6531, makes it 
unsurprising that they would have pursued a similar 
approach here.  In addition, I would --

1  It really has no power in the -- in the -- I mean, tell 
2  me if I'm wrong, but --
3
4  which is the statute of limitations provision which we 
5
6  refer not only generally to offenses involving fraud but 
7  also specifically to a tax evasion offense.  And so, I 
8  think that the fact that Congress had already felt like 
9  it needed to be expressed, to pull in not just fraud 
10
11 
12 
13
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, the paradoxical 
14  thing about your argument is that, one, it makes us 
think that Congress was just being hypervigilant about 
15
16  this problem of making sure that tax evasion offenses 
17  were covered, even though tax evasion offenses almost 
18  always do involve fraud or deceit, but Congress was 
19  thinking about these hypothetical possibilities that 
maybe there was going to be some conviction out there 
20
21  that would not involve fraud or deceit, and so Congress 
22  is being super-careful about this; and yet, at the same 
23  time, that Congress is being utterly careless, utterly 
24  clueless about the basic rule of statutory construction 
which is that one does not write superfluous language.

thing is true in paragraph (E)(i); it pulls in various 
explosives offenses including arson, destruction of 
property or building by fire or explosives; that's the 
reference to an 8441 --

 MR. GANNON:  But, Justice Kagan, we don't 
1
2  think it's superfluous, in part because of the evasion 
3  of payment cases we're talking about, but I think also 
4  if you look at the context of the rest of paragraph 
(43), the aggravated felony definition, you'll see that 
5
6  there are several other provisions that have significant 
7  overlap in them.  And so subparagraph (A) refers to 
8  murder and rape; those would also generally be covered 
9  in crimes of violence in subparagraph (F).  The same 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  statute is that superfluity doesn't matter? 
17
18  in context, there is a lot of overlap among the 
19  different provisions in -- in paragraph (43) already, 
20
21  and (ii), which like (M)(i) and (M)(ii), are ones that 
22  have little (i), which has a generic reference there to 
23  offenses associated with managing a prostitution 
24  business, and little (ii) then expressly refers to 
certain enumerated Federal statutes, all of which 
25

and I -- I was also going to mention subparagraph (K)(i) 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, our rule of statutory 
construction when it comes to this aggravated felony 

 MR. GANNON:  No, Justice Kagan, I think that 

24
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And I think that virtually all of those
 

offenses would have been included within (K)(i), but 

1  involve transporting individuals for purposes of
 
2  prostitution in the case of seeking commercial
 
3  advantage.
 
4
5
6  Congress wanted to be sure and, therefore, added 
7  (K)(ii).  And as -- as Justice Breyer, I think, pointed 
8  out before, textually it -- it had reason to think that 
9  7206 would be picked up by fraud or deceit here in --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But 7206 is the lesser 
10
offense.  I mean, you don't take -- you don't dispute 
11 
that the heavier crime is the 7201 crime; that is, 
12 
13 
evasion.  It gets a more severe penalty.  And when 
Congress picks out one tax crime and one tax crime only, 
14 
why wouldn't we assume that that's what Congress meant 
15
with respect to aggravated felonies?  That there's one 
16 
17 
tax crime, the most serious tax crime, that fits that 
label.  And the (M)(i) provision deals with the many, 
18 
many statutes that involve loss -- fraud or deceit and 
19 
loss to the victim? 
20
21
22  that's appropriate is in part because, as I've 
23  explained, there would -- there is some aspect of which 
24  (M)(ii) is not superfluous.  But, more importantly, we 
don't think that the specific controls -- the general 
25

 MR. GANNON:  The reason why we don't think

service organizations in HCSC-Laundry or DUI offenses in 

 And so, here we don't have Congress actually 

1  canon is triggered here, and we don't think that (M)(ii) 
2  talks about a category of tax crimes or tax offenses 
3  more generally, because it only refers to one offense. 
 And so, the cases that Petitioners invoke 
4
here, in order to establish that there is a category 
5
6  that's being pulled out of (M)(i), are HCSC-Laundry and 
7  Leocal.  Those are both cases in which the statute 
8  actually identified the category of offenses in 
9  question, whether it was the cooperative hospital 
10
11  Leocal. 
12
13  saying tax offenses are covered by (M)(ii).  What it 
14  says is tax evasion is covered by (M)(ii).  And --
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
 So, we read 7206; it doesn't say anything 
20
21  about fraud or deceit.  It says perjury and making a 
22  false statement.  So, then we go look up what were the 
23  torts of fraud and deceit.  And he's right.  Fraud 
24  traditionally requires an intent to get another person 
25

JUSTICE BREYER:  But what about -- what 
about -- suppose that didn't even exist here, 7201. 
Suppose we only had 7206, and the question before us 
was, does 7206 fit within the term "aggravated felony"; 
i.e., does it involve fraud or deceit?

to act, but you don't have to have that intent to 

26
 

Alderson Reporting Company

his detriment.  Fraud, you have the first of those and 

1  violate 7206.  And deceit -- it not only involves that; 
2  it also involves the person having acted. 
 So, the traditional tort of deceit, you have 
3
4  to intend the acts, and he actually has to have acted to 
5
6  second.  You read the statute and say, well, say neither 
7  of those is present here.  This is just perjury, which 
8  isn't good, but it's not fraud or deceit.  And there we 
9  are, not in the statute.  What's the answer to that?
 MR.  GANNON:  Well, I don't think that the 
10
11  common law definitions of fraud and deceit are the ones 
12  that this Court has always applied in the context --
13
14  here we were dealing with a very serious statute, 
15
16  the persons who fall within it. 
17
 MR. GANNON:  And --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So -- and in most of these 
18
19  M's and A's and B's and C's, and so forth, they refer to 
statutes by number so most of it, though not all of it, 
20
21  is very specific.  So, when we read these words "fraud" 
22  and "deceit" here, why don't we say fraud and deceit 
23  means fraud and deceit? 
24
25

 MR. GANNON:  Well, in the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  The traditional elements. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, not always.  But 

aggravated felonies.  That has terrible consequences for 

27
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no. 
 MR. GANNON:  -- and I want to recover.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  You have to prove that the 

 MR. GANNON:  In the criminal context, the 
1
2  Court has recognized that fraud offenses don't require 
3  the government to prove reliance or damages.  And that 
4  makes sense.  If you think about the tort action, the 
classic tort action, you would need to be an injured 
5
6  plaintiff; and, therefore, you would need to be able to 
7  say I relied on this to my detriment --
8
9
10
11  -- the liar intended reliance to -- to his detriment. 
12
 MR. GANNON:  And --
13
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Which he may or may not 
14  have done.  I mean, when you commit -- a person who 
commits perjury may or may not have intended that a 
15
16  victim rely to his detriment.  Which you don't have to 
17  prove here. 
18
19  separate element that there's reliance or intended 
20
21  satisfies the plain meaning of the term "deceit."  We're 
22  not focusing on fraud here but deceit, and that's the 
23  act of intentionally giving a false impression, because 
24  the elements of this offense are making and signing a 
return under the penalties of perjury that it is false 
25

 MR. GANNON:  We do not have to prove as a 

reliance here, but we do need to prove what we think 

28
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Deceit can mean that. 

 MR. GANNON:  -- does not believe to be true 

or correct, and it's all done willfully. 

 MR. GANNON:  That -- that's right, and we 

think here Congress has used the -- the term --

1  as to a material matter, that the defendant does not --
2
3  You're absolutely right. 
4
5
6
 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, the tort didn't involve 
7  that.  The tort involved the same element of fraud which 
8  you don't want to rely on. 
9
10
11
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there any -- is there 
12  any evidence of what -- I mean is there any argument 
13  other than that you just think that and you could argue 
14  the other way?  I mean, can we get anywhere?
 MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that Congress did 
15
16  use the terms disjunctively here.  And I think that now 
17  the plain meaning of "deceit" is -- it sort of operates 
18  in the opposite direction of the one that you're talking 
19  about, Justice Breyer.  And if you look at the way the 
20
21  intent to defraud and intent to deceive, it talks about 
22  an intent to defraud includes actually obtaining 
23  something, whereas an intent to deceive just involves 
24  creating a false impression.  And so, I think that 
25

actually the difference can run the other direction in a 

Court in Yermian discussed the difference between an 

29
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could I make sure, 

 But going back to the point that I was 

1  way that supports the definition that we're relying upon 
2  here. 
3
4  trying to make about this not ruling out all tax 
offenses, Justice Ginsburg, I think that the reference 
5
6  to 7201 alone doesn't do that, nor do we think the fact 
7  that Congress then added a limited -- limiting language 
8  that said that when the revenue loss exceeds $10,000, it 
9  would satisfy (M)(ii).
10
11  Mr. Gannon, that I understand your argument about 
12  superfluity?  Because when I asked whether (M) -- the 
13  second provision was superfluous, you pointed me to 
14  these evasion-of-payment cases.  And you cite two of 
them.  But then you say even those cases will almost 
15
16  invariably involve some affirmative acts of fraud.  So, 
17  are there, in fact, any cases, evasion of payment or 
18  otherwise, which do not involve some affirmative acts of 
19  fraud?
20
21  factual matter, Justice Kagan.  We were --
22
23  there any? 
24

factual matter, those evasion-of-payment cases probably 

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that's as a

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I know, but we have a very 

require deceptive acts of concealment.  And so, that's 
the reason --

1  would not happen without there being acts of 
2  concealment, but that doesn't --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And that's what I'm asking. 
3
4  As a factual matter, can you point me to any cases that 
5
6
 MR. GANNON:  I don't believe that I can, but 
7  I think that to the extent that the Court is looking to 
8  the elements of the offense in 7201, if they're talking 
9  about evasion of payment, that will not necessarily 
10
11 
12
13  active IRS, which prosecutes lots of tax cases, and 
14  you're saying that it just never prosecutes tax cases 
under this section that don't involve affirmative acts 
15
16  of fraud. 
17
18
19  Congress was so worried about this problem that it 
ignored normal rules of statutory interpretation. 
20
21
22  reason that they were worried could be because of the 
23  Scharton decision, in which this Court had already said 
24  that evasion does not necessarily require fraud, because 
the textual cues in 7201 are much further from fraud and 
25

 MR. GANNON:  Well --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And that makes me wonder why 

 MR. GANNON:  Well -- and I believe that the 

31
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

compared with fraud, this is also a provision that 

1  deceit than those in 7206; that there's also -- there
 
2  would be less certainty.  Even assuming that Congress
 
3  was well aware of the established practice at the
 
4  Federal level of having 7201 tax evasion cases be
 
5
6  applies to State and foreign offenses.  The penultimate 
7  sentence of paragraph (43) says that the term applies to 
8  an offense whether it's in violation of Federal or State 
9  law.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that was one of the 
10
11  problems that was brought up in the amicus brief which 
12  actually you considered, that reading the (M)(i) to 
13  include 7206 offenses would also -- would bring in 
14  offenses that are merely misdemeanors at the State and 
local level.  It would really swell the category of tax 
15
16  crimes that lead to deportation.  That -- did Congress 
17  really mean to turn misdemeanors into aggravated felons? 
18
19  made, that the government is going to be hurt more than 
helped by what you are seeking, because we are told that 
20
21  very often the government will try to make a bargain. 
22  It has a 7201 case, but it's going to be a little hard 
23  to prove.  So, they offer as a plea bargain 7206.  And 
24  if you -- if your position prevails, we are told, there 
25

 And then there was a very practical point 

will be many, many people who will say:  If it's a 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. GANNON:  Well, that may well be the 

petition appendix says Mr. Kawashima recognizes that he 
may be deported as a result of his conviction.  That's 
in his plea agreement to the 7206 offense here. 

1  question of whether I get thrown out of the United 
2  States, I'm going to go to trial; I'm not going to plead 
3  to something that will mean immediately when I serve my 
4  time I will be thrown out of the United States.
5
6  consequence of the definition that Congress has adopted 
7  here of aggravated felony.  And I would note that in the 
8  plea agreement that Mr. Kawashima filed in this case, 
9  paragraph 4, which is reprinted on page 117a of the 
10
11 
12 
13
14  government may well find it more difficult to secure 
guilty pleas when an alien is -- is admitting to an 
15
16  offense that is an aggravated felony.  But we think that 
17  that's a consequence of Congress having expanded the 
18  definition.  In --
19
20
21  falls within it, 7206, this fraud, what about perjury? 
22  Is every perjury statute within it?  And what about 
23  lying to an FBI agent?  And what about lying to a 
24  government official, which is -- which is -- you know, 
25

 And so, it is, to be sure, the case that the 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Let me go up to start with 

Justice Ginsburg's first question.  I mean, if this 

there are all kinds of statutes on that one. 

33
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. GANNON:  Well --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Are all those aggravated
 

 MR. GANNON:  Congress has given us two
 
different metrics for determining whether those --

1
2
3  felonies?
 
4
5
6  whether those offenses are aggravated felonies.  If they 
7  involve fraud or deceit and there is loss to the victim 
8  exceeding $10,000 --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, yes.
9
 MR. GANNON:  -- then that it could fall 
10
11  within (M)(i).  If it's perjury statute that doesn't 
12  involve loss or a false statement to an FBI agent that 
13  doesn't involve loss to --
14
15
16  requirements.  But as far as the words "fraud" or 
17  "deceit" is concerned, aggravated felony picks up every 
18  perjury statute, every lying statute, lying to an FBI 
19  agent, lying to this or lying to that.  And has that 
20
21  Have they deported people where the other two conditions 
22  are fulfilled?

 MR. GANNON:  It does not need to be an

 MR. GANNON:  It needs to be tied to the

 And Petitioner's reading of saying that all 

 The same is true for mail fraud.  The 

1  FBI agent probably don't involve costing somebody more 
2  than $10,000.  And so, I think that it doesn't often 
3  come up in (M)(i).  But many other tax offenses are 
4  prosecuted under other provisions that potentially 
involve fraud or deceits and could -- can cost the 
5
6  government more than $10,000. 
7
8  tax offenses have to be pulled into (M)(ii) and then 
9  only tax evasion is covered would require the Court to

19  cases in which somebody mails a false tax return under 
20
21  conspiracy to false claims under 286, false statements 
22  to the government -- these are all provisions that are 
23  used to prosecute tax offenses.  And Petitioner's 
24  reading of saying that all tax crimes are pulled out 
25

bifurcate all of these other provisions.  And I'm 
thinking of, for instance, 18 U.S.C. 371.  This is the 
provision for defrauding the United States by 
obstructing or impeding the IRS in its efforts to 
collect taxation.  This Court cited 371 as one of the 
fraud offenses that it thought was covered by (M)(i) in 
the Nijhawan decision. 

18 U.S.C. 1341.  False claims under 18 U.S.C. 287, 

would require the Court to bifurcate these offenses and 

36
 

Alderson Reporting Company

stating that tax evasion was expressly covered.
 

 And going back, Justice Kagan, to your
 

light of the Scharton decision, in light of the 
evasion-of-payment cases because, even though as a 
factual matter --

1  make whether it's an aggravated felony turn on whether 
2  the government has lost revenue as opposed to some other 
3  form of money.  And we don't think that that's what 
4  Congress intended when it went to the trouble of just 
5
6
7  concerns about superfluity, I do think it's important
 
8  that in the context of this statute, there's lots of
 
9  other overlap.  Congress had reasons to be unsure in
 
10
11 
12 
13
14  perfectly easy for Congress to write a provision which 
said just in case that you -- you know, just in case 
15
16  this decision called Scharton has any effect, we mean 
17  tax evasion, too, without writing it in this way that 
18  appears to exclude all other tax offenses. 
 MR. GANNON:  I don't see how -- if Congress 
19
wanted to exclude all other tax offenses, I think they 
20
21  should have put that exception in (M)(i).  They should 
22  have said offenses involving fraud or deceit, but not 
23  tax offenses, in which the loss to the victim or victims 
24  exceeds $10,000.  If Congress wanted to make an

 And so, if you were to say that the 

 MR. GANNON:  Well, yes.  I agree that the 
Court avoids superfluity where it can.  Here we have 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that's just arguing 
1
2  against our application of the normal rule of avoiding 
3  superfluity where we can. 
4
5
6  contextual reasons to think that Congress was just 
7  trying to add more offenses to the definition rather 
8  than rule out an entire class.  And I also think that 
9  there is no way to avoid the consequence of bifurcating 
10
11  reading. 
12
13  reference to 7201 pulls out all revenue loss offenses, 
14  that would mean that some mail fraud cases against the 
government in which the government loses more than 
15
16  $10,000 count and some don't.  Same for wire fraud. 
17  Same for false statements.  Same for false claims, 
18  conspiracy to false claims, and Klein conspiracies under 
19  section 371, which -- which are -- have a great deal of

22  Why?  They still wouldn't be tax offenses.

1  of the mail to defraud.
 
2
3  understand Petitioner's argument, it is the fact that
 
4  (M)(ii) refers to revenue loss that is the thing that
 
makes it pull in or define a category of cases involving 
5
6  tax offenses.  And I think that if a mail fraud offense 
7  against the government involved taking -- getting more 
8  than $10,000 worth of refunds from the government as 
9  opposed to getting more than $10,000 in an ill-gotten

21  other tax provisions --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it's not just that. 
22
23  It's -- it's also that -- that (M)(i) says loss to the 
24  victim or victims.  And (M)(ii) says the revenue loss to 
25

 MR. GANNON:  Then I just don't see how the 
reference to a single provision of 7201 refers to all 

covered. 

 MR. GANNON:  Well, that --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Then -- then you wouldn't 

the government has to exceed 10,000.  I mean, in one 

39
 

Alderson Reporting Company

involves fraud or deceit or (ii) is described in section 

 And I find it hard to regard the government 

as a victim in any of these cases, to tell you the 

1  case, it's the loss to the victim or victims.  Why --
2  why did it use parallel language?  Why -- or why did it 
3  say an offense that involves -- an offense in which the 
4  loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000 and (i) 
5
6  7201 of Title 26?  I mean, if -- if you read it, it 
7  seems to contrast loss to the victim or victims with 
8  revenue loss to the government. 
9
10
11  truth. 
12
 MR. GANNON:  Well, I -- none of the courts 
13  of appeals has had any difficulty concluding that the 
14  government is a victim when it loses more than $10,000 
in a fraud case or, indeed, in a tax evasion case.  And 
15
16  so, here, there is a different phrase, but I think 
17  what's important is that 7201 doesn't define a class of 
18  revenue loss offenses.  Instead, it defines a class of 
19  tax evasion offenses.  It only refers to the one 
statute.  And -- and then in that context, where there 
20
21  has to be a deficiency in order to -- for there to be a 
22  7201 conviction, there must be a tax deficiency.  Then 
23  it's natural to talk about the relevant losses being 
24  revenue loss to the government.
25

 The phrase in (M)(i) is broader because it 

40
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 As Justice Ginsburg mentioned before, 

1  also applies to other types of frauds.  And I think that 
2  the reference to 7201 alone doesn't indicate Congress is 
3  intending to read out all tax offenses. 
4
although 7201 has a 5-year maximum statutory penalty, 
5
6  which is longer than the 3-year maximum that applies 
7  under 7206 and some of the other tax offenses in that 
8  particular chapter of Title 26, as a practical matter 
9  the -- the sentencing guidelines use the same thing, the 
-- the same criteria that are both tied to loss.  And 
10
11  more importantly, a lot of these other offenses, like 
12  371 and 1341 and 1343 in Title 18, actually have longer 
13  maximum punishments. 
14
15
16  somebody who has a tax evasion case in which they've 
17  cost the government a great deal of money, it may choose 
18  to proceed under one of the other provisions where it 
19  can get an even greater punishment.  And so, just 
20
21  it to be a stand-in for all other tax offenses. 
22
23  aspect of this case I don't understand.  Maybe you can 
24  explain it.  There was a question about what might be 
the revenue loss in -- in the case of the wife.  Why

 MR. WHALEN:  My colleague mentioned the

4  present it to the Court today.  And it's a very 
important case decided by this Court, which said that

7  not evidence, of an intent to deceive. 
 Similarly, the Harry Bridges case, as also

22  from loss to a victim or victims; and the specific

 The answer of the Government is simply 
speculation and conjecture of, among other things, 

cognizance to different words mean different things; 

 And these cases, I believe, of this Court

 I would like to remind the Court, as many of 

 The position of the Government in this case 

is simply that tax evasion may not be in 72 -- or may

 If there are no further questions, I --

question, that the Nugent case said that you must 

because the government and the taxpayer agreed that 

1  representing immigrants deal with the government in 
2  order to avoid deportation.  And that -- in this case 
3  whether the Kawashimas in fact had filed false returns 
4  in an attempt to deceive, that was by the boards, 
5
6  their offense would be solely 7206, which as you read 
7  the elements -- and you can read the Justice Department 
8  handbook which tells you what the elements are, and it 
9  does not include fraud and deceit.
10
11  finally, I would like to mention one case which hasn't 
12  been brought up, which evolved from the questions by the 
13  Justices, and that is a Third Circuit case which we 
14  cited, Nugent, mentioned in response to Justice Breyer's

16  fulfill both elements, that is perjury, (S) under the 
17  statute, and if it's included in fraud and deceit, you 
18  must fulfill the elements of both crimes at issue. 
 And, of course, in this case, the Kawashimas 
19
did not -- were imprisoned for 4 months and did not meet 
20
21  the statutory requirement for an aggravated felony of 1 
22  year.
