McALLISTER                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 MR. McALLISTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may        it please the Court:                The joint sentencing proceeding in these      cases did not violate the Eighth Amendment because each         defendant received the individualized sentencing     determination to which he was entitled.                  Each presented all of the mitigating      evidence he chose to produce. The jury instructions         explicitly told the jury to consider each defendant        individually. In fact, there were several separate        instructions, some that related only to one defendant or         only to another defendant.                Each ­­ the jury for each defendant then had         to complete a specific verdict form, and this jury had           already proven its ability to distinguish between these        two defendants when it convicted one of some counts in          the original guilt phase, of which it acquitted the         other. Alderson Reporting Company Official             The only way the Kansas Supreme Court gets        to an Eighth Amendment error in this case ­­ well,          really, there are two points. One, it relied upon          possible, and one instance not even, violations or        errors of State law to find a prejudice that ­­ that            rose to an Eighth Amendment level. And two, it          disregarded altogether, with really no explanation, the       long­standing foundational principle that juries are      presumed to follow their instructions.                 The two State law errors, arguably, that ­­       the Kansas Supreme Court found, one was the admission of          evidence of the sister who made the comment about         Reginald may have told me he shot those people.                     Well, that's not even an error of State law.         They said basically that's prejudicial. It might not         have come in if they had been tried separately, but in           fact, that evidence would be relevant to aggravator        number , that the defendant killed multiple people.        That would have been admissible evidence and that ­­        that just can't be an Eighth Amendment violation.                    JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Kansas ­­ the        Kansas Court found independent of the severance question        that there was constitutional error in the admission of         hearsay.             MR. McALLISTER: That's the third question       Alderson Reporting Company Official presented in the cert position on which the Court has          not taken any action yet, Your Honor.                   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But when it goes         back to Kansas, they can still say thank you for telling           us about severance, but we have this other ground that          leads to the same bottom line.                  MR. McALLISTER: Well, and we are certainly        hopeful that the Court will take another look at that          second question depending on its resolution of the two         questions that are in front of it today.                                JUSTICE KENNEDY: But would ­­     MR. McALLISTER: But if it goes back in that          posture, yes, they would have another ground.                   JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was ­­ was any evidence        introduced with respect to one of the defendants that         could not have been introduced against the other had         there been severance?               MR. McALLISTER: The only arguable evidence       really, Justice Kennedy, is what ­­ what Reginald refers         to as the corrupting influence. But even that,         arguably, would be relevant to the mercy consideration        to show his character, the nature of this person that is           being sentenced.              And that was the notion that his mother        testified that sometimes ­­ of course, Jonathan looked        Alderson Reporting Company Official up to his big brother, and maybe sometimes Reginald was          a bad influence on him. But that's ­­ that was really            the extent of that evidence. And that might have come           in as a rebuttal to a mercy argument.                       The Kansas Supreme Court did not really      definitively say that was even State law error, but even          if you assumed it was ­­                             law.             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me ­­       MR. McALLISTER: ­­ it would only be State         JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ what the      constitutional standard you're asking us to apply? I ­­          this argument goes to harmless error; a serious position          to take, that even if there was error, no foul ­­ a foul              but no penalty. Okay?                 But what standard are we applying? We are         not applying the rule ­­ or are we or should we apply            the Rule standard?                MR. McALLISTER: No, not ­­ not for Eighth         Amendment purposes, Your Honor. Kansas would propose ­­        and I suspect the United States can propose something as           well, but it's a very high standard as an Eighth           Amendment matter. And we would say ­­ we would be           content to accept something like it's a serious risk          that a defendant will not be able to receive          Alderson Reporting Company Official individualized sentencing. It is sort of molding the         traditional notions of joinder with the Eighth Amendment        consideration, because that seems to be the only Eighth         Amendment consideration here, is the individualized      sentencing.             JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it the Eighth Amendment        or is it due process?                 MR. McALLISTER: Well, you could use a due          process standard, Justice Scalia, which we would also be         fine with. The question would really be, did joinder so           infect the process with unfairness that the proceedings        are fundamentally unfair.               JUSTICE SCALIA: That seems like a ­­ a          language that is relevant rather than the cruel and         unusual punishments language.               MR. McALLISTER: Well, and that's exactly       what this Court said in Romano v. Oklahoma, a case in            which the defendant's other death sentence in a separate          case was admitted against the defendant in the        sentencing proceeding. That sentence later got       reversed, and the Oklahoma court said the jury should         not have heard about his other sentence as a matter of            State law. That defendant Romano said it is an Eighth           Amendment violation, and it's a due process violation.         The Court said the Eighth Amendment doesn't have        Alderson Reporting Company Official anything to say about what's admissible really. That is          State evidentiary rules, that's not an Eighth Amendment        issue.             And the Court went on to address the due         process claim in Romano, applying that very standard.        And as we suggest the Court should do here, one of the            things it pointed to specifically was jury instructions        that said these are the aggravating circumstances you        may consider, you may not consider any others. The          court said we presume the jury follows its instructions,         and nothing in the instructions gave the jury here any          way to give effect to that improperly admitted evidence.                     And that's true here to the extent Reginald        Carr argues some of this evidence was really used as a           nonstatutory aggravating circumstance. By statute,      Kansas does not allow anything other than statutory        aggravating circumstances. In the instructions ­­ No.         I think for Reginald, No. for Jonathan ­­ very           explicitly and clearly say, here are the four        aggravating circumstances the State has alleged. And        then the next paragraph, you may not consider anything         else as an aggravating circumstance.                 So in our view, the most the Kansas Supreme         Court could come up with is potential violation of State          law if, in fact, the evidence which is minimal in the           Alderson Reporting Company Official greater scheme of this proceeding that Reginald was a         corrupting influence on Jonathan, if that would not have         been admitted, that's really all the Kansas Supreme        Court is left with to hang its hat on in finding ­­ in             saying there is an Eighth Amendment violation here.                    JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me if you're         aware, in other States or perhaps even in Kansas in          other trials, is it a common practice to sever when           there ­­ for the penalty phase when there are multiple          defendants?             MR. McALLISTER: Justice Kennedy, I think in         the briefs ­­ I do not remember the exact page ­­ there             are two States that mandate severance ­­ one, Ohio ­­         and that's, I think, Georgia and Mississippi.                    JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is just for penalty        phase?             MR. McALLISTER: I think it's for the entire          proceeding. And then Ohio, there is a presumption in           the favor of severance, but all the other States, there          is nothing that mandates or even, I think, creates a           presumption of ­­              JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems it would be very         difficult for the trial judge to decide which should go          first.             MR. McALLISTER: It would, and that's one of         Alderson Reporting Company Official the reasons ­­ I mean, not just judicial economy but, in            a sense, overall fairness ­­                            JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.    MR. McALLISTER: ­­ having them tried       together and you don't have one defendant having an         opportunity to preview the evidence that the State may         present and the arguments that may be made. This Court           has recognized that potential tactical advantage in       other joinder cases. Of course, it has not had a           joinder capital case like this, but in other        circumstances that's a factor.                 The Court has also emphasized the      consistency of determinations with respect to facts. We         are not saying the outcomes have to be the same, but           when the evidence, the mitigation evidence is percent         overlapping ­­ they were using the same witnesses, even         their experts were co­authors. They were testifying to         the exact same things essentially about each brother.                    All that overlapping evidence, what this      allows is a consistent determination by the jury and          evaluation of all that mitigating evidence that leads to         whatever outcome the jury decides. But the jury was          very clearly told to consider each defendant       individually. And that's what they got, was individual         consideration. Alderson Reporting Company Official                  I would say also, remember, even if this    Court were to think there were some kind of error which           Kansas simply does not see here ­­ again, at most,          possibly an error of Kansas law, not an Eighth Amendment          violation ­­ it would have to be harmless under any          standard, and Kansas would accept any standard that is         beyond a reasonable doubt certainly here. Given the          four uncontested aggravating circumstances ­­                JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you'd also have to        look ­­ you have it at the top of your head, maybe            forget if you don't, but what I thought I would do is I               wanted to look to the aggravating circumstances, what        were they.                          MR. McALLISTER: What were they.      JUSTICE BREYER: Let's call it "he was the         monster" approach. Reginald was the monster and        Jonathan was the puppet or whatever. I want to look at             the aggravators. I also want to look at the mitigators            that Reginald said existed, and then see if this         comparative monster, let's call it, fits into any of         them.             Do you know? Do you know the pages where          they are, just by chance?                 MR. McALLISTER: Well, I think the ­­ in          terms of the ­­ yes, the aggravating circumstances are         Alderson Reporting Company Official set forth in the instructions, Justice Breyer, so ­­                    are.             JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I know where they          MR. McALLISTER: Yeah, Instruction No. for         Reginald and Instruction No. for Jonathan, and then          following each one, so I believe Instruction No. and            Instruction No. .                 But the mitigating ­­ those are the     statutory mitigating circumstances. So what happens in        these cases is the jury is told, here are the statutory.           And we list all of them that are listed in the Kansas            statute. And then you can ­­                  them?             JUSTICE BREYER: On what page do you list         MR. McALLISTER: Well, so those are listed        in Instruction No. and Instruction No. . It's all in             the petition ­­              JUSTICE BREYER: If, in fact, this gets in,         then I guess what I have to do is go through this huge               record on the sentencing anyway and see do I really           think that this evidence that came in that the younger          one thought the older one was the monster, et cetera,          did it really have an effect?                              MR. McALLISTER: Well ­­    JUSTICE BREYER: Is that what I would have          Alderson Reporting Company Official to do? I don't see how I could avoid that if they are                at all relevant.               MR. McALLISTER: Well, I would say, first of          all, if were you to do that, it would be quite clear.            The evidence is overwhelming.                But furthermore, the premise is not      supported really by the record. They say Jonathan's         whole strategy was to paint Reginald as the bad actor          here. That's not really what happened. What they both           presented was lots of witnesses and testimony about        their ­­ their childhood and their experiences growing        up, and they presented psychological experts to talk        about their mental condition. No expert said Reginald         had some kind of psychological control over Jonathan.        That ­­ that testimony, to the extent it's there at all,           comes from their mother.                JUSTICE KAGAN: But what do you think about         a case, whether or not this is that case, in which it is             quite clear to a judge that each of two defendants is            just going to be pointing to the other person and          saying, that was the bad actor. He is why these           terrible crimes committed. And you know that ­­ you          know, each of them is going to be doing that.                      Should a judge separate the penalty       proceeding in that context?    Alderson Reporting Company Official             MR. McALLISTER: Well, not necessarily. If        the high standard is met that it will not be possible,           perhaps, to give individualized consideration to each in        an Eighth Amendment or a due process standard is going           to be so fundamentally unfair, if you can meet that very           high standard, then ­­ but that's always been the         Court's approach. It is a case­by­case determination.         Even Zafiro, which is a joinder case ­­                    JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I guess I am asking           you in what kind of factual circumstances you would find          that standard met?               MR. McALLISTER: Rarely, but I think it         would be ­­ certainly the Court has recognized in         Bruton, you have some sort of co­defendant confession ­­        I mean, confession situations, if there was something        that had not been used in the guilt phase, might be           relevant in the sentencing. That might be so         prejudicial.             We have tried to think of other examples. I          might suggest something like one is claiming at that         point in time some kind of insanity, even though they          didn't succeed on that at trial. If there was something           really starkly contradictory in their presentations and       you were going to get a lot of evidence about one that             really had nothing to do at all with the other.          Alderson Reporting Company Official             But we do believe it's a high standard that          would rarely be satisfied, especially given the Court's        long­standing presumption that the jury follows its       instructions. And that's one thing I would point out           here, the complaints that each makes in this Court.         First of all, at least one of those complaints really          wasn't even made in the Kansas Supreme Court, much less          the trial court, and that's the shackling of Reginald         and whether that might have prejudiced Jonathan.                      But they ­­ there was no complaints during     the sentencing proceeding. This corrupting influence       evidence is relevant only for Jonathan's mitigation       case, not with respect to Reginald; can we have a          limiting instruction? Reginald has anti­social      personality disorder; there was no request for any sort         of limiting that that ­­ that's not applicable to         Jonathan. Although, of course, the irony there is that          Jonathan's own expert all but diagnosed him as        anti­social personality. He said out of risk factors          that the Department of Justice has recognized for        violence and sexual violence, Jonathan has of them.                     And both brothers talked about family      history of mental illness. Both brothers and their         experts talked about whether some of these things were         hereditary or genetic. This was really a case in which            Alderson Reporting Company Official it made very good sense to proceed with a joint           proceeding, because the evidence, percent was       overlapping, essentially. I mean, they were calling the          same witnesses, taking turns with those witnesses.       Judicial economy nor fairness, neither one would have        been served any better by separating this into two         proceedings.             And, in fact, I will conclude for now,         unless there are further questions, with this       observation, that prior to trial, to the guilt phase,         the prosecution actually offered to have two juries sit         through this proceeding. Jonathan's attorney said he        would consider it, and Reginald's attorney rejected it.                    So the State even tried to ­­ to agree to          some workable system and ­­ and it was declined.                     So unless there are further questions, I       will reserve the remainder of my time.                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   Ms. Kovner.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF RACHEL P. KOVNER         ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,                           SUPPORTING PETITIONER              MS. KOVNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:               The Kansas Supreme Court erred when it found        Alderson Reporting Company Official that the State violated the Eighth Amendment by        conducting joint sentencing proceedings for the crimes       the Respondents committed together. Joint proceedings       can enhance accuracy and fairness, as a long line of           this Court's cases hold. They provide a fuller          evidentiary record to juries that are assessing relative        culpability, and they prevent arbitrary disparities that       may arise when two juries reach inconsistent conclusions        about the common facts of a single crime.                     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Kovner, is there        any difference between the Federal government's position       and the position of the State of Kansas on this          question?             MS. KOVNER: As to the standard, I think          there's a small difference. I think our proposal is            that the constitutional standard is whether evidence or        argument resulted in a denial of due process or the           deprivation of an individualized sentencing proceeding.                  And that's slightly different from Kansas's      standard, because Kansas is proposing a rule that         involves analysis of risk, and we think that is part of           the statutory rule under Rule , as Justice Sotomayor         alluded to. It's also part of the statutory standard          that states "by and large are applying," but we think          the constitutional question is just, was this person        Alderson Reporting Company Official deprived of a fair trial by the evidence that came in?            And that's the constitutional question.                 JUSTICE KAGAN: When you said it the first         time, you had "deprived of a fair trial" and then           something about individualized sentencing; is that      right? Is that supposed to indicate that this is          deriving both from the Due Process Clause and from the          Eighth Amendment?              MS. KOVNER: Well, the Eighth Amendment does        speak to this need for an individualized sentencing        determination. We would think that the Due Process         Clause also requires that proceedings be individualized.       But we would agree that if there were a situation where            there was a joint trial and because of the evidence           introduced by one, for instance, a jury simply could not           give individualized consideration to a second ­­ second         defendant, that would be a constitutional problem.                      And to give an example of that ­­ I mean, I          think the example the Court suggests in Zafiro of that          is where there is aggravating evidence that pertains        only to one defendant, but that that aggravating        evidence is just so prejudicial and so overpowering that         the jury couldn't really separate the two and would be          inclined to sort of judge the second one by association.                      So I think that's the example the Court         Alderson Reporting Company Official gives in Zafiro. But it's not ­­                   JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think      individualized consideration is required even in the       non­capital cases?              think ­­             MS. KOVNER: Absolutely, Your Honor. So I         JUSTICE SCALIA: It's really a due process         consideration, isn't it?               MS. KOVNER: I think due process encompasses         that requirement of individualized consideration.                 Just to address several of the points that        came up during Petitioner's argument, I think ­­ as to           the question that Justice Kagan asked about whether,        when defendants are simply pointing the finger at each         other, that would necessitate severance. I think that's          the question that the Court addressed in Zafiro, where         that was essentially the claim the defendants were        making, that we're both going to point the finger at          each other at trial. And the Court said that doesn't           necessitate severance; that that may, in fact, increase        the jury's ability to reach an accurate verdict, to         reach an accurate assessment of relative culpability,       and enhance fairness. So we don't think that that's a           situation that would require severance.                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I ­­ I guess the           Alderson Reporting Company Official strongest evidence for Reginald is Temica's testimony.       It's ­­ it's pretty prejudicial. She said he's ­­ he's           the one who ­­ he said he's the one who shot.                       MS. KOVNER: I don't think that that's         prejudicial evidence, certainly not any constitutional      problem with the admission of that evidence. I don't           think that even Reginald Carr is asserting that that         evidence couldn't have come in against him. Rather he          is asserting or the State below suggested ­­ the State          court below suggested maybe that ­­ maybe the State         didn't know about that evidence, and maybe just as a          factual matter it wouldn't have come in.                   But there's no constitutional unfairness     with evidence coming in on a co­defendant's case that's          harmful but accurate as to you. That's something the          Court said in ­­ in Zafiro. If it's accurate and           relevant evidence that comes in on a co­defendant's         case, there's no constitutional unfairness as to you.                      I think Reginald's primary claim before this      Court is that there was a violation of State evidentiary           law because some of the other evidence, the evidence of          bad influence, might not have come in under the State          rules. I think this Court's cases are clear that a            violation of State evidentiary law is simply a matter of           State law. The State could decide that necessitates         Alderson Reporting Company Official reversal, but it's not a constitutional error. That's          what this Court said in Romano.                  JUSTICE BREYER: It would depend on what is         was, wouldn't it? I mean, so I'm still asking the same             question. If the ­­ I take it that Reginald could not             have introduced evidence refuting these brothers' state       of mind that he was the monster. That's what you're           referring to by the bad influence.                  So the jury might have taken that evidence        into account in trying to decide whether Reginald, for         other reasons than in the statute, was a sympathetic          enough character not to provide the death penalty.        That's conceivable.              But severance is very, very rare, and joint        trials are very common. And very common is the claim on            an appeal in any kind of a case that it shouldn't ­­ it              should have been severed.                So do you have cases that you can think of          that would be good precedent for you where a court,           including particularly this Court, said, of course there        might be a little prejudice here, some, but it's not           enough to warrant severance? Because I think what I           have to do is read the record on this point, and then I             need something to compare it with.                  MS. KOVNER: Well, I want to go back ­­ I'd            Alderson Reporting Company Official like to answer the question and then go back to the           premise ­­                         JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.    MS. KOVNER: ­­ because I am not sure I           agree with the premise.                But as to whether any prejudice is a        problem, I think the best case for us is Zafiro. Zafiro             talks about the idea that what you need ­­ that joinder           is presumably going to enhance fairness and accuracy.        And what you need is substantial prejudice, even to have          a statutory problem, and then ­­ even then we are going           to presume that a limiting instruction would be         sufficient to cure it.                point.             So that would be our best case on that         But, Your Honor, I think the inquiry under         the Eighth Amendment has to be would the Constitution         have prohibited this evidence from coming in as to         Reginald Carr. And we think the answer is no. Any            evidence that's relevant to an individual defendant ­­                   JUSTICE BREYER: Well, normally in severance       cases, forgetting the death cases, seems to me the         argument has been, look, they never would have gotten         this piece of evidence in against my client. They          brought it in against the other client. Now, go look at            Alderson Reporting Company Official that evidence and you'll see how much my prejudice ­­         that my client was prejudiced by that.                       I do not know whether you call that due      process. Maybe you do. But that's the kind of argument            which seems for a quantitative weighing. That's why I           asked the question.               MS. KOVNER: I think I would go back to            Zafiro again on that one, Your Honor, because I think           Zafiro establishes that when accurate evidence comes in        through a co­defendant that is relative ­­ that's         relevant to the jury's determination, that's not       prejudice. That's information that may enhance the        accuracy of what the jury ­­                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me why we         should apply the Zafiro standard, which was joint        trials, but this is joint sentencing where there is a          different ­­ why there should be exactly the same         standard applied?                          MS. KOVNER: So we think Zafiro ­­       JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you need      individualized sentencing? So can't you say, or aren't         you required to say that something a little bit more           than ­­ than the efficiency of a joint trial has to            compel ­­             MS. KOVNER: Yes, Your Honor.      Alderson Reporting Company Official JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ has to be considered?        MS. KOVNER: Yes, Your Honor. We agree that                                  sentencings may involve special considerations. What we        think Zafiro establishes is that generally when more        relevant information is placed before a jury, that's not          prejudice to a defendant, that's not unfair, and that          juries with more information are likely to make more         accurate decisions, and we think that's equally true at         sentencing.             And, similarly, that juries with more ­­ who        are confronted with two defendants together can avoid        the unwarranted disparities that may occur when juries        reach different results ­­ two different juries       considering the same facts reach different results on        those facts. And that's equally true at sentencing.                     JUSTICE KAGAN: Sorry, but I'm not ­­                   JUSTICE SCALIA: You ­­ you would need        two ­­ two separate juries, wouldn't you? I mean ­­                       MS. KOVNER: That's ­­ that's what the        Kansas Supreme Court said here. And the result of that           is ­­ is going to be that two different juries          confronted with the very same aggravating circumstances       in largely parallel mitigation cases may simply weigh        factors like mercy differently.                JUSTICE SCALIA: But wouldn't ­­ wouldn't       Alderson Reporting Company Official the second jury have to know the facts relevant to          mitigation, as well as aggravation, I suppose, that came          out in the main trial?                 MS. KOVNER: It's ­­ it's certainly       possible, Your Honor, that if there was a second jury,           the government could simply introduce, for instance, the        evidence of Reginald Carr's statement to his sister at         the second trial. So you're introducing this disparity         that Justice Kennedy alluded to between the defendant        who goes first and the defendant who goes second.                     JUSTICE ALITO: Well, would this second jury        have been present for the ­­ for the guilt phase?                      MS. KOVNER: Well, in ­­ in the Federal         system, there are a number of ways you could do it.            Could you have two juries that hear both the guilt phase           and ­­ and the penalty phase. You could have a second             jury impanelled only for the ­­ the penalty phase. But           then in a case like this, you would need to essentially            repeat all the trial evidence, including calling victims        again, because that ­­ because the State was relying on          its evidence from the trial phase, and that is         generally, we submit, going to be the case.                    JUSTICE KAGAN: I think I missed something          you said, but ­­ forgive me. But the constitutional          standard that you're proposing, is that a constitutional         Alderson Reporting Company Official standard for both the guilt phase and the sentencing         phase? And is it also for both non­capital and capital?           Are you drawing no distinctions among those four things?                     MS. KOVNER: I think that's right, Your         Honor. I mean, that ­­ because we think that the due             process standard essentially subsumes the requirement of       individualized consideration, and, of course, due      process is applicable at the trial phase and at the          sentencing phase in capital and non­capital trials.                   JUSTICE KAGAN: So it seems a little bit          counterintuitive to me, the idea that, you know, the         guilt phase in a very minor crime would have the exact            same standard applicable to it as the guilt phase of a           capital crime and then as the sentencing phase of a          capital crime.              MS. KOVNER: If I may answer really briefly?          Your Honor, we think the reason that's the case is that           joint trials often enhance accuracy and fairness. So we          agree that accuracy and fairness considerations are at        their paramount in capital cases, but we do not think          that militates for a different standard in capital cases          because we think that the standard that the courts are          applying is one that's going to generally enhance those         values.             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       Alderson Reporting Company Official             Mr. Liu.               ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK LIU              ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN NO. ­      MR. LIU: Mr. Chief Justice, and may please                     the Court:                I want to begin by emphasizing how narrow       our rule is. Justice Kagan asked the question involving          a ­­ a case where the two defendants pointed their           fingers at each other. We are not advocating a rule            that would require severance in any case where two         defendants point their fingers at ­­ at each other.                     We are advocating a rule that this Court has          recognized in Zant, Stringer, in Sanders, that ­­ that         an Eighth Amendment violation occurs when the weighing        process itself is skewed. And the weighing ­­                    JUSTICE BREYER: But are you saying the        severance rule is the same in non­capital as in capital          cases?             MR. LIU: The general severance rule, Your        Honor, is the same.                prejudice?             JUSTICE BREYER: And you just look for        MR. LIU: Exactly. The general rule is you          can't have severance when it would compromise someone's        constitutional rights. The right at issue here just         Alderson Reporting Company Official happens to be an Eighth Amendment right, but we are not           advocating an Eighth Amendment rule that would apply        beyond the capital context or even beyond the penalty         phase. That's ­­               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You know, if you       violated an individualized sentence, why would we apply        harmless error review? Meaning, it seems       counterintuitive. We are now becoming the sentencing ­­        the sentencing body. No?                             MR. LIU: Absolutely. And I think ­­         JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh, so then we have to         do the ­­ in harmless error, we have to decide whether           the aggravators outweighed the mitigators, et cetera, so        much that none of the error could have affected that          choice?             MR. LIU: Well, this Court, Your Honor,        recognized in Satterwhite precisely how difficult it       would be to conduct a harmless error analysis in a           penalty phase, and that's precisely because there are so         many factors involved.               Sure, the crimes in the case were horrific,        but that's just one side of the scale in a harmless            error inquiry. There is an entire other side of the           balance, the mitigation side. And so it is quite          difficult for this Court, on a cold record, to go           Alderson Reporting Company Official through the harmless error analysis.                             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I ­­ I ­­        JUSTICE SCALIA: We have to do it, though,         right? I mean, that's ­­ that's part of ­­ part of our              jurisprudence.             So what ­­ what do you think are the ­­         are ­­ are the factors that would suggest the jury would           have come out a different way had the rule that you urge             been adopted? What ­­ what specifically? One is the           shackling of the ­­ of the co­defendant?                   MR. LIU: Well, we are not representing        Reginald Carr. We're not basing our claim around the          shackling. Our ­­ our claim revolves around the         evidence that Jonathan presented that Reginald had a        corrupting influence on him while they were growing up.         And that evidence, as the Kansas Supreme Court itself         held at Petition Appendix , falls beyond the rubric         of any valid sentencing factor.                 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Liu, I mean, given          the kind of evidence that was presented in this case,          the idea that somebody was a lousy big brother seems           pretty small on ­­ in the ­­ in the scale of things.                        MR. LIU: Well, a few responses to that. To            begin with, I think Your ­­ Your Honor is understating           the evidence here. This wasn't just that Reginald was a           Alderson Reporting Company Official lousy big brother. It was that he did things to           Jonathan that turned Jonathan into the person who was         capable of committing and even leading these crimes. So          this wasn't just "lousy big brother" evidence, this was         evidence that Reginald himself was the source of what         caused Jonathan to do the things he did.                    But, Your Honor, I think it's also important         to keep in mind two separate parts of the inquiry; there           is the violation and the harmless error analysis. And          this Court said in Stringer that even a thumb on the            scales is enough to skew the weighing process in         violation of the Eighth Amendment.                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what ­­ what        evidence that shouldn't have been admitted wouldn't have        been admitted in the ­­ in the separate trial?                     MR. LIU: Well, all this evidence, Mr. Chief         Justice, that says Reginald was a corrupting influence         on his brother, that wouldn't have come in in a separate            trial for two reasons: Number one, as the Kansas          Supreme Court held at Petition Appendix , that        evidence was improper, nonstatutory, aggravating     evidence, which is to say, all the aggravating factors         before the prosecution pursuit in this case all had to          do with the circumstances of the crime.                   But this evidence had nothing to do with the         Alderson Reporting Company Official circumstances of what happened on December th, it had         to do with the defendant's character concerning       circumstances that occurred years, even decades, before       the crimes at issue.                JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, wait a minute.        You're ­­ you're representing the brother who was        the alleged corrupting influence, right?                             MR. LIU: That's right, the corruptor.       JUSTICE SCALIA: The corruptor was      sentenced, by the same jury, to death. So how could it            possibly be that without the corrupting action of your         client, the jury would have sentenced your client to         life even though the corruptee was sentenced to death?         That doesn't seem to me at all likely.                    MR. LIU: Well, to begin ­­ begin with, I          don't think Jonathan Carr's sentence is a proper         baseline to use. As my friend will argue in a few             minute, his own sentence was prejudiced by severance.                    But even moving beyond that, there is every        reason to believe that the jury viewed Jonathan as         overall more culpable than Reginald. After all, the         State never established who the shooter was here. If          the jury believed that Jonathan was the shooter, the         jury could have believed that Jonathan was so culpable         that even with his evidence that he had been corrupted          Alderson Reporting Company Official by Reginald, it would have given a life sentence. I            think ­­             JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me ­­ let me put the          crime to you. You tell me which of these descriptions           of the ­­ of the crime are ­­ are incorrect. These two             men broke into a house in which there were three men and             two women. They ordered the five to remove their          clothes, forced them into a closet. Over the course of            three hours, they demanded that the two women perform         various sexual acts on one another. They demanded at          gunpoint that each of the three men have sexual         intercourse with both women.                Then Reginald drove the victims one by one        to various ATMs to withdraw cash. Jonathan raped or          attempted to rape both women twice, and Reginald raped         Holly G., who later testified, once. Placing the three          men, still naked, in the trunk of one of their cars, the            cars drove all five to a soccer field, forced them to            kneel in the snow, and shot them execution­style in the          back of the head.                One of them, fortuitously, was not killed       because ­­ I think it was a hair clip that she was              wearing deflected the bullet. And she is the one who           testified to all of this activity.                  And you truly think ­­ oh, and they ran over          Alderson Reporting Company Official her too. After shooting her in the head, the car ran            over her.              You truly think that this jury, but for the         fact that your client was a corruptor, would not have           imposed the death penalty?                MR. LIU: We do, Justice Scalia. In your          own opinion in last term in Glossip, you noted that the           egregiousness of an offense is just one factor in         determining whether a sentence is appropriate at the         penalty phase. And Reginald Carr submitted a week and a            half full of mitigation evidence that extenuated this        offense.             So I don't ­­ I think when you ­­ when you             take all that all into account and consider the fact          that this wasn't an easy case for the jury ­­ the jury,            after all, deliberated a full day on what the ­­ what            Kansas thinks is quite an easy case.                       I think the ­­ the scales of the weighing      process were much more evenly balanced than that.                    JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that the desire         to spare Holly from having to testify more than once is           a relevant factor here? And if so, how could that be ­­            how do you ­­ how would you propose to accommodate them?                       MR. LIU: It's not a relevant factor and          that's not my saying it, it's this Court saying it.          Alderson Reporting Company Official This Court in Zafiro and Bruton has said that the          benefits of joinder, while they may exist, cannot come         at the price of constitutional rights.                  So while I ­­ I completely appreciate that          severance would require some duplication of resources,       that's precisely the sort of benefit that this Court has          said cannot trump the Eighth Amendment.                  JUSTICE BREYER: So if you're right, joinder        being among the most common kind of thing that gangs and           drugs and so forth, why won't the same argument be made           over and over preventing ­­ requiring severance in        dozens and dozens, perhaps hundreds of cases where the         government tries people together? Because they will say         there are different relationships among members of the        gang. Those relationships ­­ some evidence would come         in that would negative the relationship that would tend         to show that this particular individual wasn't actually        involved in this aspect of it, et cetera.                    That's why my experience on the Courts,       lower courts particularly, leads me to think it's a very           rarely accepted argument, severance.                MR. LIU: Well, you're right, Justice       Breyer ­­             JUSTICE BREYER: And that's why I'm       interested in ­­ I mean, because if it were, you'd find            Alderson Reporting Company Official it very unusual to try people together, which, in fact,          is very usual. And so when you told me there is no             separate thing for the death cases, then I imagine it           would affect every criminal trial of gangs throughout        the country.                          MR. LIU: Well, I think ­­       JUSTICE BREYER: And that is something       that's concerning me and I am looking for an answer.                       MR. LIU: You're absolutely right, Justice       Breyer, that under our rule, the circumstances of each         case are relevant. But I think what's also important           is ­­ is that some ­­ the circumstances of some cases           might not get rise for severance.                  JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I'm looking       for. Why is it you believe that if I were to decide in               your favor on this case and find the sufficient         prejudice to warrant severance here, I wouldn't at the          same time be throwing a huge monkey wrench ­­                                 MR. LIU: Right.    JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ into the ordinary cases        of gangs, drugs, et cetera, where joinder is very common          and reversal is very rare.                 MR. LIU: Because the evidence here is        special in the sense that it fell beyond any existing          sentencing factor.  Alderson Reporting Company Official             JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you proposing just       separate sentencing hearings, or are you proposing       separate juries for each of the brothers?                   MR. LIU: Well, the Kansas Supreme Court in         this case ordered as its remedy a new trial with two            juries, but I don't think that is necessarily going to           be the required remedy in every case. There are          different ways, Justice Ginsburg, to solve the problems        of sentencing.              JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's take this case. If         you had only one jury and Jonathan goes first, that          jury, when it gets to Reginald's case, is not going to           forget everything it heard in Jonathan's case.                   MR. LIU: You're absolutely right, Justice       Ginsburg. I don't think a sequential solution with           Jonathan going first is going to work in this case          precisely because the jury won't ­­ you won't be able to           unring the bell of the ­­ precisely the evidence we          think is prejudicial in this case. But that's not to           say that a sequential solution isn't going to work in           the mine run of cases.                 This case is special just because there ­­       there is some allegation that the prejudice ran both         ways.             JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the minute ­­ but the         Alderson Reporting Company Official minute you defend the idea of two different juries, then          you sacrifice the desirability and the possibility of        consistency.             MR. LIU: Well, Justice Kennedy, there are        many ways that States have developed to resolve the         problem of inconsistent verdicts among different juries.       One way is what the Georgia State has done, which is had            proportionality review. They ask the appellate courts        to look across many sentences to see if they are          inconsistent.             Another way the Federal government has a       solution to this, is that let one jury know how the           other jury sentenced the other defendant. That's         U.S.C. (a)(). And so there are ways to solve           the problem of inconsistent verdicts across juries. But         what's ­­             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That sounds ­­ that        sounds pretty prejudicial to me. If the second case,          you say, oh, the jury considered this and individual         circumstances, you know, these people act together, and        by the way, a jury of your peers unanimously found           beyond a reasonable doubt that this guy should be          sentenced to death; now do whatever you want with this          guy. That sounds pretty prejudicial to me.                    MR. LIU: Well, it's ­­ it's ­­ if you think           Alderson Reporting Company Official that is prejudicial, Mr. Chief Justice, then this        proceeding was quite prejudicial too because the jury        was asked to make that same exact comparison.                    But the specific prejudice we are alleging       here is ­­ is unique to these or at least quite ­­ quite             restricted to the circumstances of this case.                   JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Liu, could you, for me,         just tell me what is the specific prejudice you're         alleging here? In other words, tell me more than just,           oh, he was a corrupting influence. What evidence          particularly came in ­­                           MR. LIU: Sure.    JUSTICE KAGAN: ­­ and why do you think it          might have mattered to the jury? Just give me your,           like, best shot.               MR. LIU: Sure. Well, Kansas said there was          no expert testimony on this, but that's wrong.        Dr. Cunningham, at Joint Appendix pages to ,         explained how Jonathan looked up to Reggie, and every         time they would get together they would do drugs heavily          together, that when ­­ that when they were ages or ,             Reginald prompted someone to have sex with Jonathan.        These are precisely the sort of evidence that shows that          however bad you think Jonathan is, Reginald is worse         because Reginald is the one who created the person         Alderson Reporting Company Official Jonathan is.              It's in a sense making Reginald doubly        culpable for these offenses; that, well, whatever you        think Jonathan did ­­ and yes, as Justice Scalia read,          there were some horrific things done ­­ well, Reginald         should be punished for not only everything Reginald did,         but also everything Jonathan did.                 So this is precisely the sort of evidence        that basically transfers all of Jonathan's actions to        Reginald. And that's why it's so prejudicial when you          get in the jury room, it's because it ­­ it skews the            weighing process.              And a skewing of the weighing process is an          error this Court has recognized for years. This          isn't something that we ­­ we came up special for this           case. This Court has recognized time and again that          when a jury is told to consider an improper element in            the weighing process, the weighing process is therefore        skewed. And the only thing that can cure that error is            either harmless error review or ­­                 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it ­­                 MR. LIU: ­­ reweighing by the State court.                     JUSTICE SCALIA: But it has to have been         harmless inasmuch as the person who was influenced by         your client also got the death penalty. How can you say            Alderson Reporting Company Official that what made the difference was the fact that your          client was a corrupting influence upon his younger         brother?             MR. LIU: Well, Justice Scalia, the State        never established the identity of the shooter, and that         is the key horrific act in this case. If the jury            believed Jonathan was the shooter, then the jury might         have given him the death penalty anyway regardless of         what Reginald did to him.                 JUSTICE SCALIA: I doubt whether that is the          key. You really think that that's the only thing the           jury is going to be focused on, is who pulled the           trigger? My Lord.                MR. LIU: I don't think it's the only ­­ I            don't think it's the only thing, but it's certainly the          main thing given that we are here on a capital murder            charge.             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think that on a         retrial they cannot use the sister to prove that         Reginald claimed he was the shooter?                  MR. LIU: No. And I think that just           highlights exactly how narrow our rule is. That the          evidence that Temica said that Reginald told her that         Reginald was the shooter goes to the circumstances of         the crime. And that sort of finger pointing, who shot           Alderson Reporting Company Official who on the day of the crime, is going to fall           comfortably within an existing sentencing factor, and as        a result, is not going to skew the weighing process.                      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the only issue you        think was prejudicial was that he was a corruptor?                                              MR. LIU: Absolutely.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The evidence.     MR. LIU: And for reasons I ­­ I gave to             Justice Kagan, that evidence was extremely prejudicial.       It skewed the weighing process because it transferred        Jonathan's culpability back onto Reginald's shoulders.                  If I may, I'd just like to address a few            points raised by my friend from Kansas. He said the           instructions solve the problem. Well, none of the         instructions told the jury to consider this evidence        about the corrupting influence only as to Jonathan.                    Now, on the contrary, the instructions ­­      Instruction No. told the jury consider the evidence          applicable to each defendant. Well, this evidence was         equally applicable to Reginald as it was to Jonathan.         After all, it was Reginald ­­ Reginald's actions that         were at issue.               My friends also point to the instruction on        statutory aggravators. But that disregards an entire        swath of evidence that the jury heard that it could          Alderson Reporting Company Official consider against Reginald. This was evidence,       anti­mitigation evidence that the jury considered, could       have caused them to remove weight from the mitigation         side of the scale. And the instructions left the jury           completely free to consider this evidence in       anti­mitigation.               My friends also suggest that I'm here only      arguing an error of State law. Well, no less than the            Petitioners were in Zant, Stringer, and ­­ and Sanders.         Each of those cases recognizes that a skewing of the           weighing process has to be based on State law premises.          That's why this Court in Zant went so far as to certify            a question to the Georgia Supreme Court.                   Yes, it's true that to understand the effect        on the weighing process, you have to look at the State           law. But the mere admission of evidence isn't what          causes the violation here. It's the admission of the          evidence, followed by the fact the jury was required to          consider it. And it was required to consider it because           it was part and parcel of Jonathan's mitigating        evidence.             And this Court has said time and again that         a defendant has a constitutional right for the jury, not           only to consider but to listen to a defendant's          mitigating evidence. So by considering this evidence        Alderson Reporting Company Official for Jonathan, the jury necessarily considered it against        Reginald. After all, if you're told that Reginald had a           corrupting influence on Jonathan, you can't separate       that as something for Jonathan and something for        Reginald. It's equally applicable to both.                     My friend also suggested that we ­­ we      rejected a two­jury solution before trial. Well, we          rejected that, not because of it wouldn't work to solve          any prejudice in the penalty phase, but because it         wouldn't work to solve any prejudice in the guilt phase.                      And remember, the Kansas Supreme Court found       that it was actually error to keep the guilt phase          joined, so we were perfectly appropriate in objecting to         a two­jury solution at that phase of the trial.                     JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you explain that       again? I thought you ­­ you sought only a severance at              the sentencing phase.               MR. LIU: No. That's not ­­ that's not ­­                      JUSTICE GINSBURG: You sought severance      totally?             MR. LIU: Exactly. Prior to trial, on pages           and of the Joint Appendix, we moved for severance           of the entire thing.                And if you look at those pages, you'll see         Jonathan's attorney, Jonathan's own attorney, saying      Alderson Reporting Company Official that if the penalty phase is joined, he is going to have            to present evidence that, quote, "there's no way the         State would be able to introduce if Reginald was sitting          here alone."              Well, his attorney was exactly right.      That's exactly what happened many months later.                     I see that my time is up.                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   Mr. Green.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN             ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN NO. ­                    MR. GREEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:               I'd like to first try and change the        narrative here with some illustrations about the       difference between the mitigation cases of both       defendants. That's easily seen in the testimony of the          experts.             Reginald Carr presented evidence from a      neuroscientist by the name of Dr. Woltersdorf that said         his client had been diagnosed a ­­ an incurable          sociopath.             Jonathan Carr's forensic psychologist,    clinical and forensic psychologist, got up and testified        that ­­ that Jonathan was sensitive, he was        Alderson Reporting Company Official affectionate, he had attempted suicide, and what he        really was, contrary to what Mr. McAllister represented        to you, was ­­ was depressed and schizophrenic.                    That is ­­ that is a unique illustration of          exactly how different these two defendants were in their         presentation, and why, again, a sequential penalty        phase, even if they had been separate, wouldn't work.                     Reginald says he didn't want to hear or he         thought it would be prejudicial if the jury heard         evidence from the ­­ from the ­­ from Jonathan's         witnesses about Reginald being a ­­ a corrupting          influence. On the other side, Jonathan doesn't want the          jury to hear from Reginald's expert.                  And to answer your question, Justice Kagan,       that's the evidence that would not have been introduced.                     Justice Woltersdorf's ­­ or excuse me ­­      Dr. Woltersdorf's testimony about incurable sociopathy      would not have been relevant or admissible ­­                   JUSTICE KAGAN: Maybe I'm missing something,       but if ­­ if your client's strategy was to make Reginald           as bad ­­ the bad actor in the case, why didn't that            evidence actually go hand in hand with your client's         strategy, which was to say it's all on Reginald?                     MR. GREEN: One ­­ one would think that it          would in ­­ in a typical case, and it may be that some              Alderson Reporting Company Official jurors had inferred that way.                 The problem was that ­­ that the fact that         the two brothers were sitting together allowed the        prosecutors to repeatedly paint them with the same        brush.             And ­­ and if we take a look, for example,           at JA , the prosecutor says to the jury in her           opening argument at the beginning of the penalty ­­ or          at the conclusion of the penalty phase, ladies and         gentlemen, they have the same eye color. They are now           wearing glasses, although their mother said Reginald       doesn't need them, they share some DNA.                   JUSTICE BREYER: So this ­­ maybe you can,         in your experience, cure what's bothering me about the         case. It's nothing to do with the facts, or for this ­­            this concern. It has to do with ­­ with Zafiro.                                   MR. GREEN: Right.    JUSTICE BREYER: And that's the ordinary       case of joint trials, right?                 And what the Court says is you can have the          joinder as long as there isn't a serious risk that the            joint trial would compromise ­­ it doesn't say harmless         error, it says compromise ­­ a specific trial right, or           prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment. That           doesn't talk about harmless error.     Alderson Reporting Company Official             Now, that's the standard that's used in       dozens and dozens and dozens of cases.                   Or if, in this case, we start talking about         harmless error, and that you can't have the joint         proceeding if there is error that is not harmless.         Well, what have we done to that sentence? And what have            we done to the trials that are joint in hundreds of           cases that don't involve murder or death?                   That is the legal problem that is worrying        me. And you will either cure that worry or say I've            made some elementary mistake. It has nothing to do with           your case. Say what you want, but I want to hear what              you think about it.                MR. GREEN: I don't ­­ I don't think you've            made any mistake at all, Justice Breyer. Indeed, I          think that ­­ that the State of Kansas and the Solicitor           General are offering nothing more than ­­ than the         Zafiro test and using slightly different language.                               On page of our ­­     JUSTICE BREYER: So we should not use the         words "harmless error." We should quote from Zafiro and          say could they make a reliable judgment? Now, that           sounds harder on you, because if all you have to show is            the error was harmful, it sounds like an easier task you           have than to show that the juror ­­ jury wasn't          Alderson Reporting Company Official reliable. Or are they the same thing in your opinion?                       MR. GREEN: Well, let me ­­ I think they're           the same thing and I think that's a generalization, but            we've ­­ we've offered a test that actually specifies it           a little bit more, Justice Breyer.                    In terms of saying that ­­ that the test       should be whether there is a reasonable risk ­­ and I            will explain the difference between reasonable and       serious in a minute ­­ but whether there was a           reasonable risk that there would be evidence introduced,        material, prejudicial evidence introduced that would ­­      that would, in fact, not have been introduced in a          severed penalty­phase proceeding.               And to go back to Justice Kagan's question        about the intuitive difference between these two things,        they're between ­­ excuse me ­­ trials and ­­ and          penalty­phase proceedings, the answer is that's because       in a ­­ in a trial, the ­­ the relative culpability of              the defendants makes a big difference with respect to          who's a conspirator, who's not a conspirator, who's a           principal, who's an aider and abettor.                  But when we turn to the penalty phase, the         inquiry changes, as Mr. Liu indicated ­­ it changes from          exactly what happened to who this person is and whether          or not the jury wants to put this person to death.           Alderson Reporting Company Official             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who ­­ who ­­ if you          have separate proceedings, who ­­ who gets to go second?          Because obviously that person will have a significant         advantage since they'll see all of the evidence        presented in the ­­ in the other proceeding.                                MR. GREEN: Well, in ­­     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And most of the        evidence here was overlapping, so that at least you'll         have ­­ you'll be able to see what the State thought           about that evidence. You have sort of a dry run if             you're the second person.                MR. GREEN: Well, in this case,       respectfully, no, Mr. Chief Justice, because what the ­­        what the State basically said was we're relying on our          evidence from the ­­ from the trial phase ­­ or from the            guilt phase of this capital trial.                  That's exactly what the prosecutor told the       jurors when they turned in to the penalty phase, and all           that the prosecution did in the penalty phase was         cross­examine the defense witnesses.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that       cross­examination is important.               Were there any common defense witnesses?                  MR. GREEN: There were family members.       So ­­ so it is true ­­      Alderson Reporting Company Official             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So at least it would         be ­­ it would be helpful for the second ­­ the person            who goes second to know, well, what did the prosecutor          talk ­­ how did the prosecutor attempt to cross­examine         that witness, because I am going to call the same           witness, and her testimony is going to be a lot better            the second time around because you will know exactly         what the cross­examination questions are going to be.                    MR. GREEN: That might happen. I ­­ it ­­           it could well be that that would be ­­ I would consider             that a ­­ a minor advantage, Your Honor. But that could              be handled by the judge in ­­ with protective orders,          with orders about ­­ rules against witnesses and ­­ and          folks in the courtroom who will have another proceeding.                     But I would submit ­­ and then with respect          to witnesses who might have been traumatized by these         events, that ­­ the ­­ you know, a trial court could            easily have a simultaneous penalty proceedings so that         that witness would only have to testify once. The          defense team on one side wouldn't get an advantage over          the other. There would be two juries in two different           courtrooms, same week, same days, the ­­ the witness can          go back and forth between courtrooms, and there is none          of the advantage ­­               JUSTICE ALITO: You would have ­­ the State         Alderson Reporting Company Official would have to put on, basically, its guilt phase case          again at the penalty phase, right?                  MR. GREEN: Yes, it would have to do that,          but I would imagine that ­­ that with respect to cases            like this, the defense attorneys are going to move right          into what counts as stipulations; we will read        testimony ­­             JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I am sure you'd like          to stipulate to all the facts that were proven at the           guilt phase, but I doubt that the State is going to want             to stipulate to those.                            MR. GREEN: And the State might do that.         And again, I think a trial judge could          easily handle that by expediting matters. And this is          what happens in a lot of the Federal trials. I would              refer the Court to the ­­ to the brief of the Promise of             Justice Initiative which shows that when we have joint         trials, we get joint results. When we have severed          trials, we get severed results. for , joint          trials, same result for the defendants.                  Woodson says we must have individualized      sentencing at the penalty phase, so I do not see why the             Zafiro test would not ­­ would ­­ would work for penalty           phase proceedings without some sort of change. There         has to be some recognition that ­­ that penalty phase          Alderson Reporting Company Official proceedings are different than ­­ than all the other         armed robbery, drug cases.                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how is that different        from what the government said?                 MR. GREEN: I ­­ so I think we ought to             lower the risk standard. We ought to lower the risk           standard to a reasonable risk standard, not ­­ and          that's what we propose in our brief at page . We            should lower the standard because that would recognize        the acute need for reliability and accuracy when it         comes to penalty phase proceedings and the decision        whether somebody is going to live or die.                    JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said you were going        to make a distinction between serious and reasonable         earlier.             MR. GREEN: Right. So a serious risk may be            treated as a ­­ as a preponderance or a ­­              or above.  With respect to reasonable, we're at a ­­ we're at a ­­             a ­­ maybe a likelihood. Maybe that's ­­ maybe that's            perceived as percent versus percent or percent,          something like that.               And indeed, this Court said in Boyde, with        respect to reasonable likelihood, that is not a        preponderance standard.              If the Court has no further questions, we        Alderson Reporting Company Official would urge ­­                          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       Mr. McAllister, five minutes.           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER                      ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                MR. McALLISTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may        it please the Court:                  I will try to be brief. The only Eighth         Amendment implication that this Court has recognized       that really applies to this case is I go back to the             Romano case where the Court said the admission of         evidence that might or might not be in violation of          State law is not an Eighth Amendment concern. The only           time the Eighth ­­ Eighth Amendment comes into play is          when the evidence is ­­ involves constitutionally       protected conduct.              An example would be Dawson v. Delaware,       where they sought a capital sentence. He was a member             of the Aryan Brotherhood in prison. It had nothing to           do with an aggregating factor. That was First         Amendment­protected activity. The Court said that kind        of thing could be an Eighth Amendment problem if you use           it against the defendant.                Their cases ­­ I could be wrong, but I think            all of their cases, Zant, Stringer, the others that they          Alderson Reporting Company Official refer to skewing the weighing process, are not about         admission of evidence, they are about invalid       aggravating factors. So you've basically told the jury         there is something else, literally, on the scale, an         aggravating factor that later the State says, no, that         was ­­ that was not correct, that should not have been           there. That's distinguishable from this case.                     I ­­ I agree completely with      Justice Scalia's point, and the dissenting justice made        it in the Kansas Supreme Court: If the evidence ­­ the            corrupting influence evidence was so prejudicial to       Reginald, why did Jonathan also get a death sentence?                      And I would close by saying that we all          agree, I think, that the Constitution values accuracy         and fairness. But it also values finality. And each of            these individuals received an individualized sentence,      presented all the evidence they wanted to. The jury was           instructed to consider them individually. And if we         were to undo this now, it would be very difficult for           Kansas to go back. We'd be talking about having to redo            all of the guilt phase evidence. And, again, you get           into questions, separate proceedings, traumatizing     victims yet again. None of that is necessary, because          at the end of the day they got a fundamentally fair            proceeding that gave each of them the sentence they         Alderson Reporting Company Official deserved and the jury found warranted, both under the         facts of this case and the law of Kansas.                     We would ask that you reverse the Kansas        Supreme Court on this point.                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. McAllister, I am        sorry, but even if we do this and say that the           sentencings didn't need to be severed, didn't the Kansas         court hold on another ground that they were entitled to          a new trial?               MR. McALLISTER: Yes. So that's the third         question presented in the Petition, which my       understanding is that is something the Court could        reconsider. It's not denied. The Court granted         Questions and .                 The other question that we presented was the        only other ground that the Kansas Supreme Court gave for          reversal, that's a Confrontation Clause violation in        terms of some of the hearsay evidence presented in the          sentencing proceedings.              So if the Court were to reverse on these,         deny on that question, then the Kansas Supreme Court         could, in fact, rely on that ground. But our hope would            be that the Court would do something different than that          if you reverse on these two questions.                   Unless there are further questions, thank      Alderson Reporting Company Official CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       The cases are submitted.    (Whereupon, at : p.m., the cases in the        you.
