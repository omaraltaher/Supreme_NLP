CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


first this morning in No. 02-371, Virginia v. Kevin Lamont


Hicks.


Mr. Hurd.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. HURD


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. HURD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


Before this trespass policy took effect, the


families in Whitcomb Court lived in the middle of an open-


air drug market.  Surely those who must rent from public


housing ought not be required by the law to live in


greater danger from criminals than those who rent from 

private landlords.  And yet, that is the consequence of


the decision below and its mistaken application of the


First Amendment.


This defendant is a common trespasser, not


engaged in any expressive activity.  The court below


struck down the trespass policy only by indulging in an


extravagant expansion of the overbreadth doctrine.


QUESTION:  Well, was -- was the State applying


some State law notion of standing, because certainly


Virginia can have different rules for standing than the

Federal court might have.


MR. HURD:  There is absolutely no indication in


the record, Your Honor, that the State supreme court was


doing anything other than applying what it thought was


this Court's overbreadth jurisprudence.


QUESTION:  Well, but on -- on the matter of


standing, would we necessarily assume they were applying


some Federal standard?


MR. HURD:  Your Honor, you don't need to assume


that in this case.  They -- they discuss the question of


standing in their opinion, and they referred to this


Court and this Court's traditional rule and the


overbreadth rule, never suggesting for a moment that they


thought Virginia might have a more generous rule of


standing than this Court has required.


QUESTION:  Did they cite our cases?


QUESTION:  There's -- there's no --


MR. HURD:  They did.


QUESTION:  There's no citation of any Virginia


case in the opinion, is there?


MR. HURD:  There is no citation when discussing


the -- the standing issue, the overbreadth issue at all. 


That's correct, Your Honor.


They -- they cite this Court's cases, and this


is found joint appendix page 159.  It says the Supreme

Court -- and I'm quoting now from the second complete


paragraph -- the Supreme Court has held that in the


context of a First Amendment challenge, a litigant may


challenge government action granting government officials


standardless discretion even if that government action as


applied to the litigant is constitutionally permissible.


They then cite this Court's decision in Los


Angeles Police Department.  They then go on to cite this


Court's decision in Ferber and in Broadrick and in Gooding


v. Wilson and in Dombrowski and in Thornhill, never


suggesting for a moment that Virginia has a more generous


notion of overbreadth standing --


QUESTION:  But if we were to hold for you on


that ground, the Virginia Supreme Court would be free to


say on remand, would it not, that it has decided to take a 

more generous view of standing?


MR. HURD:  It certainly could do that, Your


Honor.  The Virginia Supreme Court has historically


adhered very closely in its interpretation of the State


constitutional standards to the standards laid down by


this Court under the Federal Constitution.


QUESTION:  But when we're not talking about


substantive law, why is that really an -- an issue for us?


MR. HURD:  Well, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  They can do what they want.  It's

their courts.


MR. HURD:  Your Honor, they -- they believe they


are required by this Court's jurisprudence to grant --


QUESTION:  Well, but they didn't say that here. 


I mean, they didn't say the Supreme Court requires this


and our standing doctrine would be narrower, but we feel


we must.  I mean, we -- we just don't know.


MR. HURD:  Your Honor, I believe we -- we do


know based on the portions of the record I read.  They


relied solely upon this Court's overbreadth standing


jurisprudence.


QUESTION:  Well, they -- they did with respect


to -- to substantive law -- the substantive doctrine


overbreadth.  But at no point did they say, we would not


entertain this matter if it were brought under State law, 

but we are required to do so by the Supreme Court's


substantive doctrine.


MR. HURD:  Your Honor, I -- I think of the --


the recently decided case of Virginia v. Black cross


burning where in that case the criminal defendant raised


claims under both Federal and State law.  It decided it


under the Federal.  It did not decide it under the State.


QUESTION:  Mr. Hurd, that's not the issue


anyway, is it, whether they would have had a narrower


interpretation under State law?

 MR. HURD:  No, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  The issue is whether -- whether they


adopted a broader interpretation under State law than


Federal law would require.


MR. HURD:  That's --


QUESTION:  Isn't that the issue?


MR. HURD:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  There's no indication that they were


adopting a broader interpretation than Federal law


requires.


MR. HURD:  That is correct.  A -- a State may


well be able to adopt a broader interpretation of standing


than this Court requires, but it cannot adopt a narrower


interpretation.  It cannot disregard this Court's


direction that you give overbreadth standing according to 

the Federal constitutional standards, according to this


Court's standards.  There's nothing in the record to


suggest at all that it was adopting a broader


interpretation.  It said that this Court -- I'm


paraphrasing, of course.  But it says this Court's


standing rule -- its traditional standing rules do not


apply in these overbreadth cases, and then it cites this


Court's decisions.


QUESTION:  And if they were correct about what


our standing rules are, they would have to follow those

standing rules, wouldn't they?  They could not apply a


narrower --


MR. HURD:  That's --


QUESTION:  -- basis for standing, could they?


MR. HURD:  That is absolutely correct, Your


Honor.  The State supreme court has no discretion to


disregard this Court's application of the First Amendment


through its overbreadth doctrine.  Here, what happened --


QUESTION:  If they -- if they were wrong in


interpreting our cases, they still could have done exactly


what they did.


MR. HURD:  They could have, Your Honor, but


there's no indication that they did.


QUESTION:  They didn't say so.


MR. HURD:  They didn't say so.


QUESTION:  So if we sent it back and then they


said so, then we'd have to take the case and decide


whether they're right or wrong on the merits.


MR. HURD:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Yes.  I'm not sure why we -- why it's


called standing.  That's where I'm basically mixed up in


this case.  The person has nothing to do with speech, the


particular defendant.  It's sort of like a person who has


a gun under a gun statute that forbids it.  And he wants


to say that this law is unconstitutional because it might

apply to people who were petitioning, and if it did, it


wouldn't do it right.  It might apply to people who were


speaking.  It might apply to speech, just as the gun law


might apply to people who have a gun in a theater in a


part of a play.  And he wants to say that this law is


unconstitutional as applied to him because of that problem


with it.  And in the gun case, it would be apparent that


the law wouldn't be unconstitutional as applied to him


because in most of its applications, it would be


constitutional and he has nothing to do with speech.


And now you want to say, that's true here, too.


MR. HURD:  Absolutely, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Well, why aren't you and he arguing


on the merits of a constitutional matter, whether this


statute is or is not unconstitutional because of the 

possibility that it could be badly applied in a free


speech area that isn't this one?


MR. HURD:  Well --


QUESTION:  Why isn't that the merits?  Why is it


standing?


MR. HURD:  Well, Your Honor, there are a number


of problems with -- with Mr. Hicks' case, one of which is


exactly the one you described.  We think that there are


several aspects of that.  We think one aspect of standing.


We think another aspect is that this Court's practice has

been not to allow overbreadth challenges to be brought in


cases where it was not a -- a speech-related statute or a


statute governing something closely related to speech.


QUESTION:  Mr. Hurd, we don't normally decide


whether a statute is constitutional in the abstract, do


we?  I thought we normally decided whether someone has


been unconstitutionally convicted.  We don't go around


bashing statutes in their totality.  We say this person


was unconstitutionally convicted.


MR. HURD:  That's correct, Your Honor.  And --


and certainly --


QUESTION:  And that's why it's -- it's a


question of third-party standing whether you can say I was


unconstitutionally convicted because if you applied this


statute to somebody else, he would be unconstitutionally 

convicted.


MR. HURD:  It -- that is certainly our argument,


Your Honor.  Standing is one problem with Mr. Hicks' case.


But even if he had standing, there's a problem


here of not meeting the requirement that alleged


overbreadth be substantial.  In fact, the State supreme


court didn't address this prong of the overbreadth


doctrine at all.  And it's clear, we believe, that even if


there were some possible unconstitutional application of


this policy, that the overbreadth would not be

substantial.  The legitimate sweep of this policy is very


broad.  It sweeps up those who come to Whitcomb Court to


deal drugs and batter women and damage property and steal


and intimidate and try to make this property their turf.


QUESTION:  I didn't think it was limited to


those people.  I thought it was a total ban on people


coming in without permission.


MR. HURD:  Your Honor, that is -- that is not


exactly the -- what the policy says.  The --


QUESTION:  Well, what does the policy ban?


MR. HURD:  The policy is --


QUESTION:  It doesn't just ban drug dealers,


does it?


MR. HURD:  No, Your Honor, but in terms of -- of


the legitimate sweep, if we tried to contrast the 

legitimate sweep of the policy --


QUESTION:  Well, I -- let's say it's legitimate


to keep all the drug dealers and all the armed robbers


out, but -- but how many other people does it keep out? 


That's what I was curious about.


MR. HURD:  Well, Your Honor, we believe that the


risk that any legitimate speaker will be chilled is -- is


very small.  In fact, you know, the policy was developed


to chase away the ne'er-do-wells I have described, and if


we're unable to remove the criminals, it would not be safe

for people to come and engage in speech.


QUESTION:  But doesn't the no trespassing sign


apply to everybody?  It doesn't just apply to ne'er-do-


wells, does it?


MR. HURD:  Your Honor, it -- it does not apply


to -- just to ne'er-do-wells, and the problem is how do


you know until you actually catch them in the act of


dealing drugs?


QUESTION:  Well, it applies to -- it does not


apply to someone who is coming to see someone in the


housing development, as I understand it.


MR. HURD:  That's correct, Your Honor.  The --


the policy is explained by Gloria Rogers, the housing


manager, on page 32 of the joint appendix.  There's a


question and an answer at the bottom. 


If a nonresident --

question -- if a nonresident is seen on privatized public


housing property and he cannot demonstrate that he is


either visiting a lawfully residing resident or conducting


legitimate business, is he an authorized -- an


unauthorized person?


QUESTION:  Which, as far as the text of the


ordinance is concerned, legitimate business could include


pamphleting.


MR. HURD:  It -- it certainly could, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  As far as the text is concerned.

 MR. HURD:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  It all


could be included under the concept of visiting residents,


going door to door to visit them and hand them material.


QUESTION:  If -- if we agree --


QUESTION:  It wasn't the interpretation by one


of the administrators that leafleting was not ipso facto


legitimate businessing, or pamphleting or whatever.  Isn't


that right?


MR. HURD:  Your Honor, we would characterize


that not so much as an interpretation of the written


policy as an addendum --


QUESTION:  An addendum.


MR. HURD:  -- an addendum to it which requires


the demonstration of legitimate purpose, which is


discussed in the policy, which would require that 

demonstration be made to the housing manager to show that


the leafleting is legitimate.  That --


QUESTION:  Suppose -- and suppose I -- the --


the Court were to agree with you that the speech analysis,


particularly the overbreadth analysis here, was wrong. 


Does the case then go back to the Supreme Court of


Virginia in a posture where Mr. Hicks has the opportunity


to challenge the ordinance as being unconstitutional for


other reasons apart from the First Amendment?  It's vague. 


It inhibits his right of -- of movement.  These are

streets that are the functional equivalent of a public,


whatever.  Does he have all of those issues preserved to


him on remand?


MR. HURD:  Your Honor, he certainly has this --


this due process right to wander issue preserved.  There's


a question that the State supreme court did not address,


which is whether these streets and sidewalks are a


traditional public forum or a nonpublic forum.  And he has


certainly asserted the right to -- to be there -- the


right to --


QUESTION:  And in the context of that, to say


that the ordinance is vague for other reasons.


MR. HURD:  That would be a substantive due


process challenge there.  He also has raised below a -- a


vagueness challenge. 


It's a little different than the one 

he raises here.  But he would have that available to him


as well.  So that the -- the only -- Your Honor, the --


the only argument he raised below in the State supreme


court that would -- that would not be available to him


upon remand would be the one decided by this Court.  And


all the other issues he pressed below before the State


supreme court he could press again.


QUESTION:  Mr. Hurd --


QUESTION:  Mr. Hurd, could we go back just to


Justice Stevens' question for a minute?  And I -- I just

want to -- I want you to comment on the significance of


the -- of the -- the notice that you set out on page 5 of


your brief.  The notice says:  no trespassing, private


property, you are now entering private property and


streets, et cetera.  That sounds to me as though it -- it


means, as -- as a no trespassing sign normally would, that


if you are not a -- the landowner or a licensee of the


landowner specifically, you're not supposed to enter.


Then it goes on to say, unauthorized persons,


which I take it anybody who is not authorized to enter,


will be subject to arrest and prosecution.  So in answer


to Justice Stevens' question, if -- if that notice, which


is posted all over the -- the area, is a statement of


policy, I assume it is excluding everybody --


MR. HURD: 


No, Your Honor, it's not. 

QUESTION:  -- who is not a resident.


And -- and it then goes on to say that following


some review for what may or may not be authority, people


coming in can be arrested and prosecuted.


MR. HURD:  No, Your Honor.  The -- the policy is


not intended to convey the idea --


QUESTION:  No, but is that what this says?  If


we -- if we stick simply to the notices that you've put


up, isn't that, in effect, the burden of the notices that


you've put up?

 MR. HURD:  No, Your Honor, I do not believe


that's the case.  I believe that -- that the phrase


unauthorized persons calls into question, well, who -- who


is authorized and --


QUESTION:  Well, but before we get to that, it


says, no trespassing.  And doesn't that normally mean that


if you are not the landowner or a licensee, you're


trespassing?


MR. HURD:  Your Honor, in the context of a


private apartment complex, it would not mean that.  A


private apartment complex or a public apartment complex


where a tenant has a leasehold interest has the right to


invite people to come to that premises without having to


have the landlord grant permission.


QUESTION: 


Is it the signs that are under 

challenge here, or is it the ordinance?


MR. HURD:  It is -- it is not the signs.


QUESTION:  It -- it may well be that the


ordinance is constitutional but the signs aren't.


MR. HURD:  It is -- it is the policy --


QUESTION:  That's possible.


MR. HURD:  It is the policy that is -- that is


challenged, not -- not the signs.


QUESTION:  But are you taking the position that


the policy and the signs are different in their content?

 MR. HURD:  We're taking the position they must


be read together, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  If you read them separately, are they


different?


MR. HURD:  A -- a person might be able to read


the sign in isolation and believe that they had to get


some permission to come in advance, but the people who


come to the -- to this housing complex and do so


legitimately typically receive invitations from the


residents.  So they understand.  The residents understand


what the policy is.


QUESTION:  Mr. Hurd, that's a curiosity about


this case, the fact background of it that perhaps you can


clarify.  You keep saying legitimate visitor.  This man's


mother and his child and the mother of his child all live 

in this project, and one would think that he would


certainly have a basis to visit his family.


MR. HURD:  Your Honor, two -- two points on


that.  The -- the first point is had he not been barred,


certainly coming to visit his family would be a legitimate


purpose.  But once he is barred -- and he was -- he was


barred under this --


QUESTION:  And we don't know why.


MR. HURD:  Well, the -- the record suggests on


page 60 that there may have been some domestic violence in

the background.  We do not know the specific facts of


that.  But we do know that that is referred to by Gloria


Rogers on page 60 of the joint appendix.  There's also a


reference on that same page to giving out false


information about addresses he allegedly lived at in the


premises.  He did plead guilty twice to trespassing and


was convicted of damaging property.


He does not challenge the particular reasons why


he was barred, and if he wants to deliver diapers, he


should have thought about that before his misconduct


earned him this barment notice and he thereby forfeited


his right to return.


Besides, Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg, there's


no evidence anyone saw any diapers or that he was there on


such an errand other than what he said. 


And when he asked 

Gloria Rogers to let him back on the property, he never


mentioned visiting the child or the child's mother.


QUESTION:  It's not disputed that his -- that


they live in the project.


MR. HURD:  They do, and had he not engaged in


misconduct, the situation never would have arisen.  But it


certainly cannot --


QUESTION:  Maybe they want him out too.  We


don't really know that either, do we?


MR. HURD:  We -- we do not, Your Honor.  We do

not.  The -- there was no testimony at trial from the


mother that she had asked him to come or that he had


brought her diapers or -- or any of that.  We have no idea


whether he is welcome there or not.


But the -- the point I want to make is that


surely it cannot be the law that a desire to visit one's


mother or one's girlfriend trumps a barment notice


regardless of how bad the individual's prior conduct may


have been.  He did not challenge that barment notice by


saying, well, it wasn't bad enough.  What we do know in


the record is that it was pretty bad:  two prior instances


of trespass, damaging property, and so forth.


In sum -- I see my time is -- is running out. 


I'd like to reserve some of it.


In sum, we have families here living in 

desperate circumstances, marijuana for sale on Bethel


Street, crack cocaine on Ambrose, heroin over on Deforrest


Street.  The overbreadth doctrine was designed to remedy


situations where a challenged statute chills the rights of


others not before the court.  Here it's not this trespass


policy that chills the right of free speech, but the


dangerous conditions at Whitcomb Court that the policy was


designed to alleviate.


We ask that the judgment below be vacated.


Thank you.

QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE


SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. DREEBEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


What makes this case distinctive as a First


Amendment case is the presence of a general law not


directed at speech at all but directed at conduct that's


under challenge and the absence of any expressive activity


whatsoever by the person seeking to raise the overbreadth


challenge.


This Court's cases have entertained overbreadth


challenges as a means of alleviating the chill of First


Amendment rights of persons who are not before the Court,


but the Court has never entertained overbreadth when the


consequence of doing so would be to invalidate a general


law that's primarily aimed at conduct and when the person


who's raising the challenge did nothing to engage in


speech or any expressive activity at all.


The costs of an overbreadth challenge, this


Court has recognized, are high because they prohibit the

Government from enforcing a law against conduct that is


not constitutionally protected.  But those costs are


magnified when the law under challenge is not merely a law


that directs --


QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, assume -- I know it's


not quite clear, but assume for the moment that Virginia


had clearly -- Virginia Supreme Court clearly said we're


going to allow standing as a matter of State law, but --


even though it wouldn't be allowed as a matter of Federal


law, and the case then came to us in that posture.  Would


we then have authority to decide the overbreadth issue?


MR. DREEBEN:  I'm not sure that this Court


would, Justice Stevens.  It would then be in a posture


more analogous to the J.H. Munson case that was before the


Court in which the Court considered and Your Honor's 

separate opinion addressed the question of whether, when


there was an independent State overbreadth analysis, could


an aggrieved State official then bring the case to this


Court.


What is clear on the current record is that the


Virginia Supreme Court cited and relied on --


QUESTION:  No.  I understand that.  But I'm just


-- I'm just wondering if it went back and they said, well,


that's true, but it was a matter of Virginia law.  We


think we'll entertain a stand, and then they decide on

Federal grounds that it violates the First Amendment. 


Then my question is, could we review that holding, and if


-- if we reviewed it in that?


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the question there would be


whether the State was sufficiently aggrieved so as to have


standing under the principles announced --


QUESTION:  Some of our loyalty oath cases -- I


forget if it was Adler or Doremus.  Doremus was First


Amendment -- allowed us to relax our standing rules in


order to reach a substantive constitutional issue cited by


the State court.


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the most relevant case is


probably the Asarco decision in which the Court concluded


that once the State court binds the State officials to a


particular ruling, that there may be the requisite case or 

controversy to allow this Court to decide --


QUESTION:  There's -- there's also --


QUESTION:  The same party can have standing to


appeal.


MR. DREEBEN:  That's right.  And --


QUESTION:  There's also a question, isn't there,


Mr. Dreeben, of whether this overbreadth doctrine is


essentially a part of the First Amendment or a part of the


standing doctrine?


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, it has two aspects, Mr.


22

Chief Justice.  One aspect of it does relate to whether


there is a case or controversy, and there clearly has to


be a developed enough case or controversy to allow Article


III to be invoked for this Court to announce First


Amendment principles at all.  And part of the overbreadth


doctrine responds to those concerns.


But another aspect of the overbreadth doctrine


is purely prudential, and this Court has adopted those


limits as a matter of -- of prudential principles to avoid


the premature adjudication of hypothetical and abstract


First Amendment questions.


QUESTION:  But it clearly relates to the


doctrine of standing, doesn't it, which doctrine says that


you normally do not have standing to raise the objections


of other people? 


You only have standing to raise 

objections to your own treatment, not to the treatment of


others, right?


MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct.  I wouldn't


dispute --


QUESTION:  And overbreadth changes that.  It


says in this one area, you can object to the treatment of


other people.


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think overbreadth is -- is


an application of a more general principle that this


Court has adopted on -- in various circumstances to allow

a party who's before the Court and who is aggrieved to


raise the rights of others.  For example, in Batson


challenges, the Court allows criminal defendants to raise


the rights of the excluded jurors.


This is an example of third party standing


designed to implement First Amendment norms, but the


Court has recognized that the costs of invalidating a law,


when the person before the Court doesn't have


constitutionally protected conduct, are high, and those


costs are higher when what's being invalidated is not


merely a law aimed at speech, but a law aimed at access,


general conduct, as is this law.


QUESTION:  But the irony of what you're saying


is that the Virginia -- Virginia Supreme Court might


undertake that cost, invalidate a Virginia statute on 

Federal grounds that we think are wrong and we couldn't do


anything about it.


MR. DREEBEN:  That is probably true unless the


Court applies the Asarco principle to allow an aggrieved


State official to bring the case here because its own


supreme court has interfered with the implementation of


Federal law --


QUESTION:  See, but that's -- that's the


problem.  I mean, this is exactly -- that's why I'm mixed


up about the standing part versus the merits.  It seems to

me if it's a traditional question of standing, there --


there are a group of people who are trespassing who have


nothing to do with speech.  And then there's some other


hypothetical people that might have to do with speech. 


And the question is can these people who have nothing to


do with speech invalidate the statute because of the way


it applies to some other people?  Now, in the First


Amendment area, we have normally let people do that, but


in other areas not.


All right.  So suppose the answer is not.  You


can't.  That's their problem.  Let them raise it.


Now, Virginia says, we want to let any taxpayer


raise it.  If it were purely standing, any taxpayer could


raise it, but then what?  I would have said that the first


holding would have meant it is not unconstitutional under 

the Federal Constitution to convict this person.  And --


and now, under -- under the guise of standing, they're


going to come back and say, oh, no, it is unconstitutional


because we let this person raise the rights of some


others.  That's where I'm confused.


MR. DREEBEN:  I think the answer to this paradox


is that the State court can adopt much broader principles


of law with respect to standing than this Court would


impose, and it can administer them even when it's


adjudicating Federal light -- rights.  For example, a

State could allow a purely advisory opinion to be issued

citizen.


QUESTION:  Well, fine, let them challenge it.


QUESTION:  Okay.  Does --


QUESTION:  But if you're right, no matter how


much they challenge it, the simple fact is, if you're


right, it doesn't violate the Federal Constitution to


convict this person.


MR. DREEBEN:  That's true.


QUESTION:  So what's raising it going to get


him?


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, that -- that is an


adjudication of the -- of the overbreadth challenge on the


merits. 


It would be a determination that there is not 

sufficient real and substantial overbreadth to invalidate


this law, and we do think that that is a correct analysis


and would suffice to reject the Virginia Supreme Court's


holding in this case.


QUESTION:  Okay, but you're -- I think you're


saying that -- that under Asarco, they can challenge the


substantiality point, but they wouldn't necessarily be


able to challenge the standing point which gets this


particular defendant in a position to raise the issue in


the first place.  Is that right?

 MR. DREEBEN:  It's not exactly right, Justice


Souter, because I think this is an area analogous to the


Court's rules in criminal cases under Michigan v. Long


where the Court has to decide, does this opinion rest on a


question of Federal law or does it rest on a question of


State law?  And in Michigan v. Long, the Court adopted a


presumption that if what a State court does is cite and


rely on Federal precedents, we will presume that it did


what it did because it thought it was compelled to by the


force of this Court's decisions.


QUESTION:  We certainly -- that certainly


applies when you're talking about substantive law whether


it -- it would be an extension of that to apply it to


standing.


MR. DREEBEN: 


I think it would only be a modest 

extension because in this case the court did not


separately analyze the questions of standing as such from


whether respondent could bring an overbreadth challenge,


and the question wasn't posed with a --


QUESTION:  Why -- why isn't that a question of


standing by definition?


MR. DREEBEN:  It -- what it --


QUESTION:  Overbreadth is an exception to


standing, and -- and so why is it anything but a standing


issue?  Substantiality of overbreadth is -- is a

substantive issue, but -- you see my --


MR. DREEBEN:  Let me -- let me explain it this


way, Justice Souter.  If this Court said the First


Amendment overbreadth doctrine requires that State courts


entertain overbreadth claims like this one even when it's


a general law and even when the party before the court has


been convicted of conduct that doesn't involve speech,


then State courts would be required to follow that rule


and could not adopt a different standing principle that


was narrower and that would exclude respondent.


And our reading of the Virginia Supreme Court's


opinion is that Virginia either thought or assumed that it


was required by this Court's cases to entertain an


overbreadth challenge.  The proper response, if the Court


agrees that it's not the State court's obligation to 

entertain this overbreadth challenge, would be to vacate


the judgment, announce the correct First Amendment


principles, and remand the case to the Virginia Supreme


Court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.


QUESTION:  But that would -- that would


basically be applying something like Michigan v. Long


rather than Asarco, right?


MR. DREEBEN:  In this case, it certainly would


because the State court hasn't relied on a clearly


insufficient case or controversy in order to adjudicate

Federal rights.  There is, in fact, a case or controversy


here.  The respondent has been convicted of a criminal


offense, and he is challenging the law under which he was


convicted.  So this case does not fall outside of the case


or controversy requirement even measured by Article III


standards.


QUESTION:  If we follow that course, we wouldn't


get to the substantive overbreadth, right?  We would


just --

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN D. BENJAMIN 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. BENJAMIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


In 1997, Richmond took a neighborhood and by


ordinance, deed, and a police authorization, made it so


that a person could not walk down the street or the


sidewalk unless he could prove to the police that he was


authorized to do so.  The policy that the city implemented


was of such breadth that it included the public, residents


and nonresidents alike of this community, that it included

innocent people doing lawful things, and it included


protected conduct, such as the distribution of literature.


QUESTION:  Are you suggesting that these streets


were still as if they belonged to the City of Richmond


after they were deeded to the housing authority?


MR. BENJAMIN:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Why is that?


MR. BENJAMIN:  They were still public.  They


were still public streets, regardless of the transfer --


QUESTION:  Why -- you know, clearly the city


intended that they no longer be public streets.  Why did


that intention fail?


MR. BENJAMIN:  Your Honor, for the same reason


when Congress ruled -- or -- or passed a law saying that


the sidewalks around this building were no longer to be 

used, for the same reason.  The intent didn't matter.  The


character and the use and the form didn't change at all,


and those were the criteria that mattered.


QUESTION:  That wasn't a law making those


private sidewalks. 


What -- what about the streets to and from the


entry to the Governor's mansion in Richmond?  Are they


public streets too?


MR. BENJAMIN:  Yes, they are, Your Honor.

QUESTION:  From the gate, but there's a street


that goes right from the gate right up, you know, circular


driveway, right up to the Governor's front door.  That's a

status, whether Ms. Rogers is the one who has the right to


say who can come and who can go.  This is Ms. Rogers'

 QUESTION:  But I -- I take it that all of those


issues are open for you to argue if we were to agree with


the State that the Supreme Court of Virginia was simply


wrong in its First Amendment analysis on overbreadth, and


you would have all of those arguments to confront and to


see if you can prevail on if we remand it to the Supreme


Court of Virginia.


MR. BENJAMIN:  Your Honor, that's correct. 


However, those same issues, of course, were before the


Virginia Supreme Court.  The -- the State, the petitioner,


did not even challenge standing until the State sought


cert at this Court.


The question presented concerning the closest


issue to standing was whether Mr. Hicks was untimely in


his challenge to the barment-trespass policy.  The State


in all of the State courts argued that Mr. Hicks should


have challenged his barment in some civil proceeding, and


that's the question presented on page 97 of the joint


appendix and that was what the Virginia Supreme Court


dealt with, it having been the only issue presented to


them on this at page 158.


QUESTION:  It doesn't have to argue it if they


decide it.  We -- we will review a question that is either


argued or decided by the State court.  There's no doubt


that the Virginia Supreme Court decided the standing

question, decided the overbreadth question, and you're


saying that we cannot review that decision because he was


not the one that initiated the -- the matter?  That's just


not what our law says.


MR. BENJAMIN:  I don't know, Your Honor, if it


is true to say that the Virginia court necessarily decided


the standing order, it not -- the standing issue, it not


having been raised.  But --


QUESTION:  They had a whole long discussion of


overbreadth.  I mean --


MR. BENJAMIN:  Yes, sir.


QUESTION:  What do you think that was about?


MR. BENJAMIN:  Yes, Your Honor, that was on the


merits.  When the Virginia Supreme Court discussed the


merits, they discussed whether there was overbreadth and 

whether it was substantially overbroad.


QUESTION:  But they didn't decide that


overbreadth was an issue.  They just went ahead and


decided if overbreadth had been an issue, this is how the


issue would be resolved.  Certainly they decided that


overbreadth -- that is, the standing doctrine of


overbreadth -- was applicable to this case.


MR. BENJAMIN:  Your Honor, I disagree with you. 


I don't think they decided that and I don't think it


was --

 QUESTION:  Then why did they go into the


discussion of whether this was overbroad?  They must have


thought it relevant.


MR. BENJAMIN:  Your Honor, because it -- it was


the -- the immediate issue that confronted them.  They


were confronted with a policy that was unconstitutional in


so many fundamental respects.


QUESTION:  But they dealt with only one.  Mr.


Hurd said, yes, your question of public forum or not would


be open, your due process vagueness argument would be


open.  What wouldn't be open, if we ruled against you on


this First Amendment overbreadth thing, is -- that's all.


Everything else -- the Virginia Supreme Court said this is


what we're deciding and we're not getting to -- they


deliberately said we're not getting to public forum. 

MR. BENJAMIN:  Your Honor, if the Virginia


Supreme Court did implicitly decide the standing issue,


then it was a right that it had to accept this -- this


case which was, as the Government concedes, and the


petitioner, a case and controversy.  Mr. Hicks was


convicted, and he did raise all of these constitutional


issues in defense of his conviction.  And if the Virginia


Supreme Court implicitly reached the standing question,


then as a matter of State law and State rights, it was


entitled to do that.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Benjamin, certainly the


dissenting opinion in the Supreme Court of Virginia talked


about overbreadth.  I mean, the -- the one -- I'm just


reading a sentence here from appendix page:  Thus, I


conclude that the defendant may only challenge the


trespass policy as it was applied to him.  Now, that --


that is overbreadth.


MR. BENJAMIN:  Yes, sir.  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  So what is the answer then to the


overbreadth question?  That is, the first question


presented in the petition for certiorari, which we


granted, asks, as I read it, the question of whether a


person who does not engage in expressive conduct at all


can ask the court and can succeed in having the court


strike down a statute as applied to him for the reason 

that it might be unconstitutional as applied to other


people engaged in expressive conduct.


The example would be, favoring their side, that


you have a gun statute.  Any person who possesses a gun is


-- goes to jail, and the defendant says, well, I did


possess a gun and I was trying to rob a bank, but maybe


this statute would be applied to a person in a play, in


which case it would be too broad.  And they say it's like


that absurd example.


All right.  Now, why isn't it close enough to

the absurd example?  They're also arguing that this is a


statute that deals with drugs.  It deals with ordinary


trespass.  Very few of these people want to pamphlet or


engage in expressive conduct.  A handful might, but if


they do, let's consider it, when this statute is applied


to them, which it never has been in their view.


Now, what's your response?


MR. BENJAMIN:  Your Honor, my response is that


in the ordinary case, such as some of your hypotheticals


suggest, it would become instantly apparent that the


robber, although claiming that the statute or the policy


is overbroad -- it would become instantly apparent that he


had no basis whatsoever to bring this motion.  If he even


got to a hearing, there would be an immediate failure of


proof, but it wouldn't get to a hearing because there 

would be a motion to quash the motion for lack of --


QUESTION:  There happened to be -- I didn't give


you the whole statute.  There were seven other


constitutional errors in it, but I didn't mention them


because they could be raised on remand.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  So it's -- that -- that I'm trying to


make this --


MR. BENJAMIN:  In this policy I counted eight


constitutional errors.

 In this case, Mr. Hicks' conduct was expressive. 


Mr. Hicks meets Virginia's own test because he was going


to see his children, and there is no expressive action --


QUESTION:  You know, I -- I think it's a mistake


to put too much onto the First Amendment.  The police


officer stops me unlawfully and I say, I was on the way


home to talk to my wife.  I mean, this -- this -- it tends


to trivialize the First Amendment if you put so much on


it.  You have some very important substantive issues here


about the right of freedom of movement to use the streets


and so forth, and it seems to me that for the -- for you


to rest the case, A, on the First Amendment, B, under what


is a very questionable application of the overbreadth


doctrine.  It -- it is not the right way to proceed in


this case.


MR. BENJAMIN:  Your Honor, I understand your


question, and Mr. Hicks at the inception was not outraged


about free speech and First Amendment issues.  He was


outraged about the fact that he had been banned for


apparently nothing more, as the en banc Virginia court


found, going back to see his family repeatedly.  He was


upset and challenged the very barment proceeding and the


-- the entire policy.


QUESTION:  May I just stop you there as a matter


of accuracy?  We don't know why he was debarred, but we do

know that one of the charges was destruction of property. 


We don't know what property that was.  So it's -- I think


you're painting a somewhat false picture to suggest that


this was a loving father who was simply going to visit his


children.


MR. BENJAMIN:  The en banc court at page 125,


footnote --


QUESTION:  Is this the court of appeals?


MR. BENJAMIN:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Not the supreme court.


MR. BENJAMIN:  Not the supreme court, had found,


Your Honor, that the -- the charge of damaging property


had nothing to do with his barment, and there was nothing


in the record or in the evidence suggesting otherwise.


The testimony at page 60 of the joint appendix 

does not permit the inference urged by the petitioner. 


The inference at most urged -- that you could draw from


page 60, the testimony there is that the police quite


often saw Mr. Hicks in the development and he gave them an


address, and then Ms. Rogers would confirm that he did not


live there.


QUESTION:  Well, if you're going appeal to page


60, you're just out of the frying pan into the -- into the


fire.  Yes, it -- it doesn't mention destruction of


property, but it does mention domestic violence.

 MR. BENJAMIN:  Your Honor, what Gloria Rogers is


doing in that instance, although she has been asked the


specific question, how did Kevin Hicks come to be barred,


she begins, as she does, giving a general answer in how


people get barred.  And in the -- she began with that.


Then she went to Mr. Hicks' case, and then she went back


to one of her own reasons of domestic violence.


QUESTION:  No.  She's answering the question,


please tell the court how he came -- how has he come and


have you banned him from the property.  Yes.  All right. 


Please tell the court how that came about.  And she said,


number one -- she gave two reasons.  When the police see a


person in the development and they say they live


someplace, they confirm with the office, and Kevin Hicks


gave a false address. 


Secondly, because of the domestic 

violence in the development.  I -- I take that to be a


response to the question that was asked.  So, you know, to


the extent we know anything about why he was banned, it


was either because he destroyed property or because he


participated in domestic violence.


MR. BENJAMIN:  Yes, Your Honor.  We had sought


discovery of the reasons that he was banned, and counsel


at page 1312 and 13 had said that counsel needed to


demonstrate why Mr. Hicks was barred.  But RRHA counsel,


the housing authority counsel, objected that the reason

why Mr. Hicks was banned was irrelevant because being a


private property owner, the position was, they could ban


anyone at any time for any reason.


QUESTION:  Okay, Mr. Benjamin, I'm going to ask


you to assume that I at least do not accept the view that


the record shows that your client was there for an


expressive purpose that ought to be recognized by the --


by the First Amendment.  I don't ask you to stipulate that


he was banned because he was a criminal.  I will simply


assume that he is in some middle ground, that he is not


there for expressive purposes.  Assume we don't know why


he's there.


What's your -- your answer basically to the


question put to you by Justice Breyer?  Why is it


necessary, in order to protect the First Amendment, to 

allow a person in that position to -- to raise this kind


of -- of issue with respect, say, to leafleters or people


who are there for expressive purposes?  Why do we need to


recognize this?


MR. BENJAMIN:  Because, Your Honor, as you --


this very exchange illustrates how unworkable that very


test would be because reasonable people will disagree over


whether any given conduct is in fact expressive.  If the


very fact that Mr. Hicks --


QUESTION:  Well, you're changing my hypo.  I

mean, I -- I said let's assume that we don't have a


predicate for saying this person's conduct is expressive. 


I will grant you that there are always going to be points


on the margin in which we say, well, was he there for


speech or wasn't he.  Assume he wasn't.  What -- what is


the -- what is the best argument for recognizing his right


to raise a First Amendment claim?


MR. BENJAMIN:  Because the whole reason for the


exception is the importance of First Amendment rights and


values.  To impose this sort of a test would defeat the


purpose and -- and the value, the opportunity for society


to deal with laws that sweep this broadly and infringe


upon and violate people's --


QUESTION:  Why -- why don't you have an adequate


basis to deal with them under the vagueness doctrine, for 

example, that is open to you on remand, even if you lose


here?  Why do we have to turn this into a First Amendment


issue?


MR. BENJAMIN:  Because I think the Virginia


Supreme Court, when it saw the entirety of this policy,


including not just the First Amendment issues, but the


vagueness that permeates this policy -- I think that the


Virginia Supreme Court decided, from a conservative


approach, that it would deal with the most to it -- the


most obvious deficiency and that is the complete

unfettered discretion that -- that Gloria Rogers, the


housing manager, had, that every single police officer


had, and deal with it then while the policy was before it,


instead of going on and settling other questions, instead


of requiring that challenges --


QUESTION:  But what you just said goes right to


vagueness, that you have an administrator who says, I'm


queen.  I'll let you in or I won't let you in.  I don't


see why you need the First Amendment hook to challenge


that point.


MR. BENJAMIN:  Mr. Hicks didn't need the First


Amendment.  His issue from the very beginning began with


the -- the vagueness that permeates this, but it -- he --


QUESTION:  But -- but maybe it's not your fault,


but that's what the Supreme Court of Virginia said, and in 

the course of doing so, it arguably -- and there's a very


serious concern that it misapplied Thornhill.


QUESTION:  Mr. Benjamin, I don't want to put


words in your mouth -- excuse me.  I'm sorry.  I didn't --


I don't want to put words in your mouth, but is this what


you're trying to say, that if the statute is so overbroad


it would be unconstitutional if the person has standing to


challenge it?  It doesn't matter whether he is -- his


disability is -- is because it's not a First Amendment


issue at all or whether he's engaged in First Amendment

conduct which is perfectly prohibitable as to him.  In


either event, it doesn't matter why he can't challenge it


as long as his -- as the statute itself is overbroad.  Is


that what your position is?


MR. BENJAMIN:  Yes, Your Honor, that is.


QUESTION:  All right.  Then --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  That's -- is there a -- is there a


risk here?  And I'm not asking it from one point of view


or another.  I don't know.  But if we accepted that, there


are trespass laws all over the country.  And -- and would


-- I don't know what they all say, but people who are


convicted of ordinary trespass -- and a lot of them apply


to public property, et cetera -- could then come in and


say, look, these trespass laws, even though they've never 

been applied to stop expression -- except in my case, but


I'm assuming it's not expression in my case.  Assume it's


not.  We have to set them all aside because they might be


applied to expression in -- in a way that's


unconstitutional.  If I accepted the proposition that


you've just accepted, have I got myself in that box?


MR. BENJAMIN:  Your Honor, I'm afraid I lost you


somewhat during --


QUESTION:  Well, in other words, if I take the


proposition you've just accepted as your argument, am I

then allowing people who trespass -- nothing to do with


expression -- to start attacking all the trespass laws on


the ground that if applied in the expression area, they


would be unconstitutional?  And they haven't been applied


in that area.


MR. BENJAMIN:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  In other words -- I would be --


MR. BENJAMIN:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  I would be accepting that.


MR. BENJAMIN:  Yes.  And that -- that -- but


it's not much of a risk.


QUESTION:  Because?


MR. BENJAMIN:  Because those challenges would


fail almost immediately because it -- I know of no other


case where the trespass law has applied so pervasively to 

the entire streets and sidewalks of a community. 


QUESTION:  But trespass on public property --


there could be all kinds of situations, Federal buildings


and dozens of them, where in fact it's really applied


against people who are breaking in who have no business


there, and they just don't apply it or it never has come


up whether they would apply it were somebody interested in


a demonstration.


MR. BENJAMIN:  Yes, Your Honor, but the system


can easily deal with frivolous motions because of the

requirements already built into the requirement. 


Overbreadth must not only exist and be articulable, it


must be substantial.  And the system could deal with that,


with sanctions if necessary.


In this case it wasn't enough for a citizen to


have, in fact, a legitimate purpose to use the sidewalk. 


He had to be able to demonstrate that he had a legitimate


purpose.  The legitimate purpose was by reference solely


to the subjective standards of any particular police


officer or Gloria Rogers, the housing manager.  There was


no housing authority handbook of what constitutes


legitimate business.  There was no clear meaning as to


what legitimate meant.  Left unsaid would be whether


someone could go onto these streets and sidewalks if their


business was to argue and have it out with someone or to 

go meet with abortion activists.  All we know from this


policy is that before you can use these sidewalks, you


must be engaged in a legitimate -- whatever that means --


business or social reason, which by its own terms --


QUESTION:  Those are all vagueness -- those are


all vagueness points.  They -- they really don't go to the


-- right?  You're making the vagueness argument now. 


MR. BENJAMIN:  I am --


QUESTION:  You -- you would have us rule on a


vagueness ground as well, wouldn't you?

 MR. BENJAMIN:  I would, but --


QUESTION:  I'd sort of like to separate the


arguments that are going to vagueness and those that are


going to overbreadth.  The ones you're making now don't go


to overbreadth, it seems to me. 


MR. BENJAMIN:  Your Honor, you can't separate


vagueness and overbreadth, and this argument goes directly


to the heart of First Amendment. 


QUESTION:  Well, our cases have certainly


separated vagueness from overbreadth.


MR. BENJAMIN:  I think that this Court has used


the terms vagueness and overbreadth interchangeably and --


QUESTION:  Well, let's -- let's assume that


we're up to the challenge. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  It -- it seems to me that there are


some very important vagueness arguments in -- in the -- in


the classical sense of that term that your client can and


should make, and they're unrelated to the speech point. 


They're completely unrelated to it.  They can play back in


the speech context just as well, but -- but the Supreme


Court of Virginia thought about this just in the speech


context, and that's our concern. 


MR. BENJAMIN:  I submit, Your Honor, that the


Virginia Supreme Court was taken and impressed by the

First Amendment implications that are produced by the


vagueness.  If you must have a legitimate business or


social purpose -- and by those terms what's excluded as a


legitimate purpose are lawful purposes like wandering or


jogging because that's not a -- a business or social


purpose, but also protected purposes such as distributing


fliers, literature, or holding religious meetings.  That


does not -- that kind of conduct at least arguably does


not fall within the rubric of business or social --


QUESTION:  No, but isn't it true -- but isn't


the problem with your argument this:  It is one thing to


say that a statute that ostensibly addresses speech is


likely to have a serious overbreadth problem if it is very


vague in the way it does it, but it is a very different


thing to say that a statute that does not ostensibly 

address speech, that addresses conduct, walking across a


line, becomes an overbreadth -- presents an overbreadth


problem simply because somebody who crosses that line


might want to talk.  And you're arguing on the basis of


cases in the first category, speech with vague


limitations, to tell us that we ought to -- that we ought


to consider everything in the second category a speech


case.  Isn't that the -- the difficulty of your argument? 


MR. BENJAMIN:  It is not, Your Honor, because


this policy targeted streets in the first place, streets

and sidewalks, which are -- a principal purpose of which


is for expressive activity.  The policy itself was called


the street privatization program. 


QUESTION:  Well, that --


QUESTION:  But the --


QUESTION:  Mr. Benjamin, it may not be


immediately before us, but it seems to me it is the heart


of your case.  You are essentially saying that a public


authority cannot create, for people who live in projects,


a gated community.  The people who live outside projects


can have streets, everything just like this, but


government can't create it for poor people.  Is that --


MR. BENJAMIN:  Your Honor, they -- they can't --


the Government can't do it by simply saying that the


streets are private and simply putting up signs because --

QUESTION:  Okay.  If you're right on that, we


don't have to get to the speech issue.  If you're wrong on


that, you have the problem that I just presented to you,


don't you? 


MR. BENJAMIN:  I don't understand. 


QUESTION:  If -- look, if -- if you're right


that the Government cannot, in their words, privatize the


streets, then that's the end of the case.  Your guy can't


be prosecuted for trespass in this instance, and that's


the end of the issue here.  If it turns out, on the other

hand, that the Government can indeed do what it purported


to do here, then it seems to me your argument suffers from


the problem that I raised.  You're saying that even in a


case in which the statute doesn't address speech but


addresses conduct, crossing a property line, there is a


speech implication and every one of those trespass cases


becomes a First Amendment overbreadth case.  Isn't --


isn't that correct?


MR. BENJAMIN:  I agree that the challenge can be


made if counsel sees fit to do so, but of course, he's


bound by the State's ethical requirements.  And the -- the


issue won't be there in most cases.  There is no policy


that is going to be as vague and overbroad, so pervasive


in its effect on First Amendment freedoms as well as --


QUESTION: 


You're saying when it gets very, 

very, very, very, very vague that's when it becomes a -- a


First Amendment problem even though it -- the statute


doesn't address speech.  Is that basically it? 


MR. BENJAMIN:  Your Honor, yes.


QUESTION:  How could we administer that?


MR. BENJAMIN:  It's not -- what you administer


is what has always been administered, the requirement of a


finding of substantial overbreadth.


QUESTION:  Do we -- do we have any -- any


overbreadth cases that -- that would support that?  I

you can't stop his.  Do -- do you have any authority

MR. BENJAMIN:  I don't think that in Chicago v.


Morales that there was any claim that the petitioners in


that case were involved in expressive activity.


QUESTION:  I thought they wanted to have a


parade or a -- a --


MR. BENJAMIN:  That was --

MR. BENJAMIN:  I think, Your Honor, that was in


Forsyth County. 


QUESTION:  Oh. 


MR. BENJAMIN: 


We have cases such as Watchtower, 

for example, where admittedly in Watchtower, Jehovah's


Witnesses were engaging in expressive activity, but there


was nothing about the facts of that case or the ordinance


that suggested that anyone in nonexpressive activity would


not have been able to raise the substantial overbreadth


challenge.  If it had been Girls Scouts, for example. 


QUESTION:  No.  I think that was a First


Amendment.  What about Morales?  What -- what did Morales


involve?

QUESTION:  Their -- their right to gather and


assemble.  I -- that's sort of First Amendment stuff,


isn't it?


MR. BENJAMIN:  I don't know that this Court


reached it on that point.  It -- the Court did reach


overbreadth, but didn't decide on overbreadth because the


statute -- see, the ordinance explicitly by its terms did


not reach First Amendment freedoms or protected activity


because you had to be doing something with no apparent


purpose.


QUESTION: 


No, but the thing that the person 

wanted to do was to -- was to gather with his buddies on


the street corner. 


MR. BENJAMIN:  Under that ordinance, it wasn't


illegal.  That didn't violate the ordinance because that


was an apparent --


QUESTION:  Yes, it did, and one of them was a


gang member. 


MR. BENJAMIN:  It did not because if he wanted


to do it for an apparent purpose of expressive activity,


then it didn't violate, and so that was not a problem.

 In this case we have the extraordinary situation


that a person must have government permission, police


permission to walk a street, to use a sidewalk, and his


right to do this depends entirely upon the completely


unfettered discretion of the police and a government


official.  If someone wants to go onto that sidewalk and


pass out literature, they must get permission.  They must


get Gloria Rogers' permission, and she can give that


permission or deny that permission in accordance with


whatever criteria she uses at any given moment.


The First Amendment problems with this case are


substantial and pervasive.  The Virginia Supreme Court saw


that and dealt with it while it was there, seeing nothing


redeemable about this policy whatsoever. 


QUESTION: 


Thank you, Mr. Benjamin. 

Mr. Hurd, your time is expiring even as we


speak. 


(Laughter.) 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  So the case is


submitted. 


MR. HURD:  Thank you, Your Honor. 


(Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
