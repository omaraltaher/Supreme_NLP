CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 
first this morning in Case 11-45, Elgin v. Department of 
the Treasury. 

Mr. Schwartz. 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY A. SCHWARTZ 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The question in this case is whether it is 

fairly discernible from the Civil Service Reform Act 
that Congress revoked the district court jurisdiction to 
declare acts of Congress unconstitutional in actions 
brought by Federal employees.  The answer is no, for 
several reasons. 

First, the Civil Service Reform Act doesn't 

say that it precludes section 1331 jurisdiction. 
Congress could have said so.  Congress didn't say so. 
And there's no inference of preclusion of the 
Petitioners' claims that's fairly discernible from the 
scheme itself.  And that's because challenges to 
constitutionality of statutes are just not the type of 
claims that are reviewed through the CSRA scheme. 

Because of this, the Merit Systems

Protection Board dismisses challenge -- challenges to 
constitutionality of a statute routinely as outside of 
its authority. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Schwartz --
MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- suppose an employee is 

fired and he has a variety of different kinds of claims, 
constitutional and statutory.  What would you think 
happens then?  Does he bring the constitutional claims 
in one court but the statutory claims in another 
court -- excuse me -- in the -- in the commission? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  No, Your Honor.  I believe 

that, because of normal rules against splitting of 
claims, the employee would have to make a decision. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that seems just as 

bad.  In other words, that then, you -- it's not 
inefficient necessarily, but your scheme would force the 
employee to choose between her constitutional claims and 
her statutory claims. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  That is correct. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why would we do that? 
MR. SCHWARTZ:  Because of the importance of 
making the constitutional claims available in -- in a --
for judicial review.  That is -- that's just one of the 
options that the employee would have to weigh.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Why would you make 

that concession?  Why wouldn't it be possible in that --
for an employee to choose?  If the employee had both 
constitutional and nonconstitutional claims, perhaps 
that employee could take advantage of the review scheme 
that's outlined by the Government.  But in the situation 
where there's purely a challenge to a statute, the 
employee would have the option of bringing the claim in 
one of the district courts. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  That -- that certainly is a 

possibility, Your Honor.  And -- and it is a possibility 
that the employee could bring his constitutional claim 
in the district court and still pursue his statutory 
claim before the Merit Systems Protection Board. 
However, I'd like to point out that, while this is an 
interesting hypothetical, we don't have to look at 
hypotheticals in this situation because we have in the 
Third Circuit since 1986 and in the District of Columbia 
Circuit since 1995 -- those two circuits permit Federal 
employees to bring their constitutional claims in the 
circuit court. 

We were unable to find a single instance in 
which there has been one of these mixed claims of a -- a 
constitutional claim and a statutory claim brought in 
those circuits.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  In -- in those cases, did 
the -- did the plaintiffs also have nonconstitutional 
claims which they were pursuing in the Federal Circuit? 
MR. SCHWARTZ:  We -- we were unable to -- to 

find any example of -- of that happening. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, well, that's -- that's 

the problem here.  I mean, yes, if all you have is a 
constitutional claim, I suppose the system you propose 
would work.  You go to the district court.  But where --
where you have both, it's a problem. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  I -- and I -- I agree that 
that is a more difficult situation.  But it's not the 
situation presented by the facts of this case at least. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You suggested that it's a 
situation that doesn't often arise, and I guess that 
puzzles me.  Why wouldn't it often arise? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  I don't know why it doesn't 

often arise.  It -- it might be that -- that people 
prefer to leave their claims in the Merit Systems 
Protection Board.  And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, do you --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- what would happen if --
if the employee is fired because of his or her religion 
and he goes to MSPB?

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And this is a First 

Amendment claim.  MSPB has to say, well, this is not 
adequate cause, and -- and then they find something else 
in the statute?  It can't look at the constitutional 
aspect of the claim? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Your Honor, if -- if an 

employee is fired because of his religion, there's --
there's a -- a separate procedure for discrimination 
claims such as could be brought under Title VII -- and, 
in fact, those claims do go directly to the district 
court. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, because -- well, 

let's -- then I have to do a new hypothetical. 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because he gave a -- a 

speech --

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- saying there's no 

global warming or something. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes.  That claim now could be 
brought before the Merit Systems Protection Board, and I 
agree that -- that it can be brought before the Merit 
Systems Protection Board, and I'm not urging this Court 
to say that that --

lost this, which way your "no" was going.

my "no" then. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Schwartz, I thought 

you're talking about the constitutionality of a statute. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  That's it exactly, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Not any constitutional 

claim that there has been unconstitutional action by an 
official.  I thought that your point was when you're 
challenging the constitutionality of a statute, then you 
have a right to go to the district court. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  That is my point exactly, 

Your Honor.

on? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes.  I am drawing a 

distinction between a challenge to the constitutionality 
of a statute, as the Petitioners are doing here, and 
that is beyond the -- the authority of the Merit 
Systems --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you talking about a 

facial challenge to the statute as -- and am I 
understanding you right?  A facial challenge goes to the 
district court and a constitutional as-applied challenge 
goes to the commission? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes.  And -- and that --

that's the procedure.  The as-applied challenge -- those 
cases are bread-and-butter cases at the Merit Systems 
Protection Board now.  If somebody says I was fired 
because I wrote a letter to the editor that my boss 
didn't like, he's not challenging the constitutional --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I -- I was leading up 
to the fact, why should there be a difference?  If the 
MSPB has this expertise in as-applied, why doesn't it 
have it for facial?  I mean, the expertise question 
is -- it can't be a matter of expertise; or am I wrong 
about that? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Well, I would -- with due 
respect, I -- I disagree with you, Your Honor.  The

expertise required to decide the present Petitioners' 
claim and the letter to the editor claim is totally 
different.  In the letter to the editor claim, the facts 
concern the facts of the workplace, what was my boss's 
motivation, what were his actual reasons for firing me. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, and whether that 
reason was justifiable.  And isn't it the case that 
whenever the reason is an unconstitutional reason, you 
would have an as-applied challenge, right? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, why do you need a 

facial challenge in addition?  I thought that we always 
try to do as-applied first and facial second.  So, why 
isn't it enough that you can go to the Merit Systems 
Protection Board and then to the Federal Circuit saying 
that this action was wrong and not allowed under the 
statute?  And -- and if -- if the reason it was wrong 
was that it was unconstitutional, what's -- what's the 
problem? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Justice Scalia, I -- I agree 
that in the as-applied challenge where somebody says my 
rights were violated, that case now goes and should go 
to the Merit Systems Protection Board.  In the present 
case, there's no challenge to the application of a 
statute.  There's no challenge to any decision that was

made by -- by managers.  The challenge is to the 
decision made by Congress --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, that is the 

rule --

MR. SCHWARTZ:  -- in enacting the Civil --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's the rule that 
you would apply across the board so long -- only in the 
case of a facial challenge do you get to go to the 
district court?  If it's an as-applied -- this law was 
unconstitutional as applied to me -- that's still before 
the MSPB? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes.  And -- and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you tell me how --
MR. SCHWARTZ:  And --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- how -- how this is 

any different than the administrative system and review 
system that was reviewed in Thunder Basin and Illinois 
Long-Term Care?  In both those statutes, the agencies 
weren't permitted to consider facial challenges, 
constitutional challenges; and we said that's okay, they 
can't, but the reviewing court can.  So, how's that any 
different from the situation you're proposing here? 
MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes.  There are several 

significant differences.  I'd like to -- I'd like to go 
through them.

First of all, in the Thunder Basin case, 
the -- the constitutional challenge was -- was to the 
procedures that were being applied.  The agency, the 
Mine Safety Commission, was -- was an expert in those 
procedures.  The facts that were involved in making that 
determination were the very facts that this Mine Safety 
Commission had expertise in. 

In the present case, the challenge is to the 

Selective Service laws.  The Merit Systems Protection 
Board --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But please deal with the 

language of both cases.  Both cases said even if the 
agency can't review a constitutional challenge, there's 
still review within the Federal Circuit -- within the --
within the circuit courts, and that's okay. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, why isn't that okay 

here?  I think that was Justice Scalia's question to 
you.  I know that you say, well, the Federal Circuit 
won't have a record.  But the Government says if it 
wants a record, it can remand and ask the agency to 
develop it.  So, what's wrong with that procedure? 
MR. SCHWARTZ:  The first thing that's 

wrong -- that's wrong with that procedure as it would be 
applied to this case is that it's -- it's a vast

departure from the Civil Service Reform Act scheme as it 
was created by Congress; and -- and -- because that 
scheme involves the Merit Systems Protection Board 
acting as a trial court; and -- and giving the first 
level of review and in effect substituting for the --
for a district court.  And then --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't one of the 

challenges here by one of the Petitioners that he was 
constructively discharged?  Isn't that an issue that the 
board is better suited to determine in the first 
instance, whether there was at all a constructive 
discharge? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Well, in fact, it's -- it's 

just the reverse of that, where that one Petitioner 
would be taking the position that he was not 
constructively discharged.  If he was constructively 
discharged, the Merit Systems Protection Board arguably 
would have jurisdiction.  If he voluntarily resigned, 
under the Government's theory, he would be among the 
class of Federal employees -- constitutes about a third 
of Federal employees -- who have no appellate rights to 
the Merit Systems Protection Board. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought your position 
was that the Merit Systems Protection Board has said we 
have no authority to adjudicate constitutional

questions, period. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, I thought that the 

court was saying this claim is dismissed because we 
don't have jurisdiction to deal with that kind of 
question.  And then your next -- the Federal Circuit --
well, how can the Federal Circuit exercise jurisdiction 
over a claim where the first-instance decisionmaker said 
it didn't have authority to render the decision? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that that's 

what your position was. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  That is what our position is, 
and -- and it leaves open the question of just what the 
Federal Circuit is going to do after the Merit Systems 
Protection Board has dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's not your 

position, as I understood it, in your response to my 
earlier question.  You said that the -- it is all right 
to have as-applied constitutional challenges presented 
to the MSPB or not presented but then reviewed in the 
Federal Circuit. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  My position is that if the 
MSPB has jurisdiction to find a statute -- that since 
the MSPB does not have jurisdiction to find a statute

unconstitutional, any claim in which the employee is 
asking for them to find a statute unconstitutional is 
one that is outside of the CSRA scheme. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay, but -- but 

within the statutory scheme, are you saying that a claim 
that this statute is, while not facially 
unconstitutional, unconstitutional as applied to me --
Where does that go? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

apologize for my confusion about --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think it's 

probably mine. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Well, I would defer to you, 

Your Honor. 

(Laughter.) 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where does -- where 

does -- where does that claim go? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  My confusion is about the use 

of the term "as applied."  And I -- rather than using 
terms such as "facial" or "as applied" where the 
dividing line can be somewhat blurry, I propose drawing 
the dividing line between a case where the employee is 
saying this statute is unconstitutional; I'm saying 
Congress made a mistake --

dividing line be -- and I think that this is consistent 
with your argument.  The dividing line should be where 
the MSPB itself could decide the claim. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  If the MSPB can decide the 

claim, then it goes to the MSPB.  If the MSPB can't 
decide the claim, I think is what you're saying, then 
it has to go to the district court. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And you're saying that the 
MSPB has said that, although it can decide, can decide, 
cases where he says, you know, my -- my supervisor fired 
me for a discriminatory reason, that that's within the 
scope of the MSPB's authority, a claim like this, which 
is that the Selective Service Act is unconstitutional 
full stop, is not within the scope of the MSPB's 
authority.  Is that right? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes, that's absolutely 

correct.  And -- and the cases that would not be within 
the MSPB's authority would include cases where the 
employee says the statute is unconstitutional and would 
also include the million or so Federal employees who, as 
the Government says, have no appellate rights to the 
MSPB, all -- all of those persons, career -- those 
persons would include summer interns, FBI employees.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, what type --

summer interns and FBI employees? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes.  The --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I assume that's for 

very different reasons -- one because they are summer 
interns, and, you know, if they are impermissibly 
treated, it's kind of -- they're summer interns. 
There's no reason to get --

(Laughter.) 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't -- I 

don't mean that facetiously.  I mean, what they're 
saying is that there's some level of de minimis 
personnel actions when you're talking about the vast 
Federal bureaucracy that we don't have to really give, 
you know, the whole panoply of rights.  And FBI agents, 
I assume, because it's the sensitive nature of what they 
deal with. 

So, I guess what I'm saying is, do you want 
us to focus on the millions of employees who would now 
be going to district court or do you want us to focus on 
the small number that have facial constitutional 
challenges? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Well, actually, Your Honor, 

it's the Government that is taking the position that the

attorneys, Federal Government chaplains, who have no 
right to appeal to the MSPB -- all of those persons, the 
Government says.  Can bring their constitutional claims 
to the district court. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And why is that wrong?  It 
seems to me that's what the -- what the Administrative 
Procedure Act says, that if there is no other effective 
means of judicial review, you get judicial review under 
the APA. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  These people have no 

effective right because they can't go to the MSPB and 
can't go to the Federal Circuit.  So, they have -- they 
have rights in the district court.  That's not a 
problem. 

The problem is the people who do have rights 
to go to the Merit Systems Protection Board, right, who 
have constitutional claims based on -- on the 
unconstitutionality of a statute? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Well, I -- I disagree with 

that, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why? 
MR. SCHWARTZ:  Because the -- the summer 

intern, the FBI agent, the nonpreference employee, the 
excepted service employees, unless they -- they have a

claim that they can take to the Merit Systems Protection 
Board, they're precluded from going to any other court. 
They're precluded under the Administrative Procedures 
Act.  That's this Court's Fausto decision.  And in this 
Court's Fausto decision, a Federal employee who could 
not bring a case -- his appeal to the Merit Systems 
Protection Board tried to bring a Back Pay Act claim in 
the Court of Claims and this court said, no, that is 
precluded. 

And what the Government is doing is saying 

you got a right in Fausto, but for constitutional 
claims, Mr. Fausto had it right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but that's -- that's 

entirely logical.  Fausto in effect said that the 
statutory structure simply provides no cause of action 
for these people, okay? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They're not entitled to 
anything.  But I don't think that there's anything in 
the -- in the civil service laws that say these people 
are not entitled to constitutional protections.  So, I 
don't think that -- that Fausto rules this out. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Well, and I -- I agree with you 

completely that -- that constitutional claims are 
different from statutory claims --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Exactly. 
MR. SCHWARTZ:  -- or damages. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it's those that I say 
that people not covered by appeals to the Merit Systems 
Protection Board -- they can bring those constitutional 
claims, even though they can't bring statutory claims. 
MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes.  And that's -- that's 
the position I'm taking.  I'm taking it a step beyond 
the Government, however. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  You're taking -- I'm 
saying that's true only with respect to those people who 
have no right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection 
Board.  You're going further. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you're saying even the 

people who can appeal to the Merit Systems Protection 
Board, right, can go directly to the district court? 
That's a different question. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  But I -- I'm limiting that to 

those people who can appeal to the Merit Systems 
Protection Board, but the Merit Systems Protection Board 
has no authority to grant them relief. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  There are at least -- at 
least three different kinds of constitutional claims, 
and I'm not sure where you're drawing the line with

respect to your argument.  There's a claim that -- that 
the agency acted in an unconstitutional manner, not that 
any statute is unconstitutional --

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- but there's 

unconstitutional executive action.  There's an as-
applied claim.  Let's say that a plaintiff says that the 
registration requirement is unconstitutional as applied 
to me, not to other people, but to me because I'm a 
conscientious objector or I have religious objections to 
military action that the United States is taking at this 
particular time.  And then there's this -- there's a 
claim that this statute is unconstitutional on its face. 
Now, where do you -- which of those can the 
Merit Systems Protection Review Board decide?  Just the 
first category? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Just the first category. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  So, it's not a distinction 

between as-applied and facial? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  No.  No, no.  And that's --

that's -- that's why -- that's why I'm specifically not 
trying to say where the line is between as-applied and 
facial.

to the district court.

MR. SCHWARTZ:  That is absolutely correct. 

And --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now, in your original briefs, 

Mr. Schwartz, you suggested that if the MSPB can't hear 
a claim, neither can the Federal Circuit.  And as I 
understood the Government's brief, the Government comes 
back and said that's not the case.  Even when the MSPB 
can't hear a claim, the Federal Circuit could hear it. 
Now, then there's a question of, if there's a necessity 
for a record, how does the record get developed? 

But do you now concede that the Federal 

Circuit could hear the claim as a matter -- you know, on 
the -- at the -- at the first level? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  I agree that a system can be 

proposed to get these claims to the Federal Circuit. 
However, it's not the system of the -- that Congress 
created in the Civil Service Reform Act.  And the 
significance of the contortions that have to be gone 
through to get these claims to the Federal Circuit 
demonstrates that it's not fairly discernible from the 
Civil Service Reform Act as written by Congress that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you take the position 
that the MSPB, having no jurisdiction and saying it has 
no jurisdiction, it can't adjudicate this matter, well,

then, a reviewing court has no jurisdiction to -- to 
review?  There's nothing to review because the MSPB said 
we have no jurisdiction. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  That's how it would work in 
the real world.  I mean, what is -- what is the Federal 
Circuit supposed to do?  It has an order from the MSPB 
that says we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  The 
Federal Circuit -- and the Government doesn't say that 
that is wrong.  The Federal Circuit says we affirm your 
dismissal, and now we'll move on to the merits.  That --
it's possible we could have a system like that, but that 
isn't the system of the Civil Service Reform Act, and 
that's not the way that appellate courts normally 
function. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is it really a 

question of jurisdiction of the MSPB? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  "Jurisdiction" is a 

word with many meanings. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes.  And -- and -- and 
there's a general rule with that -- there have been 
exceptions to -- that administrative agencies do not 
have authority to rule on constitutionality of statutes. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  So, what's the problem?  He 

says -- the employee says I was dismissed.  MSPB says

that's right, you were, and it's lawful.  The employee 
says but you didn't consider my argument that the 
relevant statute was unconstitutional.  MSPB says, no, 
we can't.  The Federal Circuit says but we can; so, make 
your argument.  What's the problem?  And then I'll 
decide it.  And if they decide it's unconstitutional, 
then the action of the MSPB is wrong. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  That's a system that -- that 
could come up.  It's not the system of the Civil Service 
Reform Act in -- because --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't know -- I'm just 

saying, is there any practical problem with that? 
MR. SCHWARTZ:  Oh, it presents immense 

practical problems. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Which is? 
MR. SCHWARTZ:  Which is that the Merit 

Systems Protection Board is not going to say we affirm 
your dismissal or that -- it's not going to reach the 
merits.  It's going to -- it's going to get the 
paperwork.  The government is going to --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine, fine.  What they say 
is you have one argument here, that the statute that led 
to your dismissal was unconstitutional. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  We do not have jurisdiction

over that; therefore, we say you were rightly dismissed. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Yes. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, they appeal that, and 
they say they're right that they didn't, but you do; so, 
will you please decide that this statute is 
unconstitutional?  What's the problem? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Well, that's -- that's an 

unusual form of --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Ah.  It may be unusual.  I 

just want to know what's the problem.  I'm not saying 
there isn't one.  I want to know what's the problem with 
that. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Okay.  The problem, if that 
is the system that's going to be in place, is that it's 
not quite that straightforward.  It's -- at first, the 
employee has to file his claim in the MSPB with 
everybody knowing it's going to be dismissed.  He then 
appeals that dismissal to the Federal Circuit, which 
affirms the dismissal, says, yes, MSPB has no 
jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it doesn't affirm the 
dismissal.  It says the dismissal was unconstitutional; 
go reinstate him. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  And then, in a case such as 
this one, where -- the raison d'être of this challenge 

Alderson Reporting Company

to Rostker is that the facts have changed.  There was 
extensive factual discovery in Rostker.  So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that your point was 

and hasn't the Federal Circuit said that the MSPB has no 
jurisdiction to decide we have no jurisdiction to 
review. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  That's what the Federal 

Circuit had said. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that an appellate 

court is reviewing a court of first instance.  The 
scheme that has been proposed would turn the Federal 
Circuit into a court of first instance, rather than an 
appellate court. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  And that is why what's 

proposed by the Government is such a departure from the 
CSRA scheme as written by Congress, in which MSPB has 
first-instance jurisdiction; the Federal Circuit has 
appellate jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, isn't your basic 

answer to Justice Breyer -- I mean, correct me if I'm 
wrong -- you think that the problem is that there's no 
record that the Federal Circuit can use to evaluate this 
constitutional claim? 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  That is correct.

we get constitutional claims, and people submit all 
their arguments in the briefs.  Now, occasionally, 
there's one you have to have factual development, and I 
grant you on that one maybe they could appoint a special 
master or, if not, send it back.  But they have plenty 
of authority to get them to argue the facts.  But I 
doubt -- I don't know if there are such claims.  But I 
don't see why that would be a problem.  Now, I'm not --
again, I'm not giving you an answer.  I'm giving you a 
question. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  The problem is that that's 

not the scheme written by Congress --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's your conclusion, and 
I want to know what -- what is the practical reason that 
that wouldn't work or why is that such a big problem to 
have it work that way?  I'm asking for your answer on 
that. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Okay.  I mean, that's -- that 

system could work in some cases.  I agree with that. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Give me one where it 

wouldn't. 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Excuse me?

and may it please the Court: 

29

I'd like to begin if I could by addressing the 

question asked by Justice Kagan, which is why shouldn't 
the scope of the MSPB's authority be the test for 
determining whether a claim can be filed in district 
court? 

And I think using that as the test would 
lead to unclear and easily manipulated jurisdictional 
rules.  Among other things, it often won't be clear up 
front whether the MSPB can resolve an employee's claim 
or not.  A claim that appears at first blush to 
challenge a statute's constitutionality might be 
resolved, for instance, by interpreting the statute to 
avoid the constitutional question, which is something 
that the MSPB could do. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  We could just ask the 

MSPB, Mr. Feigin.  If you bring the claim to the MSPB, 
and then the MSPB says, no, we have no authority to 
adjudicate this claim, then you know that you're in a 
world in which the MSPB doesn't have authority, so that 
you can go to the district court. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, I don't think that's 

consistent with the CSRA, Your Honor, because the way 
the CSRA works is that you go to the MSPB first, and 
then you go to the Federal Circuit.  And I think

everyone agrees that the Federal --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but the CSRA is 

presuming that the MSPB actually can decide something. 
MR. FEIGIN:  I don't think it's presuming 
that any more than 42 U.S.C. 405(g) was presuming that 
in Illinois Council or the Mine Act was presuming that 
in Thunder Basin Coal.  That is, that it's often useful 
to have constitutional claims presented to an agency in 
the first instance, even if the agency can't resolve 
those claims, because it allows the agency to figure 
out -- for example, in the case that this Court was 
discussing with Mr. Schwartz about circumstances where 
there might be nonconstitutional claims and 
constitutional claims, the agency might be able to moot 
out the case on nonconstitutional grounds.  The 
constitutional --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Feigin, those --

those statutes to which you refer said that no action on 
the claim -- well, this was Social Security benefits --
no action shall be brought under 1331.  There is no such 
provision here. 

MR. FEIGIN:  That was true in Illinois 

Council and some of the other cases we cite.  But in --
in Thunder Basin, the Court was very clear that the 
statute was facially silent as to the preclusion of

pre-enforcement claims like the sort that were at issue 
in Thunder Basin.  The Court nevertheless held that the 
claim in Thunder Basin was precluded, and it held that 
even though it acknowledged that it might be possible 
that the constitutional claim that was raised by the 
plaintiff in that case couldn't be addressed in first 
instance by the Mine Commission. 

Now, the MSPB here is very analogous to the 

Mine Commission. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, could you help me with 
something?  Because I agree with you, Thunder Basin is a 
very strong case for you, but McNary is a very strong 
case for Mr. Schwartz.  And I read those two opinions, 
and, frankly, I have a tough time reconciling them.  So, 
could you tell me how you do? 

MR. FEIGIN:  We prefer Thunder Basin, Your 

Honor. 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, I imagine so. 
MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, I think, as we 

suggest in our brief, McNary actually presented a very 
specialized circumstance in several respects.  First of 
all, there was a special statutory provision in that 
case that limited judicial review of -- in that case, to 
the record that had already been developed, and that's

not true here. 

Second, the Court was very concerned in 

McNary that if the plaintiffs weren't allowed to bring 
their claims in district court, they wouldn't be able to 
receive any meaningful judicial review at all. 

Now, here, the plaintiffs in this case can 

get meaningful judicial review from the Federal Circuit, 
which everyone agrees has the authority to resolve a 
constitutional challenge to a statute. 

Now, if I could, I'd like to address I think 

some confusion, as the Chief Justice was noting, over 
the meaning of the term "jurisdiction" and exactly what 
would happen if the Petitioners had brought this case in 
the first instance to the MSPB. 

Now, before getting into this, I'd like to 
acknowledge that when Petitioner Elgin did bring this 
case to the MSPB, the government argued that the MSPB 
had no jurisdiction.  We have conceded below and we 
concede here that we were wrong about that.  We do not 
think Elgin should be prejudiced by the government's 
position.  If he were to file a motion now to reopen his 
case with the MSPB, the Government would support that. 

Here's how it should have worked if the 

government --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is that your -- is that

your answer for that's why it's an out for their failure 
to have gone to the Federal Circuit? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Our answer -- our answer --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Will they be able -- if 
the -- if the commission says, no, we won't reopen, do 
they have any avenue now to go to the Federal Circuit? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, they can appeal that 

decision to the Federal Circuit, and the Government will 
again support the fact that the case ought to be 
reopened. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Please finish with your 

answer. 

MR. FEIGIN:  And let me now address what 
should have happened when the case went to the MSPB. 
The MSPB would have had jurisdiction over the case in 
the sense that the challenge to the adverse action is 
properly before the MSPB.  I think that's very clear 
under 5 U.S.C. 7513(d) and 5 U.S.C. 7701(a), which grant 
the MSPB jurisdiction over adverse actions under the 
CSRA. 

Now, the MSPB would not be able to 

adjudicate the constitutionality, would not be able to 
issue an order striking down a Federal statute.  And to 
determine that that would be what would be necessary 
here in order to grant the plaintiffs relief, what it

would have done is, first of all, it could have accepted 
any evidence that the plaintiffs or the government 
wished to submit on the constitutional issue in order to 
build up the administrative record for review --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could I ask you to 

pause --

MR. FEIGIN:  Yes. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- briefly on that 
question?  So, the government -- if Mr. Schwartz comes 
in before the MSPB and says we have three witnesses who 
are going to testify only on the constitutional issue; I 
have this volume of evidence about what's happening in 
the military; it's only relevant in the constitutional 
issue; and, you know, it's going to take us 2 days to 
present this -- the government is going to say it's okay 
with us, right? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They're not going to 
object that that's beyond the jurisdiction of the agency 
to decide. 

MR. FEIGIN:  We will not object that it's 
not beyond the jurisdiction of the agency to decide --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I will object.  What 
is the agency -- taking evidence on an issue that it has 
no jurisdiction to decide?  That is absolutely weird.

(Laughter.) 
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think this 
is fairly analogous, although not perfectly analogous, 
to the fairly common circumstance where, for example, a 
district court reserves to itself a decision on the 
merits of an action and then delegates to a magistrate 
judge decisions on discovery.  Now, the only 
limitation --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But they're very different 

because the magistrate can come back to the district 
court judge and say we have a tough one, Your Honor; why 
don't you decide it? 

I mean, here you're stipulating that the 
board has no power to decide this question.  Call it 
jurisdiction; call it something else.  The board cannot 
decide the question, but the board is going to now 
become the arbiter of discovery disputes?  The 
factfinder?  I mean, "weird" is a good word for it. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, first of all, Your Honor, 
the only thing that we think the MSPB lacks authority to 
do, the only thing, is to issue an order on the merits 
declaring a Federal statute unconstitutional.  It is 
competent to resolve discovery disputes --

into the merits of the constitutional claim?  In other 
words, the parties can just put in any evidence they 
want? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Any evidence they think 

might be possibly be relevant to the case, they can put 
that in.  It can be discovery of anything. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, there may be disputes as 
to the scope of discovery.  And those -- resolution of 
those disputes may touch on the merits.  We think the 
MSPB can do all of that.  The only thing the MSPB lacks 
authority to do, according to the MSPB, is to issue an 
order striking down a Federal statute as 
unconstitutional. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think the MSPB should 

find facts with regard to this claim? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, first of all, Your Honor, 
I think this case isn't going to require any factfinding 
because I think it's worth noting that both judges that 
have addressed Petitioners' arguments on the merits, the 
district court judge and the concurring judge in the 
court of appeals --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, maybe it will and 

maybe it won't. 

MR. FEIGIN: -- were able to resolve the

claim without factfinding. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I would think, Mr. Feigin, 

it would depend on how it's litigated.  But in a case in 
which there is some factfinding to be made, would the 
MSPB have authority to find facts? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Yes, it would, Your Honor. 

Now, I'd like to add that in many cases --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you go back and tell 
me when the government changed its position?  It was my 
understanding that up until, well, certainly this case 
was litigated, the government was taking the position 
MSPB has no jurisdiction to pass on the 
constitutionality of a statute. 

When did the government back away from that 
position?  When did it say, no, we were wrong; they do 
have jurisdiction? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I need to 

separate out two things.  First, it is still our 
position that the MSPB has no authority to declare a 
Federal statute unconstitutional.  Now, the government 
was taking the position that in cases where an employee 
had been removed pursuant to a statutory bar, that the 
MSPB lacked jurisdiction to hear an appeal of -- of a 
case like that. 

And the reason the government argued was not

because the MSPB lacked authority to decide the 
constitutionality of a statute, although we believe 
that, too, but because the government was arguing 
erroneously that an employee who is removed based on a 
statutory bar that should have prevented his hiring in 
the first place wasn't an employee within the meaning of 
5 U.S.C. 7511.  Now the government no longer takes that 
5 U.S.C. 7511 position.  We've been consistent on that 
in the court of appeals and in this Court, and, 
therefore, we believe that the MSPB did properly have 
jurisdiction over the action in this case. 

Now, when it goes up to the MSPB, the MS --

and after -- the MSPB would then deny relief on the 
merits because it would lack the authority to declare a 
Federal statute unconstitutional. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't want to delay you; 
so, don't pause too long.  But I've just been curious --
where did this rule -- is there a statute or something 
that says an agency can't say that this action would be 
unconstitutional?  Where does that idea come from? 

MR. FEIGIN:  So, there is not a statute, 

Your Honor.  This Court has said in several cases that 
administrative agencies generally lack the authority to 
declare a statute unconstitutional.  It's clear from 
Thunder Basin that that isn't a constitutional

limitation on the authority of Federal agencies.  That 
is to say, if Congress wanted to give an agency the 
authority to adjudicate the constitutionality of a 
statute, it could.  And the Court noted that the Mine 
Commission in Thunder Basin believed it did have the 
authority to adjudicate the constitutionality of 
statutes, although the Court didn't reach whether the 
Mine Commission was correct about that. 

And in this case, the MSPB believes, 

consistent with this Court's repeated statements, that 
it lacks authority to adjudicate the constitutionality 
of statutes. 

Now, if the Court decides that the best way 
to reconcile this scheme would simply be to say that the 
MSPB does have the authority to adjudicate the 
constitutionality of statutes, I think that would make 
much more sense than the position the Petitioners are 
urging.  And here's an example, I think, that 
illustrates why the position the Petitioners are urging 
will lead to confusion of jurisdictional rules and 
manipulation of jurisdictional rules. 

So, if you imagine two employees who were 

fired by an employing agency for leaking information to 
the press, confidential information to the press, they 
both challenge their removals, but they raise slightly

different arguments.  The first one says, well, I don't 
think the employment statute should be construed to 
allow me to be fired for this reason because I think the 
employment statute should be construed with First 
Amendment principles in mind and shouldn't reach this 
case. 

The second one says I concede that the 

employment statutes allow my firing for this reason, but 
I think those -- I think that statute is 
unconstitutional as applied. 

Now, those are really the same claim and --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Feigin, they might 

well be the same claim, but if the MSPB can decide the 
one and cannot decide the other, that's a relevant 
distinction.  Now, you might be right in what you said. 
Well, maybe one answer is that the MSPB can decide both. 
But as long as the MSPB can decide the one or the other, 
it seems -- I mean, that's -- it seems like a sensible 
dividing line. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, even if the 

MSPB lacks the authority to strike down a Federal 
statute, I still think it might be able to adjudicate 
the claim of the employee, the second employee, who 
brings it as an as-applied challenge because the Court 
would -- I'm sorry; not the Court -- the MSPB could

decide that case on the same constitutional avoidance 
grounds that are -- that are urged by the first 
employee. 

That is, they really are the same case. 

Before striking down a statute as constitutional, this 
Court all the time, it instructs lower courts, and this 
would be true of agencies, too, should interpret the 
statute to avoid any significant constitutional 
question. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But they're not at all the 
same claim.  They're related, but one says the statute 
means something; and insofar as it's applied to a 
particular situation, it's unconstitutional.  The other 
one says it doesn't mean that. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think they 
are the same in the respect that, as I was just saying 
to Justice Kagan, if the MSPB --

JUSTICE ALITO:  When we -- just let me rephrase 

that.  If -- if this Court adopts a certain 
interpretation based on the principle of constitutional 
avoidance, do you think the Court is rewriting the 
statute? 

MR. FEIGIN:  No, Your Honor, but there may 
be ambiguity in a statute that the Court interprets to 
avoid a significant constitutional question.  So, maybe

I can give another example that might flesh this out a 
little bit. 

There's a statute, 5 U.S.C. 7311, that bars 
from Federal employment people who have participated in 
strikes.  Now, it's easy to think of an employee who 
raises a factual or statutory challenge to that claim. 
He says that what he did wasn't participating in a 
strike, either factually or shouldn't be considered 
participating in a strike within the scope of the 
statute.  And he also challenges the statute on 
constitutional grounds. 

And the most common case brought to the 

MSPB, in our experience, that raises a constitutional 
claim also raises the sort of factual and statutory 
claims I was just suggesting.  Now, the MSPB might 
resolve that first question -- those first set of 
questions in such a way as to avoid the constitutional 
question by saying that the statute doesn't reach the 
conduct that the particular employee engaged in. 

And if we imagine instead that the employee 
had only brought the constitutional claim, which would 
be kind of a strange way to litigate because he'd be 
giving up arguments on which he might win, I still think 
that the MSPB could decide, look, before we send this 
off to the Federal Circuit and decide that the only way

we can grant you relief is to say that a Federal statute 
is unconstitutional, which is something we don't think 
we can do, we should at least take a look at the statute 
to see whether these somewhat ambiguous terms, 
"participate" and "strike," actually do apply to your 
conduct. 

And by failing to give the MSPB the first 

crack at doing that, what --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there any such 

possibility in this case?  I mean, the statute says men 
must register for the draft.  There's no way to avoid --
to reread that statute to say anything other than that. 
So, I don't -- I don't see any constitutional avoidance. 

MR. FEIGIN:  I agree with that, Justice 

Ginsburg.  In this case, we don't think the 
constitutional question can be avoided, and we don't 
think the MSPB could have granted relief.  But I don't 
think the Court should essentially throw everything out 
just because of this case.  Their position is going to 
make for unclear jurisdictional rules, and employees 
aren't going to know where they're entitled to go or 
where they're supposed to go, because --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  To go back to your 

interesting suggestion that the board should decide the 
constitutional issue, I've just been spending a little

bit of time going through the Act, and you're 
certainly -- it doesn't appear that there's anything in 
the Act that precludes them from granting any 
appropriate relief with respect to an unlawful 
discharge.  Am I correct? 

MR. FEIGIN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

The statute does not, as we explain in our brief, draw 
any distinction between the types of arguments that 
would be made in seeking to set aside an unlawful 
discharge --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Although, that's weird in 

another way, isn't it, Mr. Feigin, because, can we 
really imagine in the real world the MSPB deciding that 
the Selective Service Act is unconstitutional?  I mean, 
what do they know about that question? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, as everyone agrees and as 

Mr. Schwartz was discussing with the Court, the MSPB 
does have expertise on -- in constitutional claims.  The 
MSPB are a set of -- a set of persons that are appointed 
by the President and confirmed by the Senate. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but this is a 

question, and -- and you can -- I take the point that 
I'm just talking about this case.  But this is a 
question about whether women should have to register for 
the draft in the same way as men should.  That goes to

defense policy.  It goes to equal protection law.  It 
doesn't seem to have anything to do with -- with 
workplace issues of the kind that the MSPB is expert on. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, I think that's right, 
Justice Kagan, but the CSRA doesn't draw distinctions 
between the types of arguments that are being made.  It 
draws distinctions, as Justice Sotomayor was just 
suggesting, about what sorts of personnel actions it 
covers.  And I think --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Congress is -- Congress is 

unhappy when this Court holds a statute 
unconstitutional. 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think it's -- it's 

really likely that they intended for the MS -- MSPRB to 
have the authority to declare its acts unconstitutional? 

MR. FEIGIN:  I don't, Your Honor.  And 

that's why our primary position is that the MSPB does 
not have that authority.  However --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  I mean, it sounds --
really what the argument boils down to is -- is if we 
accept your position, there's a kind of procedural 
complexity and anomaly.  And your argument is that his 
position's worse.  And, yours is also fairly bad.

JUSTICE BREYER:  So, that's his point.  So, 

I mean, that's -- but that's why I wondered.  I mean, 
U.S. magistrates, all -- tax courts, all kinds of people 
as a preliminary matter have jobs where they say we 
think a statute is unconstitutional.  I suppose 
millions.  I don't know how many.  So, is this coming 
that they can't do it from some kind of lore from 
Kenneth Davis or something or -- what's -- what's the 
basis of this?  And wouldn't it be simpler if you just 
said it says they can take appropriate relief?  They can 
take appropriate relief, period.  End of the matter. 

MR. FEIGIN:  It's coming from statements by 

this Court and also statements by Kenneth Davis --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Are there --
MR. FEIGIN:  -- in 1958 his administrative 

law treatise. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So, somebody quoted Kenneth 
Davis in 1958 and wrote it into an opinion in a holding? 

MR. FEIGIN:  No.  The Court usually just 

sort of says this in passing.  And the Court made very 
clear --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So, Kenneth Davis said this 

in 1958? 

MR. FEIGIN:  The Court made very clear in 

Thunder Basin this is just a general presumption --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 
MR. FEIGIN:  -- about the authority of 
administrative agencies.  It doesn't have to be --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Johnson v. Robison is one 

such case.  I don't recall in that case anybody 
referring to any administrative law treatise. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, that treatise is cited, 
for example, by -- the Court cites the Mine Commission 
cases that themselves cite the treatise.  But the point 
is, Justice Breyer, even if our rule does have a couple 
of hiccups with it, we do think it is much superior to 
the rule that Petitioners are urging because there are 
clear jurisdictional rules. 

If I could follow up --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If I could just 

focus there.  In your brief, you're quite careful, and 
you have been today, to talk to even if the MSPB lacked 
this authority.  It's your position that the MSPB does 
lack this authority in fact; right?  It's not just the 
MSPB's position. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Yes, we agree with the MSPB's 
position that it lacks the authority to strike down a 
statute as constitutional.  However, if it is a 
difference between adopting Petitioners' position or 
holding that the MSPB has the authority to declare a

statute unconstitutional, we think Congress would have 
greatly preferred the latter because that preserves 
the -- the basic idea of the CSRA, which was to 
consolidate and streamline judicial review. 

As this Court recognized in Fausto, Congress 
specifically did not want challenges to adverse actions 
to go through district court into the court of appeals 
and get a duplicative and wasteful two-layer judicial 
review.  Instead --

JUSTICE ALITO:  If anybody who drafted or 

voted for the Civil Service Reform Act had thought about 
a case like this, where it's a pure question of law, a 
facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute, 
do you think they would have said, well, the way we 
think that this should be handled is this scheme that 
you have proposed? 

MR. FEIGIN:  I think they would have 

preferred it to a scheme where, first of all, the claims 
go to district court, which is precisely what the CSRA 
was trying to eliminate; and, second of all, to a scheme 
where it becomes confusing and dependent on precisely 
how a plaintiff frames his argument which court winds up 
entertaining the claim.

other -- any other case where an appellate court has 
authority to decide a question that the court of first 
instance lacked authority to decide?  I mean, you say 
MSPB says it has no authority, and you agree with that. 

I couldn't think of another case where a 

court of appeals, which is a court of review, not first 
view, substitutes itself for an incompetent court of 
first instance. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, first of all, 

we cite several examples of courts of appeals deciding 
constitutional questions in the first instance, at pages 
37 to 38 in our brief.  Another example would be this 
Court's decision in INS v. Chadha, the legislative veto 
case, which came up from the Board of Immigration 
Appeals.  The Board of Immigration Appeals said it 
didn't have authority to adjudicate the separation of 
powers question.  It was reviewed by the Ninth Circuit 
and then reviewed by this Court. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Feigin, could I go back 

to the Chief Justice's question about what actually 
would happen in the MSPB?  Presumably in this case, what 
the plaintiffs seek to do is to develop an extensive 
factual record showing how much has changed in the 
military in terms of the -- the -- the role that women 
play in the military.  And that it's almost impossible

to litigate this kind of claim without having such a 
record.  That's the entire basis for -- for arguing that 
Rostker is outmoded, given current military operations. 
So, how could the -- the plaintiff develop that record 
that is needed to litigate this claim? 

MR. FEIGIN:  You would develop it in the 

MSPB, either in the first instance on the initial 
appeal, or the MSPB could let it go to the Federal 
Circuit without having developed an administrative 
record.  And the Federal Circuit if, unlike either of 
the judges to address the merits in this case, believed 
that a factual record was necessary, it could remand to 
the MSPB with instructions that the MSPB take evidence 
and develop an administrative record. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't like that at all. 
That's ridiculous.  Send it back to an agency that has 
no jurisdiction over the question, you know, make 
factfindings on this -- on this question over which you 
have no jurisdiction. 

Can you give any example where -- where that 

occurs elsewhere?  Why wouldn't the -- the preferable 
course be to appoint a master, have the Federal Circuit 
appoint a master to do it? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, if the Court 

believes that that is a better way to reconcile the

scheme, we wouldn't oppose that either, but --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I don't like 

that. 

(Laughter.) 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, the idea 

of -- the special masters floating around freely every 
time you get one of these cases -- I mean, what --
inevitably what's going to happen is that you're going 
to have a more or less permanent special master who gets 
all these things.  You're not going to appoint 85 
special masters if there are 85 of these sorts of 
claims.  It seems to me you've got an agency there 
that's expert in the interrelation between the different 
provisions in the statute.  And, you know, why don't --
why don't -- they make factfindings all the time in 
areas within their authority to decide.  It seems to me 
it's ready-made for sending these things back. 

MR. FEIGIN:  That was our position, Your 

Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but -- but this is not 

an area that's within their expertise to decide.  What 
do they know about -- about the military?  And when is 
that ever -- ever relevant to anything that they decide? 
It's utterly irrelevant to their work.  And you're 
telling them to take --

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, first of all, Your Honor, 
I think it's actually going to be a fairly rare case in 
which a challenge to a legislative act of passing a 
statute is really going to turn on some sort of factual 
finding -- like a credibility --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but this is that case. 
MR. FEIGIN:  -- like a credibility 

determination or something that's uniquely within the 
competence of a trial court or an agency with trial 
court-like powers. 

I think what might be more common, Justice 
Kagan, is that you might need to develop some sort of 
administrative record.  But once the evidence is 
submitted, the conclusions one would draw from that 
evidence will be fairly obvious.  For example, in 
Rostker v. Goldberg, there was discovery, there was 
evidence submitted, and then the parties were able to 
stipulate to the facts that would set forth review. 

So, in this case, for example, I don't think 

there's really going to be a dispute that the MSPB is 
going to have to resolve about what sorts of positions 
women can serve in, in the military.  I think the 
government is going to be willing to stipulate to that. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  I suspect that if this were 
litigated in district court, the government would move

to dismiss and would take the position that it doesn't 
matter; even if women can now do 99 percent of the --
the things that are done in the military, the 
Registration Act is still constitutional.  Wouldn't you 
take that position? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, I don't --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Would you say that if -- if 

it can be proven that they've -- that women are now --
that the percentage is now high enough, the statute may 
be unconstitutional? 

Anyway, assuming that you might take that 

position, then -- and you might win on that -- then what 
would be the point of having all of this discovery that 
you're talking about? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well --
JUSTICE ALITO:  All of this -- all of this 
development of the factual record?  What -- what sense 
does it make to develop a big factual record before you 
know whether it's even -- whether it even makes any 
difference? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, the way to 
deal with that would be to just have a very quick stop 
in the MSPB which assures itself, yes, this is a 
constitutional challenge to a statute.  As the Court 
recognized in Weinberger v. Salfi, for example, it is

useful to have -- at least exhaust the claim with the 
agency for that purpose.  Yes --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is there any rule of the 
board that stops a litigant from making a proffer -- an 
offer of proof? 

MR. FEIGIN:  There is not, Your Honor, and, 

in fact, it would be --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Wouldn't that be the 
proper way of doing it, if you're going to go up on a 
constitutional claim?  Make your offer of proof, and 
then the Federal Circuit can decide if it needs more 
evidence or not. 

MR. FEIGIN:  That's where I was going with 

this, Your Honor.  In fact, the MSPB has a special 
rule -- I believe it's 5 C.S.R. 1201.61; it's cited in 
our brief -- where even if the MSPB decided not to 
accept evidence for some reason, a description of the 
evidence would go in the record and, therefore, be 
available for the Federal Circuit. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if -- I guess 

that the party doesn't -- doesn't even have to raise its 
constitutional claim before the MSPB, does it? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, the Federal --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, it's pretty 

odd to say that you've somehow waived a claim you

couldn't pursue. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, the Federal Circuit has 
in analogous cases decided constitutional claims that 
weren't raised in front of an agency when the agency 
couldn't decide them.  In the Government's view, it 
would make sense to exhaust, for the reasons I was 
explaining earlier and to Justice Ginsburg, which is 
that it may be that the MSPB finds that the statute 
doesn't really cover the situation.  Now, I acknowledge 
that's not going to happen in this case; it is clear 
that section 3328 required these people's removals. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait.  You're -- you're 
actually proposing that you have to exhaust questions 
that the agency has no authority to decide? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think the 

Court has recognized --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Curiouser and curiouser. 
(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If you don't bring before 

the agency a question that the agency says it has no 
authority to decide, you have forfeited your ability? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I don't think 

what should happen in this -- in a case like this is 
that the employee appeals to the MSPB and says nothing 
at all.  The employee should appeal to the MSPB and at

least say what his constitutional claim is.  And the 
benefit of that, as the Court has recognized in, for 
example, Weinberger v. Salfi, is that the agency can 
assure itself, yes, it's a constitutional claim that is 
beyond my authority to resolve, and there's no other way 
for me to resolve it. 

Another benefit of presenting these claims 

to the agency is the MSPB hasn't been crystal clear 
about exactly where its authority begins and ends; and 
neither the Federal Circuit nor this Court has addressed 
that question at all.  And allowing the agency in the 
first instance to determine whether it has the authority 
to grant the plaintiff the relief he is seeking has a 
great benefit of clarifying what the scope of the MSPB's 
authority is.  It makes a lot more sense for the MSPB 
and the Federal Circuit to be deciding what the scope of 
the MSPB's authority is than it is to file a claim in 
the District of Massachusetts and have that district 
court and then the First Circuit debating about what the 
proper scope of the MSPB's authority is. 

I think the CSRA expresses a clear 

preference that appeals of adverse actions like this go 
through the MSPB and to the Federal Circuit, so that 
they can decide those kinds of questions.  Again --

Salfi go?  The agency couldn't decide the constitutional 
question.  So, what's the next stop?  Was it a court of 
appeals or the district court? 

MR. FEIGIN:  In Salfi, Your Honor? 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes. 
MR. FEIGIN:  That would have been in 

district court.  However, under 42 U.S.C. 405(g), which 
was at issue in Salfi and Illinois Council, the district 
court is performing essentially appellate-style review 
of the agency's findings.  That is, any -- the preferred 
course is that any additional factfindings that would be 
necessary would be made on remand and not taken by the 
district court. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Not on the constitutional 

question. 

MR. FEIGIN:  I think it would still be the 
preferred course that the agency would do any further 
factfinding that would be necessary in the first 
instance. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why?  The district court 
is -- that's what it's equipped to do.  That's what it 
does all the time.  And --

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, under 405(g), rather than 
1331, the preferred form of factfinding is in the agency 
and remands to the agency for further factfinding,

rather than development of the facts in the district 
court in the first instance. 

In any event, the Court has recognized that 
in Thunder Basin, for example, where review in the first 
instance was in the court of appeals, that the court of 
appeals had adequate authority to give meaningful 
judicial review to a constitutional claim that an 
agency, in that case the Mine Commission, by hypothesis 
could not decide.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY A. SCHWARTZ 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. SCHWARTZ:  Thank you.  We're not here 

for an exercise in which side can best rewrite the Civil 
Service Reform Act so that the Petitioners' claims can 
fit in it.  What we're here for is to determine whether 
the background rule that Federal courts have Federal 
question jurisdiction, under the common law and under 
section 1331, to rule on claims challenging the 
constitutionality of an act of Congress. 

Now, the fall-back position is that that 

jurisdiction remains.  What this Court is -- is tasked

to do is to see whether it's fairly discernible from the 
Civil Service Reform Act as it was written by Congress, 
not as it's twisted or amended or bent to fit these 
claims in it, but whether the Civil Service Reform Act 
as written by Congress revokes that background Federal 
court jurisdiction. 

And I suggest that the gyrations that have 
been discussed about, well, we could do this, we could 
go up, we could go down, we could do these odd 
procedures, show that it is not fairly discernible that 
Congress intended to somehow try to shoehorn these 
claims within the CSRA framework.  And for that reason, 
not because the Government's system is better, not 
because the system that I'm proposing works better or is 
faster, but because there is no fairly discernible 
evidence from the Civil Service Reform Act, as written 
by Congress, that Congress intended to revoke this very 
fundamental jurisdiction of the district courts. 

This is a Marbury case, not a Bivens case. 

This is fundamental jurisdiction, the power of the 
Federal court to say that Congress, not some Federal 
agency, but that Congress acted in violation of the 
Constitution.  And I suggest that it -- the Court should 
act carefully before deciding that Congress took that 
fundamental jurisdiction away from the district courts,
