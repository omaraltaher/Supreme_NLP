ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 


 8                    

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 


 9              

MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 


10    

please the Court: 


11              

Respondent Waffle House and Eric Baker agreed to 


12    

arbitrate rather than litigate disputes between them. 


13    

That agreement precludes Waffle House and Baker from 


14    

having an action take place between them in court.  But 


15    

the EEOC was not a party to that agreement.  Accordingly, 


16    

the agreement does not preclude the EEOC's ability to 


17    

bring a public enforcement action against Waffle House, 


18    

nor does it limit the remedies available to the EEOC in 


19    

such an action. 


20              

Title VII gives the EEOC a public enforcement 


21    

action that's independent of and, in many respects, 


22    

superior to the individual employee's cause of action. 


23              

QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, suppose the individual 


24    

employee had settled with the employer, not just an 


25    

agreement to arbitrate, but there had been a complete 


3

 1    

settlement.  They said, you know, in exchange for so much 


 2    

money, I waive any cause of action I had.  Would the 


 3    

Government still has -- have a cause of action for 


 4    

damages? 


 5              

MR. CLEMENT:  We believe the Government would 


 6    

still have a cause of action in that case, though we admit 


 7    

it would be a much more difficult case. 


 8              

QUESTION:  Wow. 


 9              

MR. CLEMENT:  Because in the case of settlement, 


10    

of course, judicial or arbitral resources have already 


11    

been expended.  There's an agreement of the parties that 


12    

specifically extinguishes the individual's right --


13              

QUESTION:  What are the damages?  The Government 


14    

gets damages that have already been paid to the individual 


15    

to -- I don't understand.  And these damages go to the 


16    

individual? 


17              

MR. CLEMENT:  The -- the damages could go to the 


18    

individual.  I think, to give you an example of the kind 


19    

of case --


20              

QUESTION:  So, if he'd settle and get the 


21    

damages, and then -- and then he'd get additional damages 


22    

recovered for him by the EEOC. 


23              

MR. CLEMENT:  That's right.  But let me give you 


24    

an example of the kind of case we have in mind, and it may 


25    

help illustrate why the Government thinks it still may

 1    

have a cause of action in that situation. 


 2              

If you can imagine a case where an employer has 


 3    

retaliated against an employee and -- simply for filing a 


 4    

charge with the EEOC, and then that employee settles that 


 5    

retaliation claim for a nominal amount of money, without 


 6    

any judicial supervision, let's say, it may be that in 


 7    

that kind of case, the EEOC has a legitimate public 


 8    

interest in, nonetheless, bringing an action, getting some 


 9    

additional amount of damages to really take the 


10    

employer --


11              

QUESTION:  Well, but that's -- that's a separate 


12    

wrong.  I don't know if that's a really fair answer to 


13    

Justice Scalia's question.  If there's retaliation, I -- I 


14    

would think that's a separate component. 


15              

But just suppose a case with no retaliation. 


16    

The -- the employee recovers $10,000 and then the EEOC can 


17    

recover $20,000 more? 


18              

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, in a case like that, I'm 


19    

sure as a matter of its prosecutorial discretion, the EEOC 


20    

would not bring that case. 


21              

QUESTION:  Well, let's say the prosecutor 


22    

doesn't exercise his discretion that way that day. 


23              

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, in that case I think they 


24    

would have cause of action. 


25              

But again, I want to make clear that we think 


5

 1    

that's --


 2              

QUESTION:  And what -- and what happens --


 3              

MR. CLEMENT:  -- a much more difficult case. 


 4              

QUESTION:  What would happen -- what would 


 5    

happen if the employee recovered $10,000 in the 


 6    

arbitration, then only $5,000 in the litigation?  Does he 


 7    

have to give $5,000 back? 


 8              

MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think that would follow. 


 9              

But again, I want to make clear that's a much 


10    

more difficult case because there there's been --


11              

QUESTION:  Well, but -- but we're asking what 


12    

the -- what the logical consequences of -- of your 


13    

position are, and that's why we're putting the more 


14    

difficult case so we can test the general proposition. 


15    

And the general proposition, it seems to me, has to 


16    

withstand some analysis under these more difficult 


17    

instances. 


18              

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, let me do -- let me make two 


19    

responses.  One, let me try one more time to defend the 


20    

general principle, which is simply that Congress in Title 


21    

VII gave the EEOC a distinct cause of action, and so the 


22    

extinguishment of the individual employee's cause of 


23    

action shouldn't automatically extinguish the EEOC's cause 


24    

of action. 


25              

But let me hone in on why I think that's so much 


6

 1    

more of a difficult case because in that case, the 


 2    

individuals settled their claim, so they have no claim to 


 3    

damages in an arbitration proceeding.  And so, it might 


 4    

make some sense to say that the EEOC has no claim to 


 5    

damages in a litigation proceeding. 


 6              

What is so anomalous about the decision below 


 7    

and the rule that respondent seeks in this case is that it 


 8    

seeks to limit the EEOC's ability to get victim-specific 


 9    

remedies in court even though those victim-specific 


10    

remedies are available to the employee in the arbitration. 


11    

All of the cases that respondent cites --


12              

QUESTION:  Well, here we have a case where the 


13    

employee did not settle, but we were really discussing 


14    

with you the possibility not presented in this case of a 


15    

full settlement or a judgment in arbitration, disposing of 


16    

the victim-specific relief, and asking you why then should 


17    

EEOC continue to have a cause of action for the victim-


18    

specific relief, as opposed to broad injunctive relief, to 


19    

address the overall problem. 


20              

MR. CLEMENT:  And I guess I do think there are 


21    

two reasons why they would still have a cause of action in 


22    

that situation.  One is that Title VII does give the EEOC 


23    

an independent cause of action.  It's quite a remarkable 


24    

statute in that respect.  It's unlike statutes this Court 


25    

has analyzed in, say, the Newport News Shipbuilder case 


7 


ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 


1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. 


(202)289-2260 

(800) FOR DEPO 


SUITE 400 


WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 


 1    

where it specifically contrasted Title VII as being the 


 2    

rare statute that gives the EEOC a duplicative cause of 


 3    

action to the individual. 


 4              

The second reason, though, is that generally, as 


 5    

a matter of privity, res judicata principles, the reason 


 6    

that you hold one party in --in -- to a judgment that they 


 7    

didn't participate in to the consequences of that is 


 8    

because the party in the first action adequately 


 9    

represented the interests of the party that wasn't 


10    

present.  I --


11              

QUESTION:  Well, why did the EEOC decide to get 


12    

into this case?  Is there some sort of a pattern or 


13    

practice involved that goes beyond this individual 


14    

establishment? 


15              

MR. CLEMENT:  My understanding is that the EEOC 


16    

picked this case because this case -- the events here took 


17    

place in 1994.  So, the ADA was still quite new at the 


18    

time that this -- that this case took place, and I think 


19    

the EEOC was concerned that employers were not sure of 


20    

what their obligations under the ADA were.  So, they 


21    

picked this case to litigate to help establish what 


22    

employers' obligations were under the EEOC --


23              

QUESTION:  This is -- this is not any broad 


24    

pattern or practice.  This is simply honing in on an 


25    

individual case?

SUITE 400 


WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 


 1              

MR. CLEMENT:  That's fair enough.  But again, 


 2    

Congress has specifically allowed the EEOC to use its 


 3    

modest litigation resources to vindicate the public 


 4    

interest both in pattern and practice cases or cases that 


 5    

seek injunctive relief and victim-specific cases where 


 6    

there's some aspect of the case that helps illustrate an 


 7    

important principle of law. 


 8              

QUESTION:  Mr. --


 9              

QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, may I ask you to back up 


10    

on how we would get to the point of having a settlement 


11    

after -- or an arbitral determination?  I thought when the 


12    

EEOC sues, then the individual has no right to come to 


13    

court, that EEOC would be the exclusive litigator.  And 


14    

so, I think it's clear that the -- the individual employee 


15    

couldn't bring a suit, a rival suit, in -- in court. 


16              

Doesn't that extend to arbitration as well?  I 


17    

thought that the -- giving the primacy to the EEOC meant 


18    

it would control this entire claim in all of its aspects, 


19    

but you answered the question as though, even though the 


20    

EEOC had filed, the employee could go on on a separate 


21    

track. 


22              

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I had taken the import of 


23    

the hypothetical as being that the individual had already 


24    

sued and settled and then, only after that had taken 


25    

place, that the EEOC decided to initiate a duplicative

 1    

action. 


 2              

But your question certainly highlights the 


 3    

anomaly of having this predispute arbitration agreement --


 4              

QUESTION:  Can the individual bring a suit?  I 


 5    

mean, is the -- within the 180 days, doesn't EEOC have 


 6    

total control? 


 7              

MR. CLEMENT:  That's absolutely right.  The 


 8    

statute gives the EEOC the exclusive right to initiate a 


 9    

cause of action for the first 180 days and then, for an 


10    

extended period, until a right to sue letter issues. 


11              

And that's why in light of the -- the 


12    

congressional determination that -- that EEOC had not only 


13    

a different action, but one that took primacy, that they 


14    

had the right to initiate the action once they found that 


15    

there was a determination that the suit would serve the 


16    

public interest, it seems particularly --


17              

QUESTION:  Once they -- once they do initiate 


18    

the action, though, the individual cannot also bring an 


19    

action.  Right?  So, what you're saying is that the --


20    

that the EEOC suit is independent of the individuals, but 


21    

somehow the individual suit is not independent of the 


22    

EEOC's. 


23              

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, allow -- allow me to make 


24    

two responses.  One is it's clear that under the ADA and 


25    

Title VII, it's not that the EEOC's filing of a suit 


10 


ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400 


WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 


 1    

simply extinguishes the individual's cause of action 


 2    

entirely.  They -- the individual has a absolute right to 


 3    

intervene in the EEOC's action.  So, if those actions were 


 4    

100 percent duplicative, there would be no need to allow 


 5    

the individual to intervene in the suit. 


 6              

QUESTION:  Exactly.  I -- I don't know why you 


 7    

think that cuts in your favor rather than against you.  It 


 8    

seems to me the whole structure of the thing indicates 


 9    

that there's one cause of action.  It can be brought by 


10    

the EEC or by the individual, but not by both. 


11              

MR. CLEMENT:  I mean --


12              

QUESTION:  Not by both successfully, anyway. 


13              

MR. CLEMENT:  I respectfully disagree because, 


14    

unlike the ADA, the ADA does not make the EEOC suit the 


15    

exclusive vehicle and extinguish any cause of action or 


16    

any basis to get into court for the individual.  They can 


17    

still intervene in the EEOC's action. 


18              

QUESTION:  So, you're saying that if the EEOC 


19    

brings an action in circumstances such as this, an 


20    

individual who has agreed to arbitrate the claim can 


21    

intervene and not be bound?  The individual is not bound 


22    

by the arbitration agreement? 


23              

MR. CLEMENT:  No, we do not take that position. 


24    

To the contrary, we think that the arbitration agreement 


25    

does preclude in this case Mr. Baker from intervening in 


11

 1    

the EEOC's action.  And I think that's quite a persuasive 


 2    

answer to the argument that the other side has made that 


 3    

somehow allowing the EEOC to sue in these circumstances 


 4    

renders the arbitration agreement a dead letter.  It 


 5    

doesn't. 


 6              

QUESTION:  It's a very strange use of the 


 7    

Article III courts to have litigation proceeding in which 


 8    

one of the real parties in interest is not permitted to 


 9    

intervene.  That --


10              

MR. CLEMENT:  Well --


11              

QUESTION:  -- that strikes me as a -- a 


12    

distortion of the whole case in controversy rule. 


13              

MR. CLEMENT:  It may be, but I think that is the 


14    

consequence of the arbitration agreement and the 


15    

implication of the FAA. 


16              

QUESTION:  Well, if it is a distortion of the 


17    

case in controversy rule, then we're in real trouble, 


18    

aren't we? 


19              

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, even if you disagree with me 


20    

on -- on that particular point and you say that the FAA 


21    

does not prevent Baker from intervening on this action, 


22    

it's still true that the arbitration agreement is -- has a 


23    

meaningful benefit to Waffle House because before Waffle 


24    

House entered that arbitration agreement with Baker, it 


25    

was subject to a suit in court by either the EEOC or

Baker.  The agreement with Baker limited Baker to an

arbitral forum.  But absent a similar agreement with the 


 3    

EEOC, Waffle House has simply no expectation and no basis 


 4    

to keep the EEOC out of court or to limit its remedies in 


 5    

court. 


 6              

QUESTION:  Do you think it is -- do you think it 


 7    

is going to be very comfort to Waffle House to know that, 


 8    

yes, it can't be sued in court by the individual, but the 


 9    

entire prosecutorial power of the United States can be 


10    

brought to bear on it in -- in a suit in court?  What 


11    

Waffle House wants to do is to stay out of court, and 


12    

that's what they're getting at when they talk about 


13    

undercutting the -- the -- in effect, the arbitration 


14    

agreement. 


15              

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, with respect, if Waffle 


16    

House wants to stay out of court, then it needs to reach 


17    

an agreement with every party that has a statutory right 


18    

to get them into court.  And as a practical matter, I 


19    

still think --


20              

QUESTION:  Unless one statutory right is 


21    

derivative of the other.  I mean, that's the -- that's the 


22    

whole issue in the case. 


23              

MR. CLEMENT:  Yes, and we think there are

Government has an independent right to sue, but you know, 


 2    

that begs the question.  That -- that's the whole issue. 


 3    

It is given a right to sue, but is -- is that right to sue 


 4    

derivative of the individual's right so that it disappears 


 5    

when the individual's does? 


 6              

MR. CLEMENT:  And I do not think it is.  And 


 7    

it's -- and I think in fact the text of Title VII is quite 


 8    

clear. 


 9              

QUESTION:  Then I think your answer has got to 


10    

be that the settlement clearly does not bind the 


11    

Government. 


12              

MR. CLEMENT:  That's exactly right, and that's 


13    

-- that's a well-established principle.  I mean, look at 


14    

-- look at Firefighters Local No. 93 against -- against 


15    

the City of Cleveland.  The Court says it's a fundamental 


16    

principle that a settlement cannot bind non-parties to the 


17    

litigation. 


18              

QUESTION:  How does this compare with the Fair 


19    

Labor Standards Act where the Secretary of Labor could sue 


20    

or the individual could sue, say, for a wage and hour 


21    

violation?  Or let's take a violation of the Equal Pay 


22    

Act.  How -- how does that work when the Secretary brings 


23    

a suit? 


24              

MR. CLEMENT:  I think in all of those cases, the 


25    

statutory scheme works effectively the same.  There are

 1    

independent causes of action given to the Government 


 2    

entity and to the individual.  And this Court held in the 


 3    

Tony and Susan Alamo Foundation case that just because the 


 4    

individual forswears a cause of action or right to sue 


 5    

under the Fair Labor Standards Act, that does not preclude 


 6    

the Secretary of Labor from bringing their own independent 


 7    

action. 


 8              

QUESTION:  Of course, the -- the cause of action 


 9    

for -- that EEOC has could be vindicated by an equitable 


10    

remedy. 


11              

MR. CLEMENT:  I -- I don't think that's 


12    

necessarily true.  It's certainly not going to be true in 


13    

every case.  And Congress specifically made all forms of 


14    

relief available to the EEOC in its public enforcement 


15    

action.  The court below drew a distinction between 


16    

equitable relief on the one hand and victim-specific 


17    

relief on the other hand to avoid a perceived conflict 


18    

with the FAA.  But with respect, I don't think there is 


19    

any conflict. 


20              

QUESTION:  But in this case then you say EEOC 


21    

can go into court and that Baker can probably not -- not 


22    

intervene, but the EEOC could get whatever he could have 


23    

gotten and give it to him. 


24              

MR. CLEMENT:  That is true, but I don't think 


25    

that is particularly anomalous or limited to this area of

 2              

Take, for example -- I mean, this Court has held 


 3    

that an individual can agree to arbitrate his or her civil 


 4    

RICO claim.  I wouldn't think, though, that that agreement 


 5    

to arbitrate the civil RICO claim would in any way prevent 


 6    

the Government from bringing a criminal RICO action or 


 7    

prevent the Government from getting a restitution order 


 8    

that agreed to give restitution directly to the victim. 


 9              

QUESTION:  Who had already recovered? 


10              

MR. CLEMENT:  No.  Let's -- let's take this --


11    

let's make it parallel to this case where the 


12    

individual --


13              

QUESTION:  No.  I'm assuming a RICO victim who's 


14    

already been -- been compensated, and you think the 


15    

Government can bring a RICO action in which it gets not 


16    

just criminal sanctions but also requires the -- the RICO 


17    

defendant to pay again what's already been paid. 


18              

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, actually they could get the 


19    

order, and then there are specific provisions in the 


20    

Federal restitution statute that allow a set-off for 


21    

amounts that have already been paid or that will be paid. 


22              

QUESTION:  Oh, well, that's quite different.

MR. CLEMENT:  But I don't think it --

QUESTION:  Okay.  Then let's go back -- then 


25    

let's simply go back to the damages case.  You said a

second ago in -- in response or you -- you agreed with the 


 2    

suggestion of mine that in fact the Government can 


 3    

perfectly well sue independently. 


 4              

My question then is, why do you concede that the 


 5    

settlement case in which the individual settles for -- for 


 6    

money in lieu of damages is a harder case?  Why don't you 


 7    

say no?  It's just as easy as this is.  And -- and in 


 8    

neither case is the agreement between the individual and 


 9    

the defendant binding or affecting in any way what the 


10    

Government can do. 


11              

MR. CLEMENT:  Again, we don't think the 


12    

agreement is binding, but let me give you three reasons --


13              

QUESTION:  But why -- but --


14              

MR. CLEMENT:  Let me give you three reasons why 


15    

I think it's a harder case. 


16              

QUESTION:  -- you did say earlier that you 


17    

thought the settlement case more difficult.  So, I guess I 


18    

want you to explain why you think it is. 


19              

MR. CLEMENT:  Okay.  Let me give you three 


20    

reasons why I think the settlement case is more difficult. 


21              

First, there's already been some expenditure of 


22    

resources in that case, either -- likely, either judicial 


23    

or arbitral. 


24              

Second, Title VII seems to place particular 


25    

importance on the EEOC's ability to be able to initiate 


17 


ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

 1    

the action and consider the early stages of litigation. 


 2    

If, for whatever reason, we've gotten to the point where 


 3    

somebody has filed a claim and it's settled, that role has 


 4    

already been filled. 


 5              

The third reason is another particularly 


 6    

important function of the EEOC under Title VII is to act 


 7    

as a safety valve, so if for some reason the individual is 


 8    

not willing or able to sue, maybe out of a fear of 


 9    

retaliation or something, in a particular case that 


10    

vindicates the public interest, the EEOC has the ability 


11    

to step in and fill that gap.  If there's already been a 


12    

settlement --


13              

QUESTION:  Well, but in each of the -- in each 


14    

of the cases that you posit, even the third one, the --


15    

the essence of the objection to your position is that an 


16    

agreement has been made between the individual and the 


17    

defendant.  And in the case of the arbitration agreement, 


18    

an agreement has been made between the individual and the 


19    

defendant.  And I don't see why the one class -- the one 


20    

kind of agreement should be treated any differently from 


21    

the other kind of agreement in determining whether the 


22    

Government really is in an autonomous position. 


23              

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I actually think there is a 


24    

reason to treat that one agreement different, which is the 


25    

agreement to settle a case extinguishes any claim to

 1    

relief.  An arbitration agreement does not.  It's simply a 


 2    

forum selection provision.  And the anomaly of the Fourth 


 3    

Circuit's ruling is they take an agreement that limits 


 4    

Baker's access to a judicial forum, but does not limit his 


 5    

remedies and somehow transmogrify it into a rule that 


 6    

limits the EEOC's available remedies but not their access 


 7    

to a judicial forum. 


 8              

QUESTION:  Then your objection is the 


 9    

transmogrification, not to the -- not to the recognition 


10    

of the agreement as such. 


11              

MR. CLEMENT:  Again, we have no -- absolutely no 


12    

objection to having the agreement bind the parties to the 


13    

agreement. 


14              

QUESTION:  But you do say that the employee 


15    

could not proceed even in the arbitral forum once the EEOC 


16    

starts.  It's clear in the statute that that's true as to 


17    

a court action, but you I thought agreed with me that the 


18    

employee, once the EEOC starts, can't go into the arbitral 


19    

forum either. 


20              

MR. CLEMENT:  Actually the EEOC is of the 


21    

opinion that the -- that the individual could bring an 


22    

arbitration action at that point.  That is a consequence, 


23    

though, of the view that they cannot intervene in the 


24    

EEOC's enforcement action.  I think -- I think they --


25

MR. CLEMENT:  -- they have to have one action or 


 2    

the other. 


 3              

QUESTION:  -- says we can have this -- we can 


 4    

have this -- you've just told us that the substantive law 


 5    

is the same.  And I think you're quite right about that, 


 6    

and -- and it's just a question of which forum.  But now 


 7    

you're saying it can be both forums simultaneously.  The 


 8    

individual can go forward in the arbitration; the EEOC can 


 9    

go forward in the court with all the problems that 


10    

duplicative litigation can have of potentially conflicting 


11    

results. 


12              

MR. CLEMENT:  That's equally, of course -- I 


13    

mean, I -- I agree that there is that problem.  That is 


14    

equally a problem with the Fourth Circuit's rule, of 


15    

course, because they said that the EEOC could be in court 


16    

seeking general injunctive relief while the individual is 


17    

arbitrating his claim for victim-specific relief. 


18              

QUESTION:  Well --


19              

MR. CLEMENT:  But -- but I think --


20              

QUESTION:  -- that doesn't strike me as so 


21    

terrible.  I mean, that -- that's entirely understandable. 


22    

You have two different types of relief being sought in two 


23    

different forums.

 2    

two different forums. 


 3              

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, and -- and I think that -- I 


 4    

mean, that may be a product of -- that happens when you 


 5    

have an arbitration agreement that limits some parties but 


 6    

not others.  That seems to be the case in -- in Moses 


 7    

Cone. 


 8              

QUESTION:  Only if we adopt your view of the 


 9    

thing, that the two -- that the two are independent.  If 


10    

-- if the two are dependent, as the statute makes very 


11    

clear they are when -- when the Government brings --


12    

brings the suit first, barring -- barring the individual 


13    

from bringing a separate suit, if the two are -- are 


14    

dependent, then you don't face any of these problems. 


15              

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, fair enough.  But in this 


16    

case, the Government did bring suit first.  Baker has 


17    

never arbitrated.  So, that position would lead you to the 


18    

conclusion that the Fourth Circuit was wrong, that the 


19    

EEOC can pursue this case, seek victim-specific relief and 


20    

general injunctive relief, and that it's up to you to 


21    

determine whether or not Baker gets to intervene in that 


22    

action.  But that is -- that is certainly a result that 


23    

the Government is quite happy with. 


24              

It seems to me what's really sort of 


25    

indefensible about the Fourth Circuit's reasoning is they

take this forum selection provision and turn it into a 


 2    

restriction on remedies.  The -- the ADA and Title VII 


 3    

have concurrent jurisdiction. 


 4              

Suppose that an employer and an employee agreed 


 5    

to litigate their case in State court, not Federal court. 


 6    

It wouldn't seem to me that that forum selection clause 


 7    

would bar the EEOC and bind the EEOC and limit them from 


 8    

bringing their public enforcement action in Federal court. 


 9    

It certainly wouldn't seem to me that that agreement to 


10    

litigate in State court would somehow prevent the EEOC 


11    

from getting victim-specific damages in Federal court if 


12    

in fact there was no State court action.  But -- but in 


13    

principle, there's no difference between the arbitration 


14    

agreement and that forum selection clause agreement that 


15    

picks the State court. 


16              

QUESTION:  Except there's a Federal Arbitration 


17    

Act, and we've said it's designed to encourage arbitration 


18    

of disputes. 


19              

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, in fairness, I don't think 


20    

that the FAA embodies a self-executing preference for 


21    

arbitration.  The --


22              

QUESTION:  No, but -- a -- a favoring where the 


23    

-- where an arbitration agreement has been entered into, 


24    

as it was here. 


25              

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, that's true.  But I think

 1    

the purpose of the FAA, as I understand it, was to put 


 2    

arbitration contracts on an equal footing with other 


 3    

contracts, not to give them some special private place. 


 4    

And we think that that forum selection clause that picked 


 5    

the State forum would be enforceable between the parties, 


 6    

but we just don't think it makes any sense to say that 


 7    

that agreement between the parties somehow leaps out and 


 8    

bars the EEOC from bringing a Federal enforcement action, 


 9    

or even more puzzlingly I think, restricting the remedies 


10    

available to the EEOC in that public enforcement action. 


11              

It seems to me that at -- at bottom Title VII 


12    

gives the EEOC a right to bring a public enforcement 


13    

action. 


14              

QUESTION:  The trouble is it's not a public 


15    

enforcement action to the extent that it is seeking 


16    

damages for this individual.  To that extent, it -- it's 


17    

an action that seeks to compensate this individual for the 


18    

damage he has suffered.  Now, that -- that has some public 


19    

benefit I -- I assume, just as his own suit, should he 


20    

recover, would have such -- some public benefit.  But to 


21    

call it a public enforcement action seems to me quite 


22    

unrealistic. 


23              

MR. CLEMENT:  With fairness, I think that's a 


24    

position that Congress rejected in Title VII itself.  If 


25    

Congress wanted to say that the only time that the EEOC

 1    

vindicates the public interest is when it seeks general 


 2    

injunctive relief, it would have been quite easy for 


 3    

Congress to limit the EEOC to general injunctive relief or 


 4    

limit it to bringing pattern and practice cases.  Instead, 


 5    

it gave it the right --


 6              

QUESTION:  Why?  That would have been very 


 7    

foolish.  Why -- why require two separate suits:  one --


 8    

one by the private individual, the other by the -- by the 


 9    

agency?  If the agency is going to be in there, it may as 


10    

well go for the whole ball. 


11              

MR. CLEMENT:  Well --


12              

QUESTION:  But -- but to say that the portion of 


13    

it that compensates the individual is essentially, you 


14    

know, a vindication of the public doesn't seem to me --


15    

doesn't seem to me reasonable.  And -- and that is 


16    

demonstrated by the fact that if the agency brings the 


17    

suit, the individual can't because he's going to be 


18    

getting his individual relief. 


19              

MR. CLEMENT:  Again, with all respect, I 


20

21    

vindicate the public interest, even though the restitution 


22    

goes to the victim, and not the Government.  It's the fact

discrimination acts by many years, where the Secretary can 


 2    

sue for the money to go into the pocket of the employee, I 


 3    

thought that those were characterized as public interest 


 4    

actions. 


 5              

MR. CLEMENT:  That's absolutely right.  I mean, 


 6    

every time a wrongdoer pays money, the payment of that 


 7    

money serves a public interest that's independent of the 


 8    

destination of the payment, whether it goes to the 


 9    

individual who was wronged or some sort of public 


10    

enforcement action. 


11              

And again, I suggest the example of a 


12    

retaliation action.  In a retaliation action, when an 


13    

employer has retaliated against an employee for filing a 


14    

charge with the EEOC, the EEOC clearly vindicates the 


15    

public interest when it files suit to take the employer to 


16    

task for the retaliation.  And that's true even if the 


17    

retaliation and the most effective remedies are victim-


18    

specific.  In a case like that, you really need the 


19    

victim-specific remedies because, after all, it is clear 


20    

as day from Title VII itself that an employer can't 


21    

retaliate against an employee for filing a charge.  So, to 


22    

simply get an injunction that says that is of somewhat 


23    

limited utility.  On the other hand, to get back pay, 


24    

compensatory and capped punitive damages I think does 


25    

vindicate the public interest.

QUESTION:  Well, what are your best authorities 


 2    

for the proposition that when litigation has been 


 3    

concluded, another party can recommence the litigation 


 4    

alleging its own injury? 


 5              

MR. CLEMENT:  I guess I would point --


 6              

QUESTION:  -- some other areas.  You cited the 


 7    

Firefighters case? 


 8              

MR. CLEMENT:  Yes.  I would -- I would direct 


 9    

you to Local No. 93 v. City of Cleveland.  There's a 


10    

statement in that case that I think was just meant to 


11    

reflect a general principle that parties to a litigation 


12    

can't, through a settlement, bind a non-party to the 


13    

litigation. 


14              

QUESTION:  Well, but that was because the other 


15    

parties had their own injury of a pecuniary nature, as I 


16    

recall the case.  I -- I don't see the case cited. 


17              

QUESTION:  As a practical matter, how often does 


18    

the EEOC seek victim-specific relief in the form of 


19    

monetary damages after there's been a settlement between 


20    

the victim and the other side? 


21              

MR. CLEMENT:  I'm actually aware of no case 


22    

where that's happened. 


23              

QUESTION:  This is all a hypothetical. 


24

there is an arbitration agreement, but the individual has 


 2    

never even sought to arbitrate.  I think that's a much

easier case.

I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for 


 5    

rebuttal.

Mr. Gordon, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. GORDON 


 9                    

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 


10              

MR. GORDON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 


11    

please the Court: 


12              

The answer to the question presented today is 


13    

found in the broad terms and policies of the Federal 


14    

Arbitration Act.  The question, of course, is what effect 


15    

does Mr. Baker's arbitration agreement have on the EEOC's 


16    

litigation remedies. 


17              

The Fourth Circuit correctly held that the EEOC 


18    

could bring in court a claim for broad-based injunctive 


19    

relief and declaratory relief.  However, because Mr. Baker 


20    

had agreed to arbitrate his claims, he could not seek 


21    

relief in court specifically for Mr. Baker. 


22              

Now, I -- I listened carefully to Mr. Clement's 


23    

argument about the issue of settlement of a claim, and I 


24    

must respectfully disagree with the authority and line of 


25    

cases that he's citing.  As a matter of fact, the 


27

 1    

position, as I understand it from Mr. Clement, is that an 


 2    

individual can settle a claim and then the EEOC can later 


 3    

sue on behalf of that individual and recover relief for 


 4    

that individual.  And that particular principle, if that 


 5    

is what the EEOC is espousing today, contradicts their own 


 6    

policy guidance --


 7              

QUESTION:  Mr. Gordon, if I understood him 


 8    

correctly, he did take that position, but he said you 


 9    

don't have to take that position to prevail in this case. 


10    

Is that right? 


11              

MR. GORDON:  Well, perhaps I perceived it 


12    

differently, Your Honor. 


13              

But I -- I do think that from our position it's 


14    

very important for the Court to understand that the cases 


15    

are almost uniform for the proposition that if an 


16    

individual settles a case --


17              

QUESTION:  Mr. Gordon, but that's so highly 


18    

hypothetical because the likelihood that the employee 


19    

would have proceeded -- if the EEOC in the beginning is 


20    

the only one who can bring an action in court, EEOC brings 


21    

an action.  Now, even if it's limited only to injunctive 


22    

relief, isn't it clear that the basic finding of fact, was 


23    

there discrimination, has to be made for any kind of 


24    

relief.  And are you going to permit a viable set of 


25    

proceedings to determine that question?

 1              

Once the EEOC brings in -- the case in court, 


 2    

mustn't its suit be given primacy to determine the basic 


 3    

question, was there discrimination in violation of the 


 4    

act? 


 5              

MR. GORDON:  Your Honor, we do not believe it 


 6    

should be given primacy when an individual has signed an 


 7    

arbitration agreement in which he says I agree that all 


 8    

claims arising out of my employment shall be resolved in 


 9    

arbitration.  We don't see any reason why that case needs 


10    

to wait for the EEOC to --


11              

QUESTION:  Well, because one of them has power 


12    

to bind the other.  Does it not?  I mean, suppose the EEOC 


13    

proceeds and there is a finding that discrimination, 


14    

unlawful under the statute, occurred.  That would be 


15    

binding on the employer in any other forum, wouldn't it 


16    

be? 


17              

MR. GORDON:  Well, Your Honor, it should be, but 


18    

the EEOC doesn't take that position, as I understand it. 


19    

As I understand their position, whatever happens in their 


20    

court proceeding is an independent action and that Mr. 


21    

Baker really doesn't have any control over.  And they're 


22    

doing their own thing in court. 


23              

QUESTION:  But we're not talking about Mr. 


24    

Baker.  We're talking about the employer who has been 


25    

found to have been a discriminator.  That would have issue

 2    

We're not talking about the individual now, but we're 


 3    

talking about the employer who has been found to be a 


 4    

discriminator in a Federal district court. 


 5              

MR. GORDON:  It would, Your Honor, if there were 


 6    

findings of fact that were common to the other proceeding. 


 7              

QUESTION:  But the other way around, if the 


 8    

arbitrator, say, finds no discrimination in that 


 9    

arbitration forum, couldn't bind the EEOC because the EEOC 


10    

wasn't party to that litigation.  Am I right about that? 


11              

MR. GORDON:  Well, I would have to disagree with 


12    

you on that because I believe that in the arbitration, if 


13    

there were -- an adjudication was made as to Mr. Baker and 


14    

in -- as in this particular case -- if I may use this case 


15    

as the example, in this particular case, Mr. Baker is the 


16    

only game in town here.  The EEOC is seeking relief solely 


17    

on behalf of Mr. Baker.  All damages will go to Mr. Baker. 


18              

QUESTION:  Let's -- let's cut out the relief 


19    

aspect of it and again concentrate on the issue, was there 


20    

discrimination or not, as to which there might be 


21    

injunctive remedies.  If Mr. -- Mr. Baker loses on that, 


22    

that can't preclude the EEOC from getting the 


23    

determination, was there discrimination. 


24              

So, the only point I'm making is when you've got 


25    

one show that will be binding and the other that can't

 1    

preclude the EEOC from litigating that basic question, 


 2    

whatever remedies would attach to it, doesn't it follow 


 3    

that the EEOC's suit must be allowed to go forward and 


 4    

have the question of discrimination determined in that 


 5    

forum? 


 6              

MR. GORDON:  Your Honor, I -- I still believe 


 7    

that there's no reason to wait in this case, that the 


 8    

arbitration can go forward to resolve Mr. Baker's 


 9    

individual claims, that the EEOC, under the Fourth Circuit 


10    

rule, can go forward and have the claims for broad-based 


11    

injunctive relief heard there. 


12              

And I -- I must say that there may be separate 


13    

issues being litigated in that EEOC court proceeding 


14    

because --


15              

QUESTION:  But isn't it true that for any 


16    

relief, there must be a finding that the employer has 


17    

violated the act? 


18              

MR. GORDON:  There must be, but in the court 


19    

proceeding, there's going to be a broader finding, that 


20    

there is some pattern or practice of discrimination going 


21    

on that may or -- may or may not apply to Mr. Baker.  If 


22    

it does apply to Mr. Baker, I would agree with you.  Then 


23    

that particular ruling would have some collateral estoppel 


24    

effect in the arbitration. 


25              

QUESTION:  Well, what -- what is your position

-- maybe you've answered this.  What is your position if 


 2    

the employer and the employee arbitrate and there's a 


 3    

finding of no liability, no wrong on -- no wrong committed 


 4    

by the employer?  The EEOC then sues.  Is the EEOC not 


 5    

bound by the liability finding? 


 6              

MR. GORDON:  Your Honor, in that particular 


 7    

case, if the arbitrator makes a ruling that there was some 


 8    

practice --


 9              

QUESTION:  No.  My hypothetical is the 


10    

arbitrator rules for the employer.  No discrimination. 


11    

There was no firing in violation of the ADA.  The employer 


12    

was taking -- the employee was taking money or something. 


13    

That -- that was the reason.  Can the EEOC then re-


14    

litigate the issue of liability? 


15              

MR. GORDON:  Not that particular very issue of 


16    

liability, but what I'm -- what I'm anticipating --


17              

QUESTION:  And why -- and why is that?

liability?

MR. GORDON:  I am anticipating from your 


23    

hypothetical that a specific finding is being made about

QUESTION:  I just want to make it clear what 


 5    

your position is.  Is it your position that when the EEOC 


 6    

sues in -- in the Federal court and there has been a 


 7    

previous finding of -- of non-liability on the part of the 


 8    

employer, that the employer did not discriminate against 


 9    

this person, is the EEOC bound in court by that finding? 


10              

MR. GORDON:  Your Honor, the EEOC, to the extent 


11    

that it's bringing a public enforcement action, something 


12    

involving a pattern or practice of discrimination, 


13    

something --

the injunction on the wrong that the employer allegedly 


19    

committed against this employee, but the arbitrator has

found that there is no such violation.

of his case, yes, it would be binding.

 1              

MR. GORDON:  Well, Your Honor, the -- the 


 2    

authority would be that based on general principles of 


 3    

collateral estoppel where there's been -- these issues 


 4    

have been litigated and --


 5              

QUESTION:  Against a particular person.  I 


 6    

thought the basic principle of preclusion was that someone 


 7    

who has not litigated cannot be bound.  You would have to 


 8    

establish that there was some kind of privity between the 


 9    

employee and the EEOC, but I think that would be certainly 


10    

unprecedented.  The main rule is you have a right to a day 


11    

in court, not two days in court, and if the EEOC has not 


12    

been a party in the arbitral forum, I don't see how it can 


13    

be bound, unless you're making up some new preclusion 


14    

rule. 


15              

MR. GORDON:  No, Your Honor, I'm not making --


16              

QUESTION:  Or unless you say the statutory 


17    

scheme necessarily finds that there is privity because the 


18    

EEOC's interests in this case, where there's no broad 


19    

pattern or practice, are allied solely with those of the 


20    

-- of the employee.  But it's -- it's a little odd to say 


21    

that a party in privity is -- is bound if that party 


22    

cannot intervene in those proceedings when it's a public 


23    

agency.  But it seems to me that that has to be your --


24    

your proposition.

 2    

what I'm going to say to the Court is that basically what 


 3    

-- what is happening here, in the -- in the terms of 


 4    

seeking individual relief, is that the EEOC is acting on 


 5    

behalf of Mr. Baker. 


 6              

QUESTION:  Why -- why --


 7              

QUESTION:  The EEOC is -- is effectively a party 


 8    

to the earlier proceeding since its right in the later 


 9    

proceeding is purely derivative of the right of -- of the 


10    

individual employee.  That's essentially what you're 


11    

urging. 


12              

MR. GORDON:  It is, Your Honor, and -- and 


13    

essentially the EEOC is standing in the shoes of Mr. Baker 


14    

when you look at this case because it is -- if you look at 


15    

the joint appendix, page 51 and 52, the interrogatory 


16    

responses from the EEOC, you see that they acknowledge 


17    

they are seeking -- when asked what -- what damages are 


18    

you seeking in this case, we are seeking relief on behalf 


19    

of Mr. Baker. 


20              

QUESTION:  That -- that happens to be in this 


21    

case.  They might have said that. 


22              

Doesn't the EEOC also pursue a public interest? 


23    

I mean, can't the EEOC -- imagine individuals who don't 


24    

want to bring suits.  They don't care.  They're cowed or 


25    

they just don't care.  And the EEOC says, I don't care

whether you want to bring a suit or not; we're bringing

 3    

employers don't discriminate?  And isn't there a public 


 4    

interest in that, as well as the private interest? 


 5              

MR. GORDON:  There is, Your Honor.  There's a 


 6    

public interest in a case such as that, and there's also a 


 7    

public interest in any claim that an individual brings to

 9              

QUESTION:  But isn't there a public interest? 


10    

Didn't Congress set this statute up so that it is more is 


11    

involved than a simple tort action or a simple contract 


12    

action?  There's a public policy in the United States 


13    

against this kind of discrimination embodied in many laws, 


14    

and this is one of those laws. 


15              

MR. GORDON:  True, Your Honor, but that public 


16    

interest can be vindicated just as effectively in 


17    

arbitration. 


18              

QUESTION:  That's the question.  If a person 


19    

then in your view says to the EEOC, my employer 


20    

discriminated against me because I'm black or because of 


21    

gender or whatever, no doubt, but I like peace; I don't 


22    

want to bother him; I'm a little worried about it; okay, 


23    

drop it, if the EEOC says, I don't want to drop it, do 


24    

they not have that right? 


25              

MR. GORDON:  They can continue to pursue that

claim for broad-based injunctive relief involved.  But --


 2    

but here's the rub. 


 3              

QUESTION:  I'm talking about can they not get 


 4    

appropriate relief.  That's what the statute says. 


 5              

MR. GORDON:  It does say that, and the relief 


 6    

would not be appropriate where an individual has signed an 


 7    

agreement to arbitrate. 


 8              

QUESTION:  I'm not -- I'm asking you my 


 9    

question, not your question.  I, at the moment, have an 


10    

individual who doesn't care, doesn't really want the suit 


11    

brought, says to the EEOC drop it, forget it.  The EEOC 


12    

says, we don't want to forget it.  There's -- I'm just 


13    

repeating myself.  So, what's the answer to my case? 


14              

(Laughter.) 


15              

MR. GORDON:  Well -- well, the answer to your 


16    

case I think is found in the Federal Arbitration Act 


17    

because this individual agreed to arbitrate --


18              

QUESTION:  I'm not -- there is no arbitration 


19    

agreement in my case.  It's a person.  You're quite right. 


20    

As soon as you answer my question, I'm then going to ask 


21    

you why does it matter that there's an arbitration 


22    

agreement. 


23              

(Laughter.) 


24

case.

MR. GORDON:  All right.  Your Honor, if -- may I 


 2    

ask you to again assert your proposition? 


 3              

QUESTION:  The person is lazy, frightened, or 


 4    

whatever and says to the EEOC, I don't want you to bring 


 5    

this action to get me reinstated.  Forget it.  Drop it. 


 6    

I'm indifferent.  Does the EEOC have the legal power to 


 7    

say we don't care?  We have a public interest here.  We 


 8    

want to bring this suit anyway because we don't think it's 


 9    

right for the employer to discriminate against you.  We 


10    

want to make an example of him.  Okay? 


11              

MR. GORDON:  Yes. 


12              

QUESTION:  They can do that. 


13              

MR. GORDON:  They can do that. 


14              

QUESTION:  Fine.  Now, my question is, when they 


15    

can do that, why does it matter if there's an arbitration 


16    

agreement since once you -- all right.  Go ahead.  Why 


17    

does it matter? 


18              

MR. GORDON:  Well, there is, of course, the --


19    

the strong Federal policy favoring arbitration, the text 


20    

of the Federal Arbitration Act that says, we're going to 


21    

enforce agreements. 


22              

QUESTION:  And, of course, my example is 


23    

designed to show that all those interests have to do with 


24    

the private interest of the individual perhaps.

 1              

QUESTION:  Not the other.  That's why I asked --


 2              

QUESTION:  -- I think -- I think it is your 


 3    

position, is it not, that the -- that the agency would not 


 4    

be able to bring such a suit if the individual had already 


 5    

sued and had been compensated, or indeed, if the -- if the 


 6    

individual had already settled? 


 7              

MR. GORDON:  True. 


 8              

QUESTION:  Isn't that your position? 


 9              

MR. GORDON:  True. 


10              

QUESTION:  And -- and your further position is 


11    

that the -- that the conclusion of an arbitration 


12    

agreement is similar to a settlement, that the agency's 


13    

ability to bring the later suit depends on what the 


14    

individual, on whose behalf it sues, has given away. 


15              

MR. GORDON:  That is correct. 


16              

QUESTION:  Good.  That's perfect.  That's just 


17    

my question.  Why is this arbitration agreement more like 


18    

the settlement than it is like the instance we both 


19    

agreed, the indifferent employee? 


20              

MR. GORDON:  Your Honor, the EEOC in these cases 


21    

-- and I hope I can be responsive to your question.  The 


22    

EEOC in these cases takes its employee as it finds it, and 


23    

in this particular case, the employee has an arbitration 


24    

agreement.  And individual conduct can limit the ability 


25    

of the EEOC to seek remedies in a case.  It happens in a

 1    

number of different contexts. 


 2              

QUESTION:  But the remedy -- I think we've 


 3    

agreed that what we're not talking about here is the 


 4    

substantive law -- the substantive right and the remedy. 


 5    

It is simply a choice of forum clause.  And if you have 


 6    

two parties that have a substantive right, who can assert 


 7    

the substantive right, one of them is bound by a choice of 


 8    

forum clause.  That's where that party must go.  And the 


 9    

other one is not so bound.  Then how do you stop the EEOC 


10    

from choosing its forum? 


11              

The same question with respect to suppose it had 


12    

been a State human rights commission that is going into 


13    

the State court, and the employer says, no, State human 


14    

rights commission, you can't do that because this employee 


15    

has signed an agreement to arbitrate. 


16              

MR. GORDON:  Your Honor, the -- the notion of 


17    

the importance of the Federal Arbitration Act is that 


18    

these agreements have to be put on the same footing as 


19    

other contracts, and we must give force to an arbitration 


20    

agreement such as this.  And to allow parties to come up 


21    

with ways to get around these agreements completely 


22    

undercuts the Federal Arbitration Act. 


23              

And I -- I would disagree with your premise, if 


24    

I -- if I may, respectfully, that arbitration is a forum 


25    

selection clause.  It's a lot more than that.  It is a --

it is a method of resolving employment disputes. 


 2              

QUESTION:  But do you -- procedural mode, but do 


 3    

you -- you don't contest, do you, that Title VII or the 


 4    

disability act or the -- whatever Federal law is the law 


 5    

that the arbitrator is to apply so that the substantive 


 6    

law to be applied, whether you're in court or in 


 7    

arbitration, is the same?  It would be Title VII.  It 


 8    

would be the Disabilities Act.  You're not suggesting that 


 9    

the arbitrator can apply some other brand of Federal law 


10    

than the Federal court would apply, are you? 


11              

MR. GORDON:  No, I'm not.  But --


12              

QUESTION:  So, we're talking about the forum and 


13    

forums have rules of procedure, which can be different, 


14    

but the substantive law is the same.  It is Title VII or 


15    

the Disabilities Act. 


16              

MR. GORDON:  That's true, Your Honor, but -- but 


17    

still if we -- if we go forward with the rule that's 


18    

proposed by the EEOC, in -- in my view we will be flying 


19    

in the face of the Court's decisions in Gilmer, the 


20    

Court's decision in Circuit City, the plain text of the 


21    

Federal Arbitration Act.  We will be discouraging rather 


22    

than encouraging arbitration, and --


23              

QUESTION:  Mr. -- Mr. Gordon, I assume that 


24    

giving up the whole cause of action is the greater and 


25    

giving up the forum is the lesser.  Isn't your response 


41 


ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

 1    

that if -- if the EEOC is bound by a settlement agreement, 


 2    

a fortiori it should be bound by an agreement only to 


 3    

bring the suit in a particular forum, if indeed its action 


 4    

is derivative of the individual's action.  The greater 


 5    

includes the lesser, and surely giving up the whole cause 


 6    

of action, if that binds the EEOC, is greater than giving 


 7    

up simply the forum in which the cause of action can be 


 8    

brought. 


 9              

MR. GORDON:  True, and if you take a step back 


10    

-- and let's -- let's take the more general -- general 


11    

example where there -- there hasn't been a claim filed and 


12    

where an individual is having a dispute with his employer. 


13    

And the employer says, I will give you $300 in exchange 


14    

for a -- a settlement agreement, a release of all claims. 


15    

It doesn't involve where an EEOC charge has been filed or 


16    

where there's a court case going on.  The EEOC and the 


17    

courts take the position that that particular scenario 


18    

would preclude it from later seeking relief on behalf of 


19    

that individual in court. 


20              

QUESTION:  Why is this greater?  You agreed that 


21    

this is a -- this is the greater, the arbitration. 


22              

The way I'm seeing it, which you can correct, is 


23    

that the word in the statute is appropriate relief, and 


24    

that there's a spectrum.  On the one hand, we have the 


25    

indifferent employee.  Next is the one with an arbitration

agreement who doesn't enforce it.  Next is the one who is 


 2    

in the middle of arbitration.  Next is the one who has 


 3    

been through arbitration and gotten some money, and 


 4    

finally, at the far end we have a settlement.  And whether 


 5    

each of those is appropriate, circumstances for the EEOC 


 6    

to proceed might differ one from the other.  But certainly 


 7    

the arbitration case is in the middle.  It's not way over 


 8    

at the extreme.  So, what -- what is your response? 


 9              

MR. GORDON:  I can't accept the spectrum 


10    

analysis, if -- if I may.  I have to revert to the fact 


11    

that -- that the individual signed the agreement to 


12    

arbitrate.  Once signing that agreement to arbitrate, then 


13    

he must pursue his individual claims in that forum and he 


14    

cannot hand off the ball to the EEOC and have the EEOC do 


15    

for him what he cannot do for himself, which is get 


16    

individual relief in court.  That was the bargain that 


17    

Waffle House made with this employee. 


18              

QUESTION:  Would that carry over to, say, wage 


19    

and hour claims?  Equal pay -- I guess the Equal Pay Act 


20    

is the closest. 


21              

MR. GORDON:  Your Honor --


22              

QUESTION:  Could the Secretary of Labor also be 


23    

in privity with the individual employee who hasn't -- who 


24    

has been denied equal pay? 


25

 2              

QUESTION:  Yes. 


 3              

MR. GORDON:  -- there -- there are different 


 4    

interests there.  For example, the -- the Department of 


 5    

Labor has to approve a settlement of a wage/hour claim 


 6    

because of the public policy involved in making sure that 


 7    

the lowest wage earners in our society get a particular 


 8    

wage. 


 9              

It's different on an ADA claim, for example. 


10    

The EEOC does not have to approve the settlement of a 


11    

claim. 


12              

QUESTION:  How about an Equal Pay Act claim? 


13              

MR. GORDON:  Equal Play Act claim, Your Honor, I 


14    

believe would be covered under the Department of Labor 


15    

scenario. 


16              

QUESTION:  Mr. Gordon, may I just ask you a 


17    

question sort of about the other end of this case?  Let's 


18    

assume that -- well, let's assume that there are parallel 


19    

proceedings going on and that the EEOC suit comes to 


20    

resolution first. 


21              

Now, you -- you are -- you at least agree that 


22    

the -- that the EEOC can get what I think you have 


23    

described as sort of generalized equitable remedies on --


24    

on -- in -- in the public interest.  Would those remedies 


25

 2    

arbitration agreement, say, in this case, but also brings 


 3    

in a -- in effect, a -- a class-wide claim and said, you 


 4    

know, there are -- we'll prove that there are hundreds of 


 5    

other individuals who have suffered the same -- what is it 


 6    

-- Title I violation that this individual suffered.  Can 


 7    

the -- and let's assume that in -- in the -- the EEOC 


 8    

suit, that they prove that.  Can the EEOC get generally 


 9    

class-wide remedy as -- as part of its general equitable 


10    

relief? 


11              

MR. GORDON:  Yes. 


12              

QUESTION:  Would that include back pay? 


13              

MR. GORDON:  No, it would not where there's 


14    

been --

QUESTION:  Why not? 


16              

MR. GORDON:  When there's been an arbitration

21    

your position is. 


22              

MR. GORDON:  Our position would be, Your Honor, 


23    

that for those individuals who have signed arbitration

agreements, then any relief specific to them must be 


25    

awarded in arbitration.  For those individuals who have

 2    

wide relief action could encompass their claim for relief 


 3    

in court.  But to give force to the arbitration agreements 


 4    

that have been signed by the individuals, the -- the 


 5    

general --


 6              

QUESTION:  Okay, but then -- then I -- is it 


 7    

also your position that the -- that the general equitable 


 8    

relief could not include an injunction to rehire all of 


 9    

those who were improperly fired? 


10              

MR. GORDON:  The -- the equitable relief 


11    

specific to the individual -- specific to the 


12    

individual --


13              

QUESTION:  Well, the injunction is just a 


14    

general injunction.  It says, rehire the people in this 


15    

class whom you unlawfully fired in -- in violation of this 


16    

title.  Can -- can they get that relief on your theory? 


17    

Can the EEOC get that relief on your theory? 


18              

MR. GORDON:  It could if the relief was broad-


19    

based and not --


20              

QUESTION:  Well, in my example, it's broad-


21    

based in the sense that it applies to everyone in the 


22    

class, but in order to enforce it, it will have to be 


23    

enforced against specific individuals.  Somebody quite 


24    

apart from this proceeding will come forward and say, I'm

be -- be enforced in that case? 


 2              

MR. GORDON:  Yes, it could, but --


 3              

QUESTION:  Then why can't back pay be enforced 


 4    

in that case? 


 5              

MR. GORDON:  But -- but -- well, it would be 


 6    

enforced in arbitration.  The relief specific to the 


 7    

individual would be enforced in arbitration. 


 8              

QUESTION:  No.  You -- if I -- if I understood 


 9    

what you just said -- maybe I didn't -- the -- the 


10    

injunction to rehire those who were improperly fired could 


11    

be enforced in -- in court.  In other words, there's an 


12    

injunction and a court that issued the injunction can 


13    

enforce it.  Is that correct? 


14              

MR. GORDON:  The determination would be in 


15    

court. 


16              

QUESTION:  All right.  Then why -- why would not 


17    

a similar determination and a similar power effect a back 


18    

pay -- generalized back pay order?  Give back pay to all 


19    

of those -- not this guy, but to all of those in the class

21              

MR. GORDON:  Well, it could, Your Honor.  In 


22    

court a determination such as that could be made that 


23    

these individuals have been discriminated against and 


24    

therefore remedies are available to them.  But the actual 


25    

determination of the remedies must be made in arbitration

QUESTION:  I can understand why you say that, 


 3    

but I don't understand why you say that a -- a general 


 4    

equitable order to rehire could be enforced in court and 


 5    

would not have to be remitted to an arbitral forum. 


 6              

MR. GORDON:  The determination could be made in 


 7    

court, but the determination of what specific equitable 


 8    

relief, whether this person should be reinstated or -- or 


 9    

this person should not, that should be made in 


10    

arbitration. 


11              

QUESTION:  So, in -- the only thing that on your 


12    

theory then that is totally within the control of the 


13    

court would be totally prospective relief, e.g., an order, 


14    

don't do this again for anybody.  That would be 


15    

enforceable in court. 


16              

MR. GORDON:  Yes. 


17              

QUESTION:  And purely in court. 


18              

MR. GORDON:  That would be. 


19              

QUESTION:  And let's say -- let's say a claim is 


20    

made then later on that that order has been violated, that 


21    

the title has been violated again, and the injunction 


22    

against violating the title has been -- has been violated. 


23    

And let's assume that the employee who claims that -- that 


24    

he is the subject of that violation has also signed an 


25    

arbitration agreement.  Does it have to go to arbitration?

MR. GORDON:  Well, in that particular case, Your 


 2    

Honor, I believe there would be contempt --


 3              

QUESTION:  Right. 


 4              

MR. GORDON:  -- of the injunction.  The contempt 


 5    

would be enforced in court. 


 6              

QUESTION:  But why isn't your -- why isn't your 


 7    

claim to the vindication of the arbitration agreement the 


 8    

same in the future case as it was in the past case? 


 9              

MR. GORDON:  Because the relief that is awarded 


10    

to a particular individual is awarded in arbitration. 


11    

Assuming that relief was awarded, then that would probably 


12    

end the participation of the arbitrator at that point. 


13              

QUESTION:  The contempt action wouldn't be 


14    

brought by either the EEOC or -- or the individual, I 


15    

assume.  It would be brought by the United States attorney 


16    

or, as we have said, some attorney appointed by the court. 


17              

MR. GORDON:  Your Honor, the Court -- the Court 


18    

should not allow -- and I think this is the central --


19    

central theme of -- of our argument here.  The Court 


20    

should not allow the EEOC and its charging party who comes 


21    

to it with an arbitration agreement to frustrate the 


22    

purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act by making this end 


23    

run around the agreement.  Mr. Baker entered into a 


24    

private agreement with Waffle House to resolve any 


25    

disputes he has arising out of his employment.  The

Court --


 2              

QUESTION:  Mr. Gordon, in -- in the history of 


 3    

the anti-discrimination acts, there was legislative 


 4    

history that said the EEOC should be the main player; that 


 5    

is, they should be the main enforcer of these anti-


 6    

discrimination laws.  Now, that model, which would have 


 7    

taken a lot more money than Congress has appropriated to 


 8    

carry out -- but that model simply could not be realized 


 9    

under your view of things because the Federal Arbitration 


10    

Act would always take primacy, I think you -- you put it. 


11              

But the notion that the EEOC ought to be running 


12    

these discrimination actions -- they are the main show, 


13    

and then the individual actions can supplement that.  But 


14    

-- but you couldn't have that model effected under your 


15    

view of it because the arbitration agreement could always 


16    

come in and interfere with it. 


17              

MR. GORDON:  Well, I think we should -- should 


18    

take account of what the EEO still is able to do under the 


19    

Fourth Circuit's rule.  The EEOC is still able to 


20    

effectuate the public interest by seeking broad-based 


21    

injunctive relief.  The EEOC is still able to get an 


22    

injunction telling an employer that you are to certain 


23    

things with the way you run your business.  The EEOC still 


24    

has the opportunity to tell an employer that you must 


25    

report back to us on a regular basis to tell us how you're

 2    

Injunctive relief is not a toothless remedy. 


 3              

But I will -- I will say one other thing. 


 4              

QUESTION:  Excuse me.  Does it have to wait for 


 5    

the -- for the arbitration to be completed before it 


 6    

brings such a suit? 


 7              

MR. GORDON:  Before the EEOC brings a public --


 8              

QUESTION:  Before it brings such a suit based 


 9    

upon the violation against an employee who has signed an 


10    

arbitration agreement. 


11              

MR. GORDON:  No, Your Honor.  It could -- it 


12    

could file its own action for broad-based injunctive 


13    

relief if it wished. 


14              

QUESTION:  And -- and injunctive relief based 


15    

upon the violation that is the same subject as the 


16    

arbitration proceeding. 


17              

MR. GORDON:  It could if there is a pattern and 


18    

practice involved in that scenario. 


19              

QUESTION:  I don't know what you mean. 


20              

MR. GORDON:  Well, if there is a policy, for 


21    

example, that is the root cause of --


22              

QUESTION:  Well, that's fine.  It says that 


23    

policy is reflected in this one instance, and -- and it's 


24    

the same instance that's -- that's before arbitration.

MR. GORDON:  Well, in that case, Your Honor, if 


 2    

the only -- if I'm -- if the only game in town is that Mr. 


 3    

Baker was discriminated against, and that's it, and there 


 4    

are no general -- general -- there's no general relief 


 5    

being sought, we're just mad about the employment decision 


 6    

directed toward him, then if the EEOC was in court just on 


 7    

that theory and was unable to show any broader 


 8    

application, then that -- the court should dismiss that 


 9    

case. 


10              

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Gordon. 


11              

Mr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining. 


12               

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 


13                    

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 


14              

MR. CLEMENT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 


15              

I want to first pick up on Justice Souter's 


16    

hypothetical about the contempt proceeding.  It seems to 


17    

me that if that were enforced by civil compensatory 


18    

contempt, rather than a criminal contempt action brought 


19    

by the U.S. attorney, that he'd -- he'd have the same 


20    

problem at the end of the day. 


21              

Respondents invoke the proposition that the EEOC 


22    

has to take the victim as we find him.  The problem with 


23    

that is that principle applies with respect to damages 


24    

problems, like a failure to mitigate, that apply to the 


25    

individual employee whether or not he arbitrates or 


52 


ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

 1    

litigates and applies equally to an EEOC enforcement 


 2    

action and to the individual claim. 


 3              

What's so unique about this is that respondent 


 4    

is attempting to take an agreement that does not restrict 


 5    

Baker's ability to get any remedy in the arbitration 


 6    

proceeding and turn it into a restriction on the remedies 


 7    

available to the EEOC in its action. 


 8              

The problem is, this is not, at bottom, a 


 9    

restriction on damages or a problem with remedies.  It is 


10    

a forum selection clause.  And you have a statutory 


11    

structure that allows two people to initiate an action. 


12    

When one of those parties has signed a forum selection 


13    

clause and hasn't even initiated the action, it seems that 


14    

even in the general case there would be no reason to 


15    

restrict the other party's access to forums or their 


16    

remedies.  That would seem to be a fortiori true for a 


17    

statute like Title VII that gives the EEOC a right of 


18    

first refusal over the initiation of the action. 


19              

Another point I'd like to emphasize is that, as 


20    

Justice Stevens made clear, there are currently no suits 


21    

pending against employers in a situation where there has 


22    

been a previous settlement.  In fact, there are only 450 


23    

suits currently in the entirety of the EEOC's docket, and 


24    

I think that puts this case in perspective.  In the 


25    

literally 99 cases out of 100, an employer's arbitration 


53

 1    

agreement will govern and the only Title VII claim that 


 2    

will be brought is the employee's claim in arbitration. 


 3    

In the 1 case out of 100, in the extreme case where 


 4    

there's some important public principle at stake or 


 5    

there's particularly egregious conduct, the EEOC's public 


 6    

enforcement action serves as a valuable safety valve that 


 7    

allows it to preserve the possibility of precedent-setting 


 8    

in public judicial proceedings. 


 9              

The third and final point I'd like to make is 


10    

that whatever the answer is in the settlement context, 


11    

there's absolutely no reason to take a restriction that 


12    

only restricts the available forum and not the remedies 


13    

and turn it into a restriction on remedies but not the 


14    

forum.  Here respondent seeks not only to bind the EEOC to 


15    

the results of an arbitration, but to prevent the EEOC 


16    

from seeking all remedies even when there hasn't been any 


17    

arbitration proceeding initiated at all. 


18              

For those reasons, we ask you to reverse. 


19              

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. 


20    

Clement. 


21              

The case is submitted. 


22

23    

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
