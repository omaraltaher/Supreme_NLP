 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

 MR. ROBERTS:  Thank you.  Mr. Chief Justice,

 To accommodate important pretrial 

proceedings, the Speedy Trial Act contains several 

automatic exclusions from its deadline for commencing 

trial.  This case concerns the exclusion for pretrial 

motions, which excludes the period of delay resulting 

from any pretrial motion from the filing of the motion 

through the conclusion of the hearing on or other prompt 

disposition of such motion. 

 For more than 30 years, the courts of 

19 

appeals had uniformly held that the exclusion applies 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

automatically upon the filing of any motion, regardless 

of its effect on the trial schedule.  The court below 

correctly rejected that established rule, which accords 

with this Court's decisions, is clear and easy to 

administer, and has worked well for over 3 decades.

 The Court's cases construing the exclusion,

Henderson and Bloate, support the established rule. 

They make clear that the exclusion applies automatically 

once a motion is filed without any need for district 

court findings.  Henderson and Bloate cannot be squared 

with the approach of Respondent and the court below. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, all that might 

be true.  On the other hand, the statute does say "delay 

resulting."  And under your approach, the time would be 

excluded even if delay does not result.

 MR. ROBERTS:  No, Your Honor.  Delay refers 

to the interval of time from the filing of the motion 

through its disposition, during which the Speedy Trial 

Act's deadline is tolled.  We know that delay has the 

meaning -- delay can often have the meaning of the 

interval of time between two events. 

 And we know it has that meaning in the 

statute here because subsection (D) tells us so.  It 

defines the period of excludable delay resulting from 

the motion as the time from the filing through the 

disposition of the motion.  Respondent's definition -足

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the Chief Justice says 

only if it -- it's really a circular argument -- only if 

it results in a delay.  Well, suppose it doesn't result 

in a delay?

 MR. ROBERTS:  That's assuming that delay is 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8

referring to delay of the trial, to a postponement in 

the trial.  But delay can't have that meaning because if 

it has that -- if that meaning is inconsistent with 

subsection (D) of the statute's exclusion of the time, 

of saying that delay is the time from the filing of the 

motion through the disposition of the motion, because 

the statute excludes periods of delay. 

 And if delay meant postponement of the 

9 

trial, then the excluded period would be the time during

21

which trial is postponed, but that period is often 

significantly shorter or longer than the time from the 

filing of the motion to the disposition.  And in 

Henderson and Bloate -足

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that doesn't -- that 

prove the point that I think is the concern of the Chief 

Justice's question, that in some cases the delay -足

there's a delay that results and in other cases there 

isn't. 

 MR. ROBERTS:  But, Your Honor, the statute 

excludes the period of delay, and then it says the 

period of delay is the time from the filing through the 

disposition.  If delay -- if delay means postponement of 

the trial, then all that's excluded by the statute in 

the first part is the -- is the time during which trial 

is postponed, but that doesn't match up with subsection 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

(D) because that period is not necessarily the period 

from the filing through the disposition. 

 If I could give you an example.  Say a 

4 

motion is filed 14 days before trial could begin, and 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

13 

14 

15

16

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

the motion takes 16 days to resolve.  Trial is postponed 

only by two days.  And so if delay means the 

postponement of trial, then the period of delay should 

be 2 days, but the statute says that the delay and the 

excludable time is the time from the filing through the 

disposition, which is 16 days. 

 And that's what this Court held in Henderson 

and Bloate, that that's the exact time.  So if you adopt 

a definition of delay for the first part as a triggering 

mechanism that's the postponement of trial, that doesn't 

line up with the rest of the statute. 

 In addition, that would be a totally 

unworkable rule because whether time is excludable would 

turn on a complex and often uncertain analysis of 

whether the motion would or could delay when trial would 

begin, and it's often going to be difficult or 

impossible to make that determination at the time that 

the motion is filed. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Roberts, is there -足

24 

is there any, anything to indicate that what Congress 

25

might have had in mind is that in criminal cases

inevitably there are going to be motions, and so the 

trial judge is likely to set the trial date for after 

that period runs? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, Your Honor.  Sometimes 

trial -- judges might take motions into account in 

setting the trial date and other times they might not 

take the motions into account.  So a rule that -- that 

said the exclusion only applies if the judge moves the 

trial date in response to the motion would lead to 

arbitrary results. 

 It would mean basically that whether time 

was excludable depended on whether the judge took the 

motions into account when it set the trial date 

initially or whether the, whether the judge correctly 

estimated the amount of time.  And also sometimes 

motions may be filed when no trial date is set, so the 

rule would be totally unworkable in that situation. 

 And Respondent, in one of his formulations 

19 

for what the test might be, suggests that a motion 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

wouldn't create excludable delay unless it would 

postpone the hypothetical earliest date on which trial 

could otherwise begin.  That's just a totally unworkable 

rule, because to divine that hypothetical date, courts 

would have to assess the effect of multiple different 

factors that could affect when trial would begin, such

as:  How much time do the parties and the counsel need 

for factual investigation and legal analysis?  How long 

is discovery going to take? 

 There would be numerous questions that would 

arise about how to apply those factors.  For example, 

the courts would have to decide:  Should they take 

potential obstacles to an earlier trial as given, or 

should they instead think about whether those obstacles 

could be eliminated?  The courts would also have to 

figure out what to do if the earliest possible trial 

date changed between when the motion was filed and when 

the motion was resolved.  And how would they take into 

account other periods of time that might exclude 

delay -- might exclude -- that might be excludable also?

 For example, say a court gets two motions 

filed at the same time.  Trial could start in 5 days 

absent the motion.  One motion's going to take 3 days to 

resolve; the other motion's going to take 4 days to 

resolve.  What's the court supposed to do?  Is one -- is 

the 3-day motion excluded?  Is the 4-day motion 

excluded?  Are both of the motions excluded?  Does it 

depend on the order in which the court decides them?  It 

just is not possible for a court to make these 

determinations.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You said at the outset

that things have been working fine.  Of course, the 

whole point of the Act was to hold district judges to a 

pretty strict standard, and the concern is that there 

might be a very complex case the judge just really wants 

to put off as long as possible and will continue to 

accept motion after motion.  Is there anything I can -足

I can read or consult to show that this has been working 

very well and that there's not a problem? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, I -- I can't point to 

anything particular, but there's been no outcry that -足

that there's been a problem from pretrial motions being 

filed as a -- as an attempt to extend the Speedy Trial 

Act deadline.  The court's been -- the -- Congress has 

reviewed the Speedy Trial Act's operation in the past. 

It made changes in 1979 to address problems that have 

occurred.  It hasn't felt the need to address this 

problem since, and there's no evidence of any abuse of 

the automatic exclusion on the other side. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, on that issue, 

do you accept the First Circuit's rule in U.S. v. Hood 

that if the government is found to be attempting to 

frustrate the operation of the Speedy Trial Act, that 

those motions and their delays won't be counted? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, first, Your Honor, I 

don't think that -- that Hood adopted any such rule.

 MR. ROBERTS:  It suggests that there might 

be that qualification.  I think that the statute 

provides that the -- that any pretrial motion tolls the 

deadline, regardless of the purpose for which it's 

filed.  But, of course, if -- in the unlikely event that 

a prosecutor did file a motion solely to extend the 

deadline and avoid proceeding to trial, that conduct 

would be sanctionable under -- under the Act, under 

section 3162(b)(4). 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Sanctionable against the 

14 

government, or -足

15

MR. ROBERTS:  The attorney could be 

16 

sanctioned for that. 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How does that help a 

18 

defendant whose speedy trial rights have been violated? 

19

20

21

23

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, the -- the court doesn't 

need to put off trial just because time is excluded, 

Your Honor, and the court has other mechanisms that it 

can use -足

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You haven't answered my 

24 

question.  The rights that this statute protects are the 

25

rights to have your trial start within 70 days absent or

extended to these exclusions.  If the government 

frustrates that and makes the trial start later, why 

shouldn't a defendant have the benefit of the Act and 

have the indictment dismissed with or without prejudice?

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, the statute provides the 

circumstances in which time is excludable and in which 

time is not, and it doesn't create an exception for 

certain kinds of motions.  It applies to any pretrial 

motion.  But I have to say, there's been no evidence 

over the 30 years that anything like this is happening, 

and in Hood itself, the motion was filed by defense 

counsel, and the court was simply saying that this is 

not -- that that's not what's going on here, there's no 

suggestion that this motion is part of a process to try 

to frustrate the Act.  There's -- the problem just 

16 

hasn't arisen.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I hope you 

won't sit down without addressing the (h)(1)(F) issue 

and explain why we shouldn't reach it, because the issue 

is, as I see it, one of law, not like Nobles, one of 

discretion.  And although you say it's unimportant 

because of a change in Rule 45, how could any criminal 

conviction that's inappropriate be unimportant to the 

defendant or insignificant enough for this Court to 

address the question once the case is before us?

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, the Court -- the Court 

does decline to address questions if it doesn't consider 

them of sufficient importance to -- general importance 

to warrant a review.  Nobles is one example.  There are 

others cited in Stern and Gressman.  But the reason that 

this issue is not of any ongoing importance is that the 

rules have been amended.  It now expressly applies to 

statutes like this one that don't specify a method for 

counting time.

 And, you know, turning to the merits of the 

issue, also -- one other point on the importance of it. 

The circuits all have adopted the same approach as the 

Court of Appeals here, and -足

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Two?  How many 

circuits are we talking about? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Two other circuits, but there 

17 

aren't any that have -- that have held to the contrary. 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If we were to decide this 

19 

based on subsection (F) involving the counting of 10

days, wouldn't that render our decision on anything that 

21 

we had to say about subsection (D) dictum? 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. ROBERTS:  I don't think it would render 

it dictum, Your Honor.  The Court can address issues 

in -- in whatever order it chooses to, and it doesn't 

mean that the -- the decisions that you make along the

way aren't precedential and binding if they're part of 

the rationale to get there.  But we would -- we don't 

think -足

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not part of the 

rationale.  The rationale for our decision would be 

(h)(1)(D) alone, and all the other discussion would be 

perfectly gratuitous, because we're going to set this 

individual free anyway.  To say, well, this other thing 

is not a good reason to set them free, but this one is, 

10

I mean, that -- the former is just utterly irrelevant to 

11 

our decision. 

12

13 

14 

15

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, Your Honor, the 

Respondent offered this argument as a ground not to 

grant certiorari in its -- in his brief in opposition. 

The Court nonetheless took the case.  The circuits are 

16 

divided on this -- this issue -足

if you think so and you think that that's a reason -足

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm sure it's not 

24 

impermissible, but I'm also sure that if we do it, what 

25

we say about the ground for which we took the case would 

13

so.

10

11 

12

 MR. ROBERTS:  I'm not trying to argue you

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it because,

problem since the amendment to Rule 45, it's calendar 

days, and so there's no problem, and so what you're 

suggesting is we would not have granted cert on that 

question? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Exactly.  You wouldn't have 

granted cert on the question.  It's of no continuing 

importance.  It's not going to affect cases going 

forward, and there's no reason for the Court to reach 

out and decide it.  In any event, the court of appeals 

correctly decided the question.  The -- the statute 

doesn't specify whether the 10 days are calendar days or

business days, and it's therefore reasonable to infer 

that Congress expected that the -- that the courts would 

interpret the provision in accordance with the counting 

rules that are applicable in similar criminal contexts.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It -- it may be 

pertinent on this question:  Mr. Tinklenberg was 

designated for transfer to MCC in Chicago on November 

10th.  How was that done?  Was that done by -- is that a 

court order or is that an administrative -足

MR. ROBERTS:  I believe what happened is the 

court ordered -- the court ordered on the 2nd that there 

should be a competency examination.  On the 10th, the -足

the BOP designated that the MCC would be where the 

competency examination -足

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the BOP did it, 

16 

not a court? 

17

18

 MR. ROBERTS:  -- would take place. 

 Yes.  And on then the 10th was, as it turns 

19 

out, was a Thursday before Veterans Day.  Then there was 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

Veterans Day, and November 12th and 13th were the 

weekend.  So on the next Monday the Marshals Service 

asked the Justice Transportation Service to transport 

the defendant.  But the way these things worked is that 

when there are interdistrict transportation, they use 

airlifts that go around the country; and the airlifts go

the last court order before he was moved was on the 2nd. 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is -- is it right that the 

Rules Committee then changed it, and it basically said 

the way the defendant here thinks it should be is that's 

what it should be?  Isn't that what happened?

advantage of that? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Because at the time, that 

wasn't -- at the time that -- that the transportation 

was done then -足

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I know it was under a 

different rule.  But where -- normally with cases where 

you have a new rule come in, it does apply to the 

advantage of the people who were then on appeal.  Is 

there something special about this, that Federal rules 

don't, or you just -- too bad, we thought it was a 

really erroneous thing that they had, we used to have, 

and we've corrected it, but just -- he's still on 

appeal, it doesn't apply to him?  Is there some law on 

that? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  I think -- I think that -足

that at the time that was the method that -- that

His case is still on appeal.  Why shouldn't he get the

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  May I suggest that perhaps 

the reason not to do it is, assuming this person was 

treated entirely fairly on the basis of the law that 

existed at the time, the consequence of what Justice 

Breyer proposes is to set free someone who has been duly 

21 

convicted of a crime. 

22

 MR. ROBERTS:  That's right. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And to do that simply

because, although the -- the process was perfectly fair

nonapplicability of this rule to this case.  The rule by 

its terms applies to computing any period of time 

specified in these rules, any local rule or any court 

order.  None of that includes the statute at issue here, 

correct? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, Your Honor.  Our argument 

17 

is not that the rule by its terms applies. 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So this whole debate

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I think you don't. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Will you like the way 

we're going if I accept your proposition that when 

Congress uses 10 days, it really means 10 business days? 

I take words in a statute like that at their plain 

meaning.  It says 10 days, not 10 business days.  So -足

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, Your Honor, I think that 

there's no plain meaning.  "Days" sometimes can mean 

business days; they can sometimes mean calendar days, 

and as I said before -足

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But Congress has used 10

used business days or not.  Respondent does point out 

that there are some statutes that contain specific 

exclusions of weekends and holidays, but those statutes

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Let's go back to -- I 

don't think you should have been so happy with the way 

the argument was going -足

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- because -- because 

your view is, Rule 40 -- if it's always assumed that 

there be conformity between Rule 45 -- Rule 45, it was 

business days, and then rule 45 changed not only to say 

calendar days, but included statutes for the first time.

 So I think what you're saying is that the 

interpretation of the statute tracks with Rule 45, Rule 

45 formerly was calendar -- was business days, it is now 

calendar days, there is conformity.  And plus, "statute" 

is in Rule 45, and that was at least laid on the table 

of Congress, so they know that it was there. 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think that 

-- that the statute always meant the same thing, and 

that it meant that 10 days should be interpreted in 

light of whatever the background rule is at the time for 

counting the time.  And so there's no -- there's no new 

rule; at the time the 10 days meant exclude the weekends 

and holidays, and now because the background rule has 

changed, it means count the weekends, and -足

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So Congress changed its 

mind between the two rules?

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, I think that -- that my 

point is that when it doesn't specify whether it's 

business or calendar days, that Congress anticipated the 

courts would say, okay, let's look to the background 

rule; and the place, the sensible place to look to the 

background rule is the rule -- is a rule of criminal 

procedure in analogous contexts. 

 In fact, courts frequently do that when 

they're trying to interpret statutes to figure out what 

the 10-day limit is/ as many of the -- many of the cases 

cited in the ALR article that Respondent cites show.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  When you're trying -- when 

you're trying to figure out -- when you're dealing with 

procedural rules that involve filing things in court, it 

was once thought to make sense to exclude weekends 

because things couldn't be filed on the weekends, but 

when you're talking about transporting a prisoner.  What

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, Your Honor, generally the 

flights don't occur on the weekends or holidays.  That 

was sort of what I was trying to explain in my extended 

digression to the Chief -- to the Chief Justice before. 

 The BOP doesn't admit and discharge 

prisoners on the weekends.  In addition, there are 

various other factors that -- that go into the need to 

have two -- two deputy marshals transporting people.  So 

the transportation doesn't generally occur on the 

weekends.  And it's because of the weekends and holidays 

that the transportation of the defendant actually took 

the amount of time that it -- that it did here. 

 But I would say, as I started, in urging you 

not to address this issue, which is of no ongoing 

importance, that the question that we did ask the Court 

to address and that the Court granted review on is a 

very important question that's divided the circuits; and 

that allowing the rule that the court below adopted to 

continue to stand could frustrate the application of the 

24

Speedy Trial Act, not only with respect to the pretrial 

motions exclusion but potentially with respect to all 

the other automatic exclusions; and I think it's very 

important that the Court correct this error and reaffirm 

the established rule. 

 If I could reserve the remainder of my time

for rebuttal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 Before turning to the substance, I would 

like to, if I may, start with the procedural question 

that Justice Sotomayor raised and that -- and that my 

opponent just completed with, because I want to be sure 

there's no confusion on the posture of this case. 

 In particular, this Court's precedents 

squarely reject the notion that there's any history in 

this Court's precedents for refusing to reach an 

argument in this posture.  In particular, in Langness v. 

Green, 282 U.S. 531, this Court held in 1931 that a 

Respondent's, quote, "right" to defend a judgment below 

on a ground that is properly preserved all along and 

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

that the lower court reached and rejected is, quote, 

"beyond successful challenge." 

 Now, I'm not sure -- I'm not aware of any 

4 

exception from that rule in the 80 years since.

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose the petition here 

had simply raised one question, and that is the question 

of how you count time under -- under a version of Rule 

45 of the Federal Rules Of Criminal Procedure that is 

not -- no longer in effect and as to which there is no 

10

conflict in the circuits.  How would you grade the 

11 

chances of the Court taking cert on that? 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 MR. FISHER:  Well, I'll take your 

hypothetical, Justice Alito, but I do want to be able to 

correct the notion that it's of no longer continuing 

importance.  But I'll assume that your hypothetical on 

that kind of a question would be cert denied.  But 

that's never been an obstacle to reaching the question. 

 Let me give you two things that are very 

19 

important here.  The first is the problem with the 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

Government's citation to Nobles is not just a 

distinction between discretion and law.  If you look at 

the Solicitor General's own reply brief in that case, it 

pointed out that the problem with the alternative 

argument there was that it would give the defendant 

different relief.  So it was therefore subject to the 

26
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8

cross-petitions rule, and that's the section in Stern 

and Gressman that's cited in their brief.  Those are the 

only two citations they have, the citations to Nobles 

and the citations to Stern and Gressman, which are all 

about cross-petitions when the defendant wants different 

relief.  We want exactly the same relief.  We want a 

dismissal on the Speedy Trial Act. 

 So finally, even if it were somehow 

9 

discretionary and this Court were to consider in this 

10

11 

12 

13

case breaking from its unbroken precedent of 80 years -足

let me give you one more example before I turn to the 

discretionary. 

 In the Walling case in 1947, this Court 

14 

reached as an alternative ground the defendant's 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

argument that there was insufficient evidence.  Now, 

that's sort of the quintessential un-cert-worthy 

question, but this Court felt required to reach it 

because the lower court had reached it and rejected it 

and the defendant had preserved it all along in that 

case. 

 And in the Union Pacific case in 2009 -- I 

can keep giving you citations.  But let me just say, 

even if it were discretionary, you would still want to 

reach it in this case, because at pages 18 and 19 of the 

Solicitor General's brief there are citations to a 

27
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

circuit split on this issue.  And the new Rule 45 hasn't 

made that go away for two reasons. 

 The first is because the Solicitor General's 

4 

own argument now doesn't depend on Rule 45.  Instead, 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

it's that the Speedy Trial Act on its own terms counts 

10 business days, not simply calendar days.  And, 

second, there continue to be decisions after the 

amendment of Rule 45 in which lower courts have said 

that this provision means only 10 business days.

 Let me give you one more citation, and 

forgive me for this because we didn't get to file a 

reply brief in this case on this issue.  But the Zabawa 

case, 2010 Westlaw, 307-5044, is a case in the Eastern 

District of Michigan last summer where the Government's 

own filing, which we looked at on PACER, asked the court 

to apply Tinklenberg and hold that subsection (F) meant 

only ten business days. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If I could just come back to 

19 

where you started before you go on to these additional 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

points.  Your argument is that if the Government 

petitions for cert on one issue that's a legal issue on 

which there's a conflict in the circuits and the 

Respondent in a criminal case says that the -- asks to 

have the decision below affirmed on 15 other grounds, we 

-- and raises those in the bio, we take the case anyway, 

28
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

we are duty-bound to decide every one of those 15 

grounds? 

 MR. FISHER:  You're not duty-bound to decide 

4 

it, Justice Alito.  But I do think under this Court's 

5

6 

7 

8

12 

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

precedent, at least, you have never reversed the 

decision below without reaching them.  So you may well 

affirm on the question presented or some one or two of 

those questions.  You may also dismiss the case as 

improvidently granted, which happens sometimes in these 

circumstances.  Of course, what ordinarily what would 

happen is when the cert -- when the ops was filed this 

Court would realize there was a serious obstacle to 

reaching the question and might well deny cert in the 

first place.  But as I said, there's no decision on this 

Court's books and certainly the Solicitor General hasn't 

appointed one where you've reversed and reinstated a 

conviction or, in fact, reversed and done anything to a 

Respondent in these circumstances. 

 Now, let me turn to the merits of the ten 

day argument and make a few points before I'm sure the 

Court might want to talk about the pretrial motions 

issue as well.  There's a few important points to make. 

Now, remember, the Solicitor General has now basically 

abandoned the Sixth Circuit's view that Rule 45 

automatically gets incorporated into the Speedy Trial 

29

Act and now they're making the making the argument that 

what Congress intended in the Speedy Trial Act was 

somehow for Rule 45 to operate as some background 

principle.  So that the meaning of the Act, I guess, 

would wax and wane according to what Rule 45 said.  Now, 

there's two versions of this argument.  I can't tell 

which it's making.  First it could be saying that what 

Congress meant when it passed subsection F in 1979 was 

that whatever the rule is in Rule 45 right now, that's 

what we expect to be applied.  Well, that can't possibly 

be the Solicitor General's argument because in 1979 Rule 

45, consistent with the traditional rule, excluded 

weekends and holidays only for periods of less than 

seven days.  That wasn't changed until 1985.  So the 

Congress at the time, even if they had cared about Rule 

45, wouldn't have, wouldn't have thought you counted, 

excluded weekends and holidays here. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why wouldn't Congress 

19 

think, we have a bunch of statutes that have times and 

20

21 

22 

23

we have a bunch that don't and the ones that don't, they 

should be interpreted into the Federal rule, that Rule 

45? 

 MR. FISHER:  I think the much more natural 

24 

reading, Justice Ginsburg, in light of the traditional 

25

rule, which is not just cited in Am. Jur., please

understand, this is a cannon of common law, traditional 

construction of time periods that goes back to 

Sutherland's treatise in 1904.  There's a Second Circuit 

case called Morasca in 1921, 277 F.2727, I could cite 

you 20 or 30 state cases all up and down the last 

century.  So the common law rule has always been for 

periods of less than seven days -- I'm sorry, for 

periods of more than seven days, it's up to the 

legislature to expressly tell the court to exclude 

weekends and holidays.  And if you look at the U.S. 

Code, it's perfectly consistent with that common law 

understanding because when Congress wanted, such as in 

the Bail Reform Act, to exclude weekends and holidays 

from a ten day period, it expressly says so.  Now, we 

cited three or four examples in our brief.  Again, this 

is at page 40, 41 of our brief.  I could have cited 15 

or 20.  So the U.S. Code is quite clear and I think the 

much more natural inference its that when Congress 

wanted to exclude weekends and holidays consistent with 

the traditional rule, it felt duty bound to say so in 

the U.S. Code, and when it hasn't, it wants simply 

calendar days -- now, if you want confirmation. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Under the 2009 amendment, 

24 

Rule 45 includes statutes it didn't before and now it 

25

does? 

31

 MR. FISHER:  It does now, but two things are 

telling about the 2009 amendments.  The first is that 

when it switched to statutes, it reverted to counting 

calendar days.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're not relying on the

 MR. FISHER:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Regardless of the 2009? 

 MR. FISHER:  That's right, that's right. 

But if you want to talk about Congressional intent, I 

don't think we have to even go there.  But, remember, 

after the -- in 2009 there's also a Federal law, the 

Technical Amendments Statutory Act made a hash of that. 

But Congress went through, most recently about a year 

and a half ago, and amended various provisions of the 

U.S. Code according to whether it wanted weekends or 

holidays excluded or times enlarged, and it left this 

alone.  So I think every indicia of evidence you can 

look at from every possible angle shows that ten days 

meant ten days at the time of the trial, and that's not 

to affirm the judgment.

 The last point I'll make concerning -足

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Congress thought about the 

Speedy Trial Act when it made those technical 

amendments, isn't it likely to have thought the courts 

had interpreted it as excluding the weekends up to that 

point? 

 MR. FISHER:  No, my point, Justice Alito, is 

Congress didn't think of the Speedy Trial Act, it didn't 

do anything with the Speedy Trial Act. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Didn't think about -- okay.

 MR. FISHER:  Well, maybe we leave that where 

it was, but let me make one final point that I think is 

the clincher here.  Remember, we have not just this 

alternative argument, we have a second alternative 

argument, which is that the time in relation to Mr. 

Tinklenberg's competency hearing exceeded the 30 day 

provision in section 4247 in the Insanity Defense Reform 

Act.  Now, I don't think you have to get to that 

argument, you can simply affirm on the ten day issue, 

but, again, let's think about what the Solicitor General 

is arguing with respect to the ten day issue.  They're 

saying that Congress sub silentio, without saying 

anything at all in the Speedy Trial Act, somehow assumed 

that the time in subsection F would wax and wane 

according to this rule.  Well, if that's -- even though 

the rule didn't even apply to statutes at the time.

Well, if that's the case, then I don't think there's any 

basis for arguing that Congress would have had exactly 

the same assumption with respect to another Federal 

statute, that is the Insanity Defense Reform Act.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And if we don't 

agree with you on your Rule 45 argument, you say we 

would have to reach this third argument, right? 

 MR. FISHER:  Yes.  So I think the only 

9 

way -- somehow, you've accepted the Solicitor General's

argument, which I don't think you can, but if you did 

accept it on merits, it runs headlong into our third 

argument, which the Solicitor General takes exactly the 

opposite position, which is, the Speedy Trial Act is its 

own self-contained universe that doesn't incorporate any 

other statutes or any other provisions of law. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why aren't they 

trying -- why isn't the effect of what you're doing to 

prompt us to dismiss this case that the petitioner has 

improvidently granted?  If we were to write an opinion 

that says that the -- the Sixth Circuit was wrong in its 

interpretation of subsection (f), and therefore, we're 

not going to get to -- and anything we then had to say 

about subsection (d) is just dictum, and that's the 

issue that we took the case to decide, why should we 

keep the case at all?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I think you would be very 

2 

happy if we didn't.

 MR. FISHER:  I think you could do that,

Justice Ginsburg.  I think you could decide based on my

discussion of the Zabawa case.  There's another case 

that postdates the rule 45 amendments, called Clifton, 

out of the Southern District of Mississippi.  So you 

might decide that there's enough of an ongoing question 

here to write an opinion.  You could do either one.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But then you would have 

to -- we would have to wait for another case to decide 

this issue, one which is a split, that is, the delay 

resulting from.  What does that mean? 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I can't stand the 

suspense.  I -- I would like to hear about the delay 

16 

point. 

17

18 

19 

20

21

 MR. FISHER:  Right.  And I think, Justice 

Ginsburg, as to your -- your question, I'll just leave 

it to this Court's best discretion how it wants to 

handle that issue. 

 Now, Justice Kennedy, let me turn to the 

22 

merits. 

23

 We think this is a straightforward case 

24 

where the text dictates the outcome of the case. 

25

Remember, the key words in the statute are "delay 

35

resulting from," and I think the -- I think the ordinary 

meaning, in fact, the only meaning, of "delay" is a 

hindrance to progress or a postponement.  So it's -足

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry to 

interrupt you so early, but what about Justice 

Ginsburg's point, which I understood to be there's 

always delay resulting from these pretrial motions; it's 

just that the district judge takes that into account, 

says, well, I'm going to have a lot of the usual 

10

pretrial motions, so I'm going to set the trial date at 

11 

this point. 

12

15

16

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 So that is delay, when the trial date might 

otherwise have been set, resulting from these pretrial 

motions, and then the -- the statute goes on to tell you 

how you count that delay. 

 MR. FISHER:  That's exactly our argument, 

Mr. Chief Justice.  Our argument is there's two ways you 

can have delay:  One is by the trial date simply being 

moved to accommodate the motion.  The other -- and this 

is where we agree with what the Solicitor General said 

here today, as well as at page 38-39 of his opening 

brief -- delay can also, in the ordinary English 

language, mean that the trial date was originally set to 

accommodate the motions in the way you just described. 

But what the Solicitor General is arguing for is

something much more dramatic than that.  They are 

arguing for an exclusion of the time, even if trial date 

was set irregardless of the motions -足

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How would you ever know 

that?  How would we ever know that, Mr. Fisher?  A trial 

judge that has had a lot of criminal cases knows that 

there's going to be some motions as you get closer to 

trial, but how would we know whether the judge -- this 

particular judge took into account the likelihood of 

motions in setting the trial date or didn't? 

 MR. FISHER:  Well, ordinarily, Justice 

Ginsburg -- remember, this is only a small subset of 

cases.  But in those cases, ordinarily, I would think 

the trial judge would say on the record when the date is 

set.  Now, if it's -- if there's motion practice before 

there's any date that's ever set, the NACDL brief, I 

think, explains how that works in the district in the 

Sixth Circuit right now.  Parties often stipulate or are 

asked to stipulate by the court.  Common sense goes a 

long way in this scenario, Justice Ginsburg.  It's 

21 

obvious. 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why -- why would the 

23 

defendant stipulate? 

24

25

 MR. FISHER:  Pardon me?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why would -- why would a 

37
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

defendant who would benefit from the clock running 

stipulate? 

 MR. FISHER:  Defendants don't always benefit 

4 

from the clock running, Justice Ginsburg.  I think

21 

22 

23 

24

25

there's two reasons why they might stipulate.  One is 

because it might simply be obvious that the motion is of 

sufficient weight and difficulty that it's going to 

consume the court's resources, so why argue something 

that wouldn't have a basis to begin with?

 But I think the NACDL brief is forthright in 

saying, at least at the beginning of criminal cases, 

often defendants find themselves wanting more time, and 

so, again, they don't have the incentive to argue 

against that.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  How do you reconcile your 

argument with the situation in which the motion is 

pending for 30 days, so that's the period from the 

filing until the prompt disposition, and as a result of 

that motion, the trial judge says this has caused -足

this is going to force me, this is going to result in 10 

days' delay in the date on which the case can begin, so 

the trial date is pushed back 10 days?  Now, in that 

situation, how much time is excluded? 

 MR. FISHER:  I think the -- the text of the 

statute allows you to say either 30 or 10.  I think in 

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

7 

8

light of this Court's Henderson decision -- and perhaps 

I think Congress had administrability concerns in mind 

with that last clause -- I think 30 days could be 

excluded.  But if you disagree with me on that and you 

want to have a rigid textual reading of the statute 

resulting from only meaning 10 days, I think that's your 

only other option. 

 Because, if I could ask the Court, or at 

9 

least direct the Court to page 6 of the Solicitor 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

General's reply brief, this is where they give -足

because I think what the government wants to do is pose 

these difficult hypotheticals, and the sort of difficult 

question you just raised, Justice Alito, and have this 

Court respond by saying, oh, we're just going to throw 

the words "delay resulting from" out of the statute. 

Because there's only two definitions, two ways to deal 

with what the Solicitor General offers. 

 First, they say that delay means time, and I 

19 

think ordinary -- in ordinary English language, "delay" 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

means something more than time.  It means postponement. 

So then the fallback argument -- this is the second 

paragraph on page 6 -- is that the occurrence that is 

postponed is the STA's deadline for commencing trial, 

and our suggestion is that that begs the whole question. 

That can't possibly be right, because the whole reason 

39
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

that you're looking to subsection (d) to apply it is to 

ask whether you should exclude the time. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me, but isn't 

4 

that what the statute says?  Meaning, if you look at 

5

6 

7

10

11 

12 

13 

14

19 

20

(h), the beginning paragraph at (h), it says, "The 

following periods of delay shall be excluded in 

computing the time within which the trial of any such 

offense must commence." 

 It's not talking about the delay of the 

trial.  It's talking about the computation of the start 

date for the trial.  So if that's what that commands you 

to do, doesn't -- isn't only the Solicitor General's 

position consistent with that?  It's telling you to take 

the periods of delay and compute the date the trial must 

start by excluding those.  That's the language. 

 MR. FISHER:  I think for two reasons, I 

would disagree, respectfully, Justice Sotomayor.  First 

is, I take that language to say that we're going to now 

tell you all the circumstances under which you exclude 

time, and so if any of these subsections are satisfied, 

21 

you exclude the time.  But the -足

22

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the -足

 MR. FISHER:  -- Solicitor General's argument 

24 

is that you start from the premise.  "Delay resulting 

25

from" means you've already excluded the time.  That's 

40
 

Alderson Reporting Company

the premise.

13

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but that's what 

(h) says; (h) says you compute the start date of the 

trial, when it must start, by excluding all of these 

periods of delay.  It's defining it for you. 

 MR. FISHER:  Well, if -- if there was delay. 

Maybe another example, Justice Sotomayor.  In 

subsection 7, which is at (4)(a) of the government's 

appendix, I think is another way of showing that it 

can't possibly -- even if it weren't begging the 

question, it can't possibly be right.  It has to be 

talking about the trial itself, because this is the 

continuance -- the end of the justice continuance 

section.  And it says, "Any period of delay resulting 

from a continuance granted by a judge on his own 

motion," and blah, blah, blah, "if certain criteria are 

met." 

 Now, it's very clear that in that section, 

19 

"period" -- "period of delay resulting from" can't mean 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

that we've already said that the clock is stopped, 

because there's an "if" clause that gives you certain 

things that have to be satisfied in order to exclude it. 

So I think starting with the very title of the Act we're 

talking about, the Speedy Trial Act, and the -- the idea 

of the words "delay resulting from" can only sensibly 

41
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

mean delay resulting from trial. 

2

3 

4 

5

 And so I think the definition that we've 

given you again, which is, delay results from a trial if 

the trial itself is postponed, or if the trial is set in 

a way that accommodates the motion, is the only way to 

6 

give meaning to the operative words in the statute.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it doesn't matter how 

substantial and important a motion is, whether it was 

your motion to dismiss for Speedy Trial Act reasons or 

the administrative motions here that you say really 

didn't require time?  It doesn't matter; all that 

matters is keeping track from day one, the commencement 

of the trial, as to when the Court is about to set the 

trial date, that it does it at the end of all the 

motions.  That's the only time the court can do it. 

 MR. FISHER:  The distinction between 

administrative and nonadministrative motions, I think, 

doesn't matter in this case because trial wasn't -足

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why wouldn't it matter?

 MR. FISHER:  Well, it would matter, I think, 

Justice Sotomayor, in a circumstance where the trial 

date hadn't been set yet and then was set, and an 

argument might arise -- well, I think we've had this 

dialogue already to some degree.  I didn't -- I expected 

these kinds of motions to be filed.  I knew there was 

42
 

Alderson Reporting Company

going to be a suppression hearing.  We had the whole -足

therefore, I set the trial out.  That would seem to be 

saying this was a nonadministrative matter that I had to 

accommodate.  I don't think a trial judge -- put another 

way, I don't think a trial judge could say I'm setting 

trial date outside the 70-day deadline because I had to 

sign my name to that pro haec vice motion. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, actually it 

9 

happens all the time.  In the "rocket docket" in 

10

11 

12 

13 

14

15

16 

17 

18

Virginia, the court sets a trial date, and you file 

whatever motions you're going to file.  Under your 

theory, until that last motion actually delays the trial 

date, none of those motions exclude time. 

 MR. FISHER:  That may well be correct, but I 

don't know why it would matter, because it doesn't 

matter until you get outside of the 70 days to begin 

with.  So -足

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It matters because the 

19 

trial judges have to know what to do, and while your 

20

reading might fit the language in ordinary English 

21 

better, I think it does. 

22

23 

24 

25

 It's also possible to read those words 

"delay resulting from" as simply referring to a period 

of time; and the statute is saying these periods of time 

are excluded from accounting.  Now, the virtue of that 

43
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

is just what Justice Ginsburg started with; all the 

trial judges know how to do it; the lawyers don't get 

mixed up; and the problem with what you're arguing for, 

in my mind -- if you want to say anything more about it, 

do -- is that it seems very unworkable to strike trying 

6 

to figure out what causes what.

 MR. FISHER:  Let me say a couple things, 

Justice Breyer.  First, with all due respect, I have to 

disagree with your premise that it's possible to read 

the statute the way the Solicitor General wants to read 

it.  Now I'll accept for purposes of responding to your 

question, let's imagine that it were possible to read it 

that way.  I think our rule is not as difficult to 

administer as you think it might be in the -- NACDL 

brief LDY.  And indeed the Solicitor General -- this has 

been the -- this has been the law in -- in the Sixth 

Circuit for 17 months.  They haven't pointed to a single 

dismissal as a result of it. 

 Now let me take the other side, and this 

brings us to the dialogue during Mr. Roberts' argument; 

the Solicitor General's rule isn't so easy, either, 

unless you simply cease caring at all about the Act. 

You could have a perfectly administrable rule that says 

every singly motion, no matter what the circumstances, 

tolls the clock.

22 

23

 But that's not the law in the First Circuit, 

for example.  They're made clear as Justice Sotomayor 

said that if a motion is filed to frustrate the speedy 

trial clock, then we're not going to exclude it; and 

that makes perfect sense.  I mean, look at this case. 

And I'm not going to suggest there was any ill will or 

bad faith in this case; but the facts of the case 

illustrate the problem. 

 On August 1st, trial date was set for August 

14th.  There were 14 days before the trial was going to 

happen.  Yet there were only -- even under the best 

reading there were only 10 days left on the clock.  So 

if no motions had been filed, unquestionably we would 

have a Speedy Trial Act violation.  So the government's 

whole case hinges on the fact that because it filed this 

purely administrative motion to bring a gun into the 

courtroom, a motion I might add that at the pretrial 

conference the judge had already told the government was 

going to be granted, and so I don't know why it couldn't 

have been made at the moment the evidence was 

introduced; and one other administration motion, then 

the Speedy Trial Act isn't violated. 

 And to borrow the Solicitor General's own 

24 

phrase from page 38 of his brief, that outcome bears no 

25

relation to the Act's purpose.  So what you have to do 

45
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

to have, I think, the government's argument be at all 

faithful, even if it were possible under the language -足

have it be at all faithful with the purpose of the Act, 

is to have some kind of exception for motions that 

frustrate, motions that are pretextual, motions that are 

6 

purely administrative, however it would be defined.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why do you think that -足

 MR. FISHER:  And you walk in -足

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- your motion -- I mean, 

the government had administrative motions, but you had a 

Speedy Trial Act motion; and you say that doesn't count, 

either? 

 MR. FISHER:  I -- well, two things, Justice 

14 

Ginsburg.  First of all, we're not relying in this Court 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24

25

on the Speedy Trial Act motion to get us to the Speedy 

Trial Act violation.  The two motions the government 

filed get you to the 70 days, and so we haven't made an 

argument with respect to the Speedy Trial Act.  But if 

we had to, the argument would be -- with regard to that 

motion, would be that it didn't delay trial.  Trial had 

already been set, the Court said this is when we're 

going to trial; trial wasn't moved, and we all went to 

trial.  And so -足

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I don't believe 

I had a trial in my district court days where between 

46
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

the time I had the pretrial conference and the time 

trial started, there wasn't a slew of motions, because 

that's about the time counsel tends to wake up. 

 MR. FISHER:  Yes.

 (Laughter.) 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay?  And -- and decide

that really now they've got to get ready. 

8

9

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

 MR. FISHER:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why should we care 

whether it's an administrative motion or simply to 

clarify the functioning of the trial?  Why should we not 

exclude those times, because those -- those motions, 

whether they're administrative or not, will cause the 

trial to go faster, because issues that would otherwise 

consume the time of the court during trial are being 

16 

resolved before trial. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. FISHER:  I think that might be an 

argument for writing the Speedy Trial Act a different 

way, Justice Sotomayor; but if the question is whether 

the motion delayed trial -- and that's the question that 

the Speedy Trial Act requires the judge to ask and 

answer -- then the administrative piece of paper going 

across the judge's desk when the judge knows ahead of 

time it isn't going to cause any difficult, simply 

doesn't delay trial.

 At page, I believe it's 5 or 6 of the NACDL 

brief, they talk about pretrial conferences.  And they 

say what happens in the Sixth Circuit right now is the 

judge holds the conference; as you say, counsel wakes 

up; and everybody -- and the judge says tell me the 

motions you're going to file.  And the counsel from both 

sides tell the judge what motions are going to be filed, 

and they discuss right then and there whether they're 

going to delay -- whether they're going to cause some 

delay for trial.  And so -足

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Fisher -- delay, you 

make an argument about the meaning of delay.  I am 

troubled by the meaning of the "from the filing of the 

motion" of that clause.  You read that, I think, to mean 

delay resulting from any pretrial moment and not to 

exceed -- right -- the peered of the filing of the 

filing of the motion to the conclusion of the hearing. 

Right?  Isn't that right? 

 MR. FISHER:  I think that's right, and I 

think that's -足

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, where do you -- where 

to you get that "not to exceed"?  It doesn't say not to 

exceed; it says delay resulting from the filing of the 

motion.

 MR. FISHER:  I think the difficulty is with

the word "from," Justice Scalia.  I think it's a tough 

word to know exactly what transition is taking place 

there, but in this Court's Bloate decision, last term, I 

think -- what I'm -- the argument I'm making is 

perfectly consistent with that decision, where it said 

the "from clause" is sort of the boundaries on when 

subsection D applies.  If you're talking about delay 

that a motion caused either after the hearing or before 

the filing, we don't want to hear from you.  But the 

10

from clause tells you if the delay falls within those 

11 

two goalposts, then it's excludable. 

12

way to say it, either, Justice Scalia.  And I said -- in 

my dialogue with Justice Alito, I think that you could 

also say, especially with a little bit of pushing on 

Henderson, that "resulting from" actually gives you a 

specific time period in between those that you have to 

exclude.  But I think that that's the best reading of 

the Act, and again, it's the only one that gives -- that 

gives meaning to the phrase delay resulting from. 

 If I might just say one or two words to 

24 

circle back to where I began, Mr. Tinklenberg urges you 

25

to affirm the Sixth Circuit decision or to dismiss this 

49
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

case as improvidently granted; but what he urges you not 

to do and thinks there's no basis in precedent for 

doing, which is to reverse the lower court without 

reading the alternative arguments; and with all due 

respect, the 10-day argument that we preserved in our 

bio and we fully made in our bottom side brief in this 

case, I think is extraordinarily strong, and it's 

difficult to get around in this case for all the reasons 

I've explained.

 So with that, I'll -- I'll answer any other 

questions this Court has about that argument, because I 

think it's very important.  Otherwise, I'm happy to 

submit the case. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Roberts, you have 3 minutes remaining. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS 

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Thank you, Your Honor. 

 First I would like to stress that the 

government thinks that it's very important that the 

Court address the question that we raised in our cert 

petition, and that the Court granted certiorari to 

answer, on which there's a split in the circuits and 

which we believe that if it's left standing will result 

in serious disruption to the Speedy Trial Act.

 Turning to -- to that question, a few points 

first.  Respondent's definition of delay is plainly 

inconsistent with Henderson which already holds that the 

period of delay that's excludable is the time between 

the filing of the motion and the disposition of the 

motion.  That can't be squared with the notion that 

delay is the period during which trial is postponed. 

 Second, Respondent's definition of delay 

9 

gives delay a different meaning in the first part of the 

10

statute and in subsection D, where this Court's already 

11 

held that it has the meaning that we suggest. 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

 Third, Respondent's test is totally 

unworkable, because you can't tell at the time a motion 

is filed how much time it's going to take to resolve and 

whether trial is going to be postponed.  District Court 

judges have over 500 pending cases on their docket, an 

average District Court judge.  A hundred of them are 

criminal.  The court -- the Speedy Trial Act cannot 

function if the judges are going to have to make a 

complex judicial determination in each case to determine 

21 

whether each motion is excludable. 

22

23 

24 

25

 Respondent says that NACDL says defendants 

won't object or that they'll stipulate to the exclusion 

of time, but NACDL also says that defendants may change 

their mind if the case goes to trial, and if they change 

51
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

their mind and file a motion to dismiss under the Speedy 

Trial Act, their prior failures to object and 

stipulations may very well not be binding because this 

Court held in Zedner that defendants can prospectively 

waive the application of the Act.  And Respondent's 

tests would also throw the established way that the 

Speedy Trial Act has been operating for over 30 years 

into disarray. 

 Turning to whether this Court has to address 

the alternative arguments for affirmance, Nobles plainly 

says that the Court has discretion not to address those 

issues if those issues are not independently worthy of 

certiorari.  It doesn't base that on the fact that 

the -- on the fact that the argument would expand the 

judgment below, and the rule that it's discretionary 

makes sense, because the contrary rule would require the 

court to address numerous issues that are not important 

and -- in every case where they're raised, and would 

also lead the court to either dismiss writs as 

improvidently granted or to address only as dicta 

important issues on which the Court has granted 

certiorari. 

 Finally -足

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So given the choice between 

a dismissal and an affirmance with good dictum about

subsection (d), you would prefer the latter? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, I think that we would 

like the Court to address the issue on which cert was 

granted.  We think it's a very important issue.  We 

think that the courts of appeals would follow it even if 

it might technically be viewed as dicta.  We would think 

that it would be an alternative holding or ratio 

decidendi. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

 (Whereupon, at 12:19 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
