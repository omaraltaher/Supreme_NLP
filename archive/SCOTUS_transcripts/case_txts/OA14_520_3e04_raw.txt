CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next  in  Case  14­520,  Hawkins  v.  the  Community  Bank  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Raymore. 

            

Mr.  Duggan. 

 

              

              

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MR.  DUGGAN 

 

 

 

 

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Persons  who  jointly  and  severally  agree  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

repay  the  applied­for  debt  are  applicants  under  ECOA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that  is  precisely  what  occurred  here.  My  clients 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  required,  in  violation  of  Regulation  B  in  ECOA  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spousal  guarantors,  to  become  jointly  and  severally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liable  to  repay  the  debts  of  their  husbands'  business, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  clearly  qualifies  them  as  applicants  both  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  straightforward  language  of  ECOA,  as  well  as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Regulation  B  that  was  adopted  by  the  regulators. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  this  particular  instance,  as  in  many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit  transactions,  the  real  applicants  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transaction  are  not  a  to­be  formed  limited  liability 

   

 

 

 

 

 

company  or  corporation,  but  the  persons  that  will  stand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  guarantors  behind  that  company.

Reserve  Board  originally,  I  think,  in  1977  take  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposite  position  and  said  explicitly  that  applicant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excludes  guarantors? 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  Your  Honor  ­­ Your  Honor,  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

regard  to  that  position  that  was  taken  by  the  FDIC  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1977,  they  were  responding  to  claims  by  the  industry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  did  not  want  applicants  broadly  defined  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include  guarantors  for  notice  provisions.  And  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

response  to  that,  the  regulation  was  crafted  in  a  way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  did,  in  fact,  address  that  concern,  but  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never  intended  to  eliminate  the  potential  claims  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spousal  guarantors. 

 

            

When  the  case  law  came  down  and  said  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relying  on  the  Regulation  B  of  1977,  according  to  what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  regulators  adopted  then  in  1985  they  said,  we  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mistaken.  We've  been  misinterpreted  about  what  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

intent  was.  We  ­­ we  now  need  to  modify  the  regulation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  make  it  clear  that  those  persons  who  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminated  against  based  on  marital  status  have  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  to  bring  the  claim. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Do  you  have  to  give  notice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ to  guarantors  now? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  No,  you  do  not,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  how  can  that  be?  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  they're  either  applicants  or  they're  not

MR.  DUGGAN:  Well,  I  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  If  they're  applicants,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

applicants. 

            

            

have  to  give  them  notice. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  I  think  the  ­­

    

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  You're  saying  they're 

  

 

 

 

applicants  for  one  purpose,  they're  not  applicants  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another? 

            

            

up? 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  Yeah,  in  this  case  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  The  agency  can  make  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  DUGGAN:  Well,  I  think  the  Court  has 

   

  

 

 

 

 

already  ruled  in  the  Duke  Energy  case  that  regulators, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  appropriate  circumstances,  can  even  take  a  defined 

   

 

 

 

 

 

term  under  the  statute,  in  that  case  the  term 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"modification,"  and  cause  it  to  mean  different  things  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  subsections. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  never  liked  that  case. 

    

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  My  apologies. 

  

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  What  ­­ what  happened  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  Your  Honor,  was  very,  very  reasonable  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulators.  They  came  out  in  1985  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Just  out  of  curiosity,  why

applicant,  right? 

 

            

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  Agreed. 

  

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Why  didn't  PHC  Development 

  

 

 

 

 

sue  and  claim  that  requiring  the  guaranties  was  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  of  the  law? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  At  that  point  in  time,  the  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  that  had  developed  so  far,  and  the  Regulation  B, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  it  clear  that  the  spouses  had  standing  to  bring  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim,  and  the  spouses  were  the  ones  that  asserted  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Why  does  it  matter,  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's  always  somebody  to  bring  a  claim?  In  what  set 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  cases  does  the  answer  to  this  question  matter? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  I  think  it's  important  for 

    

 

 

 

 

several  reasons.  First  of  all,  spouses  who  are  required 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  sign  jointly  and  severally  with  their  husbands' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

businesses  and  their  husbands  are  going  to  undertake 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potential  adverse  credit  consequences  in  the  future. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Let  me  give  you  an  example.  Divorce  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

death  of  the  primary  operator  of  the  business.  If  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wife  has  become  jointly  and  severally  liable  to  repay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  husband's  debt,  she  then  is  going  to  be  strapped 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  his  credit  profile  in  a  business  that  she  never  had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  operational  authority,  that  she  never  was  involved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in,  and  she  wasn't  an  investor  on.  She  was  simply

required  to  sign  because  she  was  the  spouse  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

husband.  And  what's  important  to  understand  in  these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Wait,  wait,  wait.  You  say 

  

  

 

 

 

 

she  was  required  to  sign.  She  wasn't  required  to  sign. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Somebody  put  a  gun  to  her  head?  She  wanted  the  husband 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  get  the  loan,  and  this  was  the  deal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  And  I  think  that's  exactly  what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  regulators  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  but  don't  talk  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  as  she  was  required  to  sign.  She  was  not  required  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sign. 

            

upon  ­­

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  There  was  a  requirement  placed 

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  If  he  ­­ if  he  was  to  get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  loan,  he  had  to  get  her  to  sign,  but  she  was  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  to  sign. 

 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  I'd  agree.  She  signed  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

guaranty  by  virtue  of  a  condition  being  placed  upon  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extension  of  credit  to  her  husband  and  the  lend  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  borrowing  entity.  And  what's  important  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

understand  is  that  in  these  cases,  these  borrowing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entities,  and  in  this  very  case,  which  typifies  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

small  business  organizations,  that,  in  fact,  it's  never 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  the  "to­be  formed  limited  liability  company"

that's  the  borrower,  it's  always  the  guarantors. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  need  to  look  no  farther  than  Doc  79­7, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  1  to  3,  which  is  the  bank's  actual  approval  of  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit  application.  In  that  document,  which  was  a  part 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  trial  court  record,  the  bank,  in  responding  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  own  internal  write­up  on  the  operating  history  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  potential  for  the  entity  to  pay  back  the  debt,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  "nonapplicable."  Financial  projections  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

borrowing  entity?  "Nonapplicable." 

  

 

            

The  precise  reason  to  approve  the  loan,  "I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recommend  approval  of  this  loan  request  based  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial  strength  of  the  guarantors  and  our  collateral 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position."  The  only  collateral  that  was  ever  taken  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  transaction  was  the  collateral  of  the  guarantors. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

To  suggest  that  guarantors  are  not  the  real  applicants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  these  loan  transactions  is  to  be  divorced  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reality.  They  are  the  true  applicants. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Let's  ­­ let's  ­­ let's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

assume  that  I  ­­ I  write  a  letter  of  recommendation  for 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

some  ­­ some  young  woman  who  is  applying  to  a  law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school,  or  to  a  college.  I  would  really  like  her  to  be 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitted,  and  I've  written  a  letter  of  recommendation  to

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Would  anybody  use  the 

  

 

 

 

 

English  language  that  way? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  Well,  I  believe,  in  that 

   

  

 

 

 

context,  that  person  is  not  agreeing  to  become  jointly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  severally  liable  to  pay  the  tuition.  They're  not  ­­

make?  Instead  of  putting  my  financial  solvency  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line,  I  put  my  reputation  on  the  line. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  Well,  I  think  it's  very 

   

  

 

 

 

important,  because  the  regulators  made  a  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

interpretation  under  their  broad  grant  of  authority  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  they're  required,  when  a  condition  is  placed  upon 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  approval,  that  they  have  to  come  forward  and  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contractually  obligated  to  repay  the  applied­for  debt, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  an  applicant.

statements,  repaying  the  debt,  paying  their  debts  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time,  honoring  all  their  obligations  with  the  lender.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And,  therefore,  what  is  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  context  of  the  guarantor  of  a  loan  that  makes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  reasonable  in  that  context  to  call  that  person  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant? 

            

directly. 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  Let  me  answer  that  question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  I  don't  agree  with 

   

  

 

 

 

the  hypothesis.  Why  do  you  accept  the  hypothesis?  What 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  means  depends  upon  the  ­­ upon  the  context?  It  means 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  it  means.  Now,  whether  the  person  is  an  applicant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  understood  meaning  of  "applicant,"  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depends  upon  the  context,  but  the  meaning  of  the  word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  change. 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  May  I  address  the  questions, 

   

  

 

 

 

Mr.  Chief  Justice?

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  That's  all  right

appeal  to  a  request.  And  in  this  particular  case,  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe  that  anybody  who  signs  a  written  contract  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  I  have  independent  obligations  to  perform  under  my

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Under  your  ­­ under  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

view  ­­ let  me  understand  the  theory  of  the  case.  Let's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  you  prevail,  that  a  guarantor  is  an  applicant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  there  is  a  violation  of  the  duty  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantor  and  that  there  are  five  guarantors.  Can  each 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  five  guarantors  bring  a  separate  suit  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

punitive  damages?  And  also  ­­ this  is  also  part  of  my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  ­­ can  the  loan  be  declared  unenforceable? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  No,  the  loan  cannot  be  declared 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unenforceable  under  the  laws  that  exist  today.  The  only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing  that  could  be  declared  unenforceable  would  be  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spousal  guaranties  which  are  deemed  illegal  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Regulation  B.  Not  all  of  the  guarantors  can  bring  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  The  husbands  can  only  bring  a  claim  to  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent  they  suffer  damage  as  a  result  of  their  wives 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  required  to  be  guarantors  on  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Chief  Justice,  I  see  that  my  time  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited.  I  may  like  to  reserve  the  remainder  for 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

rebuttal,  if  there  are  no  further  questions.

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  BRIAN  H.  FLETCHER 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

For  30  years,  Regulation  B  has  provided  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

guarantors,  cosigners,  and  other  similar  parties  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit  transactions,  qualify  as  applicants,  are  entitled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  protection  from  discrimination  under  the  Equal  Credit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Opportunity  Act  and  the  Additional  Parties  rule.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

longstanding  regulation  is  reasonable,  and  it  reflects  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  interpretation  of  the  Act's  broad  definition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  term  "applicant." 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  we've  been 

  

 

 

 

 

talking  about  applicants  ­­ is  it  ­­ is  the  person  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant  in  the  abstract?  But  one  of  the  important 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  about  context  here  is  there  are  two  terms, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"applicant"  and  "guarantor."  And  that's  the  way  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

always  worked  in  the  industry.  Somebody  in  the  industry 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  not  call  a  guarantor  an  applicant.  The  person  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  guarantor.  So  I  just  wonder  how  we  can  pluck 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"applicant"  out.  Obviously,  in  some  sense,  anybody  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  supporting  the  loan,  you  know,  you  can  describe, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  they're  applying  for  it.  But  there's  a  separate

term,  "guarantor."  And  if  you  ask  somebody,  well,  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  this  person?  Is  this  person  an  applicant?  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  say,  no,  it's  a  guarantor. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Well,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

term  "guarantor"  doesn't  appear  in  the  statute.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  it's  true  that  the  term  "applicant"  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"guarantor"  have  fixed  meanings  in  the  industry  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  could  never  construe  a  guarantor  to  be  an  applicant. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think,  in  fact,  often,  as  we  explain  in  our  brief, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantors  and  cosigners  might  fill  out  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application  and  join  together  in  the  same  application 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  submit  to  the  borrower  in  seeking  the  loan. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  I  ­­ I  don't  think  there's  an  industry 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

understanding  that  you  can't  reasonably  regard  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantor  or  a  cosigner  or  another  secondary  obligor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

who's  playing  that  sort  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Wait.  Do  you  think 

  

  

 

 

 

 

there's  an  industry  understanding  that  there  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantors  and  there  are  applicants?  I  mean,  if  you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

weren't  in  the  industry  and  you're  looking  at  this,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  call  the  Petitioner  an  applicant.  You'd  call 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

her  a  guarantor. 

   

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  I  think  you  ­­ in 

    

 

 

 

 

some  ­­ certainly,  in  some  context,  you  might  use  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  terms  differently.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Wouldn't  you 

  

 

 

call  ­­ wouldn't  you  use  the  word  "borrower"  instead  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant? 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  I  think  certainly  after  the 

    

 

 

 

 

loan  had  been  extended,  you  would  ­­ you  would  use  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

term  "borrower."  But  I  think  if  you  look  at  the  ­­ the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  in  which  Congress  used  the  term,  it  wrote  a  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broad  statute.  It  said,  "It  shall  be  unlawful  for  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor  to  discriminate  against  any  applicant  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  any  aspect  of  a  credit  transaction."  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

then  it  defined  an  applicant  to  be  any  person  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies  to  a  creditor  directly  for  an  extension, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

renewal,  or  continuation  of  credit. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Would  you  disagree  that  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary  speech,  an  applicant  is  understood,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Judge  Colloton  said,  to  be  someone  who  is  asking  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  for  himself  or  herself?  And  if  you  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree  with  that,  could  you  give  me  your  best  example  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  situation  in  ordinary  speech  in  which  the  term 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"applicant"  is  used  to  refer  to  someone  who  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking  for  something  personally? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Justice  Alito,  I  agree  that 

   

  

 

 

 

very  often,  applicant  refers  to  the  person  who's  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  receive  the  thing  that's  being  sought.  I  don't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  though  ­­ and  this  is  what  the  other  side  has  to

that.  Suppose  that  this  child  is  rejected  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

kindergarten,  and  then  the  parent  is  glum  the  next  day

JUSTICE  ALITO:  My  application  was  rejected. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  FLETCHER:  I  think  you  very  well  might. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  if  you  filled  out  the  application,  and  you  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  request,  and  you  were  upset  that  it  was  denied,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it  would  be  perfectly  sensible  to  say  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application  was  denied. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Fletcher,  in  ­­ in  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways,  the  Agency  itself  has  admitted  that  this  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  most  natural  reading  of  the  term.  When  the  Agency 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explained  why  it  was  articulating  this  rule,  it  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  the  problem  is  that  Section  706  of  the  Act  confers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing  to  sue  only  upon  an  aggrieved  applicant.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  we  have  to  come  in  and  kind  of  fix  that.

And  ­­ and  so,  too,  the  regulation  itself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talks  about  applicants  and  additional  parties  as  though 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  two  are  different.  And  then  the  regulation,  as  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  Justice  Scalia  said,  says,  well,  this  ­­ this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  definition  of  applicant,  but  it's  really  only  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  purpose,  not  throughout  the  statute.  And  all  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those,  it  seems  to  me,  are  quasi­admissions  that  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  most  natural  way  to  read  the  word  "applicant." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Justice  Kagan,  I'm  glad  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

brought  that  up  because  I  very  much  disagree  that  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  the  Agency  has  viewed  this.  I  think,  in  particular, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  referred  to  the  way  that  the  Agency  described  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  it  was  making  in  1985,  when  it  amended  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  to  expressly  include  guarantors  for  certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes.  And  you're  right.  They  said,  we're  doing 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  because  courts  have  ruled  guarantors  out  of  court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  the  reason  that  it  said  that  was  not  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believed  that  guarantors  were  unambiguously  excluded  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  or  that  it  was  rewriting  the  statute.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  that  because  between  1977  and  1985,  the  Agency's  own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  had  expressly  said  that  applicants  do  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include  guarantors,  cosigners,  and  other  similar 

 

 

 

 

 

parties.  And  so  the  courts  that  had  said  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantors  didn't  get  to  bring  a  suit  were  pointing  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Agency's  regulation  and  says  this  statute  only

protects  applicants.  And  the  Agency  is  telling  us 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

expressly  that  you  as  a  guarantor  aren't  an  applicant. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

And  so  the  Agency  came  in  in  1985,  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  our  own  regulation,  our  previous  version  of  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation,  which  excluded  guarantors,  is  creating  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem,  and  we  want  to  fix  it  by  defining  them  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicants. 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  But  you  ­­ you  don't  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  solve  a  problem  by  ­­ by  fixing  a  definition.  I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  why  was  it  a  problem?  It  ­­ it  was  not  a  problem 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  applicant  meant  what  the  prior  regulation  said  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meant.  Why  was  that  a  problem? 

   

  

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Well,  I  think  ­­ I  think  it 

   

   

  

 

 

 

was  a  problem  because  it  left  guarantors  who  had  been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

improperly  required  to  sign  loan  documents  without  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy. 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Yeah.  But  that's  what  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

law  read.  I  mean,  if  that's  a  problem,  it  was  a  problem 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  law. 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Well,  that  was  a  problem  with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  Agency's  own  prior  regulation,  which  expressly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excluded  guarantors.  When  the  Agency  ­­ and  let  me  step 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Can  I  just  start?  Why 

   

  

  

 

 

did  you  have  to  pass  the  first  regulation  at  all?  What

caused  you  ­­ if  it  was  as  clear  as  Justice  Scalia 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believes,  why  did  you  need  the  regulation  at  all  saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  doesn't  include? 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  So  if  I  could  just  give  you  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

little  bit  of  the  history  of  how  the  regulation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

developed.  The  Equal  Credit  Opportunity  Act  was  passed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  1974.  When  the  Agency,  the  Federal  Reserve  Board, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  passed  regulations  in  1975,  it  just  incorporated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statutory  definition  of  applicant  in  relevant  part. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  didn't  speak  to  the  guarantor  question  one  way  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another. 

            

But  in  1976,  just  a  year  later,  it  added  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  provision  that  made  clear  that  at  that  time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  1976,  it  regarded  guarantors  as  applicants.  It  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  for  purposes  of  a  provision  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  ­­ and  this  is  something  we  cite  at  Page  7  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  brief  ­­ for  purposes  of  a  provision  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation,  it  required  creditors  to  give  notice  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  credit  decisions  to  applicants.  If  you  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

multiple  applicants,  creditor,  you  can  just  give  notice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  one  of  them.  But  then  the  regulation  provided  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  not  give  that  notice  to  an  applicant  who  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

secondary  obligor,  such  as  a  surety  or  a  guarantor. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  Agency's  first  interpretation  was 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  that  the  ­­ the  plain  language  of  the  statute,

which  had  been  incorporated  into  the  regulation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

included  guarantors. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Isn't  it  correct  that  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

issue  matters  only  where  there  are  adverse  ­­ where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  borrower  and  the  guarantor  have  adverse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests?  And  if  that's  correct,  how  often  does  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arise? 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  So  Justice  Alito,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

it's  particularly  important  where  the  borrower  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantor  have  adverse  interests  for  the  ­­ for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance,  if  there's  been  a  divorce.  And  so  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

spouses'  interests  are  no  longer  aligned.  Then  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  very,  very  important.  But  I  don't  think  it  matters 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  in  those  cases.  And  this  goes  to  ­­ to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  that  Justice  Kagan  raised  earlier,  which  is  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  this  matter? 

 

 

            

And  the  reason  that  it  matters  is  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantor  who's  improperly  required  to  provide  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guaranty  suffers  a  unique  economic  injury  that  is  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

suffered  by  the  applicant.  So  in  ­­ in  a  common  case, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  lender  says,  I  won't  extend  this  loan  without  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

signature  from  your  spouse.  And  everyone  agrees  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  a  violation  of  Regulation  B,  and  everyone  agrees 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that's  not  permitted. 

 

 

 

            

And  if,  in  that  case,  the  spouse  provides

the  signature,  as  often  happens,  then  the  primary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant,  the  borrower,  hasn't  suffered  any  harm  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all.  They've  gotten  the  loan  that  they  wanted.  So  they 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  suffered  discrimination  in  some  sense,  and  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  a  claim  in  some  sense.  But  in  many  cases, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  not  going  to  have  economic  damages  to  assert  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court. 

            

The  guarantor,  on  the  other  hand,  oftentimes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  have  that  obligation  on  her  credit  report 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immediately.  It  could  adversely  affect  her  credit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

scores  immediately.  And  as  we  explain  in  our  brief,  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  default  on  the  underlying  loan,  then  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  a  black  mark  that's  going  to  tarnish  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantor  or  the  cosigner's  credit  going  forward  even  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she  ultimately  pays  the  debt. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  One  of  the  things  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Judge  Posner  said  against  your  interpretation  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  actually  creates  liability  on  a  scale  that  Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  have  expected  because  if  you  are  right,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantor  can  come  in  and  ­­ and  declare  the  entire  loan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalid,  and  ­­ and  the  damages  would  be  much  higher 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  it  is  for  the  borrower  himself.  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's  ­­ what's  the  answer  to  that?

just  like,  well,  that's  what  it  is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Well,  I  think  the  ­­ the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

first  answer  is  that  that  ­­ the  availability  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy  of  allowing  a  guarantor  to  assert  and  actually 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalidate  the  guaranty  that's  been  illegally  required, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  won't  be  resolved  one  way  or  the  other  by  the  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  answered  this  question  today,  which  is  just  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantors  reasonably  regarded  as  applicants  as  they've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  defined  for  30  years? 

 

 

 

 

            

But  ­­ but  I  understand,  though,  why  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  interested  because  it  is  a  related  question  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  remedies  might  guarantors  have  available.  And  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  answer  to  Judge  Posner's  question  in  that  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  there's  nothing  at  all  unreasonable  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requiring  a  lender  that  has  improperly  demanded  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

guaranty  to  not  be  able  to  enjoy  the  benefit  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guaranty.  As  we  explained  at  the  end  of  our  brief, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  been  the  enforcing  agency's  longstanding  policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  the  FDIC  or  the  Federal  Reserve  Board  or  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agencies  conduct  examinations  of  the  books  of  banks  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  they  find  violations  of  the  additional  party's  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  this. 

 

            

The  remedy  that  they  apply  is  to  require  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank  to  release  the  improper  guaranty,  or  in  cases  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I  think  this  is  another  important  point  ­­

Regulation  B  doesn't  prohibit  spousal  signatures  under 

   

 

 

 

 

all  circumstances.  To  the  extent  that  what  the  bank 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants  to  do  is  ensure  that  in  the  event  of  a  default, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  going  to  be  able  to  reach  specific  property  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  primary  applicant  is  relying  on,  it  can  require  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

signature  from  the  spouse,  not  for  personal  liability, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  just  to  allow  it  to  reach  the  property  that  is  being

And  so  if  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  ­­

  

 

 

MR.  FLETCHER:  I  was  just  going  to  say,  so 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  that  case,  I  think  the  proper  remedy  wouldn't  be  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

void  the  loan  altogether.  It  would  be  to  give  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lender  what  it  had  the  right  to  demand,  which  was  a  more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited  instrument. 

 

            

            

I'm  sorry,  Justice  Breyer. 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Can  ­­ can  you  explain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

quickly  ­­ I'm  now  uncertain.  I  accept  the  point  that  I

this  actually  about?

a  borrower,  for  example  ­­ for  example  ­­ by  saying  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you,  the  borrower,  has  to  ­­ have  to  have  a  guarantor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  someone  you're  married  to.

MR.  FLETCHER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  what  the  law  says. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  FLETCHER:  It  says  you  can't 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

discriminate  against  any  applicant  with  respect  to  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspect  of  a  credit  transaction.  Yes. 

   

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  this  has  been 

  

 

 

 

 

interpreted  to  include  you  cannot  say  to  a  married 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  you  have  to  have  the  marriage  ­­ the  spouse  sign. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  That's  correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  So  that's  where 

  

  

 

 

 

 

we  start.  Now,  if  the  applicant  were  just  the  applicant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  credit  himself,  what  would  be  wrong  with  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Then  you'd  say,  well,  the  person  who's  hurt  here  among 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  people  ­­ just  as  if,  for  example,  when  you  run  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

train  into  a  ­­ into  a  wall,  there  are  a  lot  of  people 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

hurt.  So  if  the  person  ­­ namely,  the  spouse  ­­ really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  hurt,  why  does  ­­ why  does  she  have  to  be  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant?  Why  can't  you  just  sue  for  harm  as  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

result  ­­ caused  as  a  result  of  the  forbidden 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination? 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  So  the  statutory  cause  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

action  gives  any  applicant  a  right  to  sue. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  know.  But  why  wouldn't 

    

  

 

 

 

you  sue  if  you're  ­­ if  you're  ­­ if  you're  directly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injured  as  a  result  of  a  ­­ of  an  unlawful  act?  Which

is  what  the  regulation  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  So  ­­ and  I  think  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  has  suggested  that  there  might  be  State  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causes  of  action,  but  I  think  in  terms  of  having  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Not  State,  just  right  under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  statute,  you  say  I  have  suffered  harm,  I  was  about 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  take  this  ticket,  and  everyone  admits  I  would  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken  the  money,  invested  in  the  lottery,  and  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

today  be  a  millionaire.  Hard  to  prove,  but  nonetheless, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

if  proved,  maybe  she  was  hurt.  So  why  can't  she  sue? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Because  the  statute  gives  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

right  to  sue  to  applicant. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  it  doesn't  say  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

okay.  So  you're  ­­

  

 

 

            

aggrieved  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  To  an  aggrieved  ­­ to  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  To  have  gotten  too  far, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  so  your  whole  idea  here  is  say  she's  an  applicant, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too. 

            

            

            

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  then  she  can  sue. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  FLETCHER:  She's  an  applicant. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Now  ­­ now,  it  seems  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe  you're  pushing  the  edge  of  the  word  "applicant"  as

they  did  intend  it  in  the  statute.  That's  ­­ that  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem. 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  On  that  point  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Can  you  give  an  example? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ are  there  places  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ in  this  statute  where  guarantor  and  applicant  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  distinction  that  has  to  be  made?  In  other  words, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  your  view,  does  applicant  include  guarantor  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  part  of  the  statute? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  So  in  our  view,  there's  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

place  where  reading  applicant  to  include  guarantor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  work  or  would  create  a  problem.  What  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Agency  has  done,  when  it  amended  its  regulation  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include  guarantors,  is  it  asked  for  comments  on  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  specific  provisions  of  the  regulation  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantors  should  be  exempted  from.  And  in  response  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  comments,  it  decided  to  exercise  its  broad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rulemaking  authority  to  exempt  them  and  to  not  treat 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  as  applicants  for  purposes  of  other  provisions  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute.  So  I  don't  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Where  ­­ where  does  it  get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  discretion?  I  mean,  it  says  applicant  in  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  When  it  says  applicant,  the  Agency  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion  to  say,  oh,  yeah,  it  says  applicant,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes  we're  going  to  ignore  that.

MR.  FLETCHER:  Yes,  Justice  Scalia.  It's 

  

  

 

 

 

under  the  grant  of  a  rulemaking  authority  which  is  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  1691(b),  subsection  (A). 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Which  says  what? 

  

 

 

 

MR.  FLETCHER:  Which  says  that,  "The  bureau 

  

 

 

 

 

 

shall  prescribe  regulations  to  carry  out  the  purposes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  this"  ­­ "this  subchapter,  and  the  regulations  may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contain,  but  are  not  limited  to,  such  classifications, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differentiation,  or  other  provision  and  may  provide  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  adjustments  and  exceptions  for  any  class  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transaction." 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  have  you  got  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

example?  Any  example  at  all  from  a  magazine  having  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  with  finance,  from  anything  you  can  find  where,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  in  the  context  of  financial  transactions,  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  references  to  a  surety,  a  guarantor,  or  a  mortgage 

   

   

   

 

 

 

insurance,  there  is  a  reference  to  such  a  person  with 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  word  "applicant"? 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  So  here's  my  best  example, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer.  They're  on  Page  24  of  their  brief  ­­ my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief.  And  they  don't  use  the  word  "applicant,"  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  talk  about  who's  regarded  as  receiving  an  extension 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  credit.  And  this  is  our  secondary  argument, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Alito.

someone  who  seeks  something  for  themselves,  we  think  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantor  is  reasonably  regarded  as  seeking  an  extension 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  credit  for  themselves.  As  we  explain  on  page  24  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  brief,  for  purposes  of  the  Fair  Credit  Reporting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act,  lenders  and  other  banks  rely  every  day  on  reading 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Fair  Credit  Reporting  Act  to  mean  that  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  credit  ­­ of  credit,  which  refers  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extension  of  credit,  includes  a  guaranty. 

   

 

 

 

            

The  authority  in  the  Fair  Credit  Reporting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act  that  allows  a  lender,  who  has  a  prospective 

   

   

 

 

 

 

guarantor  before  him,  to  look  at  that  guarantor's  credit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

report  is  a  provision  of  the  Fair  Credit  Reporting  Act 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  says  you  can  pull  the  credit  report  of  someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who's  going  to  receive  an  extension  of  credit  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

connection  with  the  transaction. 

 

 

 

            

And  we  cite  there  a  2001  letter  from  all  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  banking  regulators  that  explains  in  detail  why  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  to  regard  guarantors  and  other  secondary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligors  as  receiving  an  extension  of  credit,  and  why, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  fact,  that's  essential  to  the  effective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administration  of  the  Fair  Credit  Reporting  Act.

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

            

This  is  a  Chevron  step  one  case.  The  FRB 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

gets  to  be  the  sorcerer's  apprentice,  but  not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorcerer.  It's  trying  to  rewrite  the  statute  here,  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

define  ambiguous  terms.  The  government  takes  the  view 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  statute  has  to  unambiguously  exclude 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantors.  That's  the  wrong  starting  point. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

The  question  is  simply:  Is  the  statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguous  with  respect  to  whom  it  covers?  Under  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  view,  every  statutory  definition  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  have  two  parts;  the  part  that  defines  who  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant,  and  part  two  that  says  who's  not  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  McAllister,  I  take  it  if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

there  were  two  borrowers,  you  would  include  both  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them,  both  would  have  a  cause  of  action? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Absolutely.  They're  ­­ if 

  

  

 

 

 

they're  ­­ if  they're  joint  applicants,  the  statute  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  They're  joint  applicants. 

  

 

 

 

MR.  McALLISTER:  ­­ covers  them. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  How  about  if  they're 

  

 

 

 

 

cosigners?  I  take  it  that  ­­ is  ­­ a  co­signer  is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  who's  jointly  and  severally  liable,  but  is

MR.  McALLISTER:  Is  not  an  applicant. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ receiving  the  money. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  McALLISTER:  Exactly.  So  ­­

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  You  would  ­­ you  would  count 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  McALLISTER:  Count  that  out.  They  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

they  are  not  an  applicant.  So  the  statute  refers  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicants,  and  certainly,  the  regs  and  the  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contemplate  the  joint  applicants  who  go  in  together. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  want  the  credit  together,  and  they  have  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligation  to  make  the  repayments,  either  or  both.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  cosigner  is  different. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  this  is  so  even  if  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cosigner  had  to  file  the  exact  same  kind  of  papers  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  everything  else  that  the  borrower  himself  had  to  do? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Exactly.  And  ­­ and  part 

  

  

 

 

 

 

of  that  is  because  of  the  statute's  definition  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit,  which  no  one  has  talked  about.  But  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute's  definition  of  credit,  that  is  defined 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explicitly  just  like  applicant.  And  it's  part  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant  definition.  And  credit  means  a  right  to  defer 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

payment  of  debt.  A  cosigner  and  a  guarantor  never  have 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

a  right  to  defer  payment  of  debt.  If  they  become 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsible,  they  were  responsible  then.  So  what  that

the  person  who's  making  the  regular  payments.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's  encompassed  in  the  statutory  definition. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

 

 

I  would  refer  the  Court  also  to  comparable 

 

 

 

 

civil  rights  statutes  of  this  era.  In  particular,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Truth  in  Lending  Act,  the  Fair  Housing  Act,  the  AIDS 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Discrimination  and  Employment  Act.  All  of  them  use  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word  "person"  to  describe  who  can  bring  a  claim.  In  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ECOA,  Congress  very  deliberately  chose  something 

 

 

 

 

 

narrower,  and  not  only  did  it  choose  it,  but  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expressly  defined  it  in  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  describe  this  as  a  gateway  provision. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

We  don't  argue  that  the  Fed  doesn't  have  broad  authority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  many  respects  in  implementing  the  ECOA.  But  what  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  have  the  authority  to  do  is  to  rewrite  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  definition  that  Congress  very  deliberately  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precisely  put  in  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  suppose  ­­ suppose  that  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  credit  card,  and  now  I  get  married,  and  I'd  like

MR.  McALLISTER:  Well,  I  think  you  are  still

direct  benefit,  the  credit  is  actually  given  to  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spouse  now? 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Well,  if  they  have  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ability  to  charge  on  the  account  same  as  you,  then  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess  they  would,  in  effect,  become  a  joint  applicant  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  point  in  time. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  They  would  effectively 

  

 

 

 

become  a  joint  applicant,  even  though  I'm  the  only  one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who's  filling  out  the  ­­ the  ­­ all  the  papers. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  But  the  statute 

  

 

 

 

contemplates  that  there  can  be  situations  in  which  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third­party  requests  credit  on  behalf  of  another,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  another  reason  why  we  think  guarantors  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

included  because  it  is  contemplating,  for  example,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parent  who  goes  in,  says  I  want  to  arrange  a  loan  for  my 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

son  or  daughter  to  buy  their  first  car.  The  son  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

daughter  is  actually  ultimately  going  to  be  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant.  The  parent  may  well  be  a  cosigner.  The 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

parent  may  initiate  the  transaction,  but  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recipient  of  the  credit,  the  right  to  defer  payment  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  debt,  is  an  applicant. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  guess  ­­ I  guess  ­­ you 

    

   

 

 

 

 

know  ­­ and  this  is  a  ­­ a  functional  point  for  sure. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  it  doesn't  seem  to  make  a  whole  lot  of  sense  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppose  a  lender  doesn't  want  to  provide  credit  to  a

married  woman  because  it  has  all  these  sex,  gender 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stereotypes  in  the  lender's  head  or  ­­ and  the  lender 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  require  that  the  ­­ that  the  husband  be  listed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  ­­ a  joint  applicant,  but  could  require  that  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

husband  be  listed  as  a  cosigner,  even  though  the  effect 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  those  two  things  are  exactly  the  same,  which  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  requirement  that  the  spouse  essentially  become 

   

 

 

 

 

 

joint  and  severally  liable  for  the  loan. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Well,  I  ­­ I  don't  think 

   

   

  

 

 

there  is  a  difference.  I  think  the  cosigner  is  in  the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  category  as  the  guarantor.  But  here's  ­­ here's  my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental  answer  to  your  question,  Justice  Kagan,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  purpose  of  this  statute  is  abundantly  evident.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  we  think,  but  if  you  look  at  the  legislative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history,  the  point  was  to  get  the  credit  in  the  hands  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  who  were  being  denied,  in  particular,  women. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  is  the  applicant.  So  the  way  the  statute  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended  to  work,  and  works  just  fine  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  applicant  we  use,  is  to  say  when  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  shows  up,  and  the  bank  says,  oh,  no  credit  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  unless  a  spouse  signs,  the  violation  has  occurred 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

then.  And  the  discrimination  is  against  the  person  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted  to  borrow  the  money.  The  government  may  wish 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  discriminatory  provisions  were  broader  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  but  that's  the  way  the  statute  works.

So  the  applicant  has  a  claim,  the  borrower 

   

 

 

 

 

 

who  is  told  you  need  more  signatures  ­­ otherwise,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  imagine  scenarios  ­­ I  think  one  of  the  amicus 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs  spins  out  one  where,  say,  the  person  comes  in  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  bank  says,  I  need  ­­ because  you're  of  a  certain 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

religion  or  a  certain  race,  I  need  15  guarantors  for 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

your  ­­ well,  all  15  guarantors  can  simply  say  no,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  their  view,  all  15  guarantors  actually  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  under  the  ECOA.  And  that  just  makes  no  sense. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  far  beyond  what  Congress  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  not  ­­ that's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

quite  accurate,  because  the  only  person  who's  given  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  not  to  be  discriminated  against  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant  ­­ an  applicant  on  the  basis  of  marital 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

status. 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  No,  Your  Honor.  No,  that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

not  true.  I  mean,  the  statute  covers  ­­ covers  marital 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

status,  sex,  religion,  race,  age  even.  So  there  are  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  prohibited  bases.  The  original  statute  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sex  and  marital  status,  but  then  in  1976,  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expanded  to  cover  other  ­­

I'll  guaranty  this  loan.  I  want  you  to  lend  him  $10,000

MR.  McALLISTER:  It  is  ­­ it  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  is  it  ­­ because  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  the  ones  you  said  do  fall  within  applicants?  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  just  ­­

there's  like  sureties,  they're  like  guarantors,  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  a  bunch  of  different  things. 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  None  of  them  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  seemed  to  me  some  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  you  thought  might. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  None  of  them  actually 

  

 

 

 

 

should  be  included.  And  if  I  suggested  that  ­­ ours  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  straightforward  definition  adhering  to  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  can  certainly  have  joint  applicants,  joint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

borrowers,  but  that  means  they  are  receiving  the  benefit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  credit  directly.  Credit  is  flowing  to  them. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why?  I  mean,  the  thing  I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

don't  get  is  why  can't  you  apply?  An  applicant  means  a

apply  for  the  thing  being,  give  some  money  to  this  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person? 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Because,  again,  I  come  back 

   

  

 

 

 

to  the  statutory  definition,  Justice  Breyer,  which  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  are  applying  for  credit.  And  the  statute  defines 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit.  So  it  says  credit  is  the  right  to  defer  payment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  debt. 

   

            

            

And  the  person  who  has  asked  for  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yes.  And  you  say,  I  am 

   

  

  

 

 

 

applying  for  just  that.  And  I  am  applying  for  just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  My  application,  here  it  is,  in  writing,  is  that  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  you  to  do  just  that  for  Smith,  who's  sitting  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

table. 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  And  in  our  view,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute  means  Smith  is  the  applicant.

of  a  word. 

   

            

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Well,  I  come  back  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You've  got  cosigners, 

  

 

 

 

you've  got  parents  who  ­­ who  sign  as  cosigners  rental 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreements  for  their  kids.  They're  not  getting  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit  of  the  apartment.  Nobody  believes  that  they  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using  the  apartment.  They're  doing  it  to  bolster  up  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit  of  their  child. 

 

 

 

            

So  I  don't  know  why  applicant  can't  mean,  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  parlance,  that  you're  asking  for  credit  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extended  to  anyone,  whether  it's  you  or  ­­ or  another

MR.  McALLISTER:  Perhaps  that's  the  key, 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor,  is  that  you're  talking  common 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parlance.  In  my  view,  common  parlance  is  the  definition

The  Fed  put  in  a  ­­ some  language  that  said, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  don't  give  to  ­­ notice  to  applicants  such  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

secondary  obligors,  such  as  guarantors. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  Fed  then,  a  couple  minutes  later, 

   

 

 

 

 

proposed  maybe  we  should  just  make  this  a  general  rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  guarantors  are  included.  They  took  in  notice  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comment,  and  a  few  months  later  they  said,  oh,  we've 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  sort  of  stirred  up  the  pot  here.  Let's  just  make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  that  guarantors  and  secondary  obligors  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

included.  And  that's  why  we  got  the  1976  version. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  ­­ Mr.  McAllister,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Corbin  on  Contracts,  when  they  talk  about  guaranties, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  say,  in  most  cases  of  guaranty  contracts,  the  offer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes  from  the  guarantor  requesting  the  giving  of  credit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  a  principal  debtor. 

   

 

            

So  Corbin  on  Contracts  is  ­­ clearly  thinks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  guarantor  is  a  requestor,  is  an  applicant  for

credit,  and  just  to  a  third­party,  to  the  principal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

debtor. 

            

But  why  ­­ why  ­­ I  mean,  that's  a  pretty, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  credit­specific  definition  of  what  it  means  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  for  credit.  And  including,  pretty  clearly, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

guarantors. 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Well,  that's  ­­ that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  a  ­­ what  Corbin  says.  But  again,  I  would  come 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  to  guarantors  do  not  sign  the  same  document  as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

borrower.  They  are  not  liable  in  the  same  way.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  separate  contract  with  the  lender,  which  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

borrower  is  not  even  party  to  the  guarantor's  contract. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  do  you  think  that  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  contingent  on  that,  on  exactly  which  contract  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

signed?  I  mean,  these  folks  give  you  a  lot  of 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

information,  they  sign  their  names  to  a  lot  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

information,  and  ­­ I  mean,  unlike  the  usual  guarantor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  where  the  guarantor  is  only  liable  if  there's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

default,  here  the  guarantor  is  jointly  and  severally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liable,  much  like  a  cosigner  is. 

   

 

 

 

            

severally  ­­

 

            

Or  at  any  rate,  cosigners  are  jointly  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  McALLISTER:  That's  ­­ cosigners  are 

  

 

 

 

 

jointly  and  severally  liable.

the  same  box,  too.  So  it  doesn't  really  matter  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Right.  But  that  is  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

mischaracterization.  These  are  guaranties  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  It  doesn't  matter. 

  

 

 

 

MR.  McALLISTER:  ­­ that  are  not  joint  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

severally  liable. 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  bet  we  could  find  50  like 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  This  is  the  collegiate  dictionary.  Maybe  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

makes  it  too  simpleminded. 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  the  ­­ the  ­­ it  says, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  applicant  ­­ this  is  very  helpful  ­­ an  applicant  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  person  who  applies  for  something,  all  right?  We're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  making  too  much  progress. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  then  when  we  go  to  apply,  the  second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  down  here,  is  to  make  an  appeal  or  request. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Does  the  guarantor  make  an  appeal  or  request?  Yes. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Especially  in  the  form  of  written  application.  Even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

writes  it,  e.g.,  for  a  job.  No,  doesn't  apply  for  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

job,  doesn't  have  to  be  a  job. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Do  you  see,  it's  a  general  kind  of  thing, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  we're  at  step  one  of  Chevron,  and  we're  only  talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  what  ­­

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  And  we're  talking  ­­

someone,  but  this  is  about  an  extension  of  credit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Right.  But  still,  you'd  be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

asking  for  the  same  result  that  the  applicant  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking.  So  I  mean,  I  take  the  question  in  that

MR.  McALLISTER:  It  should  say  that,  but  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  analogy  would  work 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

only  if  you  did  that,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  But  ­­ but  what  I  was  going 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  say  is  the  government  concedes  that  the  statute  uses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ well,  in  fact,  they  didn't  say  this,  but  I  believe 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  uses  the  word  "applicant"  something  like  50 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

times,  and  only  for  one  purpose  do  they  say  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  should  apply.  That  runs  counter  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

presumptions  this  Court  has  long  stated.  The  statute  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  repeatedly  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  thought  that  the 

    

 

 

 

government  answered  that  question  differently.  I  ­­ I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

thought  their  position  was  that  if  they  prevail,  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  the  word  "applicant"  to  include  guarantor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  ­­ A,  applies  across  the  board  50  times,  and  B,

that  it  would  apply  across  all  50  uses.  They  said  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  change  it  ­­ and  actually,  they're  suggesting  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  have  49  other  definitions  of  applicant.  Every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  it's  used  somewhere  else  in  the  statute,  they  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

define  it  differently  for  that  purpose. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  can  you  give  me  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

example  of  where  it  would  be  really  contrary  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sensible  interpretation  of  the  Act  to  use  the  term 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"guarantor"  and  ­­

 

 

            

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  For  example  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ "applicant"  as 

  

 

 

 

synonymous,  other  than  for  what  we're  talking  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here? 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Well,  for  example,  giving 

  

 

 

 

 

notice  of  adverse  action.  I  mean,  the  Agency  itself  has 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  a  guarantor  cannot  be  subject  to  adverse  action, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  yet  you  would  have  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  frankly  ­­ I  frankly 

    

   

 

 

don't  believe  why  that  makes  the  statute  unworkable.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  a  guarantor  of  someone's  debt,  I  want  to  know  when 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  in  default  because  I'm  going  to  call  them  up  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

start  ­­ if  it's  my  child,  I'm  going  to  start

rationale  for  that  was,  whether  I  agree  with  it  or  not. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  why  does  it  make  it  unworkable?

MR.  McALLISTER:  Well,  it  would  ­­ it  is  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  that,  Justice  Sotomayor.  It's  not  just  at  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  down  the  road.  Usually,  this  is  focused  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application  itself.  So  again,  if  you  have  the  case  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

multiple  guarantors,  the  bank  turns  down  the  borrower, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  they're  under  obligation,  if  you  take  that  view  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute,  to  notify  everyone  who  had  any  connection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  transaction.  But  the  Agency  has  long  said  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  required.  The  Agency's  commenter  ­­ if  you  look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  ­­ if  you  look  at  supplement  one,  the  interpretations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  regs  and  other  commentary  by  the  agencies,  except 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  this  purpose,  the  Agency  always  talks  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantors  as  different  than  joint  applicants, 

 

 

 

 

 

co­borrowers.  No  one  in  the  industry  would  think  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  two  things  as  the  same. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

To  come  back  to  the  Chief  ­­ Mr.  Chief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice's  point,  a  bank  would  not  say  a  borrower  is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

equivalent  to  a  guarantor.  Not  even  close.  They're  two 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

very  different  things. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  No.  They  certainly  wouldn't 

  

  

 

 

 

say  a  borrower  is  equivalent  to  a  guarantor.  But  the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

question  is  whether  an  applicant  is  equivalent  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  They  would  say  the  person 

  

 

 

 

 

 

who  wants  the  credit,  the  applicant,  is  not  the  same  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  guarantor.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  what  ­­ what  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  The  entire  idea  of  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

guaranty  contract,  right,  why  is  a  guaranty  agreement 

   

 

 

 

 

 

even  enforceable?  Is  it  there  is  consideration,  and  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consideration  has  to  do  with  the  fact  that  credit  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  a  third­party,  right?  And  so  the  guarantor  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

stepping  in  and  saying,  I'm  asking  for  something  and  I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting  something  when  I  enter  into  this  contract,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  the  credit  will  go  not  to  me,  but  to  a  third 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party. 

            

So  the  question  I  think  is,  like,  why  should 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  be,  you  know  ­­ just  because  it's  to  a  third  party, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  appeal,  the  request  to  the  application  is  as  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third  party  rather  than  to  yourself,  why  that  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  any  difference  if  the  question  is  just  what  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant  mean?  Applicant  doesn't  have  to  be  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

yourself. 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Well,  I  ­­ I  agree  that's 

   

   

  

 

 

the  consideration  for  the  guaranty.  But  what  that  opens 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  door  to,  Your  Honor,  is  there  have  been  60  or  70 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reported  ECOA  decisions  since  the  change  in  1985.  More 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  half  of  those  are  within  the  last  five  years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

After  the  2008  crash,  massive  defaults,  this  is  coming 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  more  and  more  for  banks  as  a  defense. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  I  can  just  have  one  minute,  I'll  tell

you  where  this  leads  for  banks.  So  if  the  rule  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spousal  guaranty  can  be  voided  ­­ and  that's  what  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief  sought.  They're  not  asking  for  damages.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  invalidate,  void  the  entire  guaranty.  That  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Judge  Posner's  point.  So  if  that  is  the  rule,  what  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank  to  do  when  a  married  person  comes  in  and  seeks 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit? 

            

Well,  one  thing  the  bank  may  do  is  say  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

secured  credit  because  I  cannot  rely  on  any  guaranty.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  even  rely  on  a  spousal  guaranty  if  the  spouse  says 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  want  to  give  the  guaranty,  because  when  this  goes  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bad  direction  and  it's  time  to  collect,  then  years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later,  that  spouse  may  do  what  these  spouses  have  done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  say  I  was  required  to  do  this,  this  was  a  violation 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  statute.  And  at  a  minimum,  the  lender  is  then 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaged,  as  this  lender  has  been,  in  extensive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  costs  just  to  even  try  to  resolve  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation. 

            

All  of  that  leads  to  lenders  are  going  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less  likely  to  want  to  ­­ to  lend  to  married  couples 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

except  if  they  are  secure  in  their  loans.  And  that  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean  you  have  to  put  up  assets,  a  guaranty  no  longer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suffices,  and  it  may  mean  you  have  to  get  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantors  because  they  can't  rely  on  the  spouse.  None 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  that  furthers  the  purpose  of  the  ECOA,  which  was  to

time  being  discriminated  against. 

 

 

 

            

So  the  fundamental  problem  with  Reg  B  is  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

opens  the  door.  And  now  that  the  lawyers  have

regularly,  it  will  have  a  dramatic  impact  on  the  credit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

industry. 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  On  the  ­­ on  the  question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  guarantor  entering  a  contract  just  as  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

borrower  enters  a  contract,  the  two  contracts  are  quite 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

different.  The  borrower  enters  a  bilateral  contract,  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

promise  to  pay  back  the  money  if  you  ­­ with  interest  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  promise  to  lend  me  the  money.  The  guarantor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ is  asking  for  a  unilateral  contract.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

guarantor  is  just  saying,  I  make  no  promises,  but  if  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lend  money  to  this  person  that  I'm  guarantying  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  defaults,  I'll  make  good.  That's  ­­ that's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unilateral  contract,  which  doesn't  bind  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lender  at  all.  It's  if  the  lender  chooses  to  do  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'll  stand  good  for  the  ­­ for  the  default. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  two  contracts  are  quite  different.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  that  respect,  you  can't  call  both  ­­ both  of  them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicants  just  because  they  both  ­­ they  both  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts.  Of  course  they  both  have  contracts. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  I  agree  with  that,

And  unless  the  Court  has  further  questions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  would  ask  that  you  affirm  the  decision  of  the  Eighth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit. 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  Counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Duggan,  you  have  four  minutes. 

 

 

 

 

 

           

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  JOHN  M.  DUGGAN 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  the  primary  answer  to  talk  about,  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

start  with,  is  these  guaranties  are  not  simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guaranties  of  the  performance  of  the  borrower.  They  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate,  independent  performance  required  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantor  under  the  guaranty.  The  guarantor  must  pay 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  creditors  on  time.  The  guarantor  must  provide 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial  statements  to  the  lender.  The  guarantor  must 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fulfill  all  other  obligations  and  any  other  agreement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  guarantor  has  with  the  lender.  If  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantor  fails  to  perform  any  one  of  those  single, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent  requirements  of  performance  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

guaranty,  the  guarantor  agrees  to  repay  the  debt  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

full.  There  is  separate  performance  under  the  guaranty. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Could  you  ask  ­­ could  you

decide  to  give  a  loan  with  a  spousal  guaranty? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  I'm  not  sure  I  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Why  would  ­­ why  would  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank  do  that? 

 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  There's  several  circumstances. 

  

 

 

 

Number  one,  husbands  and  wives  can  come  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  safe  harbors  as  joint  applicants 

 

 

 

 

 

contemporaneously  and  say  we  want  joint  credit.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  a  violation  of  the  Act  if  the  lender,  once  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent  spouse  comes  forward  and  says  I  want  credit, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  as  a  condition  to  me  extending  you  the  credit  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want,  you  must  bring  your  spouse  along. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  second  thing  is  I  think  this  regulation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

has  got  to  be  the  easiest  regulation  to  comply  with.  A, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B,  C,  1,  2,  3.  There's  safe  harbors  under  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation.  If  a  lender  is  relying  upon  jointly  owned 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

assets  of  a  husband  and  wife,  the  regulation  and  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  1691(d),  create  a  specific  safe  harbor  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

says  get  a  security  interest  in  the  asset  and  don't  get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  guaranty,  or  simply  ask  the  spouse  to  waive  her 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marital  interest  in  the  jointly­owned  property  so  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  in  fact  you  have  to  execute  on  that  jointly­owned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  to  collect  the  debt,  you're  permitted  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  Two  very  simple  safe  harbors  to  comply  with. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  they  don't  want  you  to  do  is  to  strap

the  spouse  with  the  potential  adverse  credit  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

future  where  she  has  to  use  her  income  or  her  earnings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  her  ability  to  get  future  credit  to  pay  off  either  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divorced  or  deceased  spouse.  One  of  the  rationales. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Makes  a  ton  of  sense. 

   

 

 

            

 

 

 

Back  to  the  other  points  that  were  made. 

 

 

 

 

The  application  here,  the  dictionary  definitions  run  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gamut,  but  they  all  have  two  specific  statements. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appeal  or  request.  And  the  statute  here  says  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

repeal  ­­ applies  for  an  extension  renewal  of  credit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Doesn't  say  of  credit  to  the  borrower.  Doesn't  say  of  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

loan  to  the  borrower.  It  says  of  credit  generically. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  back  to  Justice  Breyer's  comments,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  why  in  the  world  that  somebody  who  becomes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contractually,  jointly  and  severally  liable  to  repay  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt  in  full  and  says,  I  have  my  independent  obligations 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  my  guaranty,  and  if  I  don't  perform,  you  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collect  the  entire  debt  from  me,  how  is  that  person  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  context  not  saying  to  the  lender,  I  am  appealing  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  and  requesting  an  extension  of  credit?  I'll  go  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

far  as  to  say  I'll  stand  behind  the  loan,  and  I  have  my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent  obligations  to  perform  under  the  guaranty. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  if  I  don't  perform,  I'll  pay.  That,  to  me,  can  be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  but  an  applicant. 

 

 

 

            

Thank  you  so  much  for  your  time.  I'm  happy
