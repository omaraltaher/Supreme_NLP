CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next  in  Case  14­1516,  Duncan  v.  Owens. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Ms.  Shapiro. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  CAROLYN  E.  SHAPIRO 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

MS.  SHAPIRO:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  Seventh  Circuit  in  this  case  violated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

AEDPA  when  it  granted  habeas  relief  to  Respondent  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absence  of  precedent  from  this  Court,  clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establishing  that  Respondent's  allegations  rise  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

level  of  a  constitutional  violation. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Let's  assume  the  judge 

  

 

 

 

 

said,  instead  of  what  he  said  ­­ so  make  the  assumption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  way  ­­ I  don't  know  if  the  witnesses  are  telling  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

truth  or  not,  but  I  believe  he's  guilty.  I'm  not  sure 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  their  credibility,  but  I  believe  he's  guilty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

because  he  wanted  to  get  rid  of  this  guy  because  of  a  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  drug  deal  gone  bad. 

 

 

 

 

            

Would  that  violate  due  process? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  It  would  violate  due  process 

  

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  judge  did  not  find  the  element,  the  ­­ the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  evidence  provided  by  the  State  proved  the

elements  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  But  it  would  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  violate  due  process,  or  at  least  it  does  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly  establish  that  it  would  violate  due  process,  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  finder  of  fact  to  speculate  about  a  nonelement  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  crime  where  it  is  ­­ where  the  finder  of  fact  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  disavow  or  otherwise  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  this  isn't 

  

 

 

 

speculation.  The  judge  said  who  ­­ Larry  Owens  knew  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  drug  dealer;  Larry  Owens  wanted  to  knock  him  off; 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  the  State's  evidence  has  proved  that  fact; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding  of  guilty  of  murder. 

 

 

 

 

            

off? 

            

Proved  that  Larry  Owens  wanted  to  knock  him 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MS.  SHAPIRO:  The  State's  evidence  did 

  

 

 

 

 

establish  that  Larry  Owens  wanted  to  knock  him  off, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  State's  evidence  established  that  Larry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Owens  approached  him  and  hit  him  over  the  head  with  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

baseball  bat  several  times. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Sorry,  Ms.  Shapiro.  Could 

  

  

 

 

 

I  ­­ could  I  take  you  back,  because  I  just  didn't 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  ­­ and  I'm  sure  it  was  me  ­­ the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer  that  you  gave  to  Justice  Sotomayor's  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question. 

            

And  I  think  it's  important,  because  it 

   

 

 

 

 

focuses  on  what  the  actual  issue  is  here:  How  much  is

at  issue  between  the  parties? 

 

 

 

 

            

If  you  had  a  judge  that  said,  I  don't  think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  evidence  is  up  to  snuff  here,  and  then  said,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing  that  takes  me  over  the  line  is  what  I  think  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  defendant's  motive,  and  that's  what  allows  me  to  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  defendant  is  guilty,  and  that  had  not  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proved,  that  had  ­­ the  State  had  never  offered  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  evidence.  It  really  just  came  out  of  the  judge's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

head  for  whatever  reason.  Right? 

  

 

 

 

            

Do  you  think  that  that  would  be  a  due 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  violation? 

 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  Well,  I  think  it  would  first 

   

  

 

 

 

 

depend  somewhat  on  if  ­­ on  habeas  review  on  how  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  appellate  court  or  supreme  court  interpreted  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  and  interpreted  what  the  judge  had  said.  If  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  appellate  court  interpreted  what  the  judge  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  so  that  the  judge  was  saying  he  did  not  believe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  evidence  produced  by  the  State  proved  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  that  would  be  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Winship  error  or  a  Jackson  error,  which  is  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent's  claim  here. 

 

 

            

If  the  State  appellate  court  read  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record,  interpreted  the  ­­ what  the  trial  court  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently  and  thought  that  the  trial  court  did  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  ­­ that  the  evidence  was  sufficient  but  was

tying  it  together  by  trying  to  tell  a  story  that  made 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense  to  himself,  then  it  would  not  violate  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yes.  Okay.  But  then  ­­ so 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

the  first  alternative  that  you  gave,  and  you  said  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  claim  here,  but  I  would  have  thought  it  was  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  here  because  you  ­­ there  is  obviously  a  dispute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  how  to  read  these  words.  And  we  can  talk  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ how  to  read  these  words.  Right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  once  you  say,  as  I  think  you  said,  and  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  you  properly  said,  Look,  if  what  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge's  various  comments  on  motive  was  basically  taking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him  over  the  line,  was  ­­ that  that  was  the  basis  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  verdict  of  guilty,  that  he  didn't  think  that  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence,  the  other  evidence  was  enough  and  that  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  crucial  to  his  finding,  then,  if  I  understand  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right,  you  would  say  that's  a  due  process  violation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  at  that  point  the  verdict  of  guilty  is  based  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  was  never  presented. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  If  the  ­­ if  the  judge  found 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  elements  had  not  been  proven  beyond  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  doubt. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  the  judge  is  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

saying  it's  not  ­­ you  know,  this  is  not  enough,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  necessary  for  me  to  think  about  motive  as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

missing  piece.

MS.  SHAPIRO:  That  does  not  necessarily 

  

 

 

 

 

violate  due  process  because  ­­ or  it's  ­­ it's  certainly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  clearly  established  that  that  would  necessarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violate  due  process.  Factfinders  are  free  to  develop  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory  of  the  case  that  is  not  presented  by  the  State  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long  as  it  is  consistent  with  the  evidence  and  as  long 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  the  evidence  itself  is  sufficient  to  establish  guilt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  a  reasonable  doubt. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Oh,  I  see.  So  you  think 

   

  

  

 

 

 

that  it  doesn't  matter  if  the  judge  thought  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  was  insufficient  as  long  as  the  evidence  was, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  fact,  sufficient. 

 

 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  If  the  judge  said  that  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

found  the  evidence  insufficient,  that  would  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yes.  The  judge  says,  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

know,  all  of  this  evidence,  it's  not  enough.  For  me, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motive  is  critical  to  a  finding  of  guilt  here. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  Again,  it  would  depend  on  how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  ­­ the  State  court,  State  appellate  courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreted  the  record.  I  think  that  is  ambiguous,  as 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've  described  it,  whether  the  judge  is  saying  that  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finds  that  the  elements  have  not  been  proven  beyond  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  doubt  or  if  the  judge  is  saying  that  he  needs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  find  some  way  of  telling  a  story  about  this  case  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes  sense  to  him.

The  first  would  be  a  due  process  violation. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

The  second,  it's  not  clearly  established. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Okay.  I  mean,  so  maybe  I'm 

    

  

 

 

 

 

putting  words  in  your  mouth,  and  so  tell  me  if  I  am. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  what  I  just  heard  was,  look,  if  he's  just  telling  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

story  to  himself  and  he  basically  believes  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  was  presented  is  enough,  but  he  wants  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell  a  story  about  some  other  things  that  make  this  all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  sense,  that's  one  thing.  But  ­­ but  if  he's  really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filling  in  the  pieces  and  deciding  ­­ and  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determining  guilt  based  on  something  that  was  never  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  record,  that's  another  thing  entirely,  and  that  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  run  into  all  our  statements  about  one  accused  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime  is  entitled  to  have  his  guilt  determined  solely  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  basis  of  evidence  at  ­­ introduced  at  trial  and  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forth. 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  It  ­­ it  ­­ yes,  I  ­­ but  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  be  quite  clear  that  that's  what's  happening,  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  we  have  a  presumption  that  judges  know  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow  the  law  and  especially  on  habeas  review  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption  applies  with  special  force.  Because  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

habeas  review,  we  ­­ we  assume  not  only  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

original  trial  judge  knows  and  follows  the  law  but  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  courts  that  are  reviewing  his  decision  know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  follow  the  law.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Okay.  So  now  I'm  going  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

go  back  to  Justice  Sotomayor's  second  question.  And  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but,  I  mean,  just  take  a  look  at  what  he  said  here.  All 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right? 

            

His  first  sentence  is,  all  of  the  witnesses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

skirted  the  real  issue.  All  right?  So  all  of  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses  ­­ there's  something  wrong  with  what  we've

Okay.  So  what  was  the  real  issue?  What  was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  real  issue? 

 

 

            

And  then  he  says,  the  issue  to  me  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  a  drug  dealer  on  a  bike  who  Larry  Owens,  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant,  knew  was  a  drug  dealer,  and  Owens  wanted  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knock  him  off.  That's  the  real  issue. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  he  says,  the  State's  evidence  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proved  that  fact. 

 

 

            

What's  that  fact?  Well,  that  fact  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  thing  that  he's  just  said  is  the  real  issue,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  a  drug  dealer  on  the  bike  who  knew  ­­ and  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  knew  he  was  a  drug  dealer  and  wanted  to  knock 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him  off. 

 

            

And  then  he  says,  okay.  Finding  of  guilty. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  to  me,  I  ­­ I  guess  with  all  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

deference  in  the  world,  it's  just  this  judge  saying,

there's  something  wrong  with  all  the  evidence  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  given  to  me,  and  here's  what's  really  moving  me  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  him  guilty. 

 

 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  So,  first,  if  that  were  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  judge  said,  that  interpretation,  it's  not  clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established  that  ­­ that  that  would  violate  due  process, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  reasons  I've  already  said,  that  a  finder  of  fact 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  develop  a  theory  of  the  case  to  tie  it  together  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  consistent  with  the  evidence. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  I  thought  it  was 

   

  

 

 

 

clearly  established  ­­ I  thought  you  agreed  ­­ page  14, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think,  of  your  reply  brief  ­­ that  it  is  clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established  that  it  would  be  a  violation  of  ­­ of  Taylor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  Turner  if  the  factfinder  bases  its  verdict  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  not  in  the  record. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  On  ­­ when  we  ­­ and  when  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussed  that  in  our  reply  brief,  we  talked  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility  that  a  judge  would  say,  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  don't  ­­

   

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

the  evidence  isn't  sufficient  so  ­­ but  I  know  that  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's  brother  committed  a  similar  crime,  and  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  reason  only  I'm  finding  him  guilty. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  but  to  begin  with, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  a  ­­ a  general  statement:  The  evidence  must  be

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  All  right.  And  we  agree 

  

  

 

 

 

 

MS.  SHAPIRO:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Then  I  don't  see  how  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't  understand  your  answer  to  Justice  Kagan. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

MS.  SHAPIRO:  The  ­­ the  precedent  can  be

Under  due  process  ­­ and  it's  especially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  when  we're  talking  about  due  process­claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  Court  respect  AEDPA's  requirement  that  the

specificity.  Of  course,  it's  clearly  established  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

every  defendant  is  entitled  to  a  fair  trial,  but  that

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  ­­ cannot  be  based  on

MS.  SHAPIRO:  Certainly.

MS.  SHAPIRO:  Yes. 

  

 

But  in  ­­ and  in  this  case,  it's  important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  note  that  the  Illinois  Appellate  Court  reviewed  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record,  and  the  Illinois  Appellate  Court  concluded  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  fact,  the  judge's  speculation  about  motive  was  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material  factor  in  the  verdict.  And  that  conclusion  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  entitled  to  deference  by  this  Court,  as  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  not  sure  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

know,  the  problem  is  that  you're  making  an  allegation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  not  sure  about.  They  had  trouble  with  one  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses.  They  wrote  it.  Correct? 

  

  

 

 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  They  ­­ they  said  that  they

had  its  problems,  yes. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right.  So  that 

  

  

 

 

 

leaves  it  to  a  one­witness  ID  of  a  witness  who  ­­ who, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  best,  saw  the  defendant  once,  when  he  turned  around 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  leave  the  scene  for  a  few  seconds.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Right.  I  mean,  once. 

    

  

 

 

Fleeting  look. 

 

            

How  can  you  draw  a  reasonable  inference  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  judge  wasn't  troubled  by  the  witnesses  when  he  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  all  of  the  witnesses  skirted  the  real  issue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  Several  ­­ several  answers  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  question. 

 

            

First,  Mr.  Johnnie's  testimony,  which  the 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate  court  discussed  at  some  length  and  which  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate  court  concluded  was  reliable,  was  essentially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unimpeached.  And  both  eyewitnesses  were  unrebutted. 

  

 

 

 

 

They  both  agreed  and  identified  the  defendant  on  several 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occasions  as  the  person  who  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  except  that 

  

 

 

 

evidence  failed  to  identify  him  in  court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  No.  Evans  did  identify  him  in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

court.  What  Evans  misidentified  was  the  photograph  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  selected  from  the  photo  array.  But  when  asked  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identify  defendant  in  court,  he  did  so,  as  the  person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It's  pretty  easy  to  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  identify  a  defendant  in  court.  They  sit  next  to  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense  attorney.  I've  always  thought  it's  been  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

wonderfully  ­­ a  ritual  with  no  meaning. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

But  putting  that  aside,  I  guess  my  question

is:  You  say  that  Johnnie's  testimony  was  sufficient.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  disagree  with  that.  But  what  they  didn't  say  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  was  credible,  or  that  the  judge  found  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credible.  Those  are  two  different  findings. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  Certainly.  The  judge  must 

  

  

 

 

 

have  found  it  credible,  because  if  he  didn't  believe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Johnnie,  we  ­­ what  ­­ what  you  would  have  to  presume  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  judge  said,  well,  I  don't  think  that  the  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses  have  established  the  elements  beyond  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  doubt.  I  don't  think  Johnnie  is  credible. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

So  I'm  going  to  disregard  one  of  the  most  basic  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  No.  All  the  judge  had 

  

  

 

 

 

 

to  say  was,  I'm  not  sure  he's  credible. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  what  takes  me  over  the  line  is  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motivation,  this  theory  that  I  have. 

   

 

 

 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  It  is  not  clearly  established 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  theory,  in  this  ­­ in  this  situation  would  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  violate  due  process  where  it  is  consistent  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  evidence,  is  not  contradicted  by  the  evidence,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  the  elements  are  sufficient. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  This  is  quite 

  

 

 

 

interesting.  You  can  draw  an  inference  about  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  based  on  no  evidence.  No  one  said  he  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drug  dealer,  I  presume.  Did  he  have  any  convictions  for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

drug  dealing?

judge  could  just  make  this  up  out  of  whole  cloth. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  The  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  that's  not 

  

 

 

 

extraneous  evidence. 

 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  It's  not  evidence  at  all. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Fact  finders  are  allowed  to  rely  on  their  experience  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  sense  when  they  ­­ when  they  evaluate  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence.  For  example,  in  Parker  v.  Matthews,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  had  a  ­­ a  partial  defense  of  extreme  ­­ that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  was  operating  under  extreme  emotional  disturbance. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He  had  an  expert  who  said  he  was  operating  under  extreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

emotional  disturbance,  but  the  jury  rejected  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense.  And  this  Court  said  that  the  jury  was  free  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  so,  in  part  based  on  their  own  personal  experience 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  personal  understanding  of  what  emotional  disturbance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means. 

            

So  jury  ­­ so  factfinders  are  free  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider  what  they  know  ­­ background  information  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  know  about  the  world,  and  they  bring  that  into  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factfinding  process. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  a  new  theory.  I 

   

  

  

 

 

didn't  read  that  in  your  brief,  that  somehow,  the  judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  right.  He  can  ­­ he  can  assume  that  Owens  knew  that

the  defendant  was  a  drug  dealer. 

   

 

 

 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  No.  We  ­­ we  argued  in  our 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief,  that  ­­ that  the  ­­ that  the  judge  is  free,  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  factfinder,  to  make  inferences  based  on  his  common

have  not  been  proven  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  Court  could  say  that  a  situation 

   

 

 

 

 

like  ­­ as  ­­ that  we're  talking  about  violates  due

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  I  guess  I  ­­ this  goes 

   

   

  

 

 

 

back  to  Justice  Kennedy's  question,  I  guess.  We  have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

these  statements  repeated  over  and  over  again.  One 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

accused  of  a  crime  is  entitled  to  have  his  guilt  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

innocence  determined  solely  on  the  basis  of  evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

introduced  at  trial.  And  what  I  hear  you  saying  now  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  tell  me  if  this  is  not  what  you're  saying  ­­ but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  I  hear  you  saying  now  is  well,  that's  true  as  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real  things  that  are  extraneous  to  a  proper  factfinder's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

role,  all  right?  But  it's  not  true,  as  to  ­­ I  mean,

Is  that  what  you're  saying? 

 

 

 

 

MS.  SHAPIRO:  I'm  saying  several  things. 

  

 

 

 

 

First,  it's  not  clearly  established  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

factfinder  can't  ­­ can't  tie  together  the  case  to  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfaction  by  review  ­­ by  coming  up  with  a  theory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  consistent  with  the  evidence. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

But  in  addition  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  It's  not  just  ­­ it's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  not  just  like  so  I  feel  good  about  the  case  when  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  home  at  night.  I  mean,  this  is  a  factfinder  who  has 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ a  very  clear  role,  which  is  to  adjudicate  guilt  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

innocence.  And  motive,  although  not  an  element  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Illinois,  motive  is  relevant  to  identification,  which, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case,  was  all  about  identification.  Everybody 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  that  this  case  was  about  identification. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  when  the  judge  starts  making  up  things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  motive  ­­ and  I  thought  that  the  State  really  did 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  contest  that  this  was  all  made  up,  that  none  of  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  in  the  record  that  got  ­­ you  know,  who  knows  how  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got  this.  But  he  starts  making  up  these  things  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motive,  and  then  indicating  that  these  things  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motive  are  relevant  to  his  adjudication.  To  me,  I  mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly  established  or  not,  that  just  fits  under  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Taylor  principle.

what  the  judge  said  and  did  was  rejected  by  the  Illinois 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appellate  Court. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  agree  with  you  that 

    

 

 

 

 

there's  a  question  of  interpretation.  So,  I  mean,  it 

   

   

  

 

 

 

seems  to  me  like  everything  comes  down  to  that.  Like, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  thought  that  this  judge  just  made  up  facts  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  then  said,  this  is  critical  to  my  finding  of  guilt, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  I  just  think  you'd  have  to  say  that  that's  a  due 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  violation  under  Taylor.  That  ­­ that  what  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  have  is  you  have  the  ability  to  come  back  and  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  that's  not  what  the  judge  meant.  That's  not  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  judge  said,  right? 

 

 

 

            

            

the  issue. 

 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Okay.  So  ­­ so  that  narrows 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

But  then  it's  just  like  what  was  he  saying, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  that  wasn't  what  he  was  saying? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  Well,  there  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Let  me  give  you  a  hypothesis 

   

  

 

 

 

 

of  what  he  may  have  been  saying,  because  I  think  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  be  a  little  bit  too  hard  on  the  judge. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  was  an  unusual  prosecution.  It  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

murder  prosecution  where  there  was  no  evidence  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motive.  I  think  that's  pretty  rare.  The  judge  may  have 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  saying  something  like  this:  I  have  ­­ I  have

And  by  the  way,  I  ­­ I  read  the  ­­ the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole  ­­ everything  ­­ the  whole  record  and  ­­ that's  in

just  didn't  get  a  good  opportunity  to  see  the  ­­ to  see 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  perpetrator.  The  ­­ the  ­­ argument  of  the  defense, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  I  read  it  very  clearly,  was  that  something  was  going 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  here  and  these  two  witnesses  were  identifying  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  ­­ were  falsely  ­­ knowingly  identifying  the  wrong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person.  Something  was  going  on. 

  

 

 

 

            

There's  evidence  that  the  victim  was  selling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drugs,  very  strong  evidence  that  the  victim  was  selling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drugs,  and  that's  what  was  going  on  here.  And  so  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge  said  ­­ may  have  said  to  himself,  why  does  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ why  would  the  accused  take  a  baseball  bat  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beat  this  kid,  this  17­year­old  kid  who  has  a  lot  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drugs  in  his  pockets,  riding  around  on  a  bike?  Why 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  he  just  beat  this  kid  to  death? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  there  ­­ he  ­­ I  would  be  concerned 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  finding  this  ­­ the  defendant  guilty  if  I  thought 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  no  motive  in  this  case.  But  I  can  see  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  could  well  be  a  motive  in  this  case,  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  in  the  drug  trade  kill  each  other.  And  that

seems  to  be  exactly  what  was  going  on  here.  Is  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  not  a  fair  interpretation  of  what  the  judge  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying? 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  I  think  that's  an  extremely 

    

 

 

 

 

fair  interpretation  of  what  the  judge  was  saying.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it  is  consistent  also  with  what  the  Illinois 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appellate  Court  said  when  the  Illinois  Appellate  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  that  the  speculation  about  motive  was  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material  factor  in  ­­ in  the  verdict. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  no.  It  actually  said 

  

  

 

 

 

 

­­ so  I've  been  looking  at  this  because  it  puzzles  me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  standard  we're  supposed  to  use.  He  does  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  evidence  that  the  two  eyewitnesses  knew  each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other,  had  any  reason  to  conspire  and  fabricate  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony.  Next  sentence:  "Therefore,  in  light  of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

these  identifications,  the  trial  court's  speculation"  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  page  128  ­­ "the  trial  court's  speculation  as  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's  motive  for  assaulting  Nelson  will  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construed  as  harmless  error." 

 

 

 

            

Error.  And  the  judge  who's  dissenting 

  

 

 

 

 

doesn't  deny  that  it's  error.  He  says  it's  error.  He 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  doesn't  think  it's  harmless.  So  now  we  have  a  case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  it  looks  like  the  only  words  I  can  find  on  this  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Illinois  concede  that  it's  error.  Or  they  say  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error.  Indeed,  they  say  it's  harmless  error.

Therefore,  the  issue  is  harmlessness.  What  am  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed  to  do?  What  standard  do  I  apply  out  of  2254  if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  fact  they  think  it's  error?  Or  even  if  they  didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide  it  and  we  ­­ it's  debatable,  obviously  ­­ we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  error;  we  don't  have  to  give  them  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference,  I  guess.  How  does  it  work? 

   

  

 

 

 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  The  ­­ this  Court  has  to  give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference  to  the  Illinois  Appellate  Court's  conclusion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  defendant's  due  process  rights  were  not  violated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  they  didn't  conclude 

  

 

 

 

 

that.  I  mean,  Justice  Breyer  has  asked  ­­ you  have  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  deference,  I  would  think,  on  the  ­­ the  Brecht 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  the  question  of  harmlessness.  But  why  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  to  give  question  on  the  merits  ­­ on  the  merits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue?  There  was  no  merits  determination. 

  

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  there  are  two  ways  to  read  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion,  and  neither  one  indicates  that  deference  ought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  given  on  the  merits.  One  way  to  read  it  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  said  it  was  error,  but  that  it  was  harmless  error. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  other  way  to  read  it  is  that  notwithstanding  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  they  said  it  was  harmless  error,  they  didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  mean  that.  They  didn't  reach  a  decision  as  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  of  whether  it  was  error.  But  even  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  the  case,  there's  still  nothing  to  give  deference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  on  the  merit  side.

MS.  SHAPIRO:  I  disagree.  When  the  Illinois 

    

  

 

 

 

Appellate  Court  said  the  ­­ the  ­­ it  said  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  that  Justice  Breyer  quoted,  it  was  just  after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  analyzing  the  State's  argument.  On  page  119a, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  appellate  court  explains  that  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further  argues  that  even  if  this  Court  determines  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  trial  judge's  comments  were  improper,  they  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deemed  harmless  since  there's  no  indication  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comments  constituted  a  material  factor  in  defendant's 

   

 

 

 

 

conviction.  They  then  go  on  to  discuss  the  evidence  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclude  that  this  speculation  would  be  construed  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harmless  error. 

 

            

So  what  they  are  saying  is  error  ­­ the  best 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading  of  this  opinion  ­­ they're  saying  is  error  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  speculation.  It  wasn't  necessarily  appropriate  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  judge  to  be  doing  that.  But  they're  not  saying  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  constitutional  error  here.  Indeed,  it  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  be  coherent  for  them  to  say  that  it  was  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material  factor  in  the  verdict  and  ­­ and  then  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discuss  whether  that  was  constitutional  error. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  second,  in  terms  of  whether  or  not  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  if  you  believe  that  the  Illinois  Appellate  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  directly  address  the  merits,  2254(d)  still 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires  deference  to  its  conclusions.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

unquestionably  concluded  that  the  defendant's  due

deference  on.  There's  no  question.  Harmless,  you  get 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

deference  on.  The  question  is  whether  you  get  deference 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  notion  that  this  surmising  about  motive  was  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error.  Because  ­­ because  to  me,  I  read  this  opinion 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I  say  they  ­­ they  never  say  it's  not  error.  Quite 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  opposite.  They  declare  it  harmless  error. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  The  ­­ the  ­­ ultimately,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  that  the  Court  has  to  answer  under  2254(d)  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  State's  adjudication  results  in  a  decision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  in  violation  of  an  unreasonable  application  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly  established  law  of  this  Court.  It's  ­­ it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately  the  adjudication  that  this  Court  is  looking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at.  And  the  harmless  ­­ even  if  you  believe  it's  just  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harmlessness  determination  on  which  they  decided,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  under  Davis  v.  Ayala  on  merits  determination,  and  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  adjudication  is  entitled  to  deference. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Okay.  So  harmlessness,  I 

  

  

 

 

 

think  you're  right,  is  entitled  to  deference.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

assume  if  you  think  that  this  judge  unconstitutionally

convicted  somebody  on  the  basis  of  evidence  that  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never  been  introduced  at  trial.  If  you  think  that,  how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  that  not  be  harmful?  That's  ­­ I  mean,  it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

almost  tautological.  If  the  error  is  that  he  convicted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  on  the  basis  of  evidence  that  was  not  proper  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  about,  well,  of  course,  that's  harmful.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  he  convicted  him. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SHAPIRO:  Yes,  and  for  that  reason,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe  the  best  reading  of  the  ­­ of  the  opinion  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  did  not  find  constitutional  error.  Because  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  not  a  material  factor  in  the  verdict,  it  could 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  have  been  a  violation  of  his  due  process  rights. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

rebuttal. 

            

I'd  like  to  reserve  the  rest  of  my  time  for

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  BARRY  LEVANSTAM 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

            

The  Illinois  Appellate  Court  unanimously 

 

 

 

 

found  that  there  was  no  evidence  that  Mr.  Owens  knew 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Nelson  was  dealing  drugs,  or  that  he  was  himself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  with  gangs  or  with  the  illegal  drug  trade.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsequently,  the  presentence  report  revealed  that  he

had  no  convictions  whatsoever. 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

 

The  Court  then  said  that  this  was  ­­ by  a 

 

 

 

 

 

two­to­one  margin  ­­ this  was  harmless  error.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize  that  harmlessness  is  entitled  to  deference, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I  intend  to  discuss  that.  But  it  seems  to  me  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really,  we're  past  the  ­­ the  point  of  ­­ of  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  evidence  concerning  knowledge. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Doesn't  ­­ doesn't  the  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

really  ­­ much  of  the  case  hinge  on  what  ­­ what  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean  by  error?  If  you  mean  by  error  simply  introducing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  your  decision  matters  that  were  not  in  the  record 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  had  no  support  in  the  evidence,  if  that's  what  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean  by  error,  it's  one  thing.  It's  another  thing  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  mean  by  error  using  evidence  that  was  not  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  as  a  basis  for  your  decision.  And  which  of  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  you  ­­ you  assign  this  to,  it  seems  to  me, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determines  the  outcome  of  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  I  agree.  And  it  seems  to 

    

  

 

 

 

 

me,  based  on  what  he  said,  after  saying  ­­ expressing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dissatisfaction  with  the  witnesses'  testimony,  he  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  real  issue  was  to  him  ­­ and  I  have  yet  to  be

presumption  that  the  judge  knows  and  applies  the  law? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  don't  think  there's  a  rational  judge  who  would 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

think  it  proper  to  base  a  conviction  on  conjecture  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  no  evidentiary  basis.  So  if  we  add  to  this  that  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presume  the  judge  knows  and  applies  the  law,  and  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  knows  the  defendant  must  be  convicted  on  the  basis  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  presented  in  court. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Well,  there  are  two 

  

 

 

 

 

presumptions  at  ­­ at  ­­ at  work,  in  a  sense.  This  is  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

morning  seems  filled  with  presumptions. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  presumption  that  he  knows  the  law,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  is  absolutely  correct.  And  I  think  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

presumption  is  a  reason  why  we  know  that  he  found  motive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  integral  part  of  his  conclusion  of  guilt,  and  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  Illinois  Supreme  Court  decided  the  People  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Smith  case  in  1990,  and  it  reversed  a  conviction  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  based  on  identification  that  rested  on  motive.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  said  it  is  essential,  if  you  are  going  to  convict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone  based  on  a  motive  theory,  that  you  find  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowledge  that  the  accused  have  the  actual  knowledge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary  to  generate  the  motive. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  when  he  makes  that  finding,  who  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  knew  he  was  a  drug  dealer,  he  is  going  through 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  paces  in  Illinois  law  to  establish  the  motive  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  then  the  basis  for  the  following  finding  of  guilty  of

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  think  we've  gotten 

    

 

 

 

 

pretty  far  afield  from  the  issue  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Which  case  of  ours  clearly  established  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  due  process­error  when  a  judge  speculates  about  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  that  is  not  pertinent  to  guilt  and  there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient  evidence  of  guilt  on  all  the  elements?  Which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  of  ours  says  that? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  There  is  no  case  that  says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  Your  Honor.  But  this  is  different  from  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation  because  this  is  precisely  how  guilt  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determined.  The  fact  that  it's  not  an  ­­ an  element 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  mean  that  it's  not  what  he  rested  his  guilty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict  on. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  just  want  to  ­­ I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  under  AEDPA,  isn't  it  critical  that  there  be  a

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Yes,  that  Turner  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  ­­ as  opposed  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  you're  saying  is  the  case  is:  Well,  you  know,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  cases  that  say  you  can't  be  guilty  if  there  wasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  of  guilt. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Right.

says  the  problem  is  the  judge  said  you  can  infer  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fact  that  the  person  has  been  arrested  and  indicted, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  Is  that  ­­ that's  Taylor? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  There  was  some  ­­ there  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  bad  instruction  there,  yes. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Okay.  Well,  that's 

  

  

 

 

 

very  different  from  here.  The  judge  is  the  factfinder. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He's  not  instructing  anybody  on  anything. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  about  Williams?  That  ­­ they  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Seventh  Circuit  only  cited  three  of  our  cases,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

more. 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Yes.  We've  cited  a  few 

   

  

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I  know.  But

Nothing  like  that  happens  here.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  that's  not  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

State  says.  The  State  says  you  read  the  relevant  three 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentences:  The  issue  was  you  have  a  17­year­old  youth 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

on  a  bike  who  is  a  drug  dealer;  who  Larry  Owens  knew  he 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  drug  dealer.  Larry  Owens  wanted  to  knock  him  off. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  the  State's  evidence  has  proved  that  fact.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see? 

            

So  two  members  of  the  Illinois  Supreme  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  the  words  "that  fact"  refer  to  the  sentence,  Larry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Owens  wanted  to  knock  him  off.  And  the  sentence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preceding  that  is  the  judge's  speculation  as  to  why. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

One  judge  in  the  Supreme  Court  says  what  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  that  when  you  read  that  together,  it  means  "that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact"  referred  to  the  motive. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  there  we  are.  And  the  question  is  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  we  supposed  to  do?  Is  there  enough  here  to  say  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  clearly  wrong,  those  two  members? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Yes  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  mean,  there  we  are,  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Seventh  Circuit  thought,  yeah.  There  is.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Have  ­­ have  I  got  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Well,  perhaps  that's  one  way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

issue? 

            

of  looking  at  it,  yes.  But  ­­ but  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That  seems  to  be  the  way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  your  ­­ your  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

and  it. 

 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  If  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ opponents  are  looking 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  If  the  court  reporter  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

put  a  comma  there,  I  think  what  he's  ­­ what  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  from  "skirted  the  real  issue."  Because  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  then  does  is  define  the  real  issue:  What  he  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ what  is  going  to  bring  him  over  the  line  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  a  reasonable  doubt. 

   

 

            

And  the  issue  to  me  is  ­­ and  it  goes  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  way  on  from  there  to  the  end,  and  "that  fact,"  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  to  him  is  the  "that  fact."  I  don't  think  ­­ I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  you  can  get  to  ­­ precisely  because  Illinois 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law,  which  I  think  he  was  following  his  error  was  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  ­­ says  you  need  to  establish  knowledge  to  create 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motive.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Okay. 

  

 

 

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Yes. 

  

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Now,  why  don't  we

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Well,  but  ­­

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Because  you  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

challenge  that  there's  sufficient  evidence  of  guilt,  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you?

But  that's  not  what's  happened  here.  What's

Mr.  Owens  knowing  or  being  involved  in  any  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business.  And  then  you  have  the  judge  specifically

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  what  is  it  about? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  ­­ about  a  hundred  pages. 

   

  

 

 

 

It's  about  this  event  that  happened 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No.  I  understand  that.

the  judge  did  not  believe  these  people's  story;  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  ­­ I'm  speculating  now,  too.  But  the  ­­ but  the  fact

those  witnesses  talk  about.  He  says  they  skirted  the

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  They  talked  about  what  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

saw,  and  they  talked  about  their  identifications.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  very  brief.  And  what  I'm  saying  is,  by  skirting  the

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  wait.  So  they're

thought  you  said  that  the  real  issue  was  that  the  judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  not  think  that  the  witnesses  were  credible. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  The  ­­ I'm  sorry.  I  think 

    

  

 

 

 

 

what  I  meant  to  say  was  that,  when  he  said  the  ­­ the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses  skirted  the  real  issue,  it  was  reflecting  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

measure  of  dissatisfaction  with  the  witnesses' 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony. 

            

Now,  I  don't  know  what  that  was.  I  ­­ I  ­­

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

I  don't  know.  But  what  I  do  know  is  he  immediately  says 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  ­­ he  then  frames  what  the  issue  is  to  him.  And  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

framing  what  the  issue  is  to  him,  he  says  that  Mr.  Owens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knew  that  this  victim  was  a  drug  dealer  and  wanted  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knock  him  off,  presumably  because  he's  a  drug  dealer. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  from  the  very  next  thing  that  he  says,  his  finding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  guilty  of  murder. 

 

 

 

            

So  those  things  follow  one  right  after  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other.  It  is  the  only  thing  ­­ it  is  the  only  fact  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  discusses  after  expressing  whatever  dissatisfaction 

 

 

 

 

 

he  has  with  the  witnesses'  testimony. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  it  is  ­­ at  a  minimum,  it  is  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

integral  part  of  the  process  that  he  has  gone  through  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reach  the  finding  of  guilt.

other  side,  so  you  have  to  answer  that  squarely.  And  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  maybe  I'll  put  it  this  way: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There's  ­­ well,  the  judge  has  been  sitting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  through  this  fairly  short  trial.  He  is  annoyed  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  these  witnesses.  They've  been  pussy­footing  what's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

going  on.  They  saw  the  murder.  No  problem  about  that. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  they're  not  explaining  it  because  they're  frightened 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  saying  what  it's  involved  in. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  he's  fed  up,  so  he's  going  to  say,  I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  say  what's  really  happening  here.  What's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  happening  here  is  this  is  a  drug  deal  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failed.  Or  something  like  that. 

  

 

 

 

            

            

So  that's  the  explanation  of  what  he  said. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  you  could  bring  him  back  and  say,  judge, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  you  mean  motive  played  a  role  here? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

He'd  say,  of  course  not.  Of  course  not.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  play  a  role  in  my  decision.  All  that  played  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

role  in  my  decision  was  what  the  witnesses  said,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was,  he's  the  guy.  I  was  just  saying  what's  going  on. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  what's  ­­ I  think  they're  saying 

   

 

 

 

 

something  like  that. 

 

 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  And  my  answer  to  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  speculation  upon  speculation  upon  speculation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it's  not  a  basis  for  putting  somebody  behind  bars 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  25  years.

And  the  harmless  error  ­­ they  bear  the  risk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  harmless  error.  The  State.  They  have  to  explain  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  they  want  to  explain  something  other  than  what's  on

And  the  ­­ the  Illinois  Appellate  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  No,  you  ­­ you  ­­ you  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  establish  that  it's  error  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ before  they  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

establish  that  it's  harmless. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Well,  the  only  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  But  ­­ and  what 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer  was  saying  is  it  wasn't  error.  He's  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speculating,  trying  to  make  sense  of  the  whole  thing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  that  wasn't  the  basis  for  his  decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You  have  to  establish  that  it  was  the  basis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  his  decision,  whereupon  there  is  error,  whereupon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  has  to  show  that  it's  harmless. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Well,  whereupon  I  point  back 

   

  

 

 

 

to  the  Illinois  Appellate  Court  conclusion  that  this  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error,  three­to­zip  error,  two­to­one  ­­

on  the  record,  it's  a  mistake  to  do  that  ­­ I  think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what  they  meant  by  it  was  error. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Well,  and  that's  what  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  they  thought  he  did,  and  I  think  they  decided  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  error,  and  then  they  turned  and  did  a  harmless­error 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis.  And  their  harmless­error  analysis  was 

  

 

 

 

 

insufficient,  I  think,  for  three  reasons.  Okay? 

   

  

 

 

 

              

I  believe  that  it  was  ­­ it  fails  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Brecht­Kotteakos  test  because  they  simply  took  a  look  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  remaining  evidence  and  they  did  not  make  any  effort, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  the  Seventh  Circuit  did,  to  assess  precisely  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impact  this  knowledge/motive  finding  had  on  the  judge. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  as  we've  pointed  out  in  our  briefs,  the  simple 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer  long  ago  would  have  been  to  remand  it  and  ask  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge,  and  then  we  wouldn't  be  here.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Now,  there  ­­ could  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's  some  evidence  from  which  one  might  infer  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  might  be  insufficient.  It  would  depend  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  of  review.  But  there's  evidence  that  ­­ that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nelson,  the  victim,  was  selling  drugs.  Could  you  not

from  the  record  here  that  this  kid,  this  17­year­old  kid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  40  packages  of  drugs,  who's  hanging  around  in  front

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  That  ­­ that  would  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  inference. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  And  the  ­­ and  the  ­­ the

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Well,  that  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Evans,  not  Mr.  Johnnie.  Mr.  Johnnie  comes  ­­

So  could  someone  infer  from  those  two  facts  that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  this  kid  was  pretty  openly  selling  drugs  and  the

period  of  time,  he  knew  what  he  was  doing? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  On  ­­ yes.  But  the  Illinois 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Appellate  Court  has  already  told  us  that  Mr.  Evans' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony  was  ­­ his  ­­ his  credibility  was  severely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undermined,  and  it  was  contradicted  by  Mr.  Johnnie's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony  specifically,  which  the  Illinois  Appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  relied  on,  although  erroneously,  because  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misapplied  Neil  v.  Biggers.  And  the  ­­ and  the  fact  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  can  ­­ they  held,  and  I  think  you  defer  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this,  that  there  is  no  evidence  that  Mr.  Owens  knew 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Nelson  was  dealing  drugs. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Now,  the  question  on  ­­ on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  merits  of  ­­ putting  aside  the  issues  of  ­­ of  AEDPA

a  finding  on  a  fact  that  is  not  needed  for  conviction?

no  case  of  yours  that  sets  forth  the  standard  for  that.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  is  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  But  here  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  is  the  standard? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  The  ­­ well,  the  standard  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

the  due  process  standard  in  Turner  and  Taylor  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  cases  that  the  Seventh  Circuit  cited  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've  cited. 

 

            

But  that  the  fact  is  that  the  motive  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  identification  analysis. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  I'm  trying  to  figure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

out  what  the  standard  is,  if  you  could  put  it  in  words. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Suppose  that  the  ­­ the  trial  judge  had  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  finding,  like  the  ­­ the  court  of  appeals  appears  to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  time  of  nautical  twilight,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppose  the  trial  judge  was  wrong  on  that.  Then  what? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  trial  judge  has  made  a  finding  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  on  a  fact  that's  not  necessary  for  conviction. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Might  conceivably  have  some  relevance  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination.  So  what  is  the  due  process  standard  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determining  whether  that  requires  a  new  trial? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Well,  I  think  at  that  point 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ you  would  do  a  harmless­error  analysis.

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Yes.  I  ­­

superfluous  finding  of  fact. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  It  was  not  superfluous.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

was  a  made­up  finding  of  fact  that  created  the  judge's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

final  conclusion  that  the  man  was  guilty.  That  played 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  role  in  that  final  conclusion. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  And  ­­ and  I  apologize  if  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

haven't  said  that  already,  but  that  is  certainly  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point,  is  that  ­­ that  the  judge  framed  the  issue,  laid

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ in  Taylor  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  It  depends  ­­ when  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

reading  this  ­­ in  reading  what  the  judge  said,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depends  on  ­­ the  reasonableness  of  what  the  judge  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  depend  on  whether  you  think  that  the  judge  inferred 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Larry  Owens  killed  the  victim  because  he  knew  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  drug  dealer,  or  whether  the  judge  was  ­­ in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attempting  to  fill  in  the  blanks  of  this  case,  inferred 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  he  knew  he  was  a  drug  dealer  from  the  fact  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  proof  that  he  killed  him. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  But  there  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  if  you  know  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

victim  is  a  drug  dealer  and  the  defendant  talked  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

victim,  and  then  the  defendant  proceeded  to  beat  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brains  out  with  a  baseball  bat,  you  could  probably  infer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  that  the  reason  why  he  did  it  was  that  he  knew  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  drug  dealer,  could  you  not? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  The  reason  why  whoever  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  did  it  because  ­­ yes,  I  think  that's  right.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  comes  with  Mr.  Owens  and  the  evidence  that  links 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him.  And  that's  where  we  get  to  the  harmless­error 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis,  and  the  Illinois  Appellate  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

harmless­error  analysis  was  constitutionally  inadequate. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  I  ­­ I'm  sorry.

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Mr.  Owens,  right. 

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  you're  not 

  

 

 

 

 

challenging  the  sufficiency  of  that  evidence. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  I'm  challenging  the 

  

 

 

 

credibility  of  that  evidence.  The  trial  court  never 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

found  it  credible.  In  fact,  he  expressed  some  concerns 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  witness. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but 

  

 

 

 

credibility  was  the  key  issue  in  the  trial,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Yes.  Yes.  And  ­­ and 

  

  

  

 

 

 

unfortunately,  the  Illinois  Appellate  Court,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

reviewing  this,  said  specifically  here  there  is  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indication  whether  or  not  the  trial  judge  assessed  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credibility  of  the  eyewitnesses,  resolved  conflicts  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  testimony,  or  waived  the  evidence  or  drew 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  inferences  therefrom. 

 

 

            

And  then  it  proceeded  to  do  essentially  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  which  it  can't  do  because  it  didn't  see  any  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  people.  And  the  ­­ and  it  is  clear  from  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  that  there  was  a  fair  amount  of  equivocation  by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  Mr.  Johnnie.  His  ­­ his  behavior  that  evening  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extremely  suspicious.  The  Illinois  Appellate  Court  made 

  

 

 

 

 

 

basically  mistake  after  mistake  in  its  harmless­error 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  that  ­­ seems  to 

  

 

 

 

 

me  like  you're  challenging  the  sufficiency  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence,  and  I  ­­ again,  as  I  ­­ as  the  case  comes 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  us,  we  assume  there  is  sufficient  evidence  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convict  under  every  element  of  the  crime. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  I'm  ­­ I'm  challenging  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiency  of  the  Illinois  Appellate  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

harmless­error  analysis,  upholding  the  conviction  in 

 

 

 

 

 

light  of  the  fact  that  it  concluded  that  there  were  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credibility  determinations  that  it  could  rely  upon  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

below.  Typically,  there  is  an  assumption  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

credibility  analysis  is  done,  and  that's  what's  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate  court  works  from. 

 

 

 

            

But  here  the  appellate  court  tells  us  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  is  assuming  there  are  none.  And  then  it  goes  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  applies  the  Neil  v.  Biggers  analysis,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis  determining  the  reliability  of 

 

 

 

 

identification  ­­

sense.  You're  saying  that  the  ­­ what  ­­ the  Illinois 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme  Court  thought  the  opinion  below  was,  was  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  judge  didn't  think  eyewitness  testimony  proved  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  was  the  guy  who  ­­ who  hit  him  with  a  baseball  bat. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  nonetheless,  he  thought  this  guy  was  a  drug  dealer

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ of  one  or  both  of  ­­ of

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  I  don't  ­­ I'm  telling

because  it  doesn't  make  any  sense,  because  this  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terribly  botched  job. 

 

 

            

And  even  under  the  deferential  standards  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Brecht  and  Kotteakos,  the  trial  court  got  it  ­­ based  it

to  the  police. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I'm  sorry,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Maybe  I'm  just  repeating  myself.  That  sounds  like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  arguing  the  sufficiency  of  the  evidence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  But  Your  Honor,  it  is  not  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct  sufficiency.  I  am  challenging  the  Illinois 

    

 

 

 

 

Appellate  Court's  harmless­error  analysis.  It  went 

  

 

 

 

 

through  and  said  Mr.  Johnnie  should  be  believed  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

X,  Y,  and  Z.  And  I  am  telling  you  that  in  conducting 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  harmless­error  analysis,  it  overlooked  A,  B,  C,  D,  E 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  way  through  W. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Yes,  you're  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

we're  not  challenging  the  sufficiency  of  the  evidence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  are  challenging  the  Illinois  court's  determination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  was  harmless  error  that  there  was  not  sufficient 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence. 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  The  mode  of  analysis  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

wrong.  The  ­­ as  I  said,  the  Neil  v.  Biggers  analysis 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  reliability  analysis  that  talks  about 

   

 

 

 

 

admissibility.  It  doesn't  allow  the  Court  to  make  a

there  had  been  is  these  two  eyewitnesses,  there  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  you  could  object  to.  But  what  you're  saying  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  error  that  this  judge  made  in  confining  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motive  based  on  evidence  is  not  in  the  record,  that  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error  had  a  substantial  influence  on  the  judgment  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  rendered. 

 

            

injurious. 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Yes,  substantial  and 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  indeed,  there  was 

  

 

 

 

 

sufficient  evidence,  yes,  but  the  finding  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction  rested  on  an  error  that  had  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LEVENSTAM:  Absolutely.  And  that  was 

  

  

 

 

 

not  harmless  under  Brecht  and  Davis.

any,  had  a  substantial  and  injurious  effect  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict. 

            

The  Illinois  Appellate  Court  found  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speculation  about  motive  did  not  ­­ was  not  a  material

just  sat  through  a  trial  in  which  he's  heard  two 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eyewitnesses,  unrebutted  eyewitnesses  identify  the 

 

 

 

 

defendant  as  the  ­­ as  the  killer.  It  would  not  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Illinois  Appellate  Court's  conclusion  that  it  ­­ putting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  evidence  together  with  the  presumption  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regularity,  the  Illinois  Appellate  Court  presumes  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  motive  was  ­­ concludes  ­­ excuse  me  ­­ that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motive  was  not  ­­ the  speculation  about  motive  was  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material  factor  in  the  verdict. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  motive  is  not  ­­ as  ­­ as  it's  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed  out,  motive  is  not  an  element  of  murder  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Illinois.  And  motive  ­­ although  motive  can  be  used  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish  identity,  it  doesn't  have  to  be  used  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish  identity.  People  v.  Smith  is  a  case  about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

whether  or  not  the  ­­ the  State  can  put  in  evidence  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motive  without  establishing  that  the  defendant  knew 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  ­­ this  evidence  that  they're  putting  in. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  has  nothing  whatsoever  to  do  with  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motive  is  a  necessary  part  of  establishing  identity  in  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  where  you  have  two  unrebutted  eyewitnesses. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

To  conclude,  for  Respondent  to  prevail,  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  would  have  to  find  that  the  trial  judge  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disregarded  some  of  the  most  basic  principles  of  ­­ of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisprudence  and  found  the  defendant  ­­ and  you  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  conclude  that  the  Illinois  Appellate  Court's

conclusions  were  objectively  unreasonable.  On  AEDPA,
