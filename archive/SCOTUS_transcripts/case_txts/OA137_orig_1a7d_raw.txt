 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

next this morning in Case 137 on our original docket, 

Montana v. Wyoming and North Dakota.

 General Bullock.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE BULLOCK

 ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

 MR. BULLOCK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Tongue and Powder Rivers are the only 

significant water supply in a 10,000-square-mile area in 

Montana and Wyoming, and this Court is being asked to 

decide whether the compact allows Wyoming to take the 

return flows that Montana farmers in that area have 

always relied on or, instead, affords protection to both 

States.  Our exception should be sustained for three 

reasons.

 First, the plain language of the compact 

preserves the water supply each State was receiving as 

of 1950.  Second, contrary to the compact's purposes, 

the Master's interpretation would allow individual water 

users to alter those amounts.  And, third, the Master's 

policy determinations about efficiency add ambiguity to 

the principles underlying a century of western water

law.  On that -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General Bullock, would 

you please point to the precise language of the compact 

that freezes consumption, as distinguished from the 

amount of water diverted -- which freezes consumption as 

of January 1st, 1950?

 MR. BULLOCK:  Yes, Your Honor.  In the 

compact, it's at the appendix of the Master's first 

interim report.  Two areas:  first, the preamble 

provides for an equitable division/apportionment of the 

water; and then the operative provision, article V(A), 

states that the uses existing as of January 1st, 1950, 

in each signatory State shall continue to be enjoyed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, the uses existing 

is irrigation.

 I don't see where it says -- and so I can 

understand, the amount of water diverted can't be 

increased.

 MR. BULLOCK:  Your Honor, the whole of 

article V(A) and V(B) -- I mean, no one contests that 

it's the full allocation of the water.  So V(B) is water 

after 1950; V(A) is prior.  And in order for the status 

quo to be -- remain -- for the appropriative right to 

beneficial uses existing in Montana as of 1950, there 

needs to be a water supply.  And also operative to that,

it's within the definitions at article II(H), is 

beneficial use.  And that's a derivation or departure 

from the general prior appropriation law, because it's 

that use by which a water supply is depleted 

when usefully used.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But why doesn't the 

language in article V(A) -- and this is not too helpful 

-- simply restate the issue before us, what is a 

beneficial use by the upstream owner?

 MR. BULLOCK:  Well, Your Honor, it need not 

because in article II(H) it defines what a beneficial 

use is, and that's that use by which the water supply of 

a basin is depleted.  And it's that depletion that -- as 

of 1950, so it wasn't a full consumption of water in 

Wyoming, and that depletion is the return flow upon 

which Montanans rely.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's the essence 

-- that's the essence of the argument before us.  The 

depletion was the amount of water that was taken from 

this water source to irrigate the crops.  The -- the 

issue now before us is whether beneficial use means 

consumption or it means use, isn't it?

 I -- you're begging the question in my mind, 

because I don't -- what source do you have for the fact 

that a return flow is beneficial use?

MR. BULLOCK:  Your Honor, the return flow is 

the basis of Montana's water right, so that the return 

flow under the compact isn't actually beneficial use.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's not actually 

true.  Their water right was the beneficial use that 

your pre-1950 consumers used, meaning you had consumers 

who were irrigating their own crops, who were doing 

other things with the water.  The rights protected are 

their pre-1950 uses.  You're putting -- you're -- you're 

still equating consumption as -- as being their use, but 

I don't know where you get that equation from.

 MR. BULLOCK:  The equation, Your Honor, that 

consumption is the same thing as -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  As use.

 MR. BULLOCK:  -- as use?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Uh-huh.

 MR. BULLOCK:  Well, we could go actually to 

the Special Master, who himself had stated that when 

exploring -- I mean, the beneficial use reflects the 

historic consumptive use.  It's from his own textbook. 

It's on page 82.  The Master says that a senior's right 

is limited to the amount he originally beneficially 

applied and consumptively used; that is, the amount 

received at the point of use minus the runoff.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could someone pre-1950

who irrigated crops change the crops?

 MR. BULLOCK:  It's -- it's an open question, 

Your Honor.  Yes, they certainly could, but not if it 

impacted a downstream appropriator, as per this compact.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How in the world do any 

States monitor that?  The change in crops, the change in 

irrigation methods, the change in anything that would 

cause a difference in return flow?  Let's assume global 

warming in some form or another evaporated more water, 

and so some crop area did some solar heating that caused 

a greater evaporation.  Is that a breach of the compact?

 So two questions embedded in there.  How 

does any State monitor that, the change in crops or 

change in irrigation methods?  And, second, how far does 

it go in terms of the pre-1950s right to use their 

water?

 MR. BULLOCK:  To the first question, Your 

Honor, even as of 1950, the drafters recognized that 

this was a fully appropriated river; it had reached its 

maximum practical limit.  So each individual downstream 

knows how much water they should be getting.  I mean, we 

have 80 years of measurements on one of these rivers 

alone, and you could go online right now and find out 

what the flow is at the State line occurring as of this 

morning.

So a piece of it that this is something 

we've been doing for a long time in the west as far as 

knowing what water is in the river, where it is, and 

throughout, you know, downstream appropriation.

 To the second question -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But would -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But all that shows is -­

or might show in a particular case, is that the amount 

of water is reduced.  Now the -- then the question is 

have the senior appropriators or the upstream 

appropriators reduced it in a way that's inconsistent or 

that's an overuse of their beneficial rights, and you're 

right -- again right where we started from.  And then 

you have to regulate exactly how each irrigator is using 

the appropriative right.

 MR. BULLOCK:  And, Your Honor, you don't -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So the -- so the flows 

don't necessarily answer the question.

 MR. BULLOCK:  Well, Your Honor, it's 

ultimately up to each State to administer their rights 

and their water intrastate.  But this is a compact among 

sovereigns.  So what we need, what Montana needs, is to 

get that supply of water that it was receiving as of 

1950.

where it's been talking about beneficial uses.  What the 

compact said -- says is appropriative rights to 

beneficial uses.  And to me that suggests, which I 

always understood to be the way water law worked in the 

west, is you have a right to pull out, you know, water, 

and the appropriative right is you have the right to 

take out however much you were taking out.  And the fact 

that less comes back, that's something different.  That 

doesn't affect your appropriation.

 MR. BULLOCK:  Your Honor, even at the time 

of the compact, that Wyoming recognized their paper 

rights, that appropriative right was much more than the 

actual use occurring.  So you can't read beneficial use 

out of -- especially under this compact, but in any. 

Even under the general common law, you only have an 

appropriative right for the beneficial use, and all 

along -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, isn't that 

what's going on here?  The beneficial use is irrigation 

of crops.  They have an appropriative right to take out 

so much flow for that.  That's all they're doing. 

They're doing it now, just as they were back then.  They 

just use up more of it once they've taken it out.

 MR. BULLOCK:  Mr. Chief Justice, two things, 

the first of which, the beneficial use is -- I mean, we

can't read this definition of beneficial use out of the 

contract -- or out of the compact.  And it is a 

contract, actually, among States.  And, also, though -­

second of which, though, that it's also a fundamental 

tenet of prior appropriation law -- is the downstream 

irrigator takes, given the same conditions as when he 

first got his or her right.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Given the same conditions. 

But is there any evidence, or can you say anything from 

the record or any other place, going back to 1950 -- I 

assume in 1950 people knew how much the different 

landowners were taking out of the stream of the river in 

Wyoming to use for irrigation and other such purposes. 

They knew that.

 Is there any indication they knew at that 

time how much each individual landowner was putting 

back?  I think the answer is "no."  But I'd be very 

interested if it's "yes."  And I think it would help you 

a lot if it's "yes," because I'm -­

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER:  To tell you the truth, I'm 

pretty skeptical of the fact that they're writing an 

appropriation right into this about regulating something 

they don't even know about.

could be yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I didn't say it could 

be yes.  I would like you to tell me if the answer is 

yes, and then, of course, I'm going to ask you -­

MR. BULLOCK:  Sure.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- where in the record I 

find something that says that they knew how much each 

individual landowner is putting back into this river in 

Wyoming.  And I think you can't answer that question, 

can you?

 MR. BULLOCK:  I certainly cannot answer 

that, and they didn't need to know, from the 

perspective -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, they didn't?  In other 

words, they didn't know how much is coming back, but 

you're coming in and saying what they were -- what they 

were regulating here is they're saying, not only you 

get -- you maintain a right to take out 100,000 units to 

do your irrigation, but you have to put back 80,000, but 

they didn't even know what the number was, whether it 

was 80, 70, or 60, and the appropriation law is 

ambiguous?  I think -- I think I can go that far with 

you to say it's ambiguous, but I don't see how I can go 

further.

 I mean, that's my basic question.  It's -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm saying, how can you 

read this treaty to require landowners to put back 

amounts into the river that they didn't even know what 

they were?

 MR. BULLOCK:  First, Your Honor, the 

individual landowner does not have to put water back in 

that they didn't even know what they were.  What they do 

need to do is make sure that the beneficial -- the 

appropriative right to beneficial use is existing in 

both States.  The Solicitor General pointed out that we 

don't break up V(A) and V(B) and put one group priority 

over the other, but existing as of 1950 in both States 

shall continue to be enjoyed.  So the only way that we 

can continue to enjoy the rights in Montana downstream 

is to ensure that we have the water supplies that we 

had -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you say you get the 

same amount of water and it's up to -- it's up to 

Wyoming to figure out who they have to cut down for not 

putting back enough to meet that amount?  You don't care 

what private owner it comes from?  It's up to Wyoming to 

figure out who has to be cut back?

and there's an intriguing footnote where the Special 

Master talks about his own -- his own book.  But that 

doesn't seem to me to be conclusive on your point, 

because he's saying the area is confused.  And his point

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to say what you 

say it says.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If your understanding is 

correct, would the result be that landowners in Wyoming 

would only be allowed to consume as much as they 

consumed in 1950, but landowners in Montana could take 

advantage of improved irrigation techniques and use much 

more of the -- they could divert the same amount of 

water, but they could use much more of it?

 MR. BULLOCK:  No, Your Honor, that would not 

be the case.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why wouldn't it?

 MR. BULLOCK:  First, for the irrigators in 

Montana -- I mean, one of the things -- Montana sought 

to have a system of interstate administration.  Montana 

-- or Wyoming, through storage, through curtailing 

consumption by post-'50 users, or otherwise can 

administer its water rights in however it so deems.  So, 

ultimately, that's a decision of the State of how it 

administers the water rights and the consumption of that 

amount that it has.

For Montana, we can't increase consumption 

any more than the water that we would have received at 

that point.  So to the extent that Montana allows an 

individual irrigator to go to 100 percent of consumption 

of its water right, then in our system in Montana, we 

have to deal with what's going to happen to the 

subsequent appropriator right downstream.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And what happens under 

Montana law?

 MR. BULLOCK:  Under Montana law, if there's 

an injury, and that's -- that's actually -- and the 

Special Master pointed this out in another one of his 

footnotes, that that still would be actionable.  Like a 

change from flood irrigation to sprinkler irrigation, to 

the extent that it deprives a downstream user of waters 

that they're relying on, that they could bring an 

action.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but your people can do 

that.  Your people can get more use out of the same 

amount of water diverted by going to sprinkler 

irrigation, whereas the people in Wyoming can't.  That's 

a little unfair, it seems to me.  Right?

 MR. BULLOCK:  Both can, Your Honor.  I mean, 

that -- that is -- I guess the presumption is that we 

would have the water to use it, and Wyoming is actually

getting a lot more production by consuming a lot more of 

the water within its right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Your people are entitled to 

take out the same amount they took out before, right? 

Pre-1950?

 MR. BULLOCK:  Under like water supply 

conditions -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whereas the people in 

Wyoming, you say, are not entitled to take out the same 

amount; they are entitled only net the same amount that 

they had before.  Whereas downstream your people can 

take out the same amount and whereas before 20 percent 

of it used to go back into the stream, they can now make 

use of that whole 20 percent through sprinkler 

irrigation, right?  It gives you a great advantage.

 I mean, maybe that's the way it was written, 

but -- but don't tell me that this is even-handed, 

because it -­

MR. BULLOCK:  Your Honor, I don't think that 

it does give us a great advantage, because we still have 

to deal with the same amount of water supply that we 

would have had.  So, at that point, if we switch to 

sprinkler irrigation, the first irrigator does that, 

there's going to be a shortage down river unless we make 

it up through additional storage or other causes.  So -­

 MR. BULLOCK:  We do a little bit, Your 

Honor.  There's the picture of the basin in the first 

appendix.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I won't -- I won't 

get into that, but it does seem to me that the Chief 

Justice asked the question, if you're entitled to take 

the water, you can use it for any purpose.  I -- I take 

it the answer to that is it has to be a beneficial use, 

it has to be for approximately the same crop, but that 

brings us to this -- to this gray area that the Special 

Master refers to on page 82 as confusing.  And I 

think -- was it page 65 -- he talks about this is a 

confusing area of the law.

MR. BULLOCK:  That's -- that's the only case 

that any of the parties cited that actually deals with 

the change from sprinkler -- or flood to sprinkler 

irrigation.  And what that said is if the return flow 

goes to the same river which it came from, that 

subsequent irrigators or downstream appropriators have 

the right to rely on that.

 And I guess I'd say that my second best case 

is the Special Master's own footnote.  It's 69/12, where 

he says that, you know, even though State change 

procedures don't typically apply to crop or -- changes 

in crop irrigation techniques, this does not mean 

there's no way to challenge increases in efficiency. 

Downstream water users, for example, could sue to enjoin 

an upstream appropriator from increasing consumption or 

to force the upstream appropriator to replace lost 

runoff.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I would think your best 

point is not all of that stuff, but simply the 

definition section, which very clearly makes a 

distinction between beneficial use and diversion.  And 

your point is that what is guaranteed is not the 

diversion right that existed pre-1950, but the 

beneficial use right, which is the net use of the water, 

not -- not the total amount diverted.

If -- if there were not both of those 

definitions, it seems to me it would be a little -- your 

case would be a little harder.  But with the two of 

those definitions there and with V(A) using beneficial 

use rather than -- it could have said diversion, 

appropriative right to diversion, but it didn't say 

that.  It said to beneficial use.

 Well, why -- why define beneficial use that 

way if you don't mean it?  That's your best point, isn't 

it?

 MR. BULLOCK:  I -- I agree, Your Honor.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. BULLOCK:  I was trying to -- I believe 

Justice Kennedy asked for a case or a treatise, so 

that's -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, all right.

 MR. BULLOCK:  But I agree that the plain 

language -- and especially in an area where there's so 

much ambiguities the Special Master acknowledges, why 

change the status quo of what was occurring?  And 

that's -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't understand 

why that's a good -- good answer.  I mean, the 

beneficial use is that use by which the water supply is 

depleted.  Well, the use here is irrigation.  It doesn't

say irrigation up to the technological development in 

1950.  They're still taking out the same amount of water 

for that beneficial use.  They're using it to irrigate. 

And if they get better at it so they use more, well, 

that's just too bad for you.

 MR. BULLOCK:  Your Honor, but they're 

depleting more from the basin, and that's -- I mean, you 

can have beneficial use for non-consumptive purposes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's back where -- that's 

where I was here, too.  See, I can't get too far -- I 

mean, you have the word "depletion" in that definition. 

I -- I -- that might help you.  But I'm thinking in 

accordance with the doctrine of appropriation, what does 

that doctrine, that legal doctrine, say about use and 

return?  And that's why we're -- we're -- why I was 

thinking it seems totally unclear.

 It talks about seepage, the cases, which I 

gather is different from return.  Okay.  So could they 

have really meant net?  And what struck me is that they 

couldn't, which -- which you were beginning to address, 

too, is that they couldn't have meant net because the 

water law at that time is unlikely to have meant net for 

the reason that they didn't -- you don't know what's 

coming back.

 Do you see?  It's not just -- I see your

point.  Your point is, well, Wyoming knew how much was 

going into Wyoming.  But that's not my point.  My point 

is what -- what's the water law?  What's the law of 

appropriation at that time in respect to return flows? 

And if people didn't measure return flows in general, I 

suspect in an ambiguous area they would have analogized 

it to seepage, which is what the -- what the Special 

Master thought.

 MR. BULLOCK:  Your Honor, the seepage cases, 

though, deal with adjoining landowners -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, they -­

MR. BULLOCK:  -- not the same river flow, 

and the Special Master acknowledged that.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Uh-huh.

 MR. BULLOCK:  That -- and I guess what I was 

earlier trying to explain is certainly each appropriator 

knows how much water it would -- would be receiving, 

what the flows typically are, and they all basically 

judge on that.  But I guess if there's any ambiguity -­

and the law wasn't necessarily clear as of 1950 on 

conversions from flood to sprinkler irrigation, but what 

we were trying to do is preserve those uses in both 

States existing as of January 1st, 1950, and we can't do 

that without a water supply.

 Other than the text, I think that the next

place that one would look in interpreting the compact 

would be the legislative history.  And I think that the 

report to the Senate was real good in saying that -­

and this is part of -- it's appended to motion --

Montana's brief in response to the motion to dismiss the 

bill of complaint.  At 3a it says, "It's clear then that 

the demand of one State upon another for a supply 

different from that now obtaining under present 

conditions of supply and diversion is not contemplated, 

nor would such a demand have a legal standing."

 So what they were trying to do in 1950 is 

protect what each State was doing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where is that again -­

where at?

 MR. BULLOCK:  That's at 3a of the appendix, 

Montana's motion -- or the response to Wyoming's motion 

to dismiss the bill of complaint.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General Bullock, assume 

that you're right, that what was guaranteed was the same 

amount of water flowing into Montana as in 1950, and 

I -- I take it you don't care how Wyoming deals with 

this, but what -- if you're right, what could Wyoming 

do?  It can't tell the -- the farmers go back to the old 

way of irrigating or go back to a different crop?

 MR. BULLOCK:  No -- I mean, no, Justice

Ginsburg.  Wyoming could choose to reduce groundwater 

pumping.  They could choose to curtail irrigation on 

post-1950.  They could choose to release storage.  I 

mean, they've -- they've built, I think, 15 new 

reservoirs in Wyoming since the date of the compact. 

They could choose to release water from that to fulfill 

those rights.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, you say it doesn't -­

they don't -- Wyoming doesn't have to know whether 

farmer A or farmer B is taking more than they took in 

1950 -- I mean, is using more than they used in 1950; 

they just have to know what the total amount is, and 

Wyoming can make that up?

 MR. BULLOCK:  Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So really -- I'm sorry. 

The issue is, are both of you -- both of you have pre­

and post-1950 users?

 MR. BULLOCK:  Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  And I -- I 

guess this goes to the second question, which was sort 

of not really addressed.  The Special Master said, well, 

you could cut back your post-1950 users and satisfy all 

of the needs of your pre-1950 users.  Why isn't that the 

answer?  Why isn't that an answer that should be 

respected, because you can satisfy all of the pre-1950

needs that you have potentially?

 MR. BULLOCK:  No, Your Honor, we can't 

necessarily satisfy all the needs.  The drafters did say 

even as of 1950 that this basin reached its maximum 

practicable limit for irrigation, and that's from the 

October -- the last of the drafters meetings.  So -- so, 

the water supply as of then, without additional storage, 

had already hit that limit.  And, ultimately, what we 

need, though, is -- each State will administer 

intrastate, but we still should be able to rely on the 

ability to get a supply of water to meet those needs as 

of 1950 under like water supply conditions.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Before any 1950 use? 

Post-1950 users are permitted?

 MR. BULLOCK:  We're still at the stage of 

discovery, but, yes, likely that's how it would occur, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why isn't this a 

premature lawsuit?  Because I think really the essence 

of your claim is we need the pre-1950 water flow.  We 

don't care who it comes from.  And what -- all the 

Special Master said, in my mind, was the difference -­

you can't look to what the pre-1950s were doing in this 

situation, but I haven't addressed what the posts are 

going to do or have been doing and whether that's right,

and that's depriving you of the water flow.

 I don't know if he answered that question. 

Are you, in fact, entitled to a minimum amount of water 

flow?  That's really what should be the point of the 

issue, isn't it?

 MR. BULLOCK:  It is, or that quantity under 

like water supply conditions.  I don't think it's 

premature.  We've tried to administer this compact, 

actually made calls in 2004 and 2006; and as a result of 

not getting the water, knowing -- believing we're in a 

water-short time, that's when we filed this action.

 I'd like to reserve my time if I may.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER KENNETH MICHAEL

 ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANT WYOMING

 MR. MICHAEL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Court has identified in previous 

questioning this case at this point in this issue 

involves whether a Wyoming or a Montana diverter may 

change cropping patterns, may change various 

technologies in irrigated agriculture, and change up and 

down, depending on the year and the fallowing of land 

and that sort of thing, the amount of water that is

actually consumed by crops.  And I think the Court has 

identified the critical fact that a water right, a 

classic western water right, appropriative right as in 

article V(A), is made up of the right to divert an 

amount of water at a head gate in an irrigation 

situation, put it on a defined quantity of land, and use 

it for a purpose, irrigation, that's defined by the 

State.  Wyoming has had such a -- a system in place for 

many years and controls those issues but does not and 

has not attempted to measure consumptive.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But what is the 

controlling principle in answering the question that I 

think you properly put?  Could these irrigators switch 

to something like rice, which absorbs a tremendous 

amount of water, or are they -- when they switch crops 

it must be reasonably close to the earlier beneficial 

use?  What is -- what is the standard that we look to, 

to answer that question?

 MR. MICHAEL:  The standard is the standard 

of waste, practical irrigation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The standard of?

 MR. MICHAEL:  Waste, of not wasting water, 

practical irrigation.  The irrigation right is a general 

right, and if rice were to double the amount of 

consumptive use by the crop, that would be permissible

if the previous use had not been affected by an 

abandonment action, because the amount of water was 

being reasonably used for the former crop and the crop 

has changed.  So it's not a question of -- of percentage 

change.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I thought -­

MR. MICHAEL:  It's a question -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose the first -­

suppose the first crop absorbs 50 percent of the water 

and returns 50 percent by seepage.  The second crop that 

they switch to still absorbs just 50 percent of the 

water but because of the -- of the pattern, the other 50 

percent just evaporates?

 MR. MICHAEL:  The -- the way that the water 

is -- there's -- there's a basket, Your Honor.  There's 

a basket that starts with a quantity that's taken at the 

head gate, 4 cubic feet per second put on the -- on the 

field.  And within that quantity there -- there's 

multiple -- two components, basically:  the amount 

consumed by the crop -- I should say the amount consumed 

by the crop or depleted by other elements, ditches, 

seepage, other types of things, deep percolation into 

the ground -- and -- and the other component which is 

water that's not lost but can return or go somewhere. 

It's not evaporated; there's no transpiration.  So

there's those two components.

 And if that -- if that quantity, that 

division changes, that's perfectly permissible within 

the use of the water right.  And the reason for that was 

set out in Wiel's -- Samuel Wiel's text in 1911, carried 

forward in texts and cases ever since, that -- and in 

the Binning case, a 1940 case in Wyoming; which is the 

water while it's in the stream in the public common is 

-- is not under the possession and control -- the 

personal property control of the irrigator.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But we're dealing here with 

a compact which has a text, and -- and what the water 

law of Wyoming or of Montana happened to be cannot 

overrule the text, and I am -- I'm hung up on the fact 

that article V(A) says appropriative rights to the 

beneficial uses of the water of the Yellowstone River 

System existing as of January 1, 1950.  Appropriative 

rights not to diversion, not to diversion for beneficial 

uses, but appropriative rights to the beneficial uses, 

which is defined -- which is defined in the compact to 

say "that use by which the water supply of a drainage 

basin is depleted when usefully employed."

 And it could have said diversion, but it 

didn't say that, and I notice that the Government's 

brief uses -- seems to use the words interchangeably,

"depletion" and "diversion."  They're not 

interchangeable.  They're defined quite separately in 

this thing.  And besides which I find it implausible 

that Montana signed on to, well, we don't know how much 

water we're going to get; it depends, you know, upon how 

much stuff was -- was flowing back before, but we're not 

guaranteed that that will be flowing back again.

 You combine those two things, and I -- I -­

what do you do about that definition?

 MR. MICHAEL:  Your Honor, the definition has 

two components, the classic beneficial -- the component 

that would come from a classic beneficial use 

definition, which is useful employment for the 

activities of man, a beneficial purpose, which -- a non­

wasteful purpose.  That's the start.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not how it's 

defined.

 MR. MICHAEL:  That's -- that's the last 

portion.  That's the second part.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's fine.

 MR. MICHAEL:  The first part is use by which 

the water supply of a drainage basin is depleted.  In 

the western United States, a drainage basin -­

appropriable water is not all the water in the air and 

on the land and dropping from the sky; appropriable

water is water confined in a water course.  The Binning 

case made that clear.  Until the water returned from the 

field into a water course, it was not appropriable by 

the downstream user.  So this definition -- by using 

the -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But are you addressing the 

word "depleted"?

 MR. MICHAEL:  I'm addressing the word 

"supply" of the drainage basin; and then it is depleted. 

Use by which the supply, the water supply of a drainage 

basin, is depleted.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But are you saying that 

"depleted" means only what's withdrawn, and it's not 

calculated by -- with reference to what is returned?

 MR. MICHAEL:  That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But you -- obviously, 

you're saying -­

MR. MICHAEL:  That is different from 

"diverted."

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You read it with a 

different emphasis.  Justice Scalia read it with -­

beneficial use is that use by which the water supply of 

a drainage basin "is depleted" when usefully employed by 

the activities of man.

 And you read it:  By which the water supply

of a drainage basin is depleted "when usefully employed 

by the activities of man."  So that it is a definition 

in respect to how you use it, not amounts.

 But if you emphasize the word "depleted," it 

could be read as referring to amounts, and not quality 

of use, not nature.  And -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why don't you emphasize 

both of them?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, well -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm willing to emphasize 

both, but you can't write out the "depleted" out of the

from "diversion"?

 MR. MICHAEL:  If you had a broader -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is the diversion for a 

beneficial use the same thing as a depletion?

 MR. MICHAEL:  May I give an example?

 In a -- in a river, the Tongue River, if 

there is a -- if there is a waterwheel, Montana allows 

water rights.  A 1912 case, Hennessy v. Featherman, 

allows a water right to push a waterwheel.  That water 

flowing down the river does not -- does not -- is not 

diverted.  And nevertheless it -- it would allow a water 

right.

 This definition differentiates that.  In

this definition under the compact, water that is 

diverted for agriculture, that is diverted is a 

beneficial use, but there's a small segment of -- of 

what could be a legitimate water right that is excluded 

under this definition.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, but, I mean, to -- to 

do that, the definition would have read:  The term 

"beneficial use" is defined to be that use by which the 

water -- that use "for which" the water supply of a 

drainage basin is diverted for useful employment by the 

activities of man, and that's not what it says.  To the 

contrary, it makes a clear distinction between 

"depletion" and the previous definition of "diversion."

 I just -- I was trying to give that stark 

difference some effect in the later section V(A).

 MR. MICHAEL:  Let me say this, Your Honor, 

if I might:  The -- you will find in -- in the compact, 

in article V(B), the use of both "diversion" and 

"beneficial use."

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.

 MR. MICHAEL:  And so we have two -- those 

terms are both used.  And in V(B) the drafters made a 

distinction; they said direct diversions or storage 

would be covered by V(B), and then they said how 

diversions are counted.

drainage basin would -- being the quantities of water in 

the rivers themselves, would be depleted would be 

through a diversion.  So there's really no reason to 

make a distinction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just to follow up on 

Justice Kennedy's point, because I think it's important: 

So you were reading -- when it says "is depleted," you 

think all you have to show is that it's less than when 

you started, and once that is shown, it is depleted.

Then you're saying, but we can deplete as much as we 

want?

 MR. MICHAEL:  Yes, depletion would be moving 

it from this glass of water, if that was the river -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.

 MR. MICHAEL:  -- and it reduces the quantity 

of water in the river.  That would be a depletion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you don't care 

how much?  You're saying, well, this is a beneficial use 

because it depletes some of the water, it takes some 

away, and once we have gotten over that hurdle, all bets 

are off and we can deplete as much as we want.

 MR. MICHAEL:  Yes.  And, of course, the 

water right -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I guess to get 

back to the point, wouldn't the normal word be "divert"?

 MR. MICHAEL:  It may well be, Your Honor. 

There's -- there's some problems with this definition. 

It self-defines itself using "usefully" twice, so we 

have some drafting issues with -- with this -- in some 

of these.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, could I go back 

to my question, which is twofold?  The first is the 

Solicitor General recommends that we defer the decision 

on remedies in this case, and Montana seems to agree.

Do you agree as well?  The second question presented.

 MR. MICHAEL:  That has been deferred, is my 

understanding.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It has?  My problem with 

this is -- and I think I need to understand what the 

fight is about here, or what the dispute is about -- it 

really does seem to me that it is a question of 

remedies, not about whether you're taking more water 

rights through irrigation or not.

 If I understand this compact right, both of 

you are protected in your pre-1950 beneficial uses. 

Each of you appear, under the terms of article V, to be 

entitled to get enough water to fill those uses.  The 

next section, the one that you read earlier, lets you 

use things in the future for post-1950 uses, but only if 

the water supply's protected pre-1950 beneficial uses 

have received all they're entitled to.  Neither of you 

are entitled or -- to take anything post-1950 until 

pre-1950 is protected.

 That's how I read article V.  Am I reading 

it wrong?  Because it seems to me that the only time 

that we get into a dispute -- and this is the part that 

I think your adversary may be right about, ultimately -­

is it's not a consumptive compact, but it's a use 

compact, and both of you are entitled to get a full -­

that's what I'm reading article V to say, to get enough 

water to satisfy the beneficial uses before anybody's 

entitled to post-1950 water.

 Tell me what in the language of article V 

suggests something different than that understanding.

 MR. MICHAEL:  I disagree -- the language in 

article V that disagrees with that is the very first few 

words, "appropriative rights."  Appropriative rights do 

not guarantee that any water user or any group of water 

users will be satisfied.  1934 was a horrendously dry 

year in the basin, 50 percent -- flows were 50 percent 

less than normal.  In those kinds of years, the river -­

the river dried up that year in parts of the river, 

so -- well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But this is not 

happening today, is it?  There's -­

MR. MICHAEL:  Oh, yes.  It happened in 2004.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right, but that's an 

isolated year.

 MR. MICHAEL:  Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In most years, are you 

putting water to post-1950 use -- to post-1950 uses or 

not?  Have you been regularly putting water to post-1950 

uses?

MR. MICHAEL:  Both States, at times.  Yes, 

last year, all post-1950 uses got satisfied.  It varies 

widely.  But the point is that only the appropriative 

right, which is not a guarantee of a quantity of 

water -- so the first clause of the compact, article 

V(A), does not establish a quantity of water, and there 

are many compacts that do this.  They establish a 

quantity of water, and they do it -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't disagree.

 MR. MICHAEL:  -- quite simply.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't disagree, but as 

I read the article, it says, you put all the water 

that's available to pre-1950 appropriated uses.  You 

then go, as I read the second part of this article, to 

any water supplies that each State has until you fulfill 

those 1950 appropriated uses.  And then it apportions, 

between the two of you, post-1950 percentages of the 

excess water that you're entitled to have.

 Am I correct about that structure?

 MR. MICHAEL:  Yes, and on an ongoing basis. 

It's not a quantity.  None of this is done in quantity.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly.

 MR. MICHAEL:  It's all done in a system 

that's dynamic.

understand the remedies were deferred, but to the extent 

that we were to rule that appropriated rights included 

the right to change irrigation methods or crops -- we 

don't have to reach crops, because that's not at issue 

here -- in the end, you're only entitled to take the 

appropriated uses, including irrigation rights, that 

existed pre-1950.  Are they entitled to get as much 

water as necessary to satisfy their pre-1950 rights or 

not -­

MR. MICHAEL:  No.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- before you can use 

post-1950 water?

 MR. MICHAEL:  Yes.  Yes, before -- on these 

-- on those particular dates.  On those particular 

dates, if there are pre-1950 rights in Montana that are 

not satisfied on that river and there's post-1950 rights 

in Wyoming, the Special Master has ruled, contrary to 

Wyoming's argument -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But how -- why aren't 

you taking more of the percentage that way of post-1950 

waters?  The compact says, post-1950, you can take 

whatever percentage it was.  I've forgotten what 

percentage that might have been.

 MR. MICHAEL:  60 percent.

percent -­

MR. MICHAEL:  This might add on that.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They're entitled to 40. 

Does that mean you can take a hundred percent, because 

there happens to be more water that they can satisfy the 

pre-1950s users with?  Why aren't they entitled to their 

40 percent of whatever that big basin is so they can 

give more water to post-1950 users, that they can 

exploit their full 40 percent?

 MR. MICHAEL:  Your Honor, I'm not following, 

because there's a distinction between each class of 

water.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes, I understand that.

 MR. MICHAEL:  And in your -- in your 

question, I'm not following which class you are 

referring to.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I -- I'm answering 

this only -- I'm asking this because I know we've 

deferred decision on the remedies -­

MR. MICHAEL:  Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- but for me that is so 

integral to the issue here because when they talk about 

being entitled to a water flow, I see that as being 

entitled to a pre-1950 satisfaction of water needs or 

beneficial uses before anybody gets post-1950 water.

And so, I see the only issue before us, 

because remedies have been put aside, as to whether the 

beneficial use includes some percentage increase because 

of irrigation demands, but so what?  It just means it's 

going to limit post-1950 users.  It's not going to limit 

the rights of the pre-1950 users.

 Everybody's entitled to change their 

irrigation methods.  Everybody's entitled to change 

their crops.  They appear not to be entitled to put the 

water to a new use, whatever -- however that's defined. 

We don't need to get there today, but I'm not sure how 

you're entitled to post-1950 uses while they're still 

not satisfied in 1950 use.

 MR. MICHAEL:  We -- Wyoming is not entitled 

on the same river to take post-1950 water when there is 

a pre-1950 use in Montana that's not satisfied.  The 

Special Master has held that.  Pre-1950s are -­

recommitted to the Special Master.  So for that -- for 

that reason the parties have addressed only the first 

exception in this argument today.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you -- but your 

brief, before we entered that order, said the Special 

Master was right, that they have to satisfy their needs 

from pre -- post-1950 users.  Why?  Aren't they entitled 

to their 40 percent of how much excess water there may 

be after their pre-1950 users have been satisfied in 

full?  Doesn't this compact say both of their pre-1950 

users have to be satisfied first?

 MR. JAY:  Both of their pre-1950 users have 

to be satisfied first, yes, we agree with that, so that 

no one in Wyoming is supposed to be taking post-1950 

water until pre-1950 users in Montana are satisfied.  We 

agree with that.

 The -- the point on which -- that the Court 

has sent back to the Special Master is what happens if 

pre-1950 users in Montana are not satisfied but they 

could be because Montana post-1950 users in Montana are 

also diverting water.  But what we think the -- the 

question squarely before the Court here is whether the 

right to recapture water gained from increased 

efficiency is part of the pre-1950 appropriative right, 

and that matters when there's not enough water in the

JUSTICE BREYER:  And so, on your theory in 

that situation where there isn't enough for all the

 (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I mean, I 

don't mean -- I mean, isn't that the difference between 

eastern water law and western water law?  In the east, 

you try to allocate everything fairly so everyone is 

treated fairly, and I thought in the west, for reasons 

of efficiency, it's first come, first served.

 MR. JAY:  And here the States decided not to 

do that on an interstate basis.  They said that -- that 

all pre-1950 users would be on the same footing as 

between the States.  So that Montana cannot complain 

if -- as long as Wyoming's water users pre-1950 are not 

exceeding their pre-1950 right, Montana has no remedy 

and there's no breach.  They concede that on page 20 of 

their surreply.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Jay, I thought that 

the Special Master -- very important to him was the 

meaning of "appropriative rights," and he said that the 

Wyoming law is just as you've described, that is, the 

farmer can use all that water; and he said Montana law

is uncertain, but Wyoming law is not out of line with 

the general approach.

 Suppose this had been a case -- suppose 

Montana law, instead of being uncertain, was 

diametrically opposite Wyoming law, then what happens 

under this compact?

 MR. JAY:  Under this compact, Justice 

Ginsburg, the appropriative rights existing in each 

signatory State as of January 1st, 1950, are what are 

preserved and carried forward by article V(A).  Each 

water user in -- in each State has exactly the same 

rights that he had on January 1st, 1950.  Now, in 

Montana perhaps that might not include the right to 

recapture efficiencies, but we know, for example, that 

-- that a Montana water user could divert more water per 

acre because Montana had a more generous concept of 

beneficial use for irrigation per acre than Wyoming did.

 The compact simply carries forward all 

existing appropriative rights, and the drafters 

consciously rejected the idea that they should come up 

with some kind of interstate administration system 

putting the two States' rights on an equal footing. 

They carried forward each element in the bundle of 

sticks that a rights holder had on January 1st, 1950, 

subject to the single override of the definition of

"beneficial use."  And I'd like to turn to that because 

Justice Scalia's colloquy with Mr. Michael brought that 

out.

 In article II(H), there is a definition of 

"beneficial use."  What the compact's definition of 

"beneficial use" does is specify that non-depletive uses 

don't count.  Hydropower is a classic example. 

Hydropower in the main channel is something that one 

could get an appropriative right for under some western 

water law.

II -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could you -- and this is 

MR. JAY:  II(H), which is on page A-4 to the 

appendix of the Special Master's report.  That's the 

definition of "beneficial use."

 What it does not do is specify that 

depletion is the measure of beneficial use.  It says 

beneficial use is not the use to the extent that the 

water supply is depleted; it's the use -- it's a use by 

which the water supply is depleted.  Because irrigation 

means water goes out and doesn't come -- and some of it 

doesn't come back, irrigation is a depletive use.  It's 

recognized by the compact.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, hydropower would -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course it's quantified. 

I mean, the whole purpose is you can't take any more 

than you were taking before.  It has to be quantified 

somehow.

 MR. JAY:  It's not quantified in the 

sense -- as Justice Breyer pointed out, no one -- they 

didn't write down, especially in Montana, because as the 

Special Master said on page 22, Montana didn't have a 

centralized system of rights; they didn't know exactly 

how much was being diverted in Montana.  They certainly 

didn't know how much was being consumed or how much was 

being returned to the river.

 At Joint Appendix 585, there's a Federal 

Power Commission report that says that it is almost 

impossible to make an accurate determination of return 

flow.  So what -- what the drafters did was they -- for 

the pre-1950 rights, they said we're not going to cap -­

quantify them at all; we're going to grandfather them 

in, freeze them in place.

 MR. JAY:  My argument, Justice Breyer, is 

that they didn't want mill races or hydropower to count.

races in the definition, so they purposely didn't use 

the word "diversion"; that's why they used the word

In other words, they may have a right to get 50 cubic 

whatever for irrigation, but there may not be any water 

there for them to use it because of the increased 

efficiencies upstream.

 MR. JAY:  That -- that is true, Mr. Chief 

Justice, but that has always been the case under western 

water law that the appropriative right is a priority, 

that when it's your turn and there's enough water, you 

get to take the amount of water to which you have a 

right.  But it was clear in Wyoming on January 1st, 

1950, that the appropriative right -- so long as you 

took the same quantity from the river, you took it from 

the same point on the river, you put it to the same use, 

irrigation, on the same acreage -- that you could then 

change crops, for example.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In II -- in II(H), do you 

think "beneficial use is hereby defined to be that use 

by which water supply is depleted" -- and we're looking 

at "depleted."  Do you define "depleted" as what is 

taken without any reference to what is returned?

 MR. JAY:  I -- I think that that's right. 

I 

think I agree, Justice Kennedy, but it has to be a 

depletive use in the sense that some water -- some water 

has to come out that doesn't come back.  So it's not -­

it's not the same -- the mill -- a mill race is not a

depletion, even though some water -- some water comes 

out because it then -- because it then comes back.  But 

what our -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I mean, that's -­

that's the key to this case, I take it.  Wyoming is 

telling us that what goes back is irrelevant so long as 

what is taken is for a recognized beneficial use.

 MR. JAY:  The reason it's irrelevant, 

Justice Kennedy, is that -- for two reasons.  Depletion 

is not the measure of beneficial use.  It's a -- it is a 

criterion for beneficial use.  The use has to be a 

depletive one; but it's not the measure of the 

beneficial use.

 And the second point, Montana seeks to 

equate consumption with depletion, and that's -- that's 

not correct, either.

 We urge the Court to overrule the exception. 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Jay.

 General, you have 2 minutes left.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE BULLOCK

 ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

 MR. BULLOCK:  Mr. Chief Justice, members of 

the Court:

 Briefly, that, as Justice Scalia pointed

out, this is a compact, and it's a compact between two 

different States, and Montana gave up things, a right of 

priority administration across State lines as a result 

of that.

 Justice Breyer, as an issue of fairness, we 

don't get all the water.  We only get water supply under 

like conditions.  We are now the downstream 

appropriator, so -- but one example, if half the water 

is flowing now that it was, as of 1950, Montana may not 

get anything at that point, because just by the virtue 

of -- some say it's "highology," whoever is higher on 

the river gets to take first.

 So we -- we don't get to fulfill our rights. 

All we get is to ensure that, given a like supply of 

water, that our right shall continue to be enjoyed as it 

existed as of 1950.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How many years has there 

been not enough water to fill all pre-19 -- forget about 

whether there was post-1950 use.  How many years are we 

talking about in which there has been not enough water 

to fill everybody's?

 MR. BULLOCK:  And -- Your Honor, we've done 

no discovery at all.  This is still at the motion to 

dismiss complaint.  And that's what the hydraulics and 

the engineers will ultimately determine.  We made calls

 We said:  Wait a minute, we're not getting 

enough water here, and we believe it's the -- the 

pre-1950 uses that are depleting that.  Will you give us 

water?

out.

 Ultimately, why we're here is to sort this 

 I guess I'd also point out that there was 

some discussion about an appropriative right is the 

right to use a quantity of water.  That makes sense 

other than if you're in a compact, and Montana gets no 

water.  The Solicitor General even pointed out then in 

his brief at a footnote -- he said, well, what we might 

do, then, is that Montana could bring an equitable 

apportionment action for the pre-1950 water.

 That highlights the -- I think to me, the 

illogic of just focusing on the rights and not looking 

at the uses and how much each State was consuming, 

because at that point I'll be right back here saying we 

want the same water under like conditions that we had in 

1950.

 Thank you, Your Honor.
