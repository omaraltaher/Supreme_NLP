CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  No.  14­916,  Kingdomware 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Technologies  v.  United  States. 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Saunders. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  THOMAS  G.  SAUNDERS 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

By  its  plain  terms,  the  2006  Veterans  Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires  the  VA  to  consider  veterans  first  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule  of  Two  before  awarding  contracts  to  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppliers. 

            

That  mandate,  which  applies  only  to  the  VA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  reflects  the  agency's  unique  obligation  to  veterans, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contains  no  exception  for  the  contracts  formed  when  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

VA  makes  awards  under  the  Federal  Supply  Schedule.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government's  attempt  to  create  such  an  exception 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fares  no  better  than  its  prior  attempts  to  resist  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandate. 

            

Its  semantic  distinction  between  contracts 

 

 

 

 

and  orders  conflicts  with  its  own  concession  that  an  FSS 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  is  a  contract  in  the  ordinary  sense.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

creates  ­­

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Before  you  get  too  deeply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

into  the  merits  of  the  case,  could  you  just  tell  us  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief  you  could  get  at  this  point  that's  consistent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  Tucker  Act? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  We're  seeking  a  declaratory 

   

  

 

 

judgment  that,  with  respect  to  these  particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procurements,  the  VA  erred  in  failing  to  conduct  market 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

research  and  ­­ and  to  apply  the  Rule  of  Two  before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  straight  to  the  FSS. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  On  the  ground  that  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  capable  of  repetition  yet  evasive  of  review,  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  ­­ your  answer  to  the  mootness? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Absolutely.  It's  ­­ it's 

  

  

 

 

 

recurred  ­­ the  same  situation's  recurred  numerous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

times.  Even  during  the  course  of  this  litigation, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kingdomware  continues  to  be  actively  competing  for  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts,  and  these  contracts  are  of  a  short  duration. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  What  was  the  amount  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  contract? 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  This  contract  was  for  a  base 

   

  

 

 

 

 

amount  of  $33,000. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Isn't  it  strange  to  get  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

declaratory  judgment  that  something  unlawful  occurred  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  past  but  that  no  other  relief  is  available  for  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

past  violation  of  the  law?

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Well,  no  other  relief  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

available  solely  because  of  the  passage  of  time  it  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken  for  this  case  to  work  its  way  up  to  this  Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that's  why  the  doctrine  of  capable  of  repetition  yet 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evading  a  view  ­­ review  is  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  ­­ what  I'm  getting  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is:  What  good  would  such  a  declaratory  judgment  do? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Well,  once  ­­ once  the  legal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights,  once  the  meaning  of  8127(d)  is  established  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  by  that  declaratory  judgment,  then  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward,  you  would  expect  that  the  VA  will  comply  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court's  interpretation  of  the  law.  And  so  it  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  tremendous  benefit  to  the  veterans  community  going 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward  from  that  declaration,  from  that  elucidation  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  legal  rights  here. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You  did  ­­ your  client 

  

 

 

 

 

 

stipulated  away  the  cost  that  it  would  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled  to  after  winning  before  the  GAO,  correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  The  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  there  was  relief. 

  

 

 

 

 

You  just  gave  it  away,  essentially. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Well,  the  ­­ the  Tucker  Act 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  allow  for  the  protest  costs,  and  so  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant  costs  that  might  have  been  allowed  would  be  bid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preparation  costs.

But  the  very  point  of  this  case  is  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  an  opportunity  to  bid.  This  isn't  a  situation  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  the  opportunity  was  put  out  there  and  Kingdomware 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  able  to  compete  for  it.  It  was  ­­ it  skipped 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  the  Rule  of  Two  process  required  by  8127,  went 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

straight  to  the  Federal  Supply  Schedule,  and  the  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Kingdomware  ever  learned  of  it  was  when  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

announcement  went  up  saying  that  the  contract  had  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

awarded  on  the  sole­source  basis  to  someone  else  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  Supply  Schedule. 

 

 

 

            

So  under  the  circumstances  of  this  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  it's  about  the  government  going  to  a  procedure  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't  be  going  to  first,  there's  no  opportunity  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amass  those  bid  protests. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Your  client  is  still  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

FSS  vendor  and  is  still  competing  for  contact  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts  that  the  ­­

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Okay. 

  

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  And  ­­ and  our  client  ­­ he's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

listed  it  in  the  FSS,  but  most  importantly  for  this  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  service­disabled  veteran­owned  small  business  and 

   

 

 

 

 

continues  to  be  listed  in  the  VA's  database,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limits  the  eligibility  for  the  Rule  of  Two  here.

position  that  if  we  rule  in  your  favor,  that  means  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  doing  away  with,  effectively,  the  FSS. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Is  that  your  view? 

 

 

 

MR.  SAUNDERS:  No.  Absolutely  not.  The  FSS 

  

  

  

 

 

 

is  still  going  to  apply  to  a  large  number  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procurements.  Congress,  when  it  made  this  targeted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

provision  mandatory  and  focused  on  the  VA,  also  said  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8127(e)  that  it  only  applies  to  the  businesses  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registered  in  the  VA's  database. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  it  did  that  for  two  reasons:  Number 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one,  as  opposed  to  the  self­certification  procedures  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Small  Business  Act,  which  are  more  open  to  abuse,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted  to  prescreen  and  make  sure  these  are  the  real 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deal  here  in  the  database.  And  that  also  ensures  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  VA  has  this  information  at  its  fingertips. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Currently,  there  are  about  7,000  people 

 

 

 

 

 

listed  in  that  database.  There  are  going  to  be  tons  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procurements  for  which  the  VA  will  simply  consult  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own  database  and  see  that  there  is  no  veteran­owned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business  that's  eligible  to  do  this. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Can  it  tell  from  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

database  whether  or  not  a  particular  vendor  is  a  veteran 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

or  a  disabled  veteran? 

   

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Oh,  absolutely.  The  ­­ the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

database  ­­ and  this  is  one  ­­ this  is  very  clear  ­­ the

VA  has  its  own  VA­specific  database  mandated  by  law  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  limited  to  veteran­owned  and  service­disabled, 

 

 

 

 

 

veteran­owned  small  businesses.  And  the  only  people  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  eligible  under  8127(e)  for  this  preference  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  who  are  contained  in  that  database. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  there's  two 

  

 

 

 

databases.  There  is  the  general  database  and  there  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  FSS  database.  Are  we  talking  about  the  same  one? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  No,  we're  talk  ­­ we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  a  separate  VA­specific  database.  And  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

and  so  what's  happening  is  the  VA  is  gathering  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information.  It  knows  who  the  veteran­owned  small 

  

 

 

 

 

 

businesses  are.  And  then,  rather  than  consulting  its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

own  database  to  see  who  they  are,  it's  been  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

straight  to  the  FSS. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Which  ­­ and  then  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are  wanting  to  do  away  with  the  FSS? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  No,  not  at  all.  Because  ­­

FSS  and  find  the  veteran­owned  businesses? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Not  ­­ not  under  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

mandate,  because  the  ­­ the  mandate  here  in  the  law  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tied  to  the  VA's  database.  And  people  who  are  listed  as

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Saunders,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

that  Justice  Sotomayor's  question  is  asking  you  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address  what  happens  if  there's  than  urgent  need.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  you  would  concede  it's  a  slower  process  if  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  use  the  Rule  of  Two.  And  ­­ and  suppose  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  an  urgent  need  for  a  certain  good  or  service. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Well,  two  things:  Number 

  

  

 

 

 

one,  the  Rule  of  Two  only  applies  when  you  have  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fair  and  reasonable  price  and  best  value  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States.  So  if  there's  truly  an  urgent  need  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  not  going  to  be  met  by  going  through  the  Rule  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Two,  then  I  think  you  have  leeway  within  the  best­value 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  that 

  

 

 

 

 

strikes  me  as  a  ­­ a  very  thin  protection. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

Are  ­­ these  terms  imply  a  lot  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

discretion:  What's  fair?  What's  reasonable?  What's 

  

  

  

 

 

best  value?  The  idea  that  that's  going  to  operate  as  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  restraint  on  the  requirement  that  the  VA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

locate  veteran  businesses  seems  a  real  stretch  to  me. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  But  ­­ but  the  process 

  

 

 

 

 

 

here  ­­ I  mean  ­­ take  you  through  the  process  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applying  the  Rule  of  Two.  It's  limited  to  the  universe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  people  in  the  database.  So  all  the  VA  has  to  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  fire  up  its  own  database  and  see  who's  out  there.

For  the  heartland  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  How  is  it  apparent  that  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

particular  veteran's  business  can  perform  a  particular 

   

 

 

 

 

contract?  I  mean,  what  in  the  database  shows  you,  yes, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  veteran's  small  business  is  capable  of  performing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  contract  in  a  reasonably  effective  way? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  The  ­­ because  the  database 

  

 

 

 

 

 

has  the  North  American  Industry  Classification  System 

 

 

 

 

 

 

codes,  which  are  actually  the  same  codes  that  correspond 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  what's  in  the  FSS. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  to  the  extent  there  is  additional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  that's  needed,  it's  very  easy  to  contact  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

veterans  in  those  ­­ that  database. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Counsel,  could  you 

  

 

 

 

 

get  back  to  your  answer  to  my  question? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Oh.  And  ­­ and  so  there's  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  heartland  of  ­­ of  small­business  contracting, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ are  going  to  fall  into  the  simplified  acquisition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures  under  part  13  of  the  Federal  Acquisition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Regulation.  That's  for  services  under  $150,000.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

for  procurement  of  goods,  it's  now  up  to  $7  million. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  under  that  system,  you  have  a  greatly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

streamlined  process  for  the  smallest  contracts,  micro 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchases.  It's  ­­ it's  really  just  you  make  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  for  the  sort  of  lower  tier  of  contracts,

certainly  for  anything  under  $25,000,  all  the  ­­ all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  doing  is  placing  a  purchase  order  under  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

simplified  acquisition  procedures. 

 

 

            

There  is  a  standard  form.  It's  Form  1449. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

It's  a  single  sheet  of  paper.  And  that's  the  purchase 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  that  they  place.  And  quite  frankly,  the  form 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looks  almost  identical  to  FSS  Form  347  for  how  you  place 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  order. 

 

            

So  for  the  lower­level  stuff,  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already  a  procedure  outside  the  FSS  that's  incredibly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

streamlined.  And  as  you  begin  to  get  to  larger 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollar­valued  contracts,  the  requirements  of  going 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  FSS  begin  to  ramp  up  in  terms  of  having  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seek  price  reductions.  And  also,  if  you  think  of  how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  FSS  operates  in  terms  of  services,  you  might  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

listed  on  there  for  the  GSA  as  someone  who  can  provide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  technology,  customized  computer  programming. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  to  go  to  Justice  Kagan's  question  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  do  you  know  can  you  actually  do  this  work?  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  process  plays  out  under  the  FSS.  For  the  services, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes,  someone's  listed  as  a  custom  computer  programmer. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

But  the  agency  still  has  to  issue  a  statement  of  work 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  this  is  what  we  actually  need  done.  Here  are  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements.  It  puts  that  out  there  with  their  request 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  quotations  that  come  in  from  the  various  FSS

Now,  they  will  be  constrained  by,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  prices  that  they  listed  before  on  the  FSS,  but  it

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  When  is  it  ­­ what's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  I  suppose  there  is 

   

  

 

 

 

some  system  for  the  government  to  check  to  see  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  not  this  person  really  has  been  offering  this  good, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  ­­ has  a  track  record,  because  that  goes  with  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fair  and  reasonable  price? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Yes,  absolutely.  And  they 

  

  

 

 

 

can  compare,  you  know,  a  broad  ­­ when  they're  doing  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market  research,  they  have  a  lot  of  flexibility  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

compare  here. 

 

            

The  other  thing  I  will  say  is  that  there  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  broad  grant  of  discretion  to  the  VA  in  terms  of  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  requires  in  the  database.  So  if  it  finds  that  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needs  more  information  to  make  this  law  work  up  front 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  vendors,  then  it  can  require  that.  It  can  take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  effort  that  it  spent  resisting  the  mandate  and  put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  into  making  the  mandate  work  within  its  existing  ­­

value  to  the  United  States  is  one  of  the  qualifications. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  understand  fair  and  reasonable  price.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

what  is  offer  best  value  to  the  United  States?  What 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  that  add  to  the  fair  and  reasonable  price? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Well,  best  value  is  designed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  go  beyond  price.  It's  ­­ it's  really  sort  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

totality  of  the  circumstances.  It  lets  the  government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider  quality,  its  ­­ its  needs.  In  this  case  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  allow  it  to  consider  the  urgency  of  a  particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procurement. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  the  sort  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

thing  that  there  will  be  an  awful  lot  of  litigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about,  don't  you  think? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Against 

  

 

a  framework  that  has 

   

 

 

been  recognized,  the  discretion  ­­

 

 

 

 

you  know,  there's 

 

 

 

litigation  within  an  APA  framework 
 

 

 

 

 

in  terms  of  arbitrary 

 

 

 

and  capricious  review. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS: 

 

 

  

Well,  you're  putting 

 

 

a  lot  more  weight  on  that  ­­ excuse  me  ­­ on  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  if  you  prevail  on  your  statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  argument.  And  it  seems  to  me  that  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  is  inevitably  going  to  lead  to  litigation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

How  do  you  tell  what's  best?  It's  a  combination  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

price  and  quality.  It's  not  any  absolute  that  you  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identify,  and  you  know,  what's  fair,  what's  reasonable.

MR.  SAUNDERS:  We  ­­ we  don't  have  direct

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Well,  under  the  Small 

  

 

 

 

 

Business  Act,  there  were  agencies  that  were  doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set­asides,  and  then  it  was  made  explicit  that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  do  set­asides  within  the  FSS.  We  also  have  been

value  contracts  are  just  as  simple,  if  not  in  many  ways, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simpler. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  you're  not  talking 

  

 

 

 

 

about  just  the  small  value  contracts.  You  want  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supply  to  all  contracts,  to  all  orders.  So  to  tell  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  works  for  the  small  ones  is  not  answering  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions  of  my  colleagues.  How  much  is  it  going  to

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Well,  for  the  ­­ for  the  big 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ones,  the  FSS  itself  is  already  complicated.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

already  ramping  up  in  complexity  as  the  contracts  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bigger. 

            

And  quite  frankly,  when  we  get  to  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bigger  dollar  figures,  the  idea  that  if  ­­ if  a  small 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business  is  going  to  qualify  for  a  contract  that's  above 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$150,000,  that  we  can't  go  through  the  procedures  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  mandated  here,  the  VA  can't  even  consult  its

supplier  before  going  straight  to  the  FSS  I  don't  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holds  water  in  that  sense. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  at  the  end  of  the  day  here,  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  at  a  mandate  that  was  plain  on  its  face  in  terms

decided  to  move  away  from  the  failed  Small  Business  Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach  and  go  to  the  mandatory  approach  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  why  I  wondered  ­­

   

  

 

 

I'm  not  certain  how  this  works  ­­ that  I  read  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  It  says,  "The  department  shall  award  contracts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  basis  of  competition  restricted  to  veterans.  If, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if,  if.  Okay?  Well,  what  wouldn't  be  awarded  according 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  veterans?  I  mean,  what  was  surprising  to  me  is  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  goal  was  to  have  3  percent  awarded  to  veterans. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  if  I  read  this  the  way  you  read  it, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  will  be  awarded  to  veterans.  I  mean,  maybe 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  literally,  but  there  are  millions  of  veterans. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  are  probably  hundreds  of  thousands  or  millions  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

veterans'  businesses.  So  wouldn't  everything  be  awarded 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  veterans?  What  wouldn't  be? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  No,  not  ­­ not  at  all. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  wouldn't?  That's  what 

  

  

 

 

 

I  want  you  to  address. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  The  vast  ­­ for  the  ­­ given 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  limited  number  of  veteran­owned  small  businesses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  out  there,  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  How  many  are  there?

MR.  SAUNDERS:  When  ­­ when  Congress  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

going  through  the  legislative  history  here,  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearing  that  maybe  15  percent  of  businesses.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  may  be  15  percent  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

businesses,  but  the  question  is  what  does  the  Department 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Veterans  Affairs  buy?  And  my  guess  is  they  buy  lots 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  stuff.  They  buy  household  stuff,  they  buy  paper 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

towels,  they  buy  buildings,  they  buy  all  kinds  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things.  And  in  respect  to  all  the  things  they  buy,  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  read  this,  a  contract  supplies  to  everything.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

guess  they'll  buy  it  all  from  veterans.  Now,  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  ­­ or  90  percent,  I  don't  know.  It's  very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

surprising  to  me  that  Congress  would  have  wanted  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Veterans  Administration  to  buy  everything  from  veterans. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now  ­­ now,  that's  ­­ or  nearly  everything. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now  you  explain  to  me  ­­ I  must  be  missing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  ­­ and  ­­ and  you  explain  to  me  what  I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

missing. 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  First,  the  ­­ the  fair  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  price  and  best  value  requirement  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  no,  I  understand  that. 

   

  

 

 

 

I  said  they  have  certain  qualifications,  of  course.  Do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  think  the  veterans  ­­ things  aren't  ­­ they  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  prices.  They  ­­ they  have  ­­ they're

qualified.  They  do  a  fine  job.  Let's  say  it's 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

surprising  that  Congress  would  have  wanted  nearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  to  be  bought  from  veterans,  that's  all.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  am  I  wrong? 

   

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  You're  wrong  in  terms  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  natural  cap  on  the  limit  of  businesses  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  out  there,  but  where  there  is  a  veteran­owned  small 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business  that  can  perform  the  requirement  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

perform. 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'm  not  saying  they  can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  SAUNDERS:  No,  no.  I'm  saying  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  want  you  to  address  what 

    

 

 

 

 

 

you're  calling  this  natural  cap.  You're  saying  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  wrong,  it  doesn't  mean  everything,  it  means  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  percent.  Is  that  what  you're  saying?  Or  what  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  are  you  saying? 

 

 

 

            

Explain  what  it  is.  I  read  it.  I  thought 

    

    

 

 

 

 

it's  everything.  Now  you  explain  why  it  isn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  or  nearly  everything.  I  mean,  if  you're  not 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  veteran,  Congress  wouldn't  normally  say  you  don't  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  leg  up,  but  to  shut  you  out  entirely?  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  ­­ that's  just  my  problem  that  I  want  you  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain.

business  that  can  supply  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Are  you  saying  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

want  ­­ just  wanted  everything  that  veterans  can  supply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  supplied  by  veterans?  And  if  I  say,  is  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything,  it's  not  90  ­­ it's  not  a  hundred  percent, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably  not  99  percent,  but  it  might  be  80  percent.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  I'm  guessing.  You  tell  me.  You're  the  expert. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  percent  is  it  when  you  win? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  When  I  win  I  don't  think 

   

   

  

 

 

we're  going  to  be  talking  about  numbers  that  high. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  in  the  legislative  history  was  talking  about  15 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent  of  the  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  thought  your  answer 

    

 

 

 

would  be  a  hundred  percent.

statutory  requirements  are  satisfied? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Yes;  that  is  correct.  When 

  

  

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  business  ­­

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  we  know  how  many 

  

 

 

 

 

 

businesses  there  are  because  they  registered  under  a

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Right.  And  so  when  there  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  business  that's  available,  yes,  it  should  be  getting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  those  opportunities.  That's  exactly  what 

  

 

 

 

 

Congress  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  what  Justice  ­­ what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

­­ Justice  Breyer  raised  a  question  about  the  way  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  is  worded  because  it  says,  "For  purposes  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meeting  the  goals."  And  the  goals  are  very  low;  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goals  are  3  percent. 

   

 

            

So  it  seems  odd  for  a  statute  to  say  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

persons  of  meeting  a  3­percent  goal,  you  should  do  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following,  which  will  lead  to  90  percent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Well,  a  few  points,  Justice 

   

  

 

 

 

Kagan.  First,  the  3­percent  goal  was  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

government­wide  goal  under  the  Small  Business  Act.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  for  service­disabled  veterans  requires  the  VA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  set  a  higher  goal. 

   

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  How  high? 

  

 

 

MR.  SAUNDERS:  It  doesn't  ­­ it  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

require  the  specific  number.  It  has  to  be  higher  than 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  percent.  And  we're  talking  about  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That  could  be  four  percent. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  SAUNDERS:  It  ­­ it  could  be,  but  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  a  period  in  time  when  there  have  been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goals  since  1999,  discretionary  authority  since  2003.

And  as  of  2005,  the  government's  progress  towards  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3­percent  goal  was  .6,  six­tenths  of  1  percent. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  No,  it  sounds  like  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

government  did  very  badly  in  meeting  its  goals.  And  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  understand  why  Congress  would  have  done  something  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  the  government  ­­ and  specifically  the  VA  ­­ has  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  a  lot  better  toward  meeting  its  goals. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

But  the  goals  are  still,  you  know,  pretty 

 

 

 

 

 

far  down  compared  to  what  Justice  Breyer  was  indicating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  natural  tendency  of  this  system  that  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

describing  to  produce  ­­ you  know,  almost  everything  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  to  a  veteran. 

   

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Well,  where  there  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

veteran  that's  eligible.  But  even  at  the  time  that  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  done,  the  goals  had  always  been  a  3  percent 

     

 

 

 

 

 

 

government­wide  goal.  Individual  agencies  were  required 

  

 

 

 

 

to  set  their  goals  based  on  the  maximum  practical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity,  and  so  even  at  the  time  going  into  this, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  VA  had  already  set  a  higher  goal.  I  believe  it  was 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  percent. 

 

            

The  goals  that  it  had  set  under  the  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  even  higher  than  that.  And  the  answer  is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes,  the  government  was  expecting  the  VA  ­­ this  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  important  mandate  for  the  VA  because  this  was  tied  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  VA's  unique  obligation  to  help  veteran­owned  small

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You  ­­ you  mentioned 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  ­­ you've  mentioned  several  times,  I  think, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  has  to  be  a  veterans  ­­ veteran­owned 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

business  that's  eligible  as  ­­ as  ­­ but  don't  you  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  will  be  a  lot  more  veteran­owned  businesses  if  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevail?  In  other  words,  if  everything  is  open  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preference,  as  long  as  there  is,  you  know,  two  that  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  preference,  don't  you  think  a  lot  more  veterans  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

won't  it  make  a  lot  more  sense  for  them  to  go  into 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business  rather  than  some  other  line  of  work? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  It  may  well  be.  And  Congress 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  think  that's  fantastic.  We're  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  you  shouldn't 

  

 

 

 

 

be  telling  us  that  the  limitation  is  that  there's  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  many  veteran­owned  businesses,  because  if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevail,  there  will  be  many  times  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Yeah.  And  there  could  be, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

and  then  that  ­­ you  know,  this  was  enacted  at  a  time  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2006  where  we  were  facing  incredible  unemployment  rate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

among  veterans.  And  so  if  this  is  encouraging  formation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  more  veteran­owned  small  businesses  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  see  many  good  things. 

    

 

 

 

 

People  would  enlist  in  the  Armed  Forces.  They  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  careers  assured  after.  It  just  still  surprises  me,

but  my  question  is  not  really  aimed  at  you.  It's  aimed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  other  side,  and  you  would  have  a  chance  to  answer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  question. 

 

              

I  can  understand.  I  accept  your  argument, 

    

 

 

 

pretty  much.  I  don't  know  why  there  would  be  any 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception  to  the  SS  ­­ the  FSS,  or  whatever  it's  called. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  was  rather  stopped  by  the  lower 

   

 

 

 

 

 

court's  argument  which  they  have  given  up,  which  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  in  the  statute,  not  in  a  preference,  but  right  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  it  says,  "For  purposes  of  meeting  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goals,"  under  Section  A.  That,  I  understand. 

   

  

 

 

 

            

And  then  what  you  do  is  you'd  have  goals; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  should  be  tough  goals,  and  ­­ and  if  you're  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ahead  of  the  goals,  then  maybe  you  don't  have  to  do  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  was  their  argument.  The  government's  given  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

up.

MR.  SAUNDERS:  The  government  has  given  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

up  because  the  stated  purpose  of  setting  those  goals  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  increase  contracting  opportunities.  And  the  House 

  

 

 

 

 

 

report  here  was  referring  to  tools  to  meet,  if  not

intended  to  be  ceilings  here.  And  if,  in  retrospect,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  like  there  might  be  some  mismatch  between  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandate  and  the  goals,  you  have  to  remember  that  at  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  they  were  so  far  from  meeting  even  the  more  modest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goals  that  Congress  was  thinking  of  this  in  mandatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms:  We  have  to  do  everything  we  can  here  to  ramp  up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  obligation,  because  the  old  approaches,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretionary  approaches  aren't  working. 

 

 

 

            

And  the  idea  that  in  doing  that  they  would, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  saying  anything  to  that  effect  in  the  statute, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leave  an  enormous  loophole  that  lets  the  agency  take  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  60  percent  of  its  procurements  off  the  top  and  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

send  them  straight  to  the  FSS  doesn't  jive,  especially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  you  remember  that  at  the  time  that  the  agency  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

missing  its  goals,  those  contracting  goals  counted  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  open  market  contracts,  but  FSS  orders  were  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counted.  When  the  government  was  doing  .6  against  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  percent  goal,  that  was  both  on  the  open  market  and  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  FSS.  Congress  was  worried  about  that  failure  across 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  board  and  enacted  a  mandatory  provision.

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  mandate  here  applies  when  the  VA  awards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholly  new  contracts,  not  when  it  places  orders  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

old  ones. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Tripp,  would  you 

  

 

 

 

 

preliminarily  explain  why  the  government  walked  away 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  what  was  a  winning  position  in  the  Federal  circuit? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  it's  really  odd.  I  read  the  Federal  circuit 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision,  and  I  expected  to  open  the  government  brief 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  say,  yeah,  the  Federal  circuit  was  right. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

wrong. 

            

You're  telling  us  the  Federal  circuit  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  TRIPP:  I  guess  ­­ about  the  Federal 

    

 

 

 

 

 

circuit's  position,  we  think  the  Federal  circuit's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rationale  is  right,  so  far  as  it  goes,  but  that  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incomplete.  And  so  the  Federal  circuit  has  a  complete 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

answer  for  why  Petitioner's  sort  of  maximalist  position 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  wrong,  which  is  that  if  ­­ if  this  mandate  applies  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

100  percent  of  procurements,  then  the  secretary's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion  to  set  goals  is  pretty  much  wiped  out,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  hard  to  even  talk  about  them  as  goals  at  all.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fact  that  there  needs  to  be  discretion  somewhere  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  scheme  doesn't  really  answer  where  the  discretion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needs  to  exist. 

 

 

            

And  the  distinction  that  we're  drawing  ­­

first,  I  want  to  be  clear  about  the  distinction  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  drawing.  We're  not  saying  that  when  you  place  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  under  a  preexisting  contract  that  that's  not  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  contract;  of  course  it  is.  We  say  that  outright 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  our  brief.  What  we're  saying  is  that  when  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establishes  a  procedure  that  applies  when  an  agency, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

quote,  awards  contracts,  that's  naturally  read  to  refer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  awarding  wholly  new  contracts,  not  placing  orders 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  old  ones. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Your  answer  to  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg  is  that  the  Federal  circuit  was  actually  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  though  you  disagree  with  its  reasoning.  And  isn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  real  answer  to  ­­ is  the  real  answer  to  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  that  the  ­­ the  VA  regulations  don't  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  about  goals? 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  But  it's  not  only  that  the  VA 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  don't  say  anything  about  goals.  It's  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  VA's  regulations  map  up  perfectly  with  the  argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we're  ­­ we're  ­­ we're  pressing  here,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  is  a  mandate  that  we  apply  in  100  percent  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procurements  when  we  are  awarding  a  wholly  new  contract. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  do  it  every  single  time  under  the  regulations,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  regulations  never  even  come  up.  You  never  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like,  a  contracting  officer  doesn't  begin  a  procurement 

   

   

 

 

 

by  turning  to  part  819.70  of  the  ­­ of  the  FAR.  There's

They  can  open  up,  march  their  way  through, 

 

 

 

 

 

place  an  FSS  order  under  part  ­­ part  8.  And  when  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place  an  order  under  a  preexisting  contract,  the  FAR  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crystal  clear  that  you  do  not  consider  set­aside 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  don't  quite  ­­

    

 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  And  so  the  argument  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

advancing  here  is  foursquare  with  the  way  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  actually  work  and  what  our  practices  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  on  the  ground  since  2009. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  why  is  it  that  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

call  these  order  ­­ order  contracts?  I  look  at  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  Pardon? 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  look  at  your  history,

orders  order  contracts. 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  An  order  is  a  kind  of  contract, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  under  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It's  not  a  kind.  It  is 

   

  

  

 

 

 

a  contract. 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  Yeah.  Yeah,  it's  a  contract 

   

  

  

 

 

under  the  ­­

vendor? 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  Oh,  under  the  FSS,  there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

already  a  government  contract  between  the  United  States 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  vendor  to  supply  an  indefinite  quantity  of  ­­ of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  certain  category  of  products  or  services.  And  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  placing  an  order  under  those  preexisting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  How  difficult  is  it  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  to  take  the  database  that  you  have  with  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  are  veteran­owned  businesses.  Take  that  database, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  it,  look  at  what  it  is  you  need,  a  stapler,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see  if  ­­ how  many  vendors  on  that  list  supply  staplers, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  then  check  that  against  the  FSS? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  It  ­­ it  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  If  there's  no  veteran 

  

 

 

 

 

that  matches  the  FSS  list,  then  you  go  to  the  FSS. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What's  the  problem  with  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  If  I  could  take  a  step  back  and 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

explain  why  this  is  so  important  to  the  VA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  thing  that  we're  most  troubled  by  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Petitioner's  position  would  block  us  from  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able  to  place  orders  under  preexisting  contracts.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole  point  of  the  contract  ­­

You  go  to  your  veteran­owned  list;  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  for  staplers.  You  find  five  veteran­owned 

  

 

 

 

 

 

businesses  on  your  list  that  sell  staplers,  but  you  want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ you  need  an  FSS  supplier,  because  you  don't  want

that  hard  work.  You  check  whether  there  are  two  or  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  those  five  on  the  FSS  list. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  All  right.  So  you're  saying  if 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

we  were  going  to  use  the  Rule  of  Two  to  choose  among  FSS 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vendors  who  are  already  qualified  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly.  Exactly. 

  

  

 

MR.  TRIPP:  ­­ the  first  point  about  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Petitioner  would  lose.  They  are  not  a  qualified 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

vendor. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  don't  care  about  the 

    

 

 

 

 

merits  of  whether  it  wins  or  loses.  I'm  talking  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  legal  issue. 

 

 

            

What  is  so  difficult  about  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  Yeah.  A  couple  points  about 

    

  

 

 

 

that. 

            

The  ­­ that  would  significantly  narrow  our

driven  by  ­­ by  ­­ by  the  interpretation  that  we  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  be  able  to  place  orders  under  preexisting  contracts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  all.  We  do  this  85,000  times  a  year.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  don't  ­­ I  don't  ­­

    

   

 

 

 

MR.  TRIPP:  You  know,  this  is  very  important 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

to  us.  And  so  in  our  ­­ our  first  position  about  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  we  just  don't  think  that  Congress  did  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  statute  is  materially  identical  in  its  wording  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

five  earlier  statutes,  none  of  which  have  ever  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreted  that  way.  When  Congress  wanted  to  address 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Except  the  FBA  has 

  

 

 

 

 

interpreted  this  contrary  to  you;  so  has  the  GAO. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  The  FBA  ­­ the  FBA  took  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position,  and  the  FAR  counsel,  which  represents  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entire  procurement  policy  of  a  broad,  pan­executive 

   

 

 

 

 

branch  procurement  agency,  rejected  it.  So  it  said  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  going  to  be  unworkable,  and  that  it  was  unclear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it  would  offer  us  a  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Tripp,  I  guess  I'm  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

sure  I  understand.  I  mean,  I  understand  your  policy 

    

   

   

 

 

concerns  and  ­­ and  the  way  you  think  this  will  damage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procurement  practices.  But  the  statute  just  seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

pretty  clear.  Once  you  say  that  this  is  a  contract, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  you've  said  in  your  brief  and  right  now.  And  once 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  say  that,  it  just  ­­ the  statute  says,  "A 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracting  officer  of  the  department  shall  award 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts  on  the  basis  of  competition  restricted  to

are.

understanding  of  contract.  You  just  said  this  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  No,  no. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ contract. 

  

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  But  ­­ but  the  problem  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  many  Federal  procurement  statutes  that  apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  the  ­­ when  the  Federal  government,  quote,  "awards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts."  That's  what  five  prior  small  business 

  

 

 

 

 

 

contracting  preference  statutes  say.  They  apply  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  either  awards  contracts,  award  contract 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunities,  or  reserves  contracts.  And  ­­ and  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  most  basic  statutes  in  the  area  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  as  I  understand  it,  all 

   

  

 

 

 

 

of  those  contracts  have  a  "may"  in  there. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  No.  Two  of  them  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Or  almost  all  of  them  do. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  Well,  one  of  them  has  always  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  "shall."  One  had  "shall  for  13  years."  But  if  I

could  get  to  another  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yeah,  but  ­­ but  most  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  have  a  "may."  But  here  you  have  ­­ and  ­­ and  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"shall"s,  the  one  or  two  that  there  are,  have  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never  been  adjudicated  by  ­­ certainly  by  this  Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  TRIPP:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  the  question  is,  well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  we  are.  We  are,  you  know,  for  the  first  time 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deciding  what  this  language  means,  and  this  language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means  that  you  shall  award  contracts  on  the  basis  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  restricted  competition.  And  you  say  this  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract,  so  you  know,  end  of  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  Well,  so  a  couple  points. 

   

  

 

 

 

The  ­­ the  very  basic  statutes  that  govern  sealed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bidding  and  negotiated  bidding,  the  most  heavyweight 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures  for  awarding  a  new  contract,  they  both  say 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  government  shall  award  a  contract  under  those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures.  And  if  you  extend  those  to  the  FSS,  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  totally  break. 

 

 

            

The  whole  point  of  entering  into  these  kinds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  contracts  upfront  is  that  you  don't  have  to  do  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again  and  again.  And  when  a  local  VA  hospital  needs  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  like  stents  or  wheelchairs  or  an  ultrasound

is  the  litigation  risk  that  that  would  expose. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Right  now,  our  choice  of  whether  to  do  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set­aside  when  choosing  among  FSS  vendors,  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committed  to  agency  discretion  by  law  because  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  addressed  this  point  head­on  in  644(r),  it  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  agencies  may,  at  their  discretion,  do  this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

But  if  suddenly  the  Rule  of  Two  applies  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  case,  then  in  every  case  a  disappointed  bidder  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  in  and  say,  oh,  no,  you've  misapplied  the  Rule  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Two.  You  should  have  thought  that  they  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  in  every  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  has  to  be  ­­ we're  dealing  with  small  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

veteran­owned  small  businesses.  The  examples  you  gave, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

stents,  wheelchairs,  ultrasound  machines,  are  there  many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

small  businesses  that  provide  ultrasound  machines? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  I  guess  I  ­­ I  don't  know  about 

    

   

   

 

 

 

ultrasound  machines,  but  we've  bought  things  like  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  There  are  expensive, 

  

 

 

 

 

big  things  that  you  expect  you  have  to  be  a  big  company 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  provide,  like  an  ultrasound  machine,  or  you  mentioned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stents. 

            

Now  maybe  if  they're  commodities,  then  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide  fair  price  and  best  value,  it  also  would  help  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  big  business  as  opposed  to  a  small  business.  Let

dollars  go  to  small  businesses,  and  a  lot  of  it  are  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  like  professional  staffing,  right?  So  we  hire

things  like  that,  through  ­­

acquisitions?

to  deliver  the  quality  care  that  we're  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deliver. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Is  this  the  case?  Do  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

understand  this?  Am  I  ­­ there  are  three  parts  to  this. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Question  one  in  my  mind,  is  it  the  case  that  they  lose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  agency  does  not  have  to  apply  veterans  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  they  way  exceeded  their  goal? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  answer  to  that  in  the  opinion  would  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  do  not  reach  that  question  for  there  are  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  that  suggest  that  the  agency  has  tried  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  that  approach.  Am  I  right  so  far? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  That  has  tried  to  take  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach  of  saying  that  we  drop  it  if  we're  way  over  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Correct. 

  

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  Yeah,  right.  Okay. 

  

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  Then  we  reach 

  

  

 

 

 

 

question  two,  left  one  open. 

 

 

 

 

            

Question  2  is  do  they  have  to  choose  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule  of  Two  in  the  FSS?  And  there  are  two  parts  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  The  first  part  is  suppose  two  veterans  qualified 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  already  on  the  FSS  list.  And  there  we  might  say, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes,  you  do  in  respect  to  them.  Or  we  might  say,  no, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  don't.  But  if  we  say  yes,  you  do,  at  least  we

don't,  in  your  opinion,  wreck  the  system.  All  right. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Then  we  get  to  Step  3.  There  is  no  veteran 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  FSS.  Now  what  do  we  do?  And  there  your  argument 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that,  look,  everyone  on  the  FSS  is  a  person  who  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entered  into  a  contract,  which  contract  says  that  when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

called  upon  for  further  supply,  they  will  give  it.  Am  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right? 

            

            

MR.  TRIPP:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So,  therefore,  it  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

contract,  not  the  contract  within  the  contract  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  talking  about.  And  were  we  to  say  the  contrary, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  would  have  to  take  an  architect  who  has  40,000  pages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  things  he's  going  to  do,  and  we  change  the  sentence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  page  389  to  read  300  rather  than  400,  and  we  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  a  new  contract,  or  something  like  that.  I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  make  an  argument  for  you.  It's  not  a  contract 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  a  contract,  it  is  contract  to  which  this  refer. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Am  I  way  off  base  or  is  that  what  you're  trying  to  say? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  I  think  that's  ­­

    

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  don't  just  say  it  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  you  think  I'd  agree  with  it,  please. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  I  ­­ I  don't  think  that's 

    

   

 

 

 

exactly  what  we're  trying  to  say.  And  ­­ and  it's  a

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  Well,  if  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

isn't  that,  look,  these  people  on  the  FSS  list  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already  entered  into  a  contract,  this  is  just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

implementing  the  contract  that  they've  already  entered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into.  If  you're  not  saying  that,  then  how  in  heaven's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

name  do  you  get  out  of  his  argument? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  We're  saying  that  when  we  place 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  order  under  a  preexisting  contract,  that  that  is  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

awarding  a  new  ­­ awarding  a  contract  within  the  meaning 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

of  these  procurement  statutes. 

 

 

 

            

There  have  been  ­­ I  ­­ I  really  do  want  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

emphasize  the  historical  context  that's  built  up  over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decades  about  the  understanding  of  this  phrase, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"throughout  Federal  procurement  law,"  right?  There's 

  

 

 

 

 

five  prior  statutes  on  exactly  this  same  subject,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  one  of  them  has  been  interpreted  by  the  FAR  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorically  inapplicable  when  placing  orders  under 

 

 

 

 

 

preexisting  contracts.

nothing  special  about  the  language.  It's  almost 

  

 

 

 

 

 

identical  to  the  language  of  the  HUBZone  preference  that

sorry,  1997  to  2010  that  had  exactly  the  same  shall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

award  a  contract  opportunity.  I  mean,  it  was  very 

    

   

 

 

 

 

powerful.  And  that  the  whole  ­­ the  whole  time  since 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1978,  Congress  has  had  a  provision  in  place  saying  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each  contract  in  a  small  dollar  range  shall  be  reserved 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusively  for  ­­ for  small  businesses. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

And  if  you  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Tripp,  this  is  an  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  overarching  problem.  The  ­­ the  argument  which  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state  very  well  is  very  complex.  The  Federal  circuit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  a  really  simple  take  on  it,  and  all  of  these 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  and  provisions  that  you  are  mentioning 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  figure  at  all  in  ­­ in  the  Federal  circuit's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion.  So  you're  putting  us  in  the  position  of  being 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  court  of  first  view  in  a  rather  dense  area.  This  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  usually  doesn't  do  that.  It  likes  to  know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  ­­

 

            

            

MR.  TRIPP:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  ­­ other  judges  have 

  

 

 

 

 

thought  about  it. 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  Yes,  I  ­­ and  I  ­­ I  totally 

   

   

   

  

 

 

understand  that  concern.  And,  you  know,  obviously,  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

first­line  position  is  that  we're  right  for  the  reasons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  say  in  our  brief.  This  traces  through  all  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  procurement  statutes.  It  wouldn't  upset

deciding  whether  to  go  5,  10,  15?  The  risk  of

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  if  the  discretion  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  broad,  then  it  seems  to  me  that  maybe  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuit  was  wrong,  that  these  goals  are  simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspirational.  But  that  doesn't  have  any  real  effect  on

This  has  had  ­­ I  mean,  the  statute  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  the  statute  was  enacted,  we  were  falling  short  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  the  3  percent  goal.  Now  the  goals  are  in  the  range 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  10  to  12  ­­ 10  to  12  percent,  and  in  most  years  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crushing  these  goals,  right?  We're  beating  them,  even

of  Two. 

 

            

But  we're  doing  two  other  very  important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  for  veterans.  We  put  a  thumb  on  the  scale  when 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  considering  offers  that  were  submitted  within  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FSS  by  veterans.  And  we  also  do  set­asides  under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

644(r),  the  statute  where  Congress  spoke  very  directly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  this  and  said  that  we  may,  at  our  discretion,  set 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aside  orders  placed  against  multiple­award  schedule 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts.  We  do  those  set­asides,  and  the  ­­ and  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

results  have  been  very  dramatic. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  When  ­­ I'm  sorry. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

When  you  say  you're  crushing  the  goals,  that  means 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  meeting  them? 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

            

MR.  TRIPP:  We're  ­­ sorry.  Sorry. 

  

  

 

 

 

We're  ­­ we're  far  exceeding  them.  In  ­­ in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  years  we're  ­­ we're  nearly  doubling  them.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  this  is  something  that  we  ­­ we  have  ­­ this  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  a  huge  impact  on  ­­ on  our  operations.  I  think  we 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  had  a  big  impact  on  the  veterans'  community. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  ­­ the  ­­ our  concern  is  that  if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  this  sort  of  mechanical  Rule  of  Two  and  apply  it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

especially  in  the  ­­ sort  of  the  blocking  interpretation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Petitioner  has  been  ­­ been  pressing,  that  we  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  be  able  to  place  an  order  at  all.

a  stent,  or  pencils,  or  something  like  that.  But  this

this  was  a  custom  service  that  you  were  seeking,  and  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  TRIPP:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  ­­ what  you  did  was  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

solicit  a  quote  from  a  single  contractor. 

   

   

 

 

            

So  how  does  that  fit  in  with  the  arguments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  making  about  the  need  to  use  the  FSS? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  It  ­­ it  sort  of  ­­ two  things 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  this.  The  ­­ the  ­­ this  is  a  somewhat  unusual

The  much  more  common  ­­ the  ­­ the  VA  orders 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  lot  of  services  on  the  FSS.  It's  like  one  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

major  ways  that  people  ­­ that  agencies  purchase 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

services.  And  the  ­­ the  standard  way  of  doing  it,

vendors  who  ­­ who  are  already  prequalified  to  provide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  kind  of  service.  And  the  standard  way  that  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  do  this  is  that  you  would  request  ­­ request 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quotes  from  at  least  three  of  them,  and  then  consider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  when  they  come  in. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  when  you  request  ­­ request  the  quote 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  them,  even  if  you  request  it  from  three  or  four  of

will  ­­ will  see  that  it's  open  and  can  submit  an  offer,

one  that  offers  the  best  value.

procurements  by  way  of  the  FSS.  That  we  have  it  in  our

want  to  emphasize  that  the  VA's  primary  use  of  this, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again  ­­ this  is  not  ­­ I'm  not  talking  about  staples 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  paperclips.  We're  talking  about,  you  know,  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  medical­related  stuff,  the,  you  know,  wheelchairs, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stents,  all  that  ­­ temporary  staffing  services. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  yes,  a  lot  of  the  FSS  ­­ even  for  more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complex  procurement,  the  FSS  is  still  substantially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

easier.  And  the  FSS,  you  tend  to  already  be  sort  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggregating  the  government's  buying  power.  And  so  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

pricing  is  ­­ the  idea  of  the  ­­ of  the  FSS  is  that  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both  easier  to  do  and  that  the  price  will  ordinarily  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower. 

            

And  so  ­­ I  mean,  the  ­­ the  agency  wouldn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  going  into  the  FSS  if  the  agency  didn't  think  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  the  ­­ the  best  approach.  And  in  fact, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whenever  the  procurement  is  over  half  a  million  dollars, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  believe,  the  FAR  requires  the  contracting  officer  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  an  affirmative,  express  determination  on  exactly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  point:  That  ­­ that  going  through  the  FSS  is  going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  provide  the  best  value  for  us  overall. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  ­­ and  just  to  respond  to  Petitioner's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

effort  to  put  a  lot  of  weight  onto  the  best­value

don't  ­­ I  don't  quite  understand  where  that  argument 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

goes. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Tripp,  can  ­­ can  I  ask, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  effect  would  this  statute  really  have  on  your  view? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As  I  understand  it,  the  government  does  have  to  use  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule  of  Two  on  all  open­market  purchases;  is  that  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  Under  the  statute,  our 

  

 

 

 

 

regulations  implemented  it,  yes. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Above,  like,  a  very  low 

   

  

 

 

 

threshold?  Is  it  3,500,  something  like  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  TRIPP:  Yes.  Right,  right. 

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  ­­ so  if  you're  right, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  did  this  statute  actually  accomplish?  In  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

words,  you  already  have  to  use  the  Rule  of  Two  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

open­market  purchases,  or  almost  all  of  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  TRIPP:  Oh,  right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  What  does  the  statute  do? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  TRIPP:  Yes.  It  ­­ so  8127(d)  has  a  ­­

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

has  a  huge  effect,  because  under  the  ­­ just  the  ­­ sort 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  regular  FAR,  you  just  have  to  do  a  set­aside  for

But  under  8127(d),  this  required  to  ­­ to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrict  competition  only  to  veteran­owned  small 

 

 

 

 

 

businesses  who  are  in  our  database.  So  this  is  a  far 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  ­­

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Who  ­­

  

 

 

MR.  TRIPP:  Only  in  our  ­­ who  are  verified 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  veteran­owned  in  our  database. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  this  is  a  far  more  powerful  preference 

   

 

 

 

 

 

than  the  ­­ than  ­­ than  the  ordinary  preference  in  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  FAR,  or  even  when  you  take  that  and  you  couple  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  section  8128,  which  they  mention  in  the  brief, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  gets  at,  again,  just  sort  of  putting  a  ­­ a  bit  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  thumb  on  the  scale.  Restricting  competition  is  a  very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

powerful  thing,  and  it  has  a  huge  effect. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  again,  I  think,  I  just  want  to  emphasize 

   

   

 

 

 

 

at  ­­ at  closing  that  our  ­­ our  major  concern  is  with

prevent  us  from  ­­ from  placing  orders  at  all,  even  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  them  in  place,  and  even  when  we  could  place 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

orders  with  another  veteran­owned  small  business. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  you  still  haven't 

  

 

 

 

 

answered  my  question  fully.

have  a  significant  upside.  Congress  responded  to  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

FAR  council  by  enacting  644(r)  and  establishing  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure  to  do  that,  but  making  it  discretionary  in  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases. 

            

And  if  you  extend  the  Rule  of  Two  mandate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there,  first  of  all,  it  would  expose  us  to  lots  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation.  But  I  ­­ I  ­­ again,  I  don't  see  how  you 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

restrict  that  to  this  statute  and  not  all  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ones. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Do  ­­ do  you  know  what

MR.  TRIPP:  I  think  it's  about  20  percent. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  20? 

  

 

MR.  TRIPP:  About  20  percent,  yes. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  was  the  60  percent? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

There  was  a  60  percent  figure. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  TRIPP:  The  ­­ the  60  percent  is  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transaction  volume.  You  know,  a  lot  of  the  FSS  orders 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

tend  to  be  relatively  small  dollar  order.  So  there's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot  more  of  them,  but  they  don't  add  up  to  as  many

pharmaceuticals  under  a  preexisting  contract.  And  ­­ I

MR.  TRIPP:  No.  What  I'm  ­­ what  I'm  ­­

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  THOMAS  G.  SAUNDERS 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  Thank  you. 

  

 

 

This  case  should  begin  and  end  for  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  with  the  concession  that  in  the  ordinary  sense  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  term,  an  order  under  the  FSS  is  a  contract. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  chose  sweeping  language  here  in  acting  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandate,  and  that  language  encompasses  FSS  orders.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  extent  there  are,  you  know,  changes  that  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need  to  be  made  or  other  policy  considerations,  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  be  made  by  Congress  in  the  future.  But  the  policy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consideration  it  made  is  ­­ is  embodied  in  the  statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  it  chose. 

 

 

            

Now,  the  idea  that  we're  going  to  come  back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  limit  this  based  on  a  specialized  meaning  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word  "contract,"  we  should  remember  that  that  argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  one  that  appeared  in  this  case  until  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  merits  brief  in  this  Court.

If  it's  a  settled  background  interpretation 

   

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  Congress  was  incorporating  that  limitation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  the  Act,  you  think  it  would  have  occurred  to  them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  last  decade,  the  carve­outs  for  the  Small 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Business  Act  exceptions  were  never  justified  based  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providing  a  narrower  meaning  of  the  word  "contract,"  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  their  face  were  expressly  limited  to  the  Small 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Business  Act,  the  provision  that  applied  to  part  19  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  FAR  implementing  the  Small  Business  Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Well,  to  the  extent  there's  an  exception  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Small  Business  Act,  well,  Congress  came  in  here  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  rejected  the  Small  Business  Act  approach.  Rather 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  continuing  to  tinker  within  the  framework  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Small  Business  Act  where  this  exception  applied,  it  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  taking  this  mandate  out  of  the  Small  Business  Act, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  going  to  narrow  it,  it's  not  going  to  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government­wide  mandate,  but  we're  going  to  apply  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically  to  the  VA  in  light  of  its  unique 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligations  and  set  the  VA  up  as  the  driver  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procurement  in  this  area;  have  it  set  the  example  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  rest  of  the  government. 

 

 

 

 

            

Congress  was  making  ­­ balancing  these 

 

 

 

 

 

policy  considerations.  It  wasn't  going  to  be  blundering 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  something  that  was  administratively  unworkable.

reasonable  price  and  best  value. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  as  the  ­­ the  Chief  Justice  discussed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  some  of  these  big  order  commodity  contracts,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  going  to  be  a  difficult  fight  for  the  ­­ for  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drugs  that  are  being  offered  here,  there's  a  statutory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  that  says  that  the  government  acquires  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drugs  at  76  percent  of  the  average  price  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesalers  pay  to  the  manufacturers.  So  take  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

average  price  that  anyone  else  in  the  world  can  get  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  manufacturer  and  do  a  big  discount  on  top  of  that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Those  are  tough  terms  to  beat. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  I  think  that  there's  going  to  be  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  the  reality  here  is  not  the  dire  consequences 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you're  seeing,  and  the  policy  judgment  is  for

Congress.  And  believe  me,  if  anything  in  this  mandate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforced  as  written  is  going  to  hurt  veterans  in  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way,  then  you  can  expect  Congress  will  act  swiftly  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct  that  problem. 

 

 

            

But  none  of  this  supports  the  sweeping 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carve­out  that  the  government  is  saying  that  it  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  have  to  look  at  its  own  database.  It  doesn't  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  consider  a  single  veteran­owned  small  business,  no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

matter  how  competitive  it  would  be,  because  it  can  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

straight  to  the  Federal  suppliers. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  What  response  do  you  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  judge  ­­ Justice  Ginsburg's  question  that  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  making  us  a  court  of  first  impression  here? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shouldn't  we  send  this  back? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAUNDERS:  I  don't  think  we  should 

    

 

 

 

 

because  the  meaning  of  "contract,"  this  is  a  straight­up 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  law.  And  the  reality  is  that  the  veterans 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  are  waiting  for  this  law  to  be  enforced  as  written 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  already  waited  a  decade.  And  for  ­­ to  send  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  and  have  additional  delay  on  a  pure  question  of  law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  on  a  new  argument  that  the  government's  making  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  first  time  here  sets  a  very  bad  precedent. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

The  case  is  submitted.
