CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

next in Case 10-1293, Federal Communications 
Commission v. Fox Television Stations. 

General Verrilli. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

In its previous decision in this case, the 
Court observed that when a broadcast licensee takes a 
license for the free and exclusive use of a valuable 
part of the public domain, it also accepts enforceable 
public obligations.  One of those enforceable 
obligations is the indecency restriction which Congress 
has instructed the Federal Communications Commission to 
enforce between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. 

Respondents in this case have for years 

benefited enormously from their free and exclusive use 
of public spectrum.  They argue, however, that neither 
Congress nor the commission may as a condition of their 
licenses require that they refrain from broadcasting 
indecent material when children are most likely to be in 
the audience.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, General Verrilli, it 

seems to me that this contract notion of yours can only 
go so far.  I mean, if the idea is just we gave them 
something, now they have to do whatever we say, you 
wouldn't accept that.  So, the question is why is this 
condition appropriate when many other conditions would 
not be appropriate?  I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, if 
you would say all conditions are appropriate.  But I --
I frankly think you wouldn't. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  This condition is 
appropriate, Justice Kagan, because it has been a 
defining feature of the broadcast medium from its 
inception in the 1920s in the Radio Act and has 
continued to be a defining feature of this medium 
throughout its history.  And the argument that my 
friends on the other side are making here is that that 
norm, that legally enforceable norm which has been 
recognized by this Court in Pacifica and has been 
applied since the inception of this medium, needs to be 
overturned now because circumstances have changed. 
And I would point out first, if I may, 

something that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's one of their 

arguments.  I mean, another one is that you haven't 
defined it precisely enough, right?

GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, that's true. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a separate -- really 

a separate argument. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's certainly true, 
Justice Scalia, and I will certainly get to vagueness, 
if I -- if I may just continue on this line. 

The -- their argument is that circumstances 
have fundamentally changed.  I want to point out at the 
outset something I think is significant, which is that 
their argument would sweep away indecency restriction 
with respect to radio as well as television, and they 
would sweep that away in the arguments they are making 
today without making any showing that circumstances have 
changed at all with respect to the ubiquity of -- or 
accessibility of radio. 

And I think if one looks at the FCC orders 

that this Court cited in its prior decision in this 
case, one will see that a lot of the most vile and lewd 
material really is in radio.  So, I just want to put 
that marker down at the beginning here because I do 
think it is quite important.  No showing has been made 
about radio. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I didn't quite understand 
that.  Today there's a -- there's either a potential or 
a fact of violent and objectionable broadcasting in

radio?  I didn't quite -- just to understand your point. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.  Pacifica itself, 
Justice Kennedy, was a case about a radio broadcast. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes, I understand that. 

Yes. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  And the Respondents are 

arguing in this case that Pacifica ought to be overruled 
because the circumstances that justified its rule no 
longer obtain.  I want to put a marker in at the outset 
here with respect to radio, because I do think it's 
quite important, that they haven't made any argument 
that those circumstances are any different with respect 
to radio.  It's just as ubiquitous as it was.  There 
isn't even any argument that there's blocking technology 
available.  And I want to make sure, given the kind of 
vile material that the record demonstrates has been 
transmitted over time on radio, that the Court focuses 
on the breadth of the argument that the Respondents are 
making here. 

Now, with respect to television, I do think 

they're making an argument that -- that television 
broadcasting is no longer uniquely pervasive in the way 
that it was before.  They're not making an argument --
but that, if I may, is a very different kind of argument 
than one would normally get in support of a -- the

suggestion that we ought to depart from stare decisis. 

They're not -- they're not arguing that 

broadcast television is any less pervasive than it was. 
If anything, it's probably more pervasive now.  They're 
not arguing that the harms of that pervasiveness no 
longer exist.  What they're arguing is that there are 
other media that present harms as well and that with 
respect -- and that because those other media also 
present harms, the circumstances require a change in the 
rule with respect to broadcasters. 

Now, that -- you can I think look at that in 

one of two ways.  You could say either that's an 
argument that it's futile to continue to impose this 
restriction on broadcasters.  And I think that's what 
Fox says at page 33 of its brief. 

Two points in response to that.  I think a 

significant, if not complete, answer was in this Court's 
prior decision in this case in which it said that the 
maintenance of a safe haven is actually particularly 
important in the context of these changes, a broadcast 
safe haven.  And also I do think that the idea of 
futility in that nature is foreign to our First 
Amendment jurisprudence. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General Verrilli, I took 
it from the briefs and what the FCC has been doing that

the major objection is that one cannot tell what's 
indecent and what isn't; that it's FCC, the censor, 
that's saying "Private Ryan" is okay, "Schindler's List" 
is okay, but "NYPD Blue" is not.  And I do think that 
that is the major objection, that we have a government 
agency that is going to make decisions about when nudity 
is okay and when it isn't.  You can't do it in terms of 
time because "New York" -- the "NYPD" was 7 seconds and 
another broadcast, "Catch-22," was 40 seconds. 
So, it's -- it's the appearance of 

arbitrariness about how the FCC is defining indecency in 
concrete situations.  That I think is the major flaw. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  Let me turn to that, 

Justice Ginsburg.  The -- two points about that:  The 
first one is that as we read this Court's recent 
decision in Humanitarian Law Project, the question on 
the Fifth Amendment analysis of whether there is 
vagueness and arbitrary enforcement has to be answered 
by reference to the specific broadcasts at issue here. 
In other words, was there fair notice with respect to 
these specific broadcasts? 

And I will get to that, but I -- but let me 

first go directly to Your Honor's more significant 
question.  And I think the -- the problem with looking 
at the case that way is that the lens is focused too

narrowly in that there, actually, if you -- one 
broadens out the lens and looks at the wide range of 
decisions that the commission is making about indecency 
and then broadens it out even further and looks at the 
wide range of broadcasts that occur, actually the number 
of broadcasts are -- that have been identified as even 
raising a question of arbitrariness or inconsistency is 
a -- is really quite a miniscule fraction.  It's even 
quite a miniscule fraction even with respect to 
broadcasts that the commission has adjudicated as 
indecent or not indecent. 

And, yes, we would concede that there is not 

perfect clarity in this rule.  It's a context-based 
rule.  As we read Pacifica, the Court suggested in 
Pacifica that a context-based rule may well be what the 
Constitution requires here, and that's going to result 
in some -- something less than absolute precision.  But 
the -- of course, the alternative, I would assume from 
my friend's perspective, would be worse.  The commission 
could have a list that said never say the following, 
however many words; never show broadcasting between the 
hours of 6:00 a.m. -- nudity between the hours of 
6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. 

That would be clearer, but it would -- but, 
in a way, the commission here, I think by following the

context-based approach that I think Pacifica suggested 
was required, is being -- I mean, "punished" is too 
strong a word, but it's being held against it that it's 
trying to make reasonable accommodations for First 
Amendment values. 

And so, I think when one looks at it both in 

terms of where the lenses actually ought to be focused 
here and the fact that the -- the alternative of perfect 
clarity would reach a less effective accommodation of 
First Amendment values, then I do think that the 
commission's position is quite -- quite reasonable and 
defensible. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Could you -- could you 

digress for one minute to help me understand the 
procedural posture of this case.  When it was here last 
time, we were dealing with an issue called "fleeting 
expletives," and that was Fox.  And the Fox case 
involved just that.  They didn't really, or we didn't, 
or the Court didn't, attack the 2001 order which is now 
at issue.  And then, without it going back to the 
commission, the Second Circuit decided it on a ground 
that sets aside the 2001 order. 

Now, can we here just decide the fleeting 

expletive case, because the fleeting expletive case has 
to do with one subset of applications of the 2001 order

and has to do with part 2(2) or something.  I mean, it 
has -- and how you interpret the words "material dwells 
on or repeats."  Now, that I -- that I understand how to 
get at. 

The ABC case raises -- doesn't raise 

fleeting expletives.  It wasn't fleeting.  And it raises 
the question of the validity of -- under vagueness 
grounds, of 2001 industry guidance and how that's been 
applied.  But the Second Circuit didn't deal with that 
case.  It sent it back to the commission. 

So, has there been a commission decision 
recently which has reviewed the basic arguments being 
made here about the validity of the 2001 industry 
guidance as applied?  Has there been such a thing? 

Alternatively, has there been an appeals 
court holding on the -- or analysis of the ABC case? 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  I do -- I agree with you, 

Justice Breyer, (a) that this is a complex procedural 
posture; (b) that the Court would have some discretion 
in how it approached and resolved the case. 

With respect to the ABC case, as I read the 

commission's orders, which are in the appendix to the 
petition, it applied the 2001 industry guidance to reach 
the conclusion that the ABC broadcast was indecent.  And 
then that was -- that -- then ABC appealed that to the

Second Circuit --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Right. 
GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- as I understand it, 

and that the Second Circuit then found that the -- that 
the commission had violated the Constitution in reaching 
that result.  It first --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But they didn't -- they 

didn't in that case --

GENERAL VERRILLI:  Right. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and they sent the ABC 

case back.  I see your --

GENERAL VERRILLI:  They did on -- when it 

came back, Your Honor, they then -- they disposed of the 
Fox case with a lengthy opinion --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 
GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- and then essentially 

applied that analysis to the ABC case. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I see. 
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So, I think in 

fairness --

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  When this ABC 

case was argued in front of the commission -- I have 
here about 30 briefs at least, maybe 40, and they are 
filled with very good arguments.  Were those arguments 
made to the commission in the context of the ABC case?

Because as it comes up here, we are -- whereas I thought 
when we granted cert, quite honestly, that this was Fox 
coming back, as I've read the brief it isn't at all. 
This is a new case, nothing to do with what we decided 
before.  This is the case of ABC, period.  And it is an 
attack on the 2001 guidelines, not fleeting expletives. 

And, therefore, I want to know, at least 

satisfy myself, that this Fox -- this ABC case has gone 
through ordinary procedures and, indeed, these arguments 
have all been made in front of the commission and 
they've been rejected. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  So, Justice Breyer, I'm 
not sure that I can vouch for the proposition that the 
arguments have all been made in front of the 
commission --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not saying every one, 

but has the essence of these arguments. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  In fairness, I do think 
that -- that if one reads the commission's disposition 
of the -- the ABC case, it is applying the 2001 guidance 
reaching the conclusion that the broadcast was indecent 
under the 2001 guidance.  ABC paid the fine that it was 
assessed and then, as it has -- as it can do, then 
invoked the Hobbs Act, went to the court of appeals to 
challenge it.  And so, I do think -- I do actually think

that the issues have been considered by the agency and 
are before the Court. 

And I do agree with Your Honor, moving I 

think more directly to the vagueness point, that there 
really isn't a vagueness issue left with respect to the 
fleeting expletives in the -- in the Fox case because 
the Court said the last time the case was here that 
there is no problem of arbitrary punishment because 
there was no forfeiture or any other sanction. 

ABC is in a different position because they 
were sanctioned.  And so, there is an issue with respect 
to the question of whether the commission's indecency 
standards can constitutionally be applied here and 
whether they're too vague.  But I do think, and I do --
I would like to spend a minute on that question of 
whether there is vagueness as applied to the ABC 
broadcast. 

Now, the commission's standards in the 2001 
guidance say that this is essentially a two-part test. 
First is a subject matter question:  Is there a 
description or depiction of sexual or excretory 
activities or organs?  And then there's a question of 
whether the depiction or description is patently 
offensive under community standards for broadcast 
informed by three factors:  whether the expression is

explicit, whether the broadcast dwells on it, and 
whether it's shocking or pandering or titillating. 

Now, ABC makes an argument with respect to 

this broadcast that the nudity in the "NYPD Blue" 
episode is outside of the first subject matter criteria 
because it didn't have fair notice that buttocks would 
be considered sexual organs for purposes of application 
of this -- of this standard. 

The commission said -- and this is at page 

137a of the appendix to the petition -- that it's 
impossible to believe that they didn't think that the 
naked display of buttocks would bring them within --
that weren't -- didn't have fair notice that the naked 
display of buttocks would bring them within this rule. 
I'm not sure anything more needs to be said about that. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the broader point, 

General Verrilli, isn't it, is that no matter -- even if 
you're right that there are many non-vague applications 
of this commission policy, that there is some amount of 
uncertainty and ABC finds itself in that area of 
uncertainty --

GENERAL VERRILLI:  I don't --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- because it turns out that 
nudity -- that there really -- sometimes it's allowed as 
to some body parts, and sometimes it's not allowed; and

the commission hadn't really said anything about it for 
50 years; and the length of time doesn't seem to be 
what's indicative of anything; the kind of body part 
doesn't seem to be, with some limits, what's indicative 
of anything, so that ABC just didn't really know. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  With respect, Justice 

Kagan, I really disagree with that characterization of 
the situation. 

Moving to the second part of the analysis 

here, I think it's important to take a half a step back. 
The fact of the matter is -- and I think everybody, all 
of us, understand this in our experience -- that nudity 
on broadcast television is an exceedingly, exceedingly, 
rare thing at any time of the day and certainly between 
6:00 a.m. and 10 p.m.  It is exceedingly rare, and all 
of us from our experience know that.  And the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, I'm not so sure 

because the examples were given of -- I guess excerpts 
from "Private Ryan" and from "Schindler's List" have 
been on television. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, that's true, Justice 

Ginsburg.  But, again, I think that's another issue 
about where the lens is focused.  There have been 
thousands and thousands and thousands of broadcasts, and 
the Respondents have identified four in which -- over

25 years, in which any nudity has been present. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They have their own 

guidelines that generally prohibit it, don't they? 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's certainty true, 
Justice Scalia.  And I do think, in Reno, this Court 
described the Carlin monologue at issue in Pacifica in 
the following way:  It said that monologue was readily 
identifiable as indecent because it was a dramatic 
departure from the customary norms for the broadcast 
medium.  I think the kind of nudity -- and I think if 
one just looks at the video here and sees it, I don’t -- I 
think it's hard to disagree with the proposition that 
that's a dramatic departure from what's the norm for 
broadcast television. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If they did an excerpt 

from "Hair," could they televise that? 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think it would raise 
serious questions.  I think nudity is going to raise 
very serious questions, and I think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In the -- in the opera, 
in "The Makropulos Case," there's a scene where a woman 
is seen nude entering a bathtub.  And suppose that were 
shown, that scene from the opera. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I don't -- I think, 

Justice Ginsburg, that in a context-based approach,

there's not going to be perfect clarity.  We recognize 
that.  But I do think with respect to this broadcast --
and that's the question before the Court, whether Fox --
excuse me -- whether ABC was on fair notice of whether 
this broadcast would bring them within the rule. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- what you're saying 

is, is that there is a public value in having a 
particular segment of the media with different standards 
than other segments.  And forget radio.  Let's just talk 
about television.  But -- you know, in the briefs, it 
says how much -- how many cable stations there are, and 
you, what do you call it, surf the -- you go through all 
the channels.  And it's not apparent to many people 
which are broadcast and which are not. 

But you're saying that there's still a 

value, an importance, in having a higher standard or 
different standard for broadcast media on the 
television.  Why is that, when there are so many other 
options, and -- and when it's not apparent to many 
viewers which of the two they're watching?  Just because 
it's an important symbol for our society that we aspire 
to a culture that's not vulgar in -- in a very small 
segment? 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  Two points in response to 

that, Justice Kennedy:  First, I think the Court's

previous decision in this case goes a long way to 
providing an answer, that yes, it does make a difference 
to preserve a safe haven where, if parents want to put 
their kids down in front of the television set at 
8:00 p.m., they know that there's a segment of what's 
available that -- where they're not going to have to 
worry about whether the kids are going to get bombarded 
with curse words or nudity.  And then the reason --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But this goes --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But then there's -- and 

then there's -- and then there's the chip that's 
available. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  Right. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And, of course, you ask 
your 15-year-old, or your 10-year-old, how to turn off 
the chip.  They're the only ones that know how to do it. 

(Laughter. ) 
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, and that -- that 

does point out the problem with the -- with the V-chip. 
Of course, the V-chip is not new.  It's been around for 
more than a decade, and the -- the broadcasters have 
tried to encourage uptake.  The government has tried to 
encourage uptake.  It hasn't taken. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But is your point is -- is

that the chip technology works better if you have this 
differentiation between broadcast and cable media? 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, a different point.  I 

think the -- I want to get to what I think is the 
fundamental point here, that whatever may be the case 
with respect to the ability of a viewer to differentiate 
whether something is a broadcast channel or a cable 
channel, the reality is that broadcasters are in a 
different position by virtue of the fact that they have 
a license from the government that comes with this 
enforceable public obligation that allows the government 
to create this safe haven, and that puts them in a 
different position. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, in a way, that's 

circular.  That's what we're here to argue about.  I'm 
asking --

GENERAL VERRILLI:  Right. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- is there a functional, 

a pragmatic, a practical difference between the two? 
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Is there -- well, I'm 
sorry, Justice Kennedy.  The V-chip works with both 
broadcast and -- and cable transmissions, to the extent 
it works.  The -- what the briefs have pointed out --
and I would suggest in particular that the Court look at 
the brief from the American Academy of Pediatrics, which

does a very thorough job in explaining the many ways in 
which the V-chip has proven to be a deficient 
technology.  A lot of it goes to the inaccuracy and 
incompleteness of the codes, the labels that -- that the 
programmers put in to begin with, which have to be there 
in order for the V-chip to decide what gets through and 
what doesn't. 

And I would point out in this very case, for 

example, with respect to the -- for example, the 2003 
Billboard Music Award broadcast with the Paris Hilton-
Nicole Richie back and forth, one would never have known 
from the code affixed for the V-chip purpose that that 
broadcast was going to have those kinds of words in 
them. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  What will happen when --

when we get to the point where -- when there are only a 
handful of people in the entire country who are still 
receiving television programs via the airwaves? 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I do think we're 

not there now, as we've said in our brief, but --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  We're almost there, right --

10 percent? 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  And I do -- but that I 
think -- that really makes what I think is one of the 
most fundamental points here, is that the broadcasters

want to have it both ways, right?  They -- the spectrum 
licenses they have are worth billions and billions of 
dollars.  Spectrum is staggeringly, staggeringly scarce, 
and -- and they're sitting on an enormously valuable 
resource which they got for free, and then they have a 
statutory benefit of must-carry, which gets them on 
cable systems automatically, and a further statutory 
benefit of preferred channel placement on -- on those --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sign -- sign me up as 
supporting Justice Kennedy's notion that this has a 
symbolic value, just as we require a certain modicum of 
dress for the people that attend this Court and the 
people that attend other Federal courts.  It's a 
symbolic matter. 

And if this is – if these are public airwaves, 

the government is entitled to insist upon a certain 
modicum of decency.  I'm not sure it even has to relate 
to juveniles, to tell you the truth. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  And -- and we certainly 
agree, Justice Scalia, with the point that was made in 
the Court's previous decision in this case, that -- for 
example, the words that are in the Fox broadcasts --
teachers don't use those words with students.  You don't 
hear those words in churches or synagogues.  There are 
many, many contexts --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you -- you are saying 

that the standard can still be symbolic, as 
Justice Scalia said.  We want the King's English when --
the very children we're talking about, when they go on 
the street, when they -- their big brother says 
something to them, it is -- the words that were -- the 
expletives are in common parlance today.  I mean, it 
is -- I think that children -- that children are not 
going to be shocked by them the way they might have been 
a generation ago. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  Justice Ginsburg, I think 
something this Court said in its prior decision is -- is 
right on the mark with respect to this issue, which is 
it's a question of whether it's portrayed as 
appropriate.  And when it is -- it's one thing when your

13-year-old brother is saying it to you or some bully in

It's another when it's presented to you in

That's true with respect to words, and it's also true 
with respect to nudity. 

If I might reserve the balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS 

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS FOX TELEVISION 

STATIONS, INC., ET AL. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

I'd like to respond initially to some of 

General Verrilli's general observations.  First of all, 
he talks about indecency as somehow serving as the core 
of the overall understanding of the regulatory deal that 
was made here.  And it's difficult for me to accept that 
notion when there was no effort whatsoever to enforce 
the -- the standard of indecency between 1927 and 1975. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's because 

broadcasts didn't commonly have this sort of -- these 
sorts of words or these sorts of images. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, maybe, maybe not.  We

don't know.  All we know is that for a period of 
50 years, nothing happened.  So, the idea --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, no, we know. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, that's right. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, we can -- it 

was not the case from 1927 till whenever you -- what, 
1970-something -- that nudity commonly appeared on 
broadcast television or the various words we're dealing 
with here commonly appeared.  So, it seems a bit much to 
say, well, they didn't bring any cases for that period. 
There were no cases to be brought. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  The only point I'm trying to 

make, Chief Justice, is that if you're talking about 
this as sort of the core understanding between the 
parties, it simply played a fairly minor role in the 
process through the bulk of the regulatory period we're 
talking about.  And, indeed, if you put it in context, 
this is a statute that prohibits obscenity, profanity, 
and indecency.  And while the FCC spent a lot of time 
writing about profanity as somehow being offended by 
what went on in this omnibus order, the commission has 
completely abandoned that under these circumstances. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But how about this, 

Mr. Phillips:  Look, you've been given a privilege, and 
that gives the government at least somewhat more leeway

to impose obligations on you.  Not -- can't impose 
everything, but at least has a bit more leeway.  And 
here we've had something that's very historically 
grounded.  We've had this for decades and decades that 
the broadcast is -- the broadcaster is treated 
differently. 

It seems to work, and it -- it seems to be a 

good thing that there is some safe haven, even if the 
old technological bases for that safe haven don't exist 
anymore. 

So, why not just keep it as it is? 
MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, first of all, Justice 

Kagan, it was important to catch the answer to your 
question when you asked it of General Verrilli, which 
was you're not saying that we lose all of our First 
Amendment rights.  So, clearly we retain our First 
Amendment rights. 

And, under those circumstances, it seems to 

me you've got this two ways:  First of all, the idea 
that it, quote, "worked" -- it worked perfectly fine 
from all the way up until 2001, even I would say until 
2004, when the commission wildly changed its approach. 
And it's only become dysfunctional since 2004 and, as we 
sit here today, literally facing thousands and thousands 
of ginned-up computer-generated complaints that are

holding up literally hundreds of TV license renewals, so 
that the whole system has come to a screeching halt 
because of the difficulty of trying to resolve these 
issues. 

So, to say that the system is working well, 

it seems to me, at least from the broadcasters' 
perspective, is to say -- is to suggest that's just not 
true. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you want us to 

overrule a decision of this Court, Pacifica. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, Justice Alito. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, as to radio, what --

what has changed? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I'm not here --
JUSTICE ALITO:  To justify that?  Well, 

could we hold that the policy is -- is invalid as to --
on First Amendment grounds as to TV but not as to radio? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Absolutely, Your Honor, 

because there are fundamentally different media, and 
there are different protections and the circumstances 
are different, and the Court has recognized that media 
have to be evaluated individually.  But what has 
happened over the 30 years with respect to the broadcast 
side of television is a very fundamental change.  Cable 
is now equally pervasive.  Cable is now equally

accessible to TV, satellite equally accessible to TV. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that -- but that 

-- that cuts both ways.  People who want to watch 
broadcasts where these words or expose their children to 
broadcasts where these words are used, where there is 
nudity, there are 800 channels where they can go for 
that.  All we're asking for, what the Government is 
asking for, is a few channels where you can say I'm not 
going to -- they're not going to hear the "S" word, the 
"F" word.  They're not going to see nudity.  So, the 
proliferation of other media, it seems to me, cuts 
against you. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it seems to me there 

are two answers to that:  First of all, the notion that 
one medium operates in a certain way in the exercise of 
its First Amendment rights can be used as an -- as an 
explanation for taking away or for -- for restricting 
the First Amendment rights of another medium is flatly 
inconsistent with what this Court has said across the 
board in the First Amendment context.  You don't balance 
off one speaker against another and give one favored 
status and give another unfavored status. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's your 

argument there, is that it's not a legitimate objective 
to have a safe harbor.

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, you can get a safe 

harbor, and, indeed, there are a number of safe harbors 
that are out there.  First of all, there are a ton of 
cable networks that are aimed exclusively at children. 
And, you know, there are five, six, eight stations that, 
I guarantee you, you will see -- where you'll see none 
of that language. 

And, second of all, it's always available to 

the United States Government to decide to hold this --
to create its own license for the United States to be a 
broadcaster and to ensure that the broadcasts of the 
United States public network exclude anything they want 
to exclude because that's government speech and is in no 
way restricted by what the First Amendment would 
provide. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if we rule in your 

favor on the First Amendment grounds, what will people 
who watch Fox be seeing between 6:00 a.m. and 
10:00 p.m.?  Are they going to be seeing a lot of people 
parading around in the nude and a stream of expletives? 
MR. PHILLIPS:  Not under the guidelines that 

the -- that Fox has used consistently from 10:00 p.m. 
until 6:00 a.m. and candidly that all of the other 
networks follow. 

The truth is the advertisers and the

audiences that have to be responded to by the networks 
insist on some measure of restraint, not a measure 
of restraint --

JUSTICE ALITO:  So, what will you put on 

that you are not able to put on now? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I mean, some of the 
things that we could at least wonder about is "Saving 
Private Ryan," "Catch-22," perhaps the beginning of the 
Olympics.  There's a whole slew of questions.  I mean, 
the -- and if you go beyond that and you think about 
what speech has been chilled, the Tillman memorial 
service is not broadcast because of fear of what's going 
to be said there.  Football games, basketball games, 
local news events --

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So, suppose we 
take that particular line.  You didn't argue -- I mean, 
Fox didn't argue -- Fox was worried about the fleeting 
expletive policy in Golden Globe.  I doubt in Golden 
Globe, when it was before the commission, they raised 
all these vagueness challenges to the whole 2001 policy. 
So, why -- here you've taken a much broader 

stance now, though you didn't before.  I mean, do you 
want to say anything about what I think is the basic 
issue that Fox raises?  We don't have to overrule 
Pacifica.  What Fox was penalized for was two women on

television who basically used a fleeting expletive which 
seems to be naturally part of their vocabulary. 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE BREYER:  And -- and we're worried 
about small stations that cannot censor people because 
they don't know what they're going to say.  All right. 
That was what we wrote, I think in -- in my opinion, 
anyway.  We were worried about that. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  Are you abandoning that 

argument? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  No, no, no, of course not. 

But you have to realize, Justice Breyer, that what -- I 
mean, the Second Circuit, because it didn't have 
available to it sort of what to do precisely with 
Pacifica, tended to focus on the question of vagueness. 
Vagueness was certainly an argument that we made there, 
but --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's an ABC argument 

primarily, but you made that argument in the Second 
Circuit.  What I'm fishing with -- you don't have to 
comment more, but -- is, do we have to reach that 
argument?  Except it's --

MR. PHILLIPS:  No --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- very, very broad --

MR. PHILLIPS:  No.  It's absolutely clear to 

me that if this Court wants to say no more than we 
decided the outer limits of the First Amendment in 
Pacifica --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 
MR. PHILLIPS:  -- and it goes to the verbal 

shock treatment that Justice Powell described in a 
separate opinion, and this doesn't come anywhere near 
that, and, therefore, this is beyond what the First 
Amendment provides, the Court could clearly hold that 
way and rule --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's not really 

clear.  I mean, if you want us to be really clear, you 
should ask the FCC to simply outlaw any fleeting use of 
the "F" word, the "S" word, any -- any shots of any 
nudity in any movie, buttocks included.  That would give 
you all of the notice that you need.  Why don't you 
propose that?  Boy, that's certain as can be. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, our basic argument 
would then -- I mean, obviously what you'd be taking 
away is the vagueness argument, but that would just 
bring you back then, Justice Scalia, to the core 
Pacifica argument and the question of how far can the --
how is it permissible to allow the FCC to regulate the 
broadcast networks on standards that are fundamentally

different than cable, the Internet, and every other 
medium that exists?  I -- you know, I'd be perfectly 
happy if they want to try to adopt those kinds of 
standards and subject them to the strict scrutiny 
requirements that this Court applies to every other 
medium, because the truth is those requirements will not 
withstand scrutiny under those particular standards. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, broadcast TV is -- is 

living on borrowed time.  It's not going to be long 
before it goes the way of vinyl records and eight-track 
tapes. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  I hope that -- I'm sure my 

client is not thrilled to hear you say that. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, no, I'm sure. 
(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm sure your clients will 
continue to make billions of dollars on their programs 
which are -- which are transmitted by cable and by 
satellite and by Internet.  But the -- to the extent 
that they're making money from people who are using 
rabbit ears, that's -- that's disappearing.  Do you 
disagree with that? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  No, I -- it would be -- you 

know, obviously not, because that's why we're not 
uniquely accessible or uniquely pervasive.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.  Well, so, why not just 

let this die a natural death?  Why do you want us to 
intervene --

(Laughter.) 
MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, because -- well, we 

didn't ask you to intervene, actually.  The FCC is the 
one who asked you to intervene. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you're asking us to 

intervene by overruling a prior precedent. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I'd be -- well, I think 

once the issue is before the Court, it ought to decide 
the First Amendment question that's presented here, and 
the First Amendment question says what can the FCC do 
under these circumstances? 

It seems to me there are probably four 

different ways you can go about it, all of which says 
what the FCC did here is wrong.  You can say Pacifica is 
an exceedingly narrow decision.  It goes to the outer

celebrity or want-to-be celebrity that's interviewed can 
feel free to use one of these -- one of these words?  We 
will just expect it as a matter of course, if you 
prevail.  Isn't that the necessary consequence of this 
case? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, that they will use it, 

perhaps.  But that doesn't mean that we wouldn't 
continue to try to bleep it out as best we could because 
we have our own standards. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I mean, even you did 

in this one.  You said now remember you're on 
television, which was just, you know, giving an added 
incentive for these vulgar comments. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, that was clearly not --
I mean, from Fox's perspective, it was not scripted to 
set it up that way.  But, remember, the first -- the 
first expletive --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But, I mean, isn't it 

inevitable that this will happen? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  It is inevitable that --

well, I think it's inevitable regardless that people are 
going to continue to use language that they would 
naturally use.  So, yes, I do think you can expect on 
cable and any other forum in which you have humans 
speaking that this kind of language will expand.

I don't know that it -- and it will probably 

be the case that in some context, particularly live 
television, which is really what's placed in jeopardy by 
this, that you will have less live television because 
your concern is people will continue to use this 
language. 

On a lot of awards shows, I think it's 

candidly easier to go ahead and -- and bleep this.  It's 
not always -- it's not foolproof, but the stations are 
committed to doing that.  They've all got their 
standards.  And that was applied in this particular 
case.  So, while there may be some marginal increase in 
it, if you compare it to the use of this language beyond 
the broadcast context, it's the -- it is just the 
narrowest of slivers of increase, Justice Kennedy. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think that there is a 

difference between what a person sees on broadcast 
channels and what a person sees on basic cable?  Basic 
cable now? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  You mean, can the average 

child understand the difference between the two? 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  In -- no, in content.  Is 

there a difference in content?  Because basic cable 
channels are not restricted by these rules, and I'm just 
wondering whether you think that there's a difference.

Because I -- it has not been apparent to me that there 
is. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I mean, in some -- I 

think it probably depends on which -- which channels you 
-- you look at, and even in the basic channels, but the 
-- there's the cartoon that's significantly more adult 
that's on the cable channels than the cartoons that you 
might see on the -- on the Fox Television. 

So, yes, I think there's probably a certain 

edgierness to it, but that said, it's still clear 
that -- that as long as you have advertising revenue 
that drives a significant amount of the decisionmaking 
here, you're going to have the kind of self-restraint 
that frankly ought to cause the Court to say we should 
no -- we no longer need to treat the broadcast medium as 
the weak sister of -- of the media. 

And, therefore, they ought to have the same 
protections that everybody else has, and that they will 
engage in the same restrained approach to these kinds of 
issues that newspapers do.  I mean, the Post doesn't run 
the language of the case that's -- that's being argued 
before it.  Cable does.  All of those media do.  Because 
there are natural restraints.  You don't need the 
Federal Communications Commission any longer to ensure 
under these circumstances.

If there are --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What you acknowledge to be 
the vulgarity of cable suggests otherwise, doesn't it? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I'm not suggesting that 

there's -- there's some kind of wildly different 
approach.  All I'm suggesting is that there -- that, in 
general, most people who -- who rely upon advertising 
and have to play to a particular audience in order to 
make their money is going to -- is going to obviously be 
restrained. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that depends 

what your audience --

MR. PHILLIPS:  At a minimum, the 

broadcasters will be. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It depends what 

audience you're -- you're trying to get and the 
demographic.  If you're trying to get an audience that 
is older, maybe you will decide this is what is going to 
attract them.  They don't want sanitized language.  They 
want to hear the -- the -- all those other words.  If 
your target is a much younger audience, maybe that will 
happen.  But the idea that you're -- the problem is 
going to go away because you're going to be good as you 
can be, that seems an odd way to analyze First Amendment 
problems.

is that -- that the obligation, the burden, rests on the 
Federal Communications Commission and Congress to show 
that there is a real problem that needs to be solved and 
that this is narrowly tailored to achieve that.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS ABC, INC., ET AL. 

MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

When the issue is the content-based 

regulation of speech, it is the government, not the 
speaker, that must steer, quote, "far wide of the 
prohibited zone."  That foundational principle is 
nowhere in evidence in the FCC's current enforcement 
regime, which not only intrudes into the prohibited zone 
but also enforces the indecency ban in a starkly 
inconsistent manner. 

A regime in which government officials 
decide years after the fact that 7 seconds of rear 
nudity in this particular episode of "NYPD Blue" is

indecent, but 40 seconds of nudity including full 
frontal nudity in "Catch-22" is not; that expletives in 
a documentary about blues musicians is indecent, but 
even more of those expletives in a fictional movie about 
World War II is not, is constitutionally intolerable. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  People understand --
what you're -- have demonstrated, I think, is that the 
context matters.  People understand that, including 
children.  When they hear a bad word when someone hits 
their thumb with a hammer, they understand that's 
different than having an adult stand in normal 
conversation and use the words.  And it seems to me that 
your position is saying that the government cannot 
regulate with an understanding of what takes place in 
the real world. 

The government's effort is to try to 

understand the context.  That's why you get a different 
rule in "Saving Private Ryan" than you get with Paris 
Hilton and Nicole Richie.  And what your argument seems 
to be is they can't take context into account. 

MR. WAXMAN:  On -- quite the contrary.  This 

Court made clear, in particularly Justice Powell's 
concurrence in Pacifica, that context is all-important. 
And just look at this case.  Despite -- and this goes 
directly to some of these questions about nudity.

Despite decades of denying complaints about televised 
nudity, the commission chose this case for the first 
time to sanction nudity on television in a serious drama 
that had been on for 10 years, that had featured over 
the --

JUSTICE BREYER:  This wasn't -- I mean, I --

don't know about this instance.  It's called "Nude 
Awakening."  It's about the sexual awakening of a child. 
You ran it, your client, after 10 o'clock on both 
coasts, and they choose to run it at 9 o'clock for some 
unknown reason in the Midwest.  Maybe they thought -- I 
don't know, whatever.  But the --

(Laughter.) 
MR. WAXMAN:  It's not --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But -- all right.  So, my 

point is what the FCC terribly told you to do was run it 
1 hour later in the Midwest, just as you did on the 
coast. 

MR. WAXMAN:  Just --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And -- and why is that 

not -- I'm not saying -- taking this point of view, but 
I'm saying why isn't that just time, manner, and 
circumstance that puts you to very little trouble and 
allows everybody to see it and, therefore, is 
constitutional?

MR. WAXMAN:  The -- this is not some sort of 

obscure, unknown reason.  This show was run across the 
country in the last hour of prime time, which happens to 
be from 9:00 to 10:00 p.m. in the Midwest and Mountain 
Time zones. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because you wanted to make 
more money from it, I understand that.  And maybe people 
would have been a little bit inconvenienced, but the 
inconvenience -- they made a judgment that looking at 
this show is not like "Private Ryan."  It's about sexual 
awakening.  They are showing a part of a nude woman. 
The viewer is supposed to put himself in the position of 
the boy who's seeing her, and the whole thing was 
titillating. 

Now, they might be wrong.  There are two 
sides to that argument.  And so, I guess what you're 
arguing is -- if I were to say, is that a reasonable 
view?  I guess I'd have to say it.  But you have to 
say much -- you're telling me I have to say much more 
than that. 

MR. WAXMAN:  Well, number -- yes.  Number 
one, it is not a reasonable view for reasons that I'll 
explain.  It was not sexual awakening.  This was the 
portrayal in the context of a story line about the --
the difficulties and embarrassments of blended families.

This was an exploration of one of the things that 
happens, which is a little boy stumbles in and watches a 
woman in the quotidian activity of preparing her morning 
shower. 

In any event, the commission for years had 
been adjudicating complaints about nudity, and I -- I --

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right. 
MR. WAXMAN:  It is simply untrue -- it is 

simply untrue that this had never occurred before. 
"NYPD Blue" itself was in its 10th season.  The very 
first episode, which caused a lot of media attention, 
included a nude scene of love making.  It was the 
subject of any number of complaints. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I see where you're going --

the question. 

MR. WAXMAN:  Okay. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  Which -- you haven't seen 
where I'm going.  I wanted you to say just exactly what 
you said, and you did, which I thank you. 
MR. WAXMAN:  You're welcome. 
(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE BREYER:  And -- and my question, 

which I've been trying to get so you'd see very 
precisely what it is, is why don't I just say, if you're 
right, just what you said?  And say this is an instance,

case by case, in which, for the reasons, then I quote 
you, that the First Amendment forbids the application of 
the guideline to this case.  In other words, what I'm 
driving at is the basic thing that's worrying me here: 
Does this case in front of us really call for the 
earthshaking decision that you all have argued for in 
the -- in the briefs? 

And that's what I'm trying to figure out, 
and that's why I am particularly worried about whether 
or not this whole big argument here was presented to the 
FCC about whether we have to reach that far.  Now do you 
see where I was trying to get? 

MR. WAXMAN:  I think so. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right. 
MR. WAXMAN:  And if not, I -- I hope you'll 

tell me.  First of all, the -- the -- both First 
Amendment and Fifth Amendment issues were fully argued 
in front of the commission, and the commission addressed 
them in its decision in the ABC case. 

We, of course, didn't ask the -- suggest 

to the commission that it should no longer apply 
Pacifica because the factual predicates for more relaxed 
scrutiny didn't apply, as we didn't in the Second 
Circuit, because only this Court can reconsider the 
application of that standard.  So, that's an argument

we're making here. 

That argument is not necessary to resolving 
this case, either on First or Fifth Amendment grounds. 
This broadcast -- and particularly in light of the 
ubiquitous V-chip, this broadcast is not actionably 
indecent under Pacifica, number one.  With respect to 
notice or the vagueness of the application to this show, 
clearly this was a shot out of the blue. 

The commission cannot identify -- I 

challenge the commission to identify a single decision 
of the commission issued before this was broadcast in 
2003 in which it had sanctioned any display of nudity, 
and I'm going all the way back to 1978. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  By "sanctioned," you mean 

punished as -- as opposed to "blessed" sanctioned? 

MR. WAXMAN:  Yes, yes, yes.  Yes, sanctioned 

in the "ouch" sense. 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How many displays -- how 
many displays of nudity were there that -- that went 
unsanctioned? 

MR. WAXMAN:  Well, for -- I don't -- I can't 

tell you, but I can tell you based on --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, well, I mean, if there 

are very few, it's not a very powerful argument.

MR. WAXMAN:  Well, I -- I think it's a 

powerful argument.  Let me explain the ones that I know 
of.  1978, the commission's decision in WGBH, which 
complained about scenes of explicit nudity in "Monty 
Python's Flying Circus":  Denied.  "Catch-22," 
40 seconds of nudity, including 10 seconds of full 
frontal female nudity:  Denied. 

The four or five decisions that we -- that 

we discuss on page 18 of our brief and that are appended 
to the merits brief of the ABC affiliates.  I can't 
remember whether it's 12 or 16, but more than a dozen 
episodes of "NYPD Blue" itself that included displays, 
graphic displays, of nudity during the prior nine 
seasons -- complained about and not adjudicated. 

That is the backdrop against which the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  My law clerk found 17. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's what you 

found -- that's what you've got over --

JUSTICE BREYER:  My law clerk found --

sorry. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's what you've 

got over 85 years. 

MR. WAXMAN:  Well, first of all, we don't 

have television broadcasts over 85 years, and since 
there were no reported decisions of any indecency

enforcement until Pacifica, I think it's only fair, as 
you pointed out yourself, to look at what the commission 
has been addressing. 

They're right now -- I mean, you know, I've 

cited the ones that are the subject of commission 
decisions.  I haven't cited the -- I haven't attempted 
to hypothesize about all the other instances, but let's 
just look at what's at stake here because the issue, 
Justice Breyer, is not just notice to ABC in this case. 
The question is whether the standards -- the 
commission's standards as it's currently applying them 
are so vague and capacious that they not only permit 
arbitrary action, but they are engaging in arbitrary 
action. 

Right now, as -- as Mr. Phillips suggested, 
the commission has pending before it, which it has not 
denied for years, complaints about the opening episode 
of the last Olympics, which included a -- a statue very 
much like some of the statues that are here in this 
courtroom, that had bare breasts and buttocks.  It -- it 
has refused to say that “Catch 22” -- its "Catch" – right 
over here, Justice Scalia. 

(Laughter.) 
MR. WAXMAN:  Well, there's a bare buttock 
there, and there's a bare buttock here.  And there may

be more that I hadn't seen.  But, frankly, I had never 
focused on it before.  But the point --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Me neither. 
(Laughter.) 
MR. WAXMAN:  Could -- could ABC or anybody 

else rebroadcast the "Roots" series?  Could it 
rebroadcast "Catch-22," which the commission is now here 
saying, oh, no, no, no, that was just our staff; that 
wasn't us.  In the "Saving Private Ryan" context, where 
the commission did say as a commission, not actionably 
indecent. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But your only conclusion 

from that is that they can't have any rule. 

MR. WAXMAN:  No. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  That their -- what is -- I 

looked through the briefs; I don't see what you're --
tell me where in these briefs do you suggest what the 
rule ought to be. 

MR. WAXMAN:  In our brief --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  All right. 
MR. WAXMAN:  -- we don't suggest what the 

rule ought --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 
MR. WAXMAN:  -- ought to be, because (a)

are any number of options. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, we -- well, we have 
to anticipate what the natural results or consequences 
of our decision will be. 

MR. WAXMAN:  Sure. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  As I understand it, the 

same rules that we apply to obscenity for printed 
material, under your view, would apply to television. 
MR. WAXMAN:  Well, those rules certainly 

would apply.  And before I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In other words, if it's --

if it's not obscene, you can publish it.  Period. 

MR. WAXMAN:  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm not 

suggesting that the indecency proscription in the 
statute cannot be applied in a constitutional way.  I 
can give you four different --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I thought that was 

the whole gravamen of your argument. 

MR. WAXMAN:  No.  Our -- our arbitrariness 

argument is that we now have a standard that employs 
nonexclusive factors that use capacious, vague words 
that can be balanced any way the commission wants to, 
without explanation for what all the factors are. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But isn't that inherent in 

the context-based approach?  Unless you have an approach

that says there are certain body parts you can never

going to be able to come up and say you had this 
broadcast and you said that's okay; and this one, you 
said is not okay? 

MR. WAXMAN:  It certainly is not.  And I can 

offer the Court or perhaps the commission four 
approaches it could take to reduce the astonishing 
vagueness of the current --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where are they in the 

briefs?  Can you just cite the pages where I will find 
the alternatives to the present system that don't jump 
obscenity alone? 

MR. WAXMAN:  I don't know the pages.  Let me 
just -- I can't remember the pages.  Let me just outline 
what I think -- four different things that could 
ameliorate the vagueness of the current regime. 

First of all, the FCC could revert back to 
it's, quote, "emphatically narrow enforcement regime," 
which acknowledged, one, that it had to defer to 
reasonable judgments of the broadcasters, and not 
exercise the -- an editorial eye looking at camera 
angles, whether something was or wasn't necessary to the 
message.  Number two --

let you get all four out.  But on that, the reasonable 
deference to the broadcasters, your policy was not to 
allow people in the situation of Paris Hilton and Nicole 
Richie to use those words. 

MR. WAXMAN:  Well, I --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, if they deferred 

to your reasonable judgment, your friend's reasonable 
judgment, they would sanction those. 

MR. WAXMAN:  I'm not owning Nicole Richie, 
and I think the best answer to the Nicole Richie point 
is that there is a scienter requirement in the statute 
that, you know, would preclude the application to a 
good-faith effort.  But let me just --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Go on to 

number two. 

MR. WAXMAN:  I'll just go back.  Well, no --

there are three parts to number one.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your time's -- I 

think you are. 

Your time is about to expire.  If you want 

to get your four points out, you'd better move. 

MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.  The first one is to 

revert back to the prior enforcement regime that existed

before 2004, which deferred to reasonable judgments, was 
restricted to material that is not momentary exposure 
but is dwelled upon, and that, as Pacifica explained, 
was egregious material akin to depictions of erotic 
activity. 

The second thing they could do is make this 
three-factor test -- or however many factors it is -- a 
test, not just a nonexclusive list of an infinite number 
of factors that could or couldn't be balanced in any way 
the commission wants to. 

Even if it wants to leave it as factors --
and this is number three -- it could at least identify 
what they are and apply them consistency -- consistently 
through adjudication that explains why one over-balances 
the other, which it certainly did not do in this case. 
And it also could clean up the actual form 
of the words that it uses, referring, for example, to 
sexually explicit or excretory activity. 
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr. Chief Justice. 

First with respect to the notion of 

self-restraint on the part of broadcasters, I think a 
little history is in order here.  The commission started 
with the rule that came out of Pacifica.  What it faced 
in the 1980s, with that being the outer bound of the 
commission's authority, was the explosion of the shock 
jock phenomenon, Howard Stern and Bubba the Love Sponge 
and the rest of it, which didn't use any of the seven 
words in the Carlin monologue, but which was highly vile 
and lewd, and it required the commission to make a 
judgment.  Now, that was all advertising-sponsored 
broadcast.  And so, I do think the risk of a race to the 
bottom is real --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  General --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- and this history is 

showing it. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think that the -- that the 

networks really are saying, well, even -- even if some 
regulation is permissible, the kind of regulation that 
the FCC has done here is regulation that gives it 
complete discretion as to what kind of speech to go 
after and what not to go after; that it has not tied 
itself in any way to any kinds of standards.  And it's, 
you know, evident in the notion that this -- the way

that this policy seems to work, it's like nobody can use 
dirty words or nudity except for Steven Spielberg --

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- and that there's a lot of 

room here for FCC enforcement on the basis of what 
speech they think is kind of nice and proper and good. 
And that that's a serious First Amendment issue. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  I -- well, I disagree. 
First, that's the lens problem again.  We are talking 
about a tiny, tiny number of the broadcasts that occur 
in a month, much less a year, much less a decade.  So, 
the idea that there's a significant First Amendment 
problem that encompasses a wide variety of broadcast 
expression I just don't think comports with the facts. 

Second, I do think if one looks at the 

corpus of decisions that the commission has made about 
what's indecent and what isn't, I think one can see with 
respect to the large majority of them, the vast majority 
of them, that it's clear which side of the line 
something fell on.  Yes, there isn't perfect clarity. 
There are going to be some hard cases.  But they really 
have identified what is, in the great scheme of things, 
a trivial number of hard cases. 

I don't think one can say that this is a 
situation like Reno in which there's effectively no 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

55 

standard at all.  In Reno, this Court distinguished the 
Pacifica situation eight ways to Sunday, and I think 
we've identified them in our brief and those are valid. 

I do think there's a significant problem 

with thinking about Pacifica as the outer bound of the 
commission's authority under the First Amendment.  Of course --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even though the Justices 

involved said this is a narrow decision, both Justice 
Stevens and Justice Powell. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, and, Justice 

Ginsburg, that's true, and the principles the commission 
continues to apply are narrow principles.  This is 
not -- this is not something that covers a vast array of 
speech on broadcast.  It's a tiny fraction.  And so --
and I do think if you're talking about Pacifica as the 
outer bound, the consequences are the shock jocks are 
fine; the Super Bowl half-time episode with Janet 
Jackson is fine. 

You can have as many of these 7-second 

episodes of "NYPD Blue" as you want.  That's all fine. 
In fact, anything that's -- anything that isn't at 
that extreme level is fine. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And on the other side, 
you'd better be careful about calling certain people,

certain artists to be interviewed because, even though 
it's unscripted, there's always a risk they're going to 
say something they shouldn't say. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  But I -- a couple answers 
there.  One is the delaying bleeping technology, Justice 
Ginsburg, and the other one is that there is a scienter 
requirement under the commission's enforcement authority 
here.  And so, in that situation, it seems highly 
unlikely you would have the requisite scienter that 
could lead to a forfeiture. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe the third is you 

shouldn't interview these people. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  Let me spend, if I could, 

a minute on the "NYPD Blue" broadcast.  The -- ABC 
hinges a lot on the notion, Justice Breyer, that this is 
a non-sexualized episode.  I mean, I guess one could 
make up one's own mind looking at the video.  The 
commission decided that that was -- it was essentially 
voyeurism.  The --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Finish your 

sentence, please. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  Thank you.  The little 
boy walks into the room at the very end of that -- of 
that segment of nudity, and I do think that fully 
vindicates the commission's judgment with respect to the
