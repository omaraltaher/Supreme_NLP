STRAUSS               ON BEHALF OF THE NO. ­ PETITIONERS                   MR. STRAUSS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:               Maryland determined that new generation was      needed for local reliability, so it directed its retail         utilities to sign ­year contracts with a competitively         selected project developer.               Maryland's action did not intrude on Federal       authority, primarily for two reasons.                 The first reason is that Maryland's new       resource did not distort the wholesale capacity auction.        FERC revised its auction bidding rules to require the         Maryland resource to bid on the basis of its cost,          backing out any State contract revenue. The developer         bid in accordance with the rules and cleared the         auction.             FERC says that means that the resource is        Alderson Reporting Company Official economic, needed, competitive, and does not suppress       prices, any State revenue notwithstanding.                             The second reason is ­­    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it doesn't        suppress prices, why did Maryland do it?                   MR. STRAUSS: Maryland did it, Your Honor,        because they saw a need for generation going forward.          As is clear in the generation order, Maryland perceived         a problem. It had large coal units that it believed           were going to retire in the coming years, and it needed           to have resources in place to be able to meet that need.            So it undertook to have those resources built pursuant         to the contract mechanism before you.                  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if that hadn't       happened, prices would have been higher. So it was to           suppress prices.              MR. STRAUSS: No, it was not to suppress         prices, and, frankly, Your Honor, could not have        suppressed prices.              FERC revised the rules in to be clear         that the resource had to bid on the basis of its costs            without regard to the State revenue. So there was no           way for it to suppress prices. If the costs had been            too high for the resource, it would never have cleared.          It wouldn't have been in the market at all. It was only             Alderson Reporting Company Official in the market because it was able to clear on the basis            of its cost, which showed it was efficient.                    And FERC made that finding. FERC found it         needed, competitive, and not suppressive of prices       notwithstanding the subsidy.               JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why was this done        through stepping on FERC's turf at all? I mean, could            it have been done by requiring long­term contracts with         the new generator?               MR. STRAUSS: It was done through long­term        contracts, Your Honor, but the question of getting        involved with FERC's turf is as follows:                   FERC has ­­ has set up the capacity auction         in PJM, and when under that auction, PJM procures three          years in advance for a one­year period all the capacity           the region needs, and then it allocates the cost of that           capacity among all the utilities. But it tells the          utilities that you have a way to hedge against those           costs. If you have long­term resources, resources that         you bought or procured through contract, you can bid         them in, and if they clear, they will offset the cost.                       Maryland's concern was this: It wanted and        needed the resource, but it was concerned that the         resource clear so that it hedge against the cost and          customers not pay twice for the same resource.        Alderson Reporting Company Official             So in order to do that, it entered into the          contract for differences. And the way it did that was           it did a competitive procurement and found a developer           who was willing to undertake the risk of nonclearance.                     And that was the issue. The contract for         differences assigns and allocates that risk to the        developer, not the State, and that enabled the resource         to go forward in a way that would not result in any             possibility of a double charge.                  The contract developer ­­ the developer      receives the contract price. The utilities paid the         contract price and no more than that, received the         market price. That is exactly the way this would have           worked if we had simply done it as a bilateral, with one             key difference. The difference is that the risk of          nonclearance is with the developer, not the ­­                   JUSTICE ALITO: Well, there's another key       difference. If you had done it directly with ­­ if CPV            had contracted directly with the distribution utilities,       that would have been subject to regulation by FERC,         would it not?               MR. STRAUSS: Yes. This contract was as         well.             JUSTICE ALITO: Only after you lost in the         Fourth Circuit did you concede that, isn't that correct,         Alderson Reporting Company Official on the very day of the Fourth Circuit's decision?                                             MR. STRAUSS: No, Your Honor.      JUSTICE ALITO: No.    MR. STRAUSS: In the district ­­ let me         explain why. In the district court, during the district          court litigation, CPV obtained market­based rate      authority from the FERC and filed a motion with the           court telling the court that the case should be         dismissed because the contract was being entered into        pursuant to that authority. And that made it a FERC            contract that could be reviewed at FERC. So any party           could have filed the complaint.                 JUSTICE ALITO: But your initial position       was that it did not have to be reviewed by FERC; wasn't            that ­­ isn't that right?                 MR. STRAUSS: That's ­­ that's correct. The         position below was that it was either of two things,          Your Honor. Either it was a non­jurisdictional         financing arrangement or it was a FERC­jurisdictional        contract. But either way it was not preempted, and that           was the question. It was either subject to FERC's          jurisdiction or outside it. But the question of whether          it was preempted would not have been ­­ the answer would           have been the same regardless. The district court         decided that it would deal with that motion in its          Alderson Reporting Company Official order, and decided in its opinion that while it probably          was a FERC­jurisdictional contract, the judge went ahead         and found what Maryland had done unconstitutional.                   JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm not sure why it is that          when you say it was subject to FERC's jurisdiction, that          doesn't end the case right there against you, because if          it's subject to FERC's jurisdiction, that means it's a         wholesale sale. And that's for FERC to do is to set the             rates and other terms of wholesale sales, and that's not          for the States to do. So that means you're preempted.                       MR. STRAUSS: No, that's ­­ no, no. No, it           does not. You're exactly right, Your Honor. Wholesale          sale is for FERC to review.                  But the way the statute works, sellers under        the statute are permitted to set rates as an initial          matter by contract or tariff. FERC superintends that         process, as this Court decided in the NRG case a number            of years ago. In this case, the developer, the seller           set the rate through a contract entered into with the           State utility. That contract would be subjected to FERC          review. That's just another day on ­­                   JUSTICE KAGAN: Are you saying that Maryland        didn't set the rates just because they use an auction?          Is that what you're saying?                 MR. STRAUSS: Maryland did not set the rate         Alderson Reporting Company Official because Maryland did not select the price. The price          was selected by the seller.                 JUSTICE KAGAN: That's true of FERC itself.        FERC doesn't set rates anymore, either. It allows an          auction to set rates, but we would never say that that           doesn't mean that they are FERC rates, that they are          FERC­approved rates. And so here, the fact that         Maryland decided not to set rates directly but to allow          an auction to do it, I mean, that's just a mechanism             that Maryland chose. They are still Maryland's rates.                     MR. STRAUSS: The ­­ the auction ­­ the         auction that FERC designed, the wholesale auction,       permits, if not incentivizes, exactly what was done        here. FERC has made that very clear. The purpose of            the auction is to ­­ in part, to provide information to           the market about what kinds of long­term contracting        is ­­ are needed, what is needed.                   JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you used the auction        dynamic, the auction mechanism to go outside of the ­­         of that dynamic.               MR. STRAUSS: What we did was perfect ­­        yes, Your Honor, but that's perfectly permissible.       Remember, the ­­              JUSTICE KENNEDY: That ­­ that's ­­ I ­­                     MR. STRAUSS: Let me explain.      Alderson Reporting Company Official             JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm ­­ I'm sure that        that's one of the issues in the case.                    MR. STRAUSS: Yes, Your Honor. The auction         dynamic allows for parties, and indeed encourages       parties, to enter into long­term contracts for capacity        resources and bid them into the auction. But they can't           clear the auction. They don't become auction resources         unless they are able to do so. And in this case, FERC             had in front of it exactly what Maryland and a related            program in New Jersey were about at the time they          revised the rules.               What FERC sought to do was to reconcile the         issue of the State programs and how they would interact          with the auction, and FERC did that. It set a different             bidding process, and Maryland followed that bidding       process. The CPV resource bid in accordance with it and           cleared on that basis.                JUSTICE ALITO: But the ­­ as originally set         up, CPV had no incentive to ­­ to bid anything other           than zero; isn't that right? All it was interested in           was clearing the market.                MR. STRAUSS: That is ­­ that is correct.                     JUSTICE ALITO: And that affects the dynamic        of the ­­ of the PJM auction, does it not?                      MR. STRAUSS: Yes. Yes, Justice Alito, it         Alderson Reporting Company Official does. And that's why in , FERC, when it became           aware that this had happened, changed the rules.        Remember, originally, when FERC approved the auction in        , it said that State resources that were being built          for reliability, which is exactly what this resource is,         could bid in at zero, a zero price, and clear           automatically in order to ensure that States could meet         their responsibilities to ensure of a liability.                    In , when FERC became aware of the        Maryland and New Jersey programs, it revised the rules.         But it didn't prohibit those resources; it didn't        preclude them. It changed the rules so that they could           continue to bid, but they had to bid on a cost basis.                         JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But ­­ but I have to say           that they also looked at a long­term contract ­­ FERC           did, and PJM ­­ in the PJM Interconnection order, and it           determined that a seven­year lock­in period for a new           generator was unfair, unjust and unreasonable. It's        something it can do.                Why didn't that end what you're doing?       You're arguing that you're not affecting price. FERC         disagrees, because you have no incentive to bid anything         other than zero. I don't understand why this case is            not ended by FERC's determination that locked­in       contracts are unjust and unreasonable.     Alderson Reporting Company Official             MR. STRAUSS: FERC determined that under the        auction it would not allow a guarantee of more than           three years. But FERC did not at that time say that            long­term contracts outside the auction were prohibited.       Long­term contracts are a staple of this industry, as          this Court knows, and FERC was not trying to prohibit          them. What FERC was doing there was, the three­year          lock­in, which I think is what you're alluding to,          Justice Sotomayor ­­              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is it different than        your contract?              MR. STRAUSS: It's different in that this is         a ­year agreement.               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know the years are        different, but I'm talking about the mechanics.                   MR. STRAUSS: The mechanics of it are that         it operates outside the auction, but bids into the         auction. The ­­ the new entry price adjustment to which           you refer functions within the auction and for a very           specific purpose. It's designed to address the        situation in which you have a relatively small         geographic zone and a relatively large plant that's         built. The concern is that when you build that resource           and put it in the market, it creates a glut, and prices             will crater. And the concern was because of that, no           Alderson Reporting Company Official one will ever build such a resource. So the auction            allows you to lock those prices in for three years, but           that's simply in that particular circumstance.                  What FERC said when asked to make it longer         was that's not the purpose of the auction. The auction           is not intended to ensure revenue certainty. It's         intended to provide information, information that the       market can use in making contracting decisions. And         that is exactly what happened here.                  Maryland looked at the ­­ at the auction        results, came up with a program to have a resource built             outside the auction, which would then bid into the         auction, but it had to do it in accordance with FERC           rules. FERC is the gatekeeper of the auction. Maryland           couldn't insert itself into the auction in a way that           FERC didn't allow, even if it wanted to.                                JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Strauss ­­     JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't ­­ I ­­ I           didn't ­­ I have to admit for myself, in this kind of             brief, it would have been much, much easier if people          had used simplified examples with real numbers. I have           a hard time thinking in terms of simply abstract words.          But as far as I understand it, my law clerk says that             this cost­based system of FERC is that the minimum­offer         price has to be set, that is, they have to set a price              Alderson Reporting Company Official at percent of the cost of new entry for a combustion             turbine generator or a combined cycle generator. That's          as they calculated ­­ PJM, or if it's neither of those           two kinds of generators, it's at percent; is that          correct?              MR. STRAUSS: I believe that is, Your Honor.                     JUSTICE BREYER: If that's correct, then if        I have a generator up somewhere in the hills of ­­ of             surrounding their hills in Maryland, and it's more        expensive to get coal up into those hills or oil or           natural gas, and so I have a generator that I can ­­              that's megawatts, and it allows me, based on cost,          to charge, if I were to charge the full cost, and that             depends on the banks and loans and so forth, it allows           me to charge $ a megawatt­day. Okay?                     MR. STRAUSS: Okay.                JUSTICE BREYER: Does that? I can go to           FERC, and I can say percent of that is what I am               going to put into the pool, 'cause I know that Maryland            will give me the rest. And this is not one of those two              kinds. And percent of is around ­­ I don't know,              my math isn't too good ­­ .                   So they get awarded the contract 'cause it's        , but there's some other firms that are more         expensive over here, and those other firms don't get         Alderson Reporting Company Official into it at all because we used up all the generating           capacity that we needed for the next five years with          your firm and a few others. And that changes rather            dramatically who supplies the contract, and it also        changes the price at which retailers across PJM will pay          for the electricity they are getting from the pool.                     wrong.                         Now, is that right? That's either right or         MR. STRAUSS: Well, Your Honor ­­      JUSTICE BREYER: If it's right, it seems        like the end of the matter. If it's wrong, then you            explain to me why.                MR. STRAUSS: Here's what's going on, Your        Honor. If the cost of the generator is below the           default price, that or percent price that you          described, the generator is ­­ that is its offer floor,          and the generator is permitted ­­                 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I'm assuming that the        cost is higher than the percent.                   MR. STRAUSS: That ­­ that might ­­ that         might be a problem, but I have two answers to that, Your              Honor.             First of all, that was not this case. In          this case, the ­­ the resource bid on the basis of its            cost, and its cost base number was below the default          Alderson Reporting Company Official price. So there was no issue of a ­­ of what you've              described as a resource with a cost above the default            price that gets to bid the default.                   JUSTICE BREYER: So you're asking only for        the case where it's below. You're not interested in the           case where it's above. And this whole case has been           argued only in the case where it's below.                    MR. STRAUSS: Well, that is actually what        happens, Your Honor.               JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not saying what       happens. I'm saying we have to decide a legal issue.            Is my legal issue to include my example or is it not?                        MR. STRAUSS: I think it does not include          your example, Your Honor. That is a different kind of            distortion. The Solicitor General mentions it in its         brief. And if FERC ­­ FERC, in , when they revised            the minimum­offer rule, did not find reason to adjust         the offer level higher, which might have limited that ­­         that problem. If FERC now believes that that distortion          exists ­­             your time.              JUSTICE BREYER: I don't want to use up all           MR. STRAUSS: I'd like to reserve the        balance for rebuttal. Thank you.                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.      Alderson Reporting Company Official             Mr. Elgarten.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFTON S. ELGARTEN               ON BEHALF OF THE NO. ­ PETITIONER                   MR. ELGARTEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:               Let me respond first to Justice Kagan's       comment. The way the Federal Power Act works is States           have the power and the authority, recognized by FERC, on          the purchasing end of any contract to direct their local          utilities to enter into any contract they want.                    When they direct a purchaser to do so, that          gives rise to a contract that is certainly within FERC's           jurisdiction to review. They review the rates charged         on the other side of the contract, the seller side of           the contract, and they review the ultimate contract        itself. But the notion that you are setting the rate by            engaging in a contract with a seller is completely           inconsistent with what has always been ­­ and I can only            say always been the rule ­­ and that's how the Federal           Power Act is written as set forth in our reply brief.                       The Federal Power Act supplies jurisdiction      on the seller side of those rates.                   JUSTICE KAGAN: If I understand what you         just said, you're not relying on Mr. Strauss's argument.         Mr. Strauss said that this wasn't a ­­ setting a           Alderson Reporting Company Official wholesale rate because Maryland did it by auction.                    But you're saying that's irrelevant; that      Maryland could have just picked a price, and ­­ and that            that would have been fine so long as at some point FERC            had the power to review and veto it. Is that what            you're saying?              MR. ELGARTEN: No. It's ­­ it's a fair           point, but no, Maryland could not have picked a price.           It could not impose that price on the seller.                                 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well ­­    MR. ELGARTEN: The ­­ the long­standing rule        of FERC has been if it's competitively set by the          seller, leaving the seller free to respond to the ­­ to           the bid of the purchaser, then it is subject to FERC,           and that review process is there. And it is not           inconsistent with Mr. Strauss's position.                 In the specific circumstance of an auction,       what we had here ­­                                        JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess I ­­        MR. ELGARTEN: Yes.    JUSTICE KAGAN: ­­ I don't understand that.         I mean, just take a hypothetical case where ­­ where           Maryland said to all its utilities, this is the price          and this is the only price that you will pay for           electricity. Alderson Reporting Company Official MR. ELGARTEN: Crosses the line.      JUSTICE KAGAN: Are you ­­ are you saying         MR. ELGARTEN: I belive that would ­­        JUSTICE KAGAN: ­­ Maryland could do that?        MR. ELGARTEN: I believe ­­ there's a case                                   that ­­                                     from ­­ from the Commission, says that would cross the          line. I am imposing a price that all my utilities would              sell. That crosses the line.                  JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. Then you are saying         that everything's dependent on the difference between       picking a price and letting an auction pick a price.            But I guess I ­­ I'll repeat the question that I made               to ­­ to Mr. Strauss.                   I mean, we know that one of the ways that         you pick a price is by letting an auction determine that            price. That's exactly what FERC does.                   MR. ELGARTEN: We ­­ we had a competitive          bid to bid ­­ build a power plant. That's what was set              up here. We were talking ­­ in answering your first           question, I was answering the conceptual question of         what it is FERC regulates. FERC regulates the seller          side of ­­ of every transaction.                  In the auction context, things get a little         more complicated, as you just discussed in the ­­ in the           Alderson Reporting Company Official EPSA case. This case, however, was a procurement to           build a power plant.                   CPV bid to build this power plant. It       looked at the costs it would take to build a power plant             in this locale, how much turbines cost, how much it          would cost to run the plant and to bid into the market            and make it available to the market. Of course, it then            divided the price over the years. You have           monthly payments. That's exactly what we bid.                    We understood that for Maryland to pay for        us to build a power plant and to keep all the profits             from our sales in ­­ in the markets, both the energy           sales and capacity sales, both were involved ­­ that         would be unfair. They didn't want the ratepayers to          both finance our power plant construction, which is what         Maryland was after, and keep all the revenues.                    So the contract reads ­­ and this is on         page of the reply brief ­­ the contract reads: "We            turn over all the revenues for years, and we build           the power plant." They pay us to build the power plant.            We turn over the revenues. It is correct enough that           the net of that is the difference between the revenues          and the price. But the purchase here was to build the            power plant.              Now, how did it impact the auction? How         Alderson Reporting Company Official does it impact the auction? The auction was always set           up by FERC on the understanding that States have the          inherent power, and I mean the reserve power under the           Federal Power Act itself to direct these kinds of         long­term contracts, to direct capacity purchases      outside because they control the purchasing decisions of        their local utilities every single day. They review         them and they control them. And they understood that          States would be using long­term contracts to support new         generation.             So FERC didn't, just as an act of grace,         allow constant sales of capacity outside the auction.        They constructed the auction against the existing       authority of the States to do exactly what was done          here.             JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it be correct or        incorrect to say that under Maryland law, you entered ­­         you entered the auction, and as a result, you altered           the consequences of that auction in a way that was           inconsistent with FERC's policy. Is that a fair or an            unfair statement?              MR. ELGARTEN: No, it is not fair, because         FERC's policy, it was expressed. They said when States          do exactly what was done here, before they even set up           the auction ­­ and then in ­­ in fact they said, if            Alderson Reporting Company Official States do what we do here, we have a mechanism in our             auction not to correct it, to adjust the auction so the           auction still functions. And that was the point         Mr. Strauss was making.                The minimum­offer price rule, which has two       formats, is acceptable to FERC because FERC says if you          comply with that rule, it does not artificially suppress         prices. That was FERC's judgment, whether it was a           percent or percent situation of how you bid.                      FERC has determined that is competitive,      economic ­­ these are quotes ­­ does not ­­ does not           artificially suppress prices because FERC wants those       bids in. You're a competitive resource.                    In our case, however, we didn't even use        that default price. We used a pure cost­based price.           So the concern the government expresses that there's a         possibility of an exception which they say they haven't         corrected ­­ I think FERC did it on purpose and said it             doesn't suppress prices ­­ the possibility of that        exception is eliminated. We were ­­ we, in our case,           because we bid a pure cost­based bid.                    And when you bid a pure cost­based bid, does          it affect the market? Of course. The addition of           supply affects the market. FERC doesn't think that's a          bad thing. FERC thinks that's a wonderful thing.          Alderson Reporting Company Official             JUSTICE BREYER: Why? That's another       problem I have here. I ­­ don't spend more than a              minute on this, but I don't understand the procedural          posture of this case. That is, it seemed to me it            started out by saying that there was a ­­ a Supremacy             Clause private right of action or something, which I         think there isn't, in my opinion.                              MR. ELGARTEN: Uh­huh.    JUSTICE BREYER: And then ­­ and then it         seemed to go we don't have FERC's opinion. We only have            it through the SG. I thought there was a doctrine             called primary jurisdiction where if the agency       really ­­ their views is really relevant on that, you          got their views directly, what happened to all that?                     MR. ELGARTEN: We want to be in front of ­­          of the Commission. We believe the Commission should         decide these issues. We think the Commission would         decide these issues favorably to us because they have         done so in connection with this very case. When the           issue arose of this offer ­­                                         JUSTICE ALITO: Of course.     MR. ELGARTEN: ­­ being presented ­­      JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't understand        your position. You're ­­ you're arguing that FERC does          not think that this adversely affects the auction? Is          Alderson Reporting Company Official that what you're saying?                MR. ELGARTEN: Adversely affects the      auction. In fact ­­                JUSTICE ALITO: Why ­­                MR. ELGARTEN: ­­ the auction ­­                  JUSTICE ALITO: Why has FERC filed a brief          arguing the opposite? I ­­                  MR. ELGARTEN: I ­­ if you read ­­                     JUSTICE ALITO: You're arguing as if they're        not even here.               MR. ELGARTEN: If you ­­ if you read the          FERC's decisions that we've cited, the and         FERC ­­ that's how it's numbered in the briefs ­­ if you            read that and you read the quotes that are included in           the Joint Appendix, you will see that FERC has         determined that these bids are competitive if they are         submitted in this way. Why ­­                  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you're saying that       FERC ­­ FERC doesn't understand its own order?                    MR. ELGARTEN: I'm saying FERC's ­­ as        happened in the Morgan Stanley case, there is a little           bit of changing of ­­ of tunes that's at issue here. If             this issue was presented to the Commission ­­ which is          exactly who should decide these issues of energy policy,         not this Court, whether something artificially      Alderson Reporting Company Official suppresses. These kinds of issues of energy policy and          how the auctions should work should be decided by FERC.                      Under this Court's case, Northwest Central,      it says if the issue between the State's authority and          the Federal authority can be reconciled ­­ and they were          reconciled with these specific contracts in front of us.         FERC modified the rules to allow exactly this bid and          determined that it did not artificially suppress prices.                    Does it affect prices? Of course. New         supply affects prices.               this ­­ JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. How would                    MR. ELGARTEN: Does it artificially do that?                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How would this work       normally? Meaning forget that a lawsuit was started.          You enter into this contract. Do you have to submit the            contract to FERC?               MR. ELGARTEN: No. Because we have what's         called market­based rate authority. It's been discussed        in your cases. So we notify them.                    Anyone can protest to FERC, yes. Anyone ­­                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can somebody protest      here?             MR. ELGARTEN: They didn't. They ­­ well,         they ­­ we thought they did. They raised an objection.           Alderson Reporting Company Official They said this is adversely affecting the auction. FERC          resolved their objection.               FERC had in front of it the very complaints         we have here. The complaints about ­­ excuse me ­­ the            RFPs and the solicitations from New Jersey and Maryland,         and they presented this to FERC.                   FERC said, ah, we take care of this in our         auction ­­ we've always known how ­­ with the         minimum­offer price rule. They said the minimum­offer        price rule, when it is applied, will result in not          artificially suppressing prices.               That is how this was presented to FERC.        With these specific contracts, they are in ­­ they are          in Volume III of the Fourth ­­ Fourth Circuit appendix.          These specific contracts.               Now, if they want to protest it again and         say these have rates, or the rates that affect the          jurisdiction, they are free to protest it yet again.         And I am ­­ I believe FERC would come up with the same               conclusion again and say this is perfectly appropriate        to bid into the auction in this way.                    Now, if somebody wants to petition, let's       close this what they are calling the "loophole," the one          that Justice Breyer suggested, because it doesn't       require a bid at exactly a cost­based price. They can             Alderson Reporting Company Official go to FERC and close that loophole. It wouldn't have           affected our case at all because we bid a cost­based,           but they can go to FERC on every one.                     All of the conflict preemption issues should       be addressed to FERC. They are not really for this           Court, which is obviously having some trouble       conceptualizing how this all works, to resolve. Those         conflict preemption on the Northwest Central issues go        to FERC.              JUSTICE GINSBURG: You wouldn't ­­                 MR. ELGARTEN: They should not ­­                  JUSTICE GINSBURG: ­­ get to conflict       preemption if field preemption applies.                 MR. ELGARTEN: That's absolutely correct.      And so on the issue of field preemption, have we          exercised an authority that belongs to FERC? No. By           setting ­­ by directing a contract or competitively         soliciting, we are not setting the rate. If we did, the            hypothetical from Justice Alito, we ­­ if we said         everybody in the State must pay that rate, FERC has          dealt with that issue. That crosses the line.         Competitive solicitations do not.                When ­­ the purpose ­­                JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is your explanation       for why FERC is on the other side now, when you're           Alderson Reporting Company Official saying it was in your corner earlier?                   MR. ELGARTEN: FERC ­­ FERC, as the        Commission through its rulings and orders based on        evidence and appeal, as reflected in the New Jersey         appeal, the NJBPU, appeal of that order, they were on          our side. When they were asked to join this case, the            Third Circuit said get in; they had two weeks. I think             they took an ill­advised position, but it's certainly        not a position that was done on the record subject to an             order.                         And that's what's decisive here. If the ­­        CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   Mr. Clement.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                 MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:               Maryland's effort to dictate what CPV      receives in connection with its wholesale sales to the         wholesale market operator is plainly preempted.                  Maryland's targeting of the Federal market      was direct in this case. CPV gets nothing unless it           bids and clears the PJM auction. Once it does, it must            sell all of its output, all of its energy and capacity           to PJM.  Alderson Reporting Company Official             If those things happen, then CPV receives,       thanks to the State of Maryland and its State action,          payment streams in conjunction ­­ in connection with        those sales to PJM that are different from and far more           stable than the prevailing price on the PJM auction.         And ­­             JUSTICE BREYER: Why? The ­­ the way that          they've described it to me ­­ I'll try this once more.           Because truer words were never spoke, than I am not           quite on top of how this thing works.                    But the ­­ the ­­ the way he described is,          what are they bidding into the PJM is their real cost.           And when they are bidding their real cost, Maryland         isn't going to pay them a dime. If they are an             inframarginal unit, which I assume they would be, the          cost for PJM is going to be higher, not lower. And            there will be extra money. So what they are going to do             is they are going to be paying Maryland.                    Now, what they said is, we're going to be         paying you.              Oh, he's shaking his head. So I haven't got           that right, either.               (Laughter.)             JUSTICE BREYER: No? No, I have got it           right? I don't know. I'm guessing at getting it right.             Alderson Reporting Company Official Maybe not.                                      this.             Anyway, I ­­ well, you see my problem ­­         MR. CLEMENT: Well, I ­­      JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ which is understanding       MR. CLEMENT: Well, I guess I can see your            problem, which is, I think, first, there's a factual           premise there ­­                          JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.    MR. CLEMENT: ­­ which is ­­ I think it's           pretty much conceded that, at least in the first couple          of years of this, the expectation is that CPV is going           to be receiving an additional payment, a forced payment,          from the LSC, the loading serving entity, to PJM. So           that's just a factual premise for you.                    JUSTICE BREYER: But are they bidding their        true cost into PJM?                MR. CLEMENT: Well, they sure didn't start        that way.              And let me start here. I mean, they had, as            I think Justice Alito alluded to, a completely different          incentive in bidding their costs into PJM than would a          private generator with new capacity.                   A private generator with new capacity is      going to build its actual ­­ bid in its actual costs           Alderson Reporting Company Official because they don't want to clear at the expense of          having an unprofitable generator.                It's a completely different dynamic for       somebody like CPV, because the bidding clear requirement        for them is just an obstacle to get to the pot of gold             at the end of the rainbow, which is all these guaranteed           payments for years. So they have every incentive to           understate their cost.               That incentive was realized here. They       talked about bidding in their costs. When they first          bid in their costs, they bid in their costs at less than            $ a megawatt­day. Okay?                  Now, when PJM took a look at that, they          ended up upping the figure sevenfold to about $. So           that's a great measure of their incentive to distort          their costs for FERC.                Now, what they will say is, ah, but        Mr. Clement, the $ bid cleared, and that's all that          matters.             Well, with all due respect, that's wrong.       FERC says it's wrong. A bid like this can still have a              price effect ­­ suppressive effect. And you can see          that in a couple of ways.                     I want to say one thing, though, is FERC is         here on our side in part because they are on its record            Alderson Reporting Company Official as saying this MOPR ­­ the minimum­offer price rule.         The MOPR is not some sort of cure­all that is designed           to ward off any price­suppressive bid. It is a default            rule. It is a coarse screen to deal with the most             egregious cost­reducing bids. It also depends on an         estimate of cost. And here's why it doesn't really work           for a bid like this.                  One of the most important costs is your cost         of capital. Well, what was CPV's cost of capital          without this program? They told you. They told          Maryland, without the ­year guarantee, we can't get        any financing for this project. We can't do it.                      At the bench trial, they told the district        court, our ability to bid this project depends entirely         on the ­­              JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's another way of        saying that the bid that ­­ that ­­ that FERC says that            they have to make is not their actual costs ­­                     MR. CLEMENT: What ­­                JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ because if in fact it's         based on a cost of capital that is lower than what the             cost of capital really is, that is a misstatement of           their cost or a ­­ an ­­ a lower­than­actual cost, just             as much as if the steel were in fact less expensive than            what they actually have to pay.      Alderson Reporting Company Official             MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely. And of course,        another component of cost is going to be future fuel          costs. And anybody who's been to the pump lately knows           that we can all have a lot of variance as to what we              think are going to be future fuel costs, but if I could             return to the capital cost and just finish this point,          it's even worse that it's misstated, because ultimately,        because they are getting a ­year guarantee and no one           else is, everybody else is calculating their cost of a          new generation financing based on the three­year price        signal that the ­­ that the ­­ that the capacity market           is settling, it destroys the ability to do an         apples­to­apples comparison. And then the one thing we         know for certain here is that this project ended up          displacing a project that actually could be built based          on the three­year forward price and without a ­year          contract.             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you'd have ­­      you'd have no objection if Maryland just decided to         subsidize the construction of the plant, would you?                    MR. CLEMENT: We would, Your Honor. I think           it might be a harder case, but particularly if the           subsidy was conditioned on a bid­and­clear requirement,        I would be here making a preemption argument. You might            not think it's as good of a preemption argument, and I            Alderson Reporting Company Official think that the only difference is because the statutory         text of the Federal Power Act, it seems to me to make            our position clearly correct, is the provision that says         that FERC has the authority to dictate what a seller           receives in connection with a wholesale sale.                    JUSTICE KENNEDY: How do you define the        field that's preempted?               MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think the field that          is preempted is the ability of a government actor to set            wholesale rates for wholesale sales. And so if you have           State action that sets rates for wholesale sales ­­ and          "rates" in this context is defined by the statute as          including what a seller receives for wholesale sales ­­         we think that's preempted.                JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are they ­­ are they        setting rates by having ended the auction?                   MR. CLEMENT: We certainly think so, and        more importantly, I think, for purposes of this case, so           did the district court. I mean, it's kind of odd for me              to hear my friends on the other side, as I heard them in              the colloquy with Justice Kagan, they essentially       conceded they lose if Maryland sets the rates, and that          would be an odd concession in any case, but particularly          where at footnote at the district court's opinion,         the district court finds ­­ as a matter of fact, I'll            Alderson Reporting Company Official concede it's a mixed question of fact and law and all,            but still there it is. The district court ­­                     JUSTICE KENNEDY: In a sense, I guess all of            the bidders in the conventional auction in effect set         their rates by their bid.                 MR. CLEMENT: Sure. And I think what          Justice Kagan alluded to is if Maryland ­­                   JUSTICE KENNEDY: So why is this ­­ why is          this different?              MR. CLEMENT: Well, it's ­­ it's not,        because I ­­ I think the point is, if Maryland is not              setting the rates here, than FERC's not setting any         wholesale rates, and that's not right. And so just          because you use an auction mechanism to set the rate,          that doesn't mean that it's not the State setting the          rate. And if you look at footnote , it's ­­ it goes             beyond that because, based on particular findings, based        on the testimony of the chairman of the Maryland PSC,          the district court said that actually because there was         back and forth between Maryland and CPV, this was         Maryland setting the rate.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is Maryland       setting the rates when it subsidizes the construction of         a power plant?               MR. CLEMENT: Well, if ­­ Mr. Chief Justice,         Alderson Reporting Company Official suppose they decided to ­­ I mean, potentially they          could. Not all subsidies are created equal. If they           had a subsidy that was measured, a dollar­for­dollar          subsidy based on sales to PJM, I would think that would            actually be setting the rate. Again, you might disagree          with me, but I would say that in that case, you would             have a very similar situation. I think this case is             that much clearer because these payments from the LSC is          directly conditioned on selling to PJM.                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Clement, can you       tell me how I write this opinion? And I'll ask you why.                          MR. CLEMENT: Okay.                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As I look at the         relevant statutory provisions, what it says is that FERC         has the power to ensure that rates that are set are           fair, are just and reasonable. So it doesn't say it           gets to set the rates. It says it can do rules and             regulation that control how the rates are set so that          I'm not sure how this is field preemption. At best, I            think it might be conflict preemption. And so if I           think it's conflict preemption, that something about       Maryland's plan conflicts with the system that FERC has         set in place, how do I articulate the rule in this case?             What is it that conflicts with FERC's rules and         regulations with respect to setting ­­ participating in        Alderson Reporting Company Official the market ­­ in the auction?                              MR. CLEMENT: Sure.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because as I understand        it, and I don't think you ­­ you've told me any            differently, that the people who are auctioning in the         market can and do enter into contracts with States on a           regular basis.              MR. CLEMENT: Oh, not with contracts with        the States. That's not what my friends on the other           side were saying. They enter into voluntary bilateral         contracts off of the market.                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.                MR. CLEMENT: And that is not what's        happened here.              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Voluntary       contracts outside the market.                MR. CLEMENT: Right.                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why is this involuntary?       Because of the State ­­                MR. CLEMENT: Because the State told the        load­serving entities that they had to make these        payments to CPV.               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So is that         what conflicts? I'm ­­ I'm trying to articulate the          preemption rule in some simplified way. I'm a little           Alderson Reporting Company Official bit like Justice Breyer on this. I'm not quite sure how            everything is working, but I don't think it can be field            preemption, because you have to explain what field we're         talking about and what rule we're setting in the future.          I think it's conflict preemption.                 MR. CLEMENT: I think it's both, Your Honor.          I think part of the reason this is difficult is because           it's like an overdetermined equation. There is both         field preemption here, but there's also conflict       preemption, and there are multiple evidences of conflict        preemption, because nobody's tried to do anything like        this before ­­              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So give me a simple ­­         sir, when I write this opinion ­­                   MR. CLEMENT: Sure ­­ right.                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ give me ­­ give me         the first paragraph. This conflicts with what?                    MR. CLEMENT: This conflicts with FERC's       determination that the PJM rates for the PJM auctions         are just and reasonable. As you said, the starting          premise here is the statute gives FERC the authority to          determine whether wholesale rates are just and       reasonable. FERC has done that effectively ex ante with          respect to the PJM markets by its regulations of PJM.          FERC has said that the auction clearing rate for sales          Alderson Reporting Company Official to PJM is just and reasonable.                  Now, the authority of FERC extends not just        to what the nominal rate is in the auction but to what            the supplier receives in connection with that sale. So          if a State, through State action, says, it's all very           well CPV that you've sold that to PJM and PJM has given            you a hundred, this is your lucky day, we're going to            give you another , that is clearly preempted because a          State is having the supplier receive something in        connection with a wholesale sale to PJM that is          different from the rate that FERC has determined is         reasonable.             JUSTICE BREYER: Let me try that with the         example. Five thousand new megawatts of capacity is         needed. Existing suppliers can't supply more than four.         So FERC is trying to get an extra thousand. The people            whom it will choose to give it and will allow to bid are             those who are the new people who have the lowest cost.           All of those people in a rising market will have higher            costs than the existing people.                 So if in fact FERC looks to the existing         people and says, which can bid? And says, you have to            use your real costs. And if they really implement that,           what you just said is going to have no effect on the            market, because they will be in the market whether they          Alderson Reporting Company Official are given a subsidy or whether they are not given a            subsidy.             And indeed, it won't affect the price       because the price is affected only by the marginal         units, who, by definition, have higher costs than        anything that FERC will look to to see what these          people's costs are. Therefore, it is without impact,         and they add to that.                 We would like to make this argument to FERC         where they have to focus on it and not just say in            general to the SG, this is how we think, because by the            time we're finished, we'll be able to modify present         rules so that they will see that they are not hurt at            all in the actual world by our costs.                      I did get something like that out of what        they said. Maybe I'm wrong in what they think. Maybe            they'll just agree because they think I'm agreeing with         them at the moment, but I would like to know some            response to that.               MR. CLEMENT: Here's your response, Justice       Breyer, and it comes in two parts, because there's at          least two parts to that question.                  First, I take issue with the premise because         it may be that some new generation will come in, in your            hypothetical, but it won't necessarily be this one. And          Alderson Reporting Company Official in fact here we know, as a matter of fact, that it             wouldn't be this one, except for the ­year guarantee,         and so they displaced somebody.                 shoulders ­­             you. I am.     But please don't just shrug your      JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, I am agreeing with                      (Laughter.)                         shoulders.             MR. CLEMENT: That is a huge ­­        JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not shrugging my       MR. CLEMENT: That is a huge difference,         because this ­­ the message this all sends to my clients           is don't take FERC's direction that you should be         competing based on market forces and efficiency. We         should stop competing efficiently on the PJM and try to          put the best bid together based on the three­year         advanced auction. We should start competing for        subsidies, and we should start competing for guarantees.                    The second part of your question, what about        FERC primary jurisdiction. This is all a bit rich           coming from my friends on the other side because, as          Justice Alito alluded to, when this all started, their         position was this has nothing to do with FERC at all.           This is a financial arrangement that FERC can't even          Alderson Reporting Company Official look at.              Then my friend talks about how, well, they        eventually got market­based rate authority from FERC in        a submission. Well, I ­­ I'd ask you to take a look at                what they said on Joint Appendix page of that          submission. What they said about the contract is they          said, quote, "CPV Maryland also notes that it included         the CFD in this application solely for informational        purposes and is not requesting that the Commission        address or discuss Commission jurisdiction over the CFD        in its decision on CPV's Maryland's request for        market­based rate."              Don't look what's behind that curtain,      Mr. FERC. We don't want you to do anything with that.            We're just here to try to get market­based rate         authority.             For them now to come in, not having raised         any objection to the Supremacy Clause cause of action ­­         and by the way, there was a Commerce Clause cause of            action there as well, which is maybe why the parties          overlooked it, and I do think that's not jurisdictional,          so I think we're past that.                   So for them to come in now and say, oh, this           has to go to FERC, I'm sorry; it's a bit rich. And I               understood why they were making the MOPR argument at the          Alderson Reporting Company Official early stages of this litigation before FERC filed the         brief. But I am a little mystified why, at this late              stage of the game, after FERC has filed three briefs          saying that the MOPR is not sufficient to eliminate         price­suppressive bids, that they're still saying we win        because FERC's on our side.                   I mean, that is a bit mystifying. And I          think FERC is absolutely right on this for the reasons          that we've already talked about. I mean, you can't           really even apply the MOPR in an apples­to­apples way if          you have this kind of ­year guarantee, because the         cost of capitals are completely out of whack. And of           course, they do have the problem that their own         testimony is they wouldn't be on the market at all if           they didn't have this ­year guarantee.                  So in the first capacity auction that we had         to deal with, the price was suppressed. In every energy           auction since then, the price was suppressed. And         that's why I think FERC ­­ you know, they never tried to             design the MOPR as this perfect thing.                   You talked about the percent and the         percent? Way back in one of those proceedings, my          client said, FERC, why isn't it a hundred percent? If            you think about the economics of this, it should be a           hundred percent. And FERC's response was, eh, close         Alderson Reporting Company Official counts, this isn't perfect, we don't pretend it's        perfect so we think perfect is a rough compromise.           Fair enough. Probably not arbitrary and capricious, but         it doesn't mean that this is something that the MOPR is           some perfect solution.                 I also don't think there's anything terribly      anomalous about the procedural posture of this case. I          think it's exact procedural posture you had in front of          you in the Schneidewind case. That was a district court            action, declaratory judgment for preemption.                 What I think makes this a preemption case,          and what completely distinguishes voluntary bilateral      contracts, is State action. It's the State action         forcing the LSCs to make these payments, and essentially         conditioning CPV's participation on the PJM market on        the bid­and­clear requirement. That's State action       that's preempted.              In the typical voluntary bilateral contract,      you don't have State action. The parties make their          agreement. They eventually submit it to FERC, or if          it's a market­based rate, somebody can object. And the           only time you really get State action at that point is           at the very end of the process when the State's doing           retail rate regulation, and that's the point where        Mississippi Power & Light and Nantahala come in and say           Alderson Reporting Company Official if at that late stage when there's finally State action          that the State has to take FERC's wholesale rate         determinations as a given; they can't second guess them          at late stage. But here you got the State action right            up front, and the State action is preempted.                    JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement, it ­­ it does         seem to me important what the kind of State action is.           And this goes back to the question that the Chief          Justice raised with you.                If the State had just said we need another         power plant and had delivered a load of money to CPV and             said go build a power plant, you're not saying that that            would be preempted, are you? If it's not at all, it ­­            it ­­ you know, that's going to have an effect on the            kind of bids that CPV is going to make. But the State             is not itself changing the outcomes of the auction         process. You wouldn't say that's preempted, would you?                     MR. CLEMENT: It would depend. I mean, the           way you just described it, I would say ­­ especially           because I think it's a helpful answer ­­ of course not,             not preempted.              (Laughter.)             MR. CLEMENT: But if they conditioned all of         that money on a bid­and­clear requirement, I would be           saying that that was preempted. I think it's a harder             Alderson Reporting Company Official case, but I'd hate to lose that case here because there           are cases like that that are being litigated in the          lower court.                          Thank you, Your Honor.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   Ms. O'Connell.               ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL               FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,                     SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS               MS. O'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may        it please the Court:                In the government's view, the Maryland      Generation Order is preempted because by requiring the        State­selected generator to bid into and clear the PJM         capacity auction in order to receive the guaranteed        payments provided in the contract, the Maryland program        directly intrudes on the Federal auction, and it also         interferes with the free market mechanism that FERC has         approved for setting capacity prices in that auction.                    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have a        position on the question that Mr. Clement avoided, about         what if the State ­­ what if the State subsidized the           power plant? Is that good or bad?                    MS. O'CONNELL: I ­­ I agree with          Mr. Clement's answer. If the State just ­­        Alderson Reporting Company Official             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What ­­ what was        Mr. Clement's answer?               (Laughter.)             MS. O'CONNELL: If the State ­­ if the State          just paid to build a power plant, that's not directly           targeting what's happening in the PJM auction. Sure,         it's adding supply to the market. But as long as the            State is staying within its sphere under the Federal         Power Act, that's fine.                But I also agree with the second part of his           answer, which is that if there was some kind of a           bid­and­clear requirement in the auction attached to it;        for example, if the State paid to build the power plant           and turned it over to CPV, but then they said, okay, we            want to get some money back for this power plant that we            built, so you're going to bid the capacity of this plant           into the auction. And unless you clear, we're taking          the plant away from you, or something like that. That           changes the incentives of the participants in FERC's        auction.                                                 And that's what ­­ what is the key ­­        JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that's the conflict?       MS. O'CONNELL: Yes. Yes.      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's ­­ that's      because ­­ you're articulating it as ­­ and correct me          Alderson Reporting Company Official if I'm wrong ­­ that the conflict is in affecting the           bid price in any way. Requiring it, affecting it, or ­­                                   MS. O'CONNELL: Yes. It's ­­      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ determining it.                  MS. O'CONNELL: It's in creating a conflict,         changing the incentives of the people in the market in a           way that conflicts with the market mechanism that FERC         has set up. We think that shows both field and conflict            preemption.             JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. O'Connell, you ­­ you        have both arguments field and conflict. If ­­ if you           were to win this case, would you rather win it on field            or conflict?              (Laughter.)             JUSTICE KAGAN: And why?                 MS. O'CONNELL: I mean, I think that field           preemption is probably a better way to decide the case,           and it would ­­ it would be a broader ruling. In such              a ­­ in such a ruling, I think the ­­ the Court would               say that when the State does something that alters the          incentives of the people that are participating in        FERC's market, that is intruding on the Federal field.                     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But for ­­ that ­­ that         answers the earlier question: No, they can't give money          to build a generator because that changes the         Alderson Reporting Company Official incentives. The generator's cost by definition change        if it's receiving subsidies for free.                  MS. O'CONNELL: If ­­ if the State is just          acting completely outside of the auction with no        requirement to bid into and clear in the auction, then          that is not something that changes the incentives of the          folks that are participating in the auction, which is         what happened here.               The ­­ the cost ­­                JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, why do you even need         the sort of change­in­incentives language? Why isn't        the field preemption argument more that this ­­ this ­­         this scheme essentially takes the rate that the auction         produces and changes that rate for CPV and for all the           utilities in Maryland?               MS. O'CONNELL: I think ­­ Justice Kagan,         the ­­ the reason why we don't agree with that broader           interpretation is because we ­­ FERC does not think that          just receiving extra money in ­­ in connection with         capacity that's being sold into the auction is        necessarily preempted, and let me explain why.                   There's something that happens in this      industry, a widespread practice called contracts for        differences. The contracts in this case are sometimes         referred to as contracts for differences, but because of         Alderson Reporting Company Official the bid­and­clear requirement they don't operate in the        same way.              Parties can enter into a hedge agreement.        For ­­             JUSTICE KAGAN: No, but that's ­­ but        that's ­­ when Mr. Clement said that there's a real           difference here between voluntary agreements ­­ you       know, if there's a contract for differences, fine, but          that this is Maryland coming in and effectively forcing         the LSCs to enter into such a contract, and by doing so,             changing the wholesale rate.                MS. O'CONNELL: Well, I think the ­­ the          problem that ­­ that FERC sees with this is the effect           that it has on the auction. If this was just a            bilateral contract occurring outside of the auction       where Maryland was accepting the results of a        competitive procurement and then submitting that      bilateral contract to FERC for review, that's where FERC         would review that contract.                The field that we're talking about here is        the auction. And what FERC is concerned about here is           the effects on the auction of a State program like the            one here that ties a subsidy or ­­ or extra payments            under the contract to a requirement that the ­­ the           person receiving it bid into and clear the capacity in          Alderson Reporting Company Official the auction.                          JUSTICE KAGAN: See, when we ­­      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How far does your ­­        how far do you think your authority reaches with         respect to indirect effects on the auction?                     I guess that was the point of my question on         the subsidies. I mean, a lot of things are going to              have an effect on the auction.                  Is it only because of the legal mandate in         this case?              MS. O'CONNELL: Yes. It's ­­ it's because         the ­­ the ­­ the program in this case, by requiring the            capacity to be bid into the auction and clear, it          directly targets the auction. It has a direct effect on            the auction.              We ­­ we recognize that, in the context of         the Federal Power Act, the State has its sphere too.          The State regulates retail rates. The State has control          over generation. And it can do things within that          sphere that have indirect effects on ­­ on FERC's field.                      But in this case the problem is that,        because of the bidding­and­clearing requirement, it's      directly altering the incentives of the people in that         market.             JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why doesn't the ­­ the         Alderson Reporting Company Official MOPR correct the problem?                MS. O'CONNELL: The MOPR corrects it to some         extent because the MOPR is choosing what ­­       what FERC   thinks is a fair price for a new generator            to bid in at.    The MOPR isn't a complete solution because,         as we've  described in our brief, if somebody bids in         at the  minimum­offer price rule but its costs are        actually higher, it is necessarily going to knock somebody out of          the auction that would have cleared otherwise, and the         price of the auction will go down.                   But ­­ and I ­­ I think, as Mr. Clement            correctly pointed out, the MOPR is not a ­­ a perfect             solution to this. In ­­ in this particular case, I           think the incentives of what ­­ what were ­­ was          happening under the State program is demonstrated by the         fact that CPV tried to bid in so low even when it tried             to cost­justify their bids. And the market monitor in          PJM, when trying to actually reconstruct CPV's costs,        came to different numbers on what those costs would be.                      So it's not a perfect way to try to screen           out offers that are not actually based on cost or that           should not be coming in.                 And ­­ and, additionally, just the fact that        FERC had to expand the MOPR to cover this program I           think shows that there's been an intrusion onto FERC's         Alderson Reporting Company Official field. FERC has tried to correct what's happening in          these programs through extending the minimum­price offer       rule to these bids, but I think that ­­ that just shows             that's what's happening here is that the State programs         are changing the incentives of the ­­ the people in the           field.             JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but I don't see how          that could be true. If FERC could, in fact, get rid of             the problem, then it leaves you with no conflict.                     MS. O'CONNELL: I don't think that's right.         I think the conflict is still with the ­­ the market           mechanism that FERC has set up in order to determine          wholesale capacity rates in the auction. When you have          a program that has this bid­and­clear requirement, it        alters those incentives. Even if there's not an actual          price­suppressive effect, the ­­ the ­­ the possibility        for a conflict or the imminent possibility of a conflict            still calls for field preemption.                 The ­­ the Court of appeals cited       Schneidewind and Northern Natural Gas on page a of         the ­­ of the Petition Appendix showing that ­­ that's          still field preemption.               It's ­­ what ­­ what FERC is concerned about         is the effects of the ­­ of the State program on the            participants in its auction. In this particular ­­ the          Alderson Reporting Company Official way that these contracts are constructed, CPV is going         to get the contract price regardless of whether the         clearing price is lower or higher.                  JUSTICE BREYER: I can see it. But what are            the words of the field preemption thing that puts         outside the preemption the thing that's worrying the        Chief Justice?              See, I ­­ I ­­ I mean, you ­­ you want to               say the field is so defined ­­                  MS. O'CONNELL: Well ­­                JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ as, and ­­ and now,         look, billions of actions of States affect the cost of          the generator and thereby affect the bid price into the          PJM auction.              Now, . percent we want the State to        do. They're perfectly free to do. But you want this             percent no. And ­­ and ­­ and I want the words that               are going to define that field.                  That's what Justice Sotomayor was asking for       before. It's something to do with the rule here in           Maryland that forces them not just to have these         artificial costs but to put it on the ­­ the auction.                       MS. O'CONNELL: Right.                JUSTICE BREYER: What are the words?                   MS. O'CONNELL: I think directly targeting        Alderson Reporting Company Official the auction to take some words from ONEOK would be a           fine way to do it.                             JUSTICE BREYER: I see targeting.       MS. O'CONNELL: The ­­ the ­­ the field that          we're talking about is the PJM auction. And any ­­ a            State program that directly targets the auction and the         incentives of the participants in that auction by the         bid­and­clear requirement is ­­ would be preempted under        a field­preemption theory. We think also under a         conflict­preemption theory.                I ­­ I could distinguish just a ­­ just a           little bit the contracts for differences that are not         tied to a bid­and­clear requirement in the auction.                     States ­­ or the parties in this context        will sometimes enter into a hedge agreement where they          agree on a price. Like a hundred dollars, if the             auction clearing price is below that, say it's , then          the person that the generator has contracted with, like         Merrill Lynch or something, owes the generator $        regardless of what ­­ what else happens. That         transaction will always take place.                 The generator then has to make a separate         decision of whether it wants to bid into the auction.          If it's ­­ if the auction price is and its costs are             , it's not going to. If its costs are , it will bid              Alderson Reporting Company Official in.             That sort of a contract for differences is         not preempted here. It's just when there's a         bidding­and­clearing requirement that the subsidy is      tied to.              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                    Mr. Strauss, you have three minutes     remaining.           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT H. STRAUSS               ON BEHALF OF THE NO. ­ PETITIONERS                   MR. STRAUSS: Thank you, Your Honor.                   We did not ­­ Maryland did not require CPV         to bid into the auction. CPV agreed to do so in            response to a competitive procurement.                  FERC has no issue with competitive      procurements, and that can be found in the Joint         Appendix. At page , there is a regulation in which            FERC essentially says so.                That's all that happened here.                 The question of whether we targeted the       auction: We did not regulate the auction. We could not            regulate the auction. We could not regulate CPV,         either. They're a wholesale generator. They make their           own choices, and they made their own agreement here to          enter into this contract.    Alderson Reporting Company Official             We couldn't regulate the outcome of the       auction because FERC regulates the outcome of the        auction. They control every aspect of it.                    And in this case, what FERC found was a rule           change was needed to address this very contract. The          change was made. The resource bid in accordance with          the rule change and cleared.                 FERC said its rule change would reconcile       the tensions between State policy and auction integrity.        FERC said that this resource was economic, needed,        competitive, and did not suppress prices.                  There was no undue price suppression or no        artificial price suppression from this resource. FERC        said that and ­­ and said it more than once. Even with             the State subsidy.               And the reason is very clear: Because the         bid was a cost­based bid without regard to the contract           revenue.             And keep in mind, there's been a lot of talk           about a subsidy here. Maryland concluded that, over the           life of this contract, this was going to be a better            deal for ratepayers than for the generator. And that is           in the generation order.                The only other point I would make,        Your Honor, is that the rule that should be articulated          Alderson Reporting Company Official here is one that allows each of the parties to fulfill           their responsibilities under the statute. Sellers get        to set rates as an initial matter. FERC gets to review            those rates, and States get to direct the procurement         decisions of their retail utilities.                 Been a lot of talk here about what the          retail utilities were forced to do. The subject is          State regulation. State courts have affirmed what        Maryland did here with respect to its retail utilities.         There should be no question about that. States can take           actions where necessary to develop new power plants.                    And as we move forward into an era of a new            generation portfolio in this country, the last thing the         Court should be considering is trying to limit State         options. It's very important to keep them open,         especially in a case here, where FERC has reviewed this           precise contract.              If you look on page of our reply brief,           there is a quote from the FERC rehearing order in           November of in which FERC describes an acceptable         arrangement and describes this arrangement: one in        which local utilities contract with a generator and the          generator bids the unit into the market.                   That is exactly what happened under this       contract. FERC speaks approvingly of it.       Alderson Reporting Company Official Thank you, Your Honor.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       Case is submitted.   (Whereupon, at : a.m., the
