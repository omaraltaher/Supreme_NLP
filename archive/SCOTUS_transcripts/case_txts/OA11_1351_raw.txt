Gonzalez Act.  The Act has two clauses, an operative

 As everyone understood at the time of the

Official 

 The operative clause says, in simple 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Feldman, but it says, 

1  clause and an introductory clause. 
2
3  declarative terms, that the intentional tort exception 
4  to the Federal Tort Claims Act shall not apply to any 
cause of action arising out of a wrongful act or 
5
6  omission in the performance of medical functions. 
7
8  first, "for purposes of this section."  And, as I -- I 
9  understand your argument, those words don't count.  In 
other words, you would be making -- you would interpret 
10
11 
the statute the same way if the sentence started with 
12 
"the provisions of Section 2680(h)." 
13
 MR. FELDMAN:  No, Your Honor.  That's not 
14  right.  We -- we -- that -- that -- the part after the 
15
16  intentional tort exception shall not apply to medical 
17  malpractice cases."  And that would make it apply across 
18  the government to any government employee who is 
19  performing those medical functions. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

By saying, "for purposes of this section," 
Congress limited it in accordance with the case -- the 
agency by agency approach that it had adopted in this 
area and limited it to just the cases that are covered 
by the Gonzalez Act; that is, by malpractice that's 
committed by doctors of the Department of Defense, the 

introductory clause says, "The provisions of the 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

Act -- they had already passed the statutes dealing, for 

1  National Guard, the Armed Forces Retirement Home, and so 
2  on. 
 And so the -- each clause serves quite an 
3
4  important function.  Congress had before the Gonzalez 
5
6  example, with the Public Health Service that's 
7  essentially written in the same terms, with the Veterans 
8  Administration -- although part of that was then added 
9  later -- with the State Department doctors, and so on. 
And so they were proceeding on an agency by 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18
19  purposes of this section," because it's only the 
20
21  and the torts covered by those sections. 
22
23  Administration, it doesn't say that, does it? 
24
25

agency basis, and the way to accomplish that was to 
first say, we -- we think that the intentional tort 
exception should not apply to these cases because in 
medical batteries of the sort that we -- as alleged in 
this case, are so close to the kinds of medical 
malpractice cases that are going to be brought against 
the government anyhow. 

agencies, only the personnel covered by those sections, 

 But then, in each statute, they say, "for 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The Veterans 

 MR. FELDMAN:  The Veterans --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes. 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. FELDMAN:  The Veterans Administration, 

Section A," which accomplishes exactly the same thing. 

 And, actually, if you look at the history of 

1
2  originally -- the original Veterans Administration 
3  statute, which was from about 1965, doesn't have this 
4  1089(e) intentional tort exception at all in it. 
But then they added it later, about 10 years 
5
6  after this statute, and then they added a provision that 
7  was slightly worded differently, but it achieves exactly 
8  the same result.  Instead of saying, "for purposes of 
9  this section," it says, "by the personnel named in 
10
11
12  that statute, the Senate report on that statute, quite 
13  clearly, recites that Congress understood that 1089(e), 
14  the statute here, has exactly the effect that I said. 
And they said, we are modeling it on that provision. 
15
16  And then they did tinker with the wording, and there's 
17  actually no explanation for the specific change. 
 But it's not uncommon that, in statutes that 
18
19  have been reviewed by different committees and passed 10 
20
21  would use slightly different language to achieve, 
22  essentially, the same purpose. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  What would -- what do you 
23
24  do, if anything, about those of us -- I hope more than 
25

one -- who actually look at legislative history, and the 

or 12 years apart, that Congress would have a -- they 

6

thing. 

United States will pay for unlawful assault and battery. 
 That's what the two reports say.  That's why 

1  House and Senate Report -- the Senate Report says 
2  Subsection (e) would nullify a provision of the Tort 
3  Claims Act, which would otherwise exclude any action for 
4  assault and battery, then the House says about the same 
5
6
 So, when I look at those two things, I think 
7  the purpose of this Act was to do just exactly what the 
8  other side says, it was to get rid of assault and 
9  battery as an exception and said the government of the 
10
11
12  they passed it. 
13
14  that's our -- that -- that's the way we read it, exactly 
like that, which is the -- by nullifying the intentional 
15
16  tort exception -- what the intentional tort exception 
17  provides is -- actually, what it says, is, "The 
18  provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act shall not 
19  apply to any case arising out of assault, battery," and 
20
21
22  provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act are otherwise 
23  totally applicable to cases of medical battery, like 
24  this, or other kinds of intentional tort. 
25

 MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  I believe, actually, 

so on. 

 And, by eliminating that, the -- the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't quite 

What the section does is provide that the 

and, therefore, you can bring an action against the 

1  Act -- that is, cases of medical malpractice committed 
2  within the scope of employment by the doctors of the 
3  certain specified agencies that Congress has named --

7
8  understand your answer to Justice Ginsburg on the "for 
9  purposes of this section." 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  that's right.  I mean, I think, for purposes of this 
18  section, you have to read it in context.  And the fact 
19  is that 2680 -- the term "2680(h) of Title 28" doesn't

remedy against the United States is exclusive.  But what 
the 1089(e) goes on to say is that the 26 -- the 2680(h) 
provision doesn't apply.  So I don't see how that -- I 
mean, the -- the reference is to the exclusivity, not to 
the waiver of the limitation on -- on intentional torts.

 The only work that that provision does in

of this section. 

1  cases. 

2
3  shall not apply, all that could mean -- all that could 

4  possibly mean is you eliminate that, and then you have 

the Tort Claims Act how it is.  And then what the four 

5
6  purposes of this section does is say, but we're not 

7  doing that across the board for every Federal employee 

8  everywhere or even every malpractice case.  We are just 

9  doing it for the claims that are covered -- for the 

10
11 
12
 In this section, if you look at (a), then, 
13  (a), which is the -- you know, basic exclusive remedy 
14  provision that Your Honor mentioned, what (a) does is 
15
16  malpractice committed by doctors and personnel. 
17
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, one of the 
18  strongest arguments by your adversary has to do with the 
19  incongruity between these claims and the Westfall ruling 
20
21  language argument, but how do you address the fact that 
22  we will be interpreting, essentially, two statutes that 
23  are almost identical, but with different conclusions now, if 
24  we were to adopt your view. 
25

by this Court.  It's more a policy argument than a 

deal specifically with -- intent with medical 

Official 

 So when they say, in simple terms, that 


MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  I -- I think there 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  are -- there are a few reasons why the statutes have to 
2  be construed differently.  I mean, one is that, if you 
3  look at the Court's decision in Smith, where it 
4  construed that provision of the Westfall Act, it -- the 
Court never suggested that the language -- the part of 
5
6  the Westfall Act whose language is the same as this 
7  supported its conclusion there.  It was relying on other 
8  provisions in the Westfall Act. 
 In particular, there was a provision that 
9
said, "Once the government substitutes itself for the 
10
11  defendant, the case shall proceed, subject to all the 
12  exceptions and limitations in the Tort Claims Act."  And 
13  the Court said, well, yes, that -- that gives us a clear 
14  understanding that, whether there's exceptions or not, 
15
16  provision isn't here in the Gonzalez Act. 
17
18  Westfall Act -- in the Smith case, in the Westfall Act, 
19  that dealt with making a specific exception for Bivens 
20
21  that --
22
23  Congress want to treat them differently? 
24
25

when they were dealing in this case with this area in 

cases.  And, again, that provision isn't here.  And 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But why -- why would 

 MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  I think the reason is, 

we want that case to proceed -- to proceed.  That

employees? 

 And they were -- when they focused on that 

remedies for tort victims and to protect Federal 
employees. 

1  1976, they were dealing with a specific problem of 

2  medical malpractice, and they were looking at that --

3  that problem, doctors, doctors had to get insurance, 

4  what are we going to do about that for Federal 

5
6
7  problem -- actually, as the Executive Branch itself said 
8  in a letter that was sent to the Senate committee, it 
9  said there's an urgent need, both, to assure adequate 
10
11 
12
13  and I think you see it throughout the Gonzalez Act. 
14  But --
15
16 
17 
18
19
20
21  you know, rather odd that, in -- in one instance, 
22  Congress would be concerned and, the other, not 
23  concerned. 
24
25

feel the need here to assure adequate remedies for tort 
victims, where they did not in -- in the Westfall Act? 

 MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  I think the difference 

is that, here, they were dealing specifically with the 

 MR. FELDMAN:  Well --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean -- you know, injured 

tort victims are injured tort victims.  It does seem --

 And that's what they were trying to do here, 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But why -- why did they

exception. 

 And, when they are looking at the broad 

 They were looking, generally, at a whole --

1  problem of medical malpractice.  12 years later, when 
2  they got around to the Westfall Act, they weren't 
3  looking at medical malpractice. 
4
the whole problem of government employees being sued 

5
6  after this Court's decision in the Westfall case, a 

7  problem that particularly affected, actually, lower 

8  level government employees who were -- it's clear, 

9  couldn't take advantage of the discretionary function 

10
11
12  universe of employees, they took a different approach 
13  and decided, well, we're just going to -- some people 
14  are just going to be out of luck because this is the --
15
16  appropriate there. 
17
18  problem of medical malpractice in the Gonzalez Act, it 
19  definitely took the position, as everybody said at the 
20
21  they wanted to preserve remedies.  And there are two 
22  provisions in the Westfall Act that make that clear --
23
24  this in slightly more concrete terms.  You have two --
two situations.  In one case, a Federal employee who's 
25

the determination that Congress made -- felt was 

 But, when it was looking at the specific 

time and as the structure of the Act itself showed, that 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, maybe we could address 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

Now, as -- under your reading, there 

that? 

 MR. FELDMAN:  That -- that's correct. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  Why would Congress want 

 MR. FELDMAN:  The reason they'd want it is 

1  driving a car deliberately runs somebody down.  And, in 
2  the second case, a government doctor grabs somebody who 
3  doesn't want an operation and performs the operation 
4  anyway. 
5
6  would -- there would be a claim against the government 
7  in the second situation, but not in the first situation; 
8  is that right? 
9
10
11 
12
13  this:  In the first situation, that -- that really 
14  arose -- that -- that problem came with the Tort Claims 
15
16  Congress was looking at the universe of Federal 
17  employees, they felt -- and, especially, given the law 
18  at that time and that continued really up to the 
19  present, that, when a Federal employee or average 
20
21  that they commit, especially a battery, it's 
22  extraordinarily unlikely that that's going to be within 
23  that scope of that employee's employment. 
24
25

 And Congress felt, well, we want to just 
eliminate that altogether.  It's not just to hold the 

Federal employee, for the types of intentional torts 

Act when it was first enacted in 1946.  And, when

 When they got around to 1976, to dealing 
with the particular problem of medical malpractice, 

1  government responsible for that kind of a claim, when 
2  some Federal clerk slugs someone or something like that, 
3  and that was the determination they made. 
4
5
6  the -- it doesn't actually usually happen -- these kinds 
7  of claims don't arise -- I'm not aware of anywhere a 
8  doctor just grabs somebody and throws him, physically, 
9  into the operating room.  They happen when the doctor is 
10
11  procedure or a procedure that was not authorized by the 
12  patient. 
13
 And that -- that is very closely related to 
14  core medical malpractice claims of exactly the sort that 
they were dealing with here.  It's very closely related 
15
16  to informed consent claims, which I believe the 
17  government -- I read the government to be conceding, 
18  could be brought against the government. 
19
20
21  malpractice from another.  We want all of these claims, 
22  we want to provide a remedy, and they all should be 
23  brought against the government. 
24
25

 I would add one other --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In law review commentaries 

 And they thought there was no reason to 

distinguish -- to distinguish one type of medical 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

is the kinds of claims you're going to have. 

1  and maybe in lower courts' opinion, is there -- is it 
2  fair to say that the weight of authority is to criticize 
3  the battery-negligence distinction as being productive 
4  of litigation and not really making a lot of sense? 
MR. FELDMAN:  I think that is fair to say, 
5
6  and -- you know, States -- a lot of States have dealt 
7  with this by dealing with -- in statutory -- in 
8  statutes, not in common law development, so they 
9  could kind of rationalize the system and say, look, this 
10
11
 But the key thing is that everybody in the 
12  country, I think, under every State's law, if a doctor 
13  performs an operation that you didn't consent to, you 
14  have an action in tort.  And that protects both you and 
15
16  doctors and medical personnel, to be sure that they are 
17  only doing what they are authorized to do. 
18
19  dealing with the Westfall Act -- I keep saying, "the 
Westfall Act" -- when Congress was dealing with the 
20
21  Gonzalez Act, there is not a hint that they were trying 
22  there to say, well, we want to save money or something 
23  by eliminating those kind of very, very traditional tort 
24  claims from those victims, and we don't want those

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Feldman, do I 


1
2  understand the mechanics of this right, that, if the 

3  injured person sued the United States directly, that 

4  suit would fail because the battery exclusion would 

apply, but it's only by suing the officer -- the doctor 
5
6  and then getting the United States substituted that the 
7  battery exception is abrogated; is that right? 
 MR. FELDMAN:  No, I don't -- I don't believe 
8
9  that that's correct.  There is nothing in this Act that 
says it should make any difference.  There is nothing, 
10
11 
certainly, in Subsection (e) or anywhere else in the Act 
that says it should make any difference, whether you are 
12 
13 
suing the government or suing the -- or suing the -- or 
suing the doctor.  If you sue the government, the 
14 
government says, well, we have a defense that the 
15
16 
intentional tort exception applies. 
17
18  purposes of this section, the intentional tort exception 
19  does not apply.  And what that means, "for the purposes 
of this section," is for claims that are covered by this 
20
21  Act, which is claims that are medical tort claims 
22  brought against personnel of the affected agencies who 
23  are acting within the scope of their authority.

MR. FELDMAN:  If it would be an assault or 

battery that was committed by -- within the scope of the 
professional's employment, then it would be.  But it's 
always the question of whether it's within the scope of 
employment. 

And I think, usually, the -- the case law --

Let's assume that it's not an operation, but 

 Is that covered under the Gonzalez Act, as a 

 Are there any other tort claims besides the 
1
2  lack of consent battery claim at issue here that could 
3  be encompassed by the Intentional Tort Act, as it 
4  relates to medical malpractice?

23  where -- you know, it would depend on the facts of the 
24  case. 
25

I mean, I think, usually, the cases are that a doctor 
who commits a sexual assault on a patient or something 
is not acting within -- in the kind of circumstances you 
are talking about, is not acting within the scope of 
employment. 

 But that would be a case-by-case

professional is sued and that kind of thing -- or -- or 
10

nonmedical professional, for that matter.  That --
12
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, when the 
13  government removes the case, it concedes that point, 
14  doesn't it, normally?  Where a case is removed from 
State court, the government -- the Attorney General must 
15
16  certify that it was within the scope of employment, no? 
17
18  correct.  And that is actually one of the two -- one of 
19  two of the key provisions of the Act, that kind of 
20
21  Congress was trying to do was preserve remedies because, 
22  in that very provision, after it talks about removing 
23  when the Attorney General has certified that it's within 
24  the scope of employment, it says, "The case can be 
25

remanded if the removed case is one such that" there --

 MR. FELDMAN:  That's correct.  That's 

establish -- that could make it very clear that what

19  which is the Gonzalez Act and the other four or five 
statutes continue to serve two -- at least two vital 
20
21  functions, and one is specifically this:  That they 
22  eliminate the -- the intentional tort exception and, 
23  therefore, allow relief for victims of intentional tort 
24  in this medical malpractice context, just like victims

tort provision, when that was passed, why -- was there 
any reason why Congress kept these five or six separate 
acts, like the Gonzalez Act, instead of saying, well, we 
did this piecemeal for particular agencies, and, now, we 
we’re dealing with Federal employees across the board, so 
there is no reason why we should have these five or six 
that go another way? 

 MR. FELDMAN:  Well, I can give you the 

of other kinds of malpractice.

 The other thing is there are some cases, for 

judgments are against them in certain -- when there's a 

So, again, Congress in that -- that 

1
2  instance, foreign torts, where there is another 
3  provision of the Gonzalez Act, 1089(f), that provides 
4  for indemnifying or holding harmless doctors, when 
5
6  foreign tort, when the doctor has been detailed to a 
7  non-Federal agency, or if the circumstances are such as 
8  are likely to preclude a remedy under the Tort Claims 
9  Act. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
 But that provision also shows that Congress 
17  intended that to preserve remedies here because it would 
18  have made no sense for Congress to say, we want to 
19  provide for the indemnification or reimbursement of the 
20
21  eliminate all the cases against doctors. 
22
23

provision remains important because there could be a 
foreign judgment against the doctor or something, even 
after the Westfall Act, and that would -- that gives the 
authority to reimburse the doctor, if the agency 
determines that -- that that's appropriate. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Feldman, is --

doctor, if what they really were trying to do was

 MR. FELDMAN:  That's right.  And the -- and 

the choice that Congress had -- had here, really, was 

1  thing, so I -- that provision ends -- and I am 
2  strengthening you -- your last point -- that provision 
3  ends, "if the circumstances are such as are likely to 
4  preclude the remedies of third persons against the 
United States described in Section 1346(b) of Title 28."

 That clearly envisions that, in the ordinary 
7  case, those remedies against the United States would not 
8  be precluded.

11  between taking intentional tort cases and allowing them 
12  to be continued to be brought against doctors and then 
13  subject to this kind of reimbursement provision, which 
14  they had provided for, or saying, no, we want these to 
just be brought against the government and to protect 
15
16  the Federal employees much more fully.  And so that was 
17  the purpose of 1089(e).

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So there is a lot of going 
12  back and forth about this question of what would happen 
13  if the government were immune, would the individual 
14  doctor be immune?  But that is, essentially, irrelevant 
15
16
17  irrelevant because what the -- the provisions that I 
18  have been talking about show is that Congress --
19  Congress was not trying, in this Act, unlike in the 
Westfall Act, which doesn't have either of these two 
20
21  provisions, the reimbursement and remand provision that 
22  I've talked about -- unlike in the Westfall Act, 
23  Congress wasn't trying to save money or other -- do 
24  something else by just eliminating remedies for victims. 
It was trying to -- as the Executive Branch

also helps clarify what 1080 -- or makes more clear what 

your narrower argument. 

1  said, as I said, to assure remedies for all tort victims 
2  and to protect doctors in a variety of different ways. 
3  And given that that's what they were trying to do in the 
4  Gonzalez Act, which is clear from the structure, that 
5
6  1089(e) means.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is that correct?

 MR. FELDMAN:  Yes.  That is correct.

 I would add that, with respect to the strict 
construction standard, I don't think it does apply in --
15
16  in this context.  The Court has never applied it in the 
17  Federal Tort Claims Act context.  In the Gonzalez Act,

starting in 1965, then 1976.  The Gonzalez Act was part 
15
16  of that chain.  All four statutes in this relevant 
17  subsection, the analogue, the Subsection (e) here, said,

language.  It eliminates that opening proviso for

goes something like this:  This provision is there to --
20
21  to prevent people from drawing a mistaken inference. 
22  And the inference would be that the doctors were liable 
23  because the government was not.  Now, there are a 
24  thousand ways to do that pretty clearly.

did was it enacted a kind of "let's pretend" provision,

7  then the inference won't arise.  Now, that has to be not 
8  just not the best way of achieving Congress's objective;

 Why would Congress have wanted to do that?

 Both sides agree that, without Subsection 

1
2  (e), covered medical personnel would have faced the risk 
3  of personal liability for medical battery claims.  Both 
4  sides also agree that Subsection (e) was enacted to 
obviate that risk and, in fact, successfully does so

the Gonzalez Act's conferral of immunity, as the text of 
the provision suggests; or, instead, whether it takes 
the substantial further step of actually amending the 
FTCA, which is a separate -- an entirely separate

United States.

5
6  1089, basically, and it says you can sue the government 
7  for the tort of an employee -- I'm oversimplifying, I'm 
8  oversimplifying so.  And we should interpret that narrowly, 
9  okay?  We should interpret that -- absolutely has to be 
10

 Now, what we have is an exception to that. 
12  And the exception is an exception for battery, but not 
13  battery.  Can't sue the United States for battery.  And 
14  we're supposed to interpret that, I guess, as broadly as 
15
16  could be broader, you get it, as long as it's plausible. 
17
18  after these two things, you can still sue the person who 
19  hit you over the head, you can go sue him in a State 
court, can't you?  Now, oh, now, we bring a new Act

MR. SHAH:  Well, the "for purposes of this 
section" language, I think, is the key phrase, and this 
section refers to the Gonzalez Act.  What the Gonzalez 
Act primarily does -- what Sections (a) through (c) are 
all about, are about conferring personal immunity.  So I 
think --

4

7
8  against the canon -- the sovereign immunity canon, I 
9  think we would expect Congress to speak more clearly. 
And Congress gave us two examples of how it spoke more 
10
11 
clearly in this very context. 
12
 One is, in 1974, the sole -- the only time 
13  it amended Section 2680(h), it amended it within the --
14  the provision itself; that is, it amended the language 
of 2680(h) to add a law enforcement proviso that said, 
15
16  "This exception applies except with respect to law 
17  enforcement in certain circumstances." 
18
19
20
21  you cut the exception to the exception to the exception, 
22  the presumption, da, da, da, out of it, what we've got 
23  on your interpretation is that a person who's hurt by a 
24  battery committed by a government official, given your

 That's one way --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  But why?  Why would

before the Gonzalez Act came along, there was a split in 
the circuits.  That's why the Gonzalez Act came along. 
There were -- there were circuits that did not allow a 
claim to proceed personally against the physician. 

1  previously, he could have at least sued in State court. 
 MR. SHAH:  Well --
2
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, what you're saying is 
3
4  Congress tried to do with this language is say, hey, you 
can't sue in State court; and, by the way, when you try 
5
6  to sue the Federal government, we are not going to give 
7  you your suit, either.  Why do that?

17  the government. 
18
19  you want to look at legislative history, what the Senate 
Report says is, in light of this D.C. Circuit decision 
20
21  that went the other way, Congress enacted the Gonzalez 
22  Act because it was primarily concerned about conferring 
23  personal immunity.

 That was one of the things that the

 But, even if all that were true, I think the

1  This was rather a central theory for your interpretation 
2  of the Act; maybe not the only theory, but a central 
3  theory. 
4
 MR. SHAH:  I -- again, I -- I disagree, 
fundamentally, with that characterization.  It's two 
5
6  sentences in our brief.  It's at the back end of the 
7  brief.  It was not fundamental to the position in Smith. 
8  The Court did not rely on it at all in Smith. 
9
10
11  is -- the first and foremost is the statements in the 
12  Court's decision in Smith itself, which, obviously, 
13  post-dated our brief --
14
inconsistent with the position argued.  There -- you are 
15
16  talking about the statement that the sole purpose was --
17  was to --
 MR. SHAH:  The two statements, the sole 
18
19  purpose of the Gonzalez Act is to confer immunity,

 MR. SHAH:  Well, Your Honor, I would 

That's subsidiary to the sole purpose of the 

1  is to assure immunity to these doctors.  Now, in

6  Act.  Sure, the sole purpose is to -- is to -- is to 
7  help these doctors.  But, in order to do it and be fair 
8  at the same time, you have to allow suit against the 
9  United States.  I think you could still say the sole 
10
11
12  disagree with that.  The other side's brief says, all 
13  along, the sole purpose of this Act was not just to 
14  confer personal immunity, but it had a dual purpose. 
The dual purpose was to confer personal 
15
immunity -- and this is, time and time again, in the 
16 
17 
other side's brief -- to -- to confer personal immunity 
and also to provide adequate remedies to tort 
18 
plaintiffs.  That was not, we submit, a purpose, let 
19 
alone a primary purpose, of the Gonzalez Act. 
20

22  Congress -- I mean, the Veterans Administration Act came 
23  after the four or five others, and Congress thought it 
24  was patterning that Act after the Gonzalez Act.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why would -- why would 

Why would Congress want to provide this 

48
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. SHAH:  Of course, Congress doesn't say. 

I think there are two potential reasons, Justice 

1  battery remedy if a Veterans Administration medical 
2  person messed up, but not if it was an armed service 
3  doctor? 
4
5
6  Ginsburg.  One might be the -- as -- as this Court has 
7  recognized, the special solicitude that Congress pays 
8  veterans, and it may have wanted to open up remedies to 
9  veterans that were unavailable to others. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18
19  Congress may have decided to -- to change course in the 
Veterans Act in 1988, after it had four provisions that 
20
21  said exactly the same thing, using the four purposes of 
22  this Act provision, it changed it, and it must have 
23  changed it for a reason. 
24
25

I think the second potential reason is the 
defense side reasons.  The defendants in Veterans Act 
cases are civilian Veterans Administration employees. 
In a Gonzalez Act case, by and large, the defendants are 
going to be active military personnel.  Congress is 
often hesitant to create -- expand judicial remedies 
against active military personnel because of the risk it 
poses to interfering with military function and order. 

 Two potential reasons are to change the 
result, which, of course, under which the government

intentional tort exception shall not apply. 

1  would win; or because it think -- it thought it needed 
2  to speak more clearly, in order to waive sovereign 
3  immunity.  And, under the presumption against sovereign 
4  immunity waivers, the government would also prevail. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Shah, your basic theory 
5
6  of the case, which is that, in order to make absolutely 
7  certain that everyone gets the benefit of the 
8  intentional tort exception, both the government and 
9  individual doctors, in order to make that absolutely

2  uses words like "assume that" or "consider that," as

4  on page 18.  However, other times, when it uses "for

"For purposes of this chapter, the term 'State' includes

 Now, there's no dispute that Congress was

is not enough.  And I think you can look at this Court's 
decision in Nordic Village. 

The statutory provision in that case made 
certain Bankruptcy Court determinations binding on the

of sovereign immunity, despite that very explicit 

 Here, the same is true.  Section 1089(e), 

undisputedly performs a function here.  It performs a 
function of securing the personal immunity conferred by 
Section 1089(a), that is, for purposes of the Gonzalez 
Act, the conferral of immunity under Section 1089(a). 
 Just -- just as in Nordic Village, that is 

1  assertion of sovereign immunity," sounds awfully like a 
2  waiver of sovereign immunity.  It seems pretty explicit.

2  position. 
 MR. SHAH:  Well, Your Honor, there are four 
3
4  courts that have decided -- conclusively spoken -- to my 
5
6  interpreted this provision, Section 1089(e).  All have 
7  come out in the government's favor.  There were two 
8  district court decisions before the Smith case.  Both 
9  came out in the government's favor.

14 
15
16 
17
18  It would be a substantial expansion of the narrow 
19  exception in Dolan to say that the unequivocal waiver 
requirement didn't apply.  There was no dispute that 
20
21  sovereign immunity applied the day before the Gonzalez 
22  Act was enacted. 
 So the only question is whether the Gonzalez 
23
24  Act enacts a new waiver of sovereign immunity.  That is 
25

two decisions in this case, conclusively interpreting 
1089(e), the district court and the court of appeals. 
Both courts in this case relied on the unequivocal 
waiver requirement.  And I think that that's -- it's not 
a stretch, at all, to apply the unequivocal waiver canon 
here. 

the type of situation in which the canon applies most

1  strongly. 
2
 And Congress did it in a separate statute. 
3  Again, in Dolan, we were interpreting provisions that 
4  everyone agreed were part and parcel of the FTCA that --
that altered the balance of sovereign immunity.  Here, 
5
6  the question is whether it even affects or amends the 
7  FTCA in the first place, whether it means to affect the 
8  sovereign immunity balance in the first place.

12  any sense to distinguish between a medical malpractice, 
13  negligence and this unconsented operation, to split 
14  those two and say the government is liable for 
15
16
17  lot of sense, and here's why:  When Congress enacted the 
18  intentional tort exception itself in 1946, one of the 
19  principal reasons it -- it did that was because 
20
21  but more difficult to disprove. 
 That is particularly true with respect to 
22
23  these sort of lack of consent claims, where you have a 
24  patient who has signed consent forms, agreed to a 
surgery, and says -- and the facts of this case, I 
25

intentional tort claims are sometimes easier to allege 

malpractice, but not for this unconsented action. 

 MR. SHAH:  Your Honor, I think it makes a

 Now, here, the government was successful in 

winning on summary judgment dismissal of the actual 

 The government won summary judgment on that

15
16  summary judgment, even though the deposition testimony, 
17  as pointed out in the government's brief, everyone else 
18  in the operating room, including the doctor, said that 
19  this patient did not so object, just shows that these 
20
21
22  why -- if your interpretation is correct, Subsection (e) 
23  did not read -- not for purposes of this section, but 
24  rather for purposes of Subsection (a), the provisions of

4  and (c) all work in tandem.  (D) is a settlement

7  section," "Subsection (a)" and "this section" are 
8  essentially the only operative provisions of the Act. 
9
 The only other provisions that do any work 
10
11  (e).  So, when Congress used the term "for purposes of

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I just wanted to make a

couple of quick points.  One is the Court has not

Court did not actually address 1089(e). 

 The reason the government, though -- this 

1  see that the Court is saying there, no, we want to 
2  interpret this Act to -- consistent with Congress's 
3  intent, the way it wanted it interpreted, which is with 
4  a fair reading of its words, not in one direction, not 
5
6
 I just also wanted to clarify, in the Smith 
7  case because, of a possible misunderstanding, the Court 
8  definitely addressed the Gonzales Act, repeatedly, in 
9  its opinion in the Smith case, but it didn't -- the 
10
11
12  was important to the government, and, actually, the 
13  government's reply brief in the Smith case was, I think, 
14  a hundred percent about the Gonzales Act -- was that the 
15
16  construe the Westfall Act the way the government wants, 
17  that will be an implied repeal, but the Gonzales Act 
18  will have nothing left to do. 
 And it was important for the government --
19
that's why they kept saying it.  It was important for 
20
21  the government to say, no, the Gonzales Act does have 
22  things to do, this is not an implied repeal.  And one of 
23  the things it does is exactly what we say Section 
24  1089(e) does.
