 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BEDRICK


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR. BEDRICK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


9  please the Court:


10

11

 I would like to address three points. 


 First, the correct prima facie standard under


12  Batson is whether there is sufficient evidence to permit a


13  reasonable judge to infer discrimination.  The California


14  threshold is too high and incorrectly conflates step one


15  and step three of Batson analysis. 


16

 QUESTION:  Well now, Mr. Bedrick, are -- are you


17  talking about enough evidence, say, to -- for a trial


18  judge to let a case go to a jury or enough evidence to


19  persuade a trial judge who's sitting as the finder of


20  fact?  I think those are two different things.


21

 MR. BEDRICK:  I would say the former rather than


22  the latter, Your Honor.  I'm suggesting sufficient


23  evidence to permit a reasonable trial judge to infer that


24  there was racial discrimination in jury selection.


25

 QUESTION:  So it -- it doesn't have to be proven


3


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  by a preponderance of the evidence. 


2

 MR. BEDRICK:  Absolutely not.  California uses a


3  standard of preponderance of the evidence and we believe


4  that is substantially higher than that which the -- the


5  standard which this Court suggested in Batson and in


6  Purkett v. Elem and in Hernandez v. New York.  This


7  standard is substantially higher than used by anywhere


8  else in the country.


9

 QUESTION:  What's the best analog that you have? 


10  Probable cause doesn't seem to fit.  Reasonable suspicion,


11  reasonable grounds for belief.  Are -- are there cases


12  which tell us what little semantic formulation you want to


13  use?


14

 MR. BEDRICK:  That's a good question.  In


15  discussion with associates, we thrashed that around. 


16  Probable cause is much too high.  Reasonable suspicion,


17  which is lower than probable cause, starts to get near it,


18  but I know the Court had a reasonable suspicion case last


19  week and I don't know all the intricacies of it.  My sense


20  is somewhat -­


21

 QUESTION:  Well, that's -- that's not the


22  standard for letting a case go to the jury, though.  It


23  seems to me that if that's what you're appealing to, what


24  the test ought to be is not whether the judge thinks it's


25  more likely than not, but whether a reasonable jury could


4


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  think that it's more likely than not.  Surely that's the


2  standard for letting a case go to the jury, not a


3  suspicion.  You know, if the judge thinks --


4

5

 MR. BEDRICK:  No.


 QUESTION:  -- he has to say a reasonable juror


6  could find that it is more likely than not that the


7  plaintiff's case is -- is sustainable.  Isn't that the


8  test for going to the jury?


9

 MR. BEDRICK:  When the test goes to the jury,


10  the plaintiff has the burden of proving his case by a


11  preponderance of the evidence. 


12

 QUESTION:  The jury has to find it by a


13  preponderance.


14

15

 MR. BEDRICK:  Yes.


 QUESTION:  But in order to let it go to the


16  jury, I had always thought that the criterion was not


17  whether the judge thought it was more likely than not but


18  whether in his view a reasonable jury could think it more


19  likely than not.


20

 MR. BEDRICK:  I think that is close to the test


21  that I'm asking for, Your Honor. 


22

23

24

 QUESTION:  Okay.


 QUESTION:  You had a model -­


 QUESTION:  Of course, that standard applies


25  after the -- after the case has been -- has been tried and


5


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  -- and both sides have had an opportunity be heard.  All 

2  -- all you're asking for is the opportunity to make 

3  inquiry. 

4

 MR. BEDRICK:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  All we're 

5  asking is that prosecutor be -- or the -- or the 

6  challenger, whoever that may be, be asked the reason.  So 

7  what we are ask -- our standard is somewhat closer to a 

8  discovery standard. 

9

 QUESTION:  You're asking more than that.  You're 

10  asking under our law that if the -- if the prosecutor 

11  doesn't come back with a reason, you win. 

12

13

14

 MR. BEDRICK:  Absolutely not, Your Honor. 

 QUESTION:  You're not? 

 MR. BEDRICK:  I respectfully disagree.  The 

15  series -­

16

 QUESTION:  The -- the prosecutor can stand 

17  silent and -- and -- and the -- the judge can still find 

18  against you. 

19

 MR. BEDRICK:  Very much so because the -- the 

20  series of cases from this Court, the Batson-Hernandez-

21  Elem trilogy, and -- and also the -- some of the Title VII 

22  cases provide that even though the burden of producing 

23  evidence shifts, the burden of persuasion never shifts. 

24  So -­

25

 QUESTION:  But the persuasion burden would be 

6


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  for the jury if you submit enough to make out a prima 

2  facie case.  The Title VII cases deal with a situation 

3  where you've made the prima facie showing.  You don't 

4  necessarily win if the defendant comes up with a 

5  nondiscriminatory reason.  But if the defendant just 

6  stands silent -- you've made your prima facie case. 

7  Defendant says nothing.  Don't you win at that point? 

8

 MR. BEDRICK:  No, Your Honor, I do not win 

9  either under Batson or under Title VII.  This Court 

10  decided a couple of cases, including Reeves and St. Mary's 

11  Honor Center in which the finding was a prima facie case 

12  was made, the employer gave a reason, the trial judge said 

13  I disbelieve that reason -­

14

 QUESTION:  Yes, of course, but suppose the 

15  employer gives no reason. 

16

17

 MR. BEDRICK:  I don't -­

 QUESTION:  Suppose that the prosecutor stands 

18  silent.  Those are all cases where the prosecutor does 

19  what you would expect.  The defendant does what you 

20  expect:  come up with a reason.  But if no reason is 

21  given -­

22

 MR. BEDRICK:  In the Batson context, Your Honor, 

23  we have never come across a case -- there may be one.  We 

24  have never come across one where the prosecutor stood 

25  silent.  The prosecutor always has a reason. 

7


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION:  Well, you -- you were asked to


2  consider what -- what does it mean, this prima facie case,


3  if the defendant does stand silent.  It may be implausible


4  that the prosecutor would or a defendant would in Title


5  VII.


6

 MR. BEDRICK:  Yes, but even so, even -- even in


7  this theoretical and I think inconceivable hypothetical


8  situation, if the challenger stood silent, the trial judge


9  still has to determine whether or not the objector has


10  proven discrimination at that point, at stage three, by a


11  preponderance of the evidence. 


12

 QUESTION:  I -- I suggest that the reason you've


13  never come across a case in which the prosecutor stands


14  silent is because the prosecutors know that if they stand


15  silent, they lose.


16

17

 MR. BEDRICK:  No.  The prosecutor -­


 QUESTION:  It's not at all inconceivable.  I


18  mean, that -- that's why they always come up with a reason


19  because, as I understand the way we formulated our -- our


20  Title VII test, you -- you have to come up with an excuse,


21  and if you don't have an excuse, the plaintiff wins.  I'm


22  -- I'm not sure I agree with that, but that's what our law


23  is.


24

 MR. BEDRICK:  The prosecutor knows that he will


25  look bad if he does not come up with a reason.  A


8


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  prosecutor knows that the trial judge could infer that


2  something is up or something has been done wrong if he


3  doesn't come up with a reason.  But our prosecutors are


4  bright and energetic and talkative and garrulous people. 


5  They always have a reason for everything. 


6

 So in this case -- and even there are many


7  cases.  In the many cases where the question of prima


8  facie case is being discussed and it looks like it's a


9  close case, in many of those, a careful prosecutor will


10  say, Your Honor, let's not hang this case up at the prima


11  facie level.  I would -- let's -- let me not leave a


12  record that is not clear.  I would like to tell you what


13  my reason is and here -­


14

 QUESTION:  May I ask you a hypothetical


15  question?  I hate to push you to the wall on it, but


16  supposing you had a prosecutor who conducted the voir dire


17  for the first day and then was hit by a truck and died and


18  wasn't able to continue the trial.  And he had made one


19  challenge of one African American juror, but he had let


20  six others on the jury.  What -- what would you do with


21  that case?  Would that be a prima facie case or not?


22

 MR. BEDRICK:  With one juror challenged, six


23  remain, from the defense perspective, I would say I have a


24  very lousy -- lousy chance of making a prima facie case,


25  and I would not make that argument.

1

 QUESTION:  What if there were one and otherwise 

2  it was an all-white jury? 

3

 MR. BEDRICK:  Then I guess we would hope to find 

4  some evidence of the prosecutor's reason.  Perhaps he 

5  had -­

6

 QUESTION:  I'm -- I'm positing a case in which 

7  for reasons beyond the control of the prosecutor, they 

8  can't tell what the real reason was of the man who 

9  conducted the voir dire. 

10

 MR. BEDRICK:  At that point I would suggest that 

11  the wise trial judge would find a prima facie case, avoid 

12  any possible RICKS discrimination and ask jury selection 

13  to begin anew.  At that point, the cost to the system is 1 

14  day of poor jurors parading through.  That's a much lower 

15  cost than the risk of this case going to the jury and 

16  being tried by a jury that has been chosen with racial 

17  discrimination. 

18

 QUESTION:  What if it comes up -- comes up on 

19  appeal?  I mean, it's happened.  In the case -- because 

20  the trial judge lets the case go forward. 

21

22

 MR. BEDRICK:  I -- I need some more facts. 

 QUESTION:  No.  The appellate court has to 

23  decide whether -- whether the conviction has to be thrown 

24  out -­

25

 MR. BEDRICK:  Yes.  The -­

1

 QUESTION:  -- on the basis of a -- a strike that 

2  the appellate court has no way of finding out the reason 

3  for. 

4

5

6  struck. 

 MR. BEDRICK:  If -­

 QUESTION:  The only prospective black juror was 

7

 MR. BEDRICK:  That is why we are arguing here 

8  for this -- for the threshold that we are arguing for, 

9  which is a relatively -- relatively low threshold at which 

10  the trial judge examines all the circumstances and, when 

11  in doubt, rules that there should be a prima facie case, 

12  and then we get an answer, and then the trial judge makes 

13  a decision based on an answer, and then we get a record. 

14

 QUESTION:  Why do you say when in doubt?  I 

15  mean, isn't it enough to say the trial judge has to -- can 

16  find that there's a prima facie case of discrimination, 

17  but why slant it one way or the other? 

18

 MR. BEDRICK:  Because in response to the last 

19  question, I was trying to show that one of the things that 

20  are missing when a -- when the questions are not asked of 

21  the challenger is a record.  We do not know what the 

22  answer would be, and that puts the appellate court in a 

23  much more difficult situation.  So that is what I was 

24  saying.  When we're -- when in doubt, one of the benefits 

25  that we obtain from an answer is a record so that it can 

11


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  be reviewed. 

2

 Furthermore, my guess is most of the 

3  prosecutor's answers will, in fact, show race-neutral 

4  reasons.  Then we have no problem.  Everyone knows what 

5  the situation is.  The answer has been revealed.  It does 

6  not become an appellate issue and everyone then has 

7  confidence that the jury has been fairly chosen. 

8

 QUESTION:  Tell me how it works.  You have some 

9  suspicion, because of the issues in the case and so forth 

10  after the first minority juror is excused, and say oh-oh, 

11  there may be something going on here.  At -- at what point 

12  under California procedure do you think you should make 

13  the objection?  At the earliest possible opportunity when 

14  they've excused the first minority juror or you wait until 

15  the whole jury is empaneled and ready to be sworn?  How 

16  does that work? 

17

 MR. BEDRICK:  I would say it depends on the 

18  discretion of the objecting party.  If there was only one 

19  minority juror and defense counsel thought that that was a 

20  good juror and therefore smelled possible discrimination, 

21  then defense counsel might make the challenge at the time 

22  of the first juror.  If -­

23

 QUESTION:  What happened here?  Was it after the 

24  second juror or after the first? 

25

 MR. BEDRICK:  The first motion here was made 

12


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  after the second African American juror and the second -­

2

3

 QUESTION:  And then renewed on the third. 

 MR. BEDRICK:  -- and the second motion was made 

4  after the third African American juror.  So defense 

5  counsel did not -- did not make his motion at the earliest 

6  possible opportunity.  He may have been giving his 

7  opponent the benefit of the doubt.  But after the opponent 

8  challenged two out of two, he no longer thought there 

9  should be a benefit of the doubt. 

10

 QUESTION:  And under your procedure, how long 

11  would this take?  You say, Your Honor, I want an inquiry 

12  into why this juror was excused and the -- I guess the 

13  judge excuses the -- the panel, or the prospective panel, 

14  and then says, Mr. Prosecutor, can you tell me why you 

15  excused the jury.  Is that the way it works? 

16

17

 MR. BEDRICK:  Yes.  In -- in this -­

 QUESTION:  Don't -- don't they just go up to the 

18  bench?  Do they have to excuse the whole jury panel? 

19

 MR. BEDRICK:  I've seen it done all different 

20  ways.  I've seen it done out in the back hall.  I've seen 

21  it done at the bench.  I've seen it done with the room 

22  cleared, and I've seen it done in front of the whole jury. 

23  They do it all different ways. 

24

25

 QUESTION:  What happened here? 

 MR. BEDRICK:  Here both motions were discussed 

13


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  outside of the presence of the jury, and that was, of


2  course -­


3

 QUESTION:  And the trial judge did what?  He


4  decided on his own that there were good reasons?


5

 MR. BEDRICK:  The trial judge in this case on


6  the first motion, decided that there was no prima facie


7  case because the trial judge speculated as to possible


8  reasons on the record that might theoretically and


9  arguably have provided a race-neutral reason.


10

 QUESTION:  And was the judge asked if the


11  prosecutor could be asked to explain?


12

 MR. BEDRICK:  The trial judge asked the


13  prosecutor, Mr. Prosecutor, I'm about to -- I'm in the -­


14  I'm about to rule that there's no prima facie case.  Do


15  you have anything you want to add?  Do you have any


16  reasons you want to state?  And the prosecutor said, no,


17  Your Honor, I don't want to -­


18

20

21

22

 QUESTION:  Well, why should he -­


 QUESTION:  Why should he? 


 QUESTION:  -- if he's already been told? 


 (Laughter.) 


 MR. BEDRICK:  That was clearly too late in the


23  process, but there are many other cases I mentioned


24  earlier where when a prima facie case seems relatively


25  close, the intelligent prosecutor will give a reason and

 QUESTION:  Counsel --

 QUESTION:  -- before you exhaust your time here, 

5  on appeal did you challenge also an evidentiary point, a 

6  Brady claim? 

7

10

 MR. BEDRICK:  There are other issues -­

 QUESTION:  There are other issues in the case. 

 MR. BEDRICK:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  The Brady claim, some evidentiary -­

11  and -- and a new trial was granted on some of those 

12  issues? 

13

 MR. BEDRICK:  No.  This -- this case has been 

14  tried three times.  In the -- the first case got three­

15  quarters of the way through.  There was a Brady problem. 

16  A mistrial was granted.  There was a second trial.  There 

17  was a conviction after the second trial.  In that second 

18  trial, there were instructional errors regarding 

19  concurrent causes.  There was a reversal on that.  This 

20  now is the appeal from the third trial. 

21

 QUESTION:  On the third trial, were there other 

22  issues? 

23

 MR. BEDRICK:  There are other issues that the 

24  court of appeal did not reach. 

25

 QUESTION:  That were not reached.

1

2

 MR. BEDRICK:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  But do we have a jurisdictional 

3  problem?  Do we have a final judgment? 

4

 MR. BEDRICK:  We certainly have a -- we 

5  certainly have a final judgment from a trial which is a 

6  conviction of the defendant.  We have a -- we have a 

7  decision from the intermediate court of appeal that says 

8  reversed.  We have a decision from the State supreme court 

9  that says reversed again.  So that we have lost our -- we 

10  have lost our Batson argument. 

11

 QUESTION:  Well, but it's sent back.  Wasn't it 

12  sent back to the court of appeals for further proceedings 

13  in this case? 

14

15

16

 MR. BEDRICK:  The -- yes. 

 QUESTION:  Well -­

 QUESTION:  And you may win on two -- on either 

17  of two issues that are left in the court of appeals. 

18

 MR. BEDRICK:  That is theoretically possible, 

19  but I think -­

20

 QUESTION:  But that's on three of those issues. 

21  Isn't it the case that the intermediate appellate court 

22  said there's something going for your side on those three? 

23  It's kind of hinted that you have a good case on the 

24  issues it didn't yet decide. 

25

 MR. BEDRICK:  Yes, that's correct, Your Honor, 

16


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  but I very much hope that the Court would reach the issues 

2  here.  We've put in a lot of time on that. 

3

 QUESTION:  But we have a firm finality rule.  So 

4  how can we if the judgment that you're bringing to us is 

5  non-final? 

6

7

8

9

10

11

 MR. BEDRICK:  I believe that -­

 QUESTION:  We've put in a lot of time on it too. 

 MR. BEDRICK:  I understand. 

 (Laughter.) 

 QUESTION:  I -- I -­

 MR. BEDRICK:  We have a -- California has -­

12  differs from every other court in the Nation on several of 

13  these jury selection points.  California has a standard 

14  that is much higher than virtually everyone else in the 

15  Nation. 

16

 QUESTION:  We understand that it's a good case 

17  to address the issue, but only if there's a final judgment 

18  so that we have jurisdiction.  Can you enlighten us any 

19  more on that jurisdiction point? 

20

 MR. BEDRICK:  This issue has not been raised by 

21  either side in this case. 

22

23

 QUESTION:  Well, it's raised now. 

 MR. BEDRICK:  I understand that, Your Honor.  So 

24  that it is my understanding that we have a final -- we 

25  have a final judgment from the trial court of convicting 

17

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  the defendant.  We have what is a final judgment from the 

2  intermediate court of appeal, which was a reversal.  That 

3  court did not need to reach the other issues.  It felt it 

4  did not need to bother to reach them. 

5

 QUESTION:  But now it does because it's been 

6  reversed and there's a remand.  And when it's remanded, it 

7  is certainly going to take up the issues that it left 

8  undecided.

 MR. BEDRICK:  If it needs to reach those, that's 

10  correct, Your Honor. 

11

 QUESTION:  Well, it's been instructed.  There -­

12  there are exceptions under our Cox case, and I've looked 

13  at them.  I don't think this comes under them.  We don't 

14  like to ambush you this way, but I mean, if there's a -­

15  there's a real jurisdictional problem here.

18  bono.

 (Laughter.) 

 QUESTION:  It seems like a dirty trick. 

 (Laughter.) 

 QUESTION:  No.  But may I ask on the finality 

23  question?  Is the decision of the California Supreme Court 

24  final with respect to the disposition of the Batson claim? 

25

 MR. BEDRICK:  It very much is, Your Honor.

1

 QUESTION:  There's nothing more to be decided


2  relevant to that issue.


3

4

 MR. BEDRICK:  Absolutely not.


 So that what I was hoping to argue to the Court


5  was we have a very distinct and sharp conflict between the


6  State of California and the Ninth Circuit and, indeed,


7  between the State of California and the rest of the


8  country on several of these issues.  What is the -­


9

 QUESTION:  May I ask you one question that is


10  relevant to that?  And that is, that California, as I


11  understand it, is taking the position each State is free


12  to implement Batson as it chooses, and California points


13  out that it has a standard that's more stringent than the


14  Federal standard on disqualifying a juror for race bias. 


15  The California standard is significant likelihood that the


16  juror is biased, where the Federal standard is a


17  reasonable possibility.  So California says if we can have


18  a more stringent standard on disqualifying a juror for


19  race bias, why can't we have a more stringent standard on


20  Batson.


21

 MR. BEDRICK:  Because California did not present


22  any federalism issues at the State supreme court nor does


23  my opponent.  California said we are deciding the Federal


24  constitutional issues.  We are deciding this case under


25  Batson.  We believe that our standard complies with


19


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Batson.


2

 QUESTION:  I thought part of that was that


3  Batson leaves room for the States.  It doesn't require


4  every State to -- to handle Batson challenges the same


5  way.  I think that is an argument that California made.


6

 MR. BEDRICK:  There are -- there -- there are


7  some -- I'm not sure what aspects were left to the States,


8  but California's Supreme Court did not -- the State makes


9  this argument, but the California Supreme Court did not. 


10  The California Supreme Court did not say anything


11  addressing any independent State ground.


12

 QUESTION:  More a question for the State than


13  for you.


14

 I -- I can't really think of an analog here. 


15  Our search and seizure jurisprudence, our arrest


16  jurisprudence, our Miranda jurisprudence is all uniform. 


17  Here, of course, State jury selection procedures vary, and


18  so there has to be some allowance for that.  On the other


19  hand, I'm not sure what the State is going to tell me so


20  far as a helpful analog for having a different -­


21  different rule.


22

 MR. BEDRICK:  The best standard we could come up


23  with, Your Honor, was something that was similar to the


24  standard on a Federal civil procedure 12(b)(6) motion.  On


25  a motion to dismiss, could a reasonable trial -- could a


20


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  reasonable trier of fact find for the plaintiff?  That was


2  -- that is the closest analog we have.


3

 QUESTION:  Yes, but what you're talking about is


4  a judgment at the close of the plaintiff's case, aren't


5  you?  You're not talking about a motion to dismiss a


6  complaint before trial.


7

 MR. BEDRICK:  That -- that's what 12(b)(6) would


8  be, Your Honor.  So the question is can the plaintiff get


9  out -- can the plaintiff get out of the batter's box.  So


10  that that is -- that is the type of language that -- that


11  we are seeing in the Federal courts interpreting the raise


12  in inference. 


13

 That's also what we are -- in Title VII context


14  we're actually seeing a lower threshold.  In Title VII, to


15  establish a prima facie case, the plaintiff needs to show


16  that he was part of -- of a protected group, that he was


17  qualified for a job, that he applied, that he was


18  rejected, and the employer is still looking.


19

 QUESTION:  But you -- you do have some


20  difference on a motion to dismiss because the rule is that


21  if any conceivable allegations could have been proved in


22  support of what the complaint says, it shouldn't be


23  dismissed.  But at the close of the plaintiff's evidence,


24  I think it's a little more stringent.  It's what -- what


25  does the plaintiff's evidence show, not what could it have


21


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  shown.


2

 MR. BEDRICK:  I -- I guess I'm persuaded that we


3  are somewhat higher than rule 12(b)(6).  I think we're


4  also somewhat lower than reasonable suspicion.  But I


5  think this standard comes up in many other kinds of


6  motions where ordinary civil procedure motions where a


7  plaintiff wants to proceed and for -- a motion for


8  challenged discovery, for example.  The plaintiff wants to


9  proceed and the defendant says we don't want our witness


10  brought in here.  He's an important person.  He's an


11  officer of an important corporation, and the judge -- show


12  me why we should take that person's deposition.  Now, you


13  don't have to prove anything beyond a preponderance.  You


14  need to show some reasonable facts that can be learned


15  from that person.  In this -­


16

 QUESTION:  But the typical discovery motion


17  isn't appealable, so there isn't much writing on the


18  subject of what sort of a standard should apply in that


19  sort of discovery.


20

 MR. BEDRICK:  But it -- it could turn out to be


21  appealable.  The chances of them showing prejudice are


22  limited, but it's the same kind of situation.  The


23  plaintiff here is trying to obtain some evidence, and here


24  it's actually the crucial evidence so that in my discovery


25  analogy, it wouldn't work for -- it wouldn't work for


22


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  garden-variety discovery, but if we had a major witness


2  and a major point, that issue might show up as a -- as the


3  -- as the issue on which an appeal turned.


4

 Here the information we're trying to find is -­


5  goes to the guts of the question of racial discrimination. 


6  It goes to the reason that the prosecutor -- the reason


7  for the prosecutor's challenge.  The trial judge has to


8  decide whether there is a race-neutral reason and whether


9  that was in fact the prosecutor's reason and whether that


10  reason was credible.  None of that can be determined


11  unless we know the prosecutor's reason.


12

 QUESTION:  What if -- what if the trial court at


13  the prima facie stage says it -- it seems perfectly


14  obvious to me -- and I think this is perhaps what the


15  judge here did -- that the reason the prosecutor did this


16  was thus and so.  And then the -- so he doesn't call on


17  the prosecutor, but nonetheless, it's very plausible what


18  he said.  Now, isn't that a form of harmless error?


19

 MR. BEDRICK:  I can't see anything remotely


20  obvious here, Your Honor, between the State judges and the


21  attorney -- State Attorney General's office has speculated


22  as to two reasons for challenges to Clodette Turner.  They


23  speculated as to five possible reasons for the challenges


24  to Sara Edwards, and they speculated on eight possible


25  reasons for the challenges to Ruby Lanere.

1

2

 QUESTION:  Well, what -- what --


 MR. BEDRICK:  If it was so obvious, they


3  wouldn't have 15 speculations. 


4

 QUESTION:  What if the prosecutor, after the


5  prima facie stage, says I did it for this reason?  All


6  parties -- the -- the defense isn't bound by that


7  statement, is it?  But I suppose the prosecutor is.


8

 MR. BEDRICK:  The prosecutor is, and then the


9  defense gets to argue, as one does in a Title VII case,


10  that there is something wrong with that answer which


11  therefore shows prejudice.  Perhaps the prosecutor has


12  said I challenge this juror because in voir dire, the


13  juror said he was -- I believe the juror was illiterate.


14  And it turns out the question was, Mr. Juror, how do you


15  get your news?  From the newspaper or television?  And the


16  juror said, I get it from television.  And the prosecutor


17  thought that showed illiteracy.  If that's the test for


18  literacy, then two-thirds of our population is illiterate.


19

 That's why we need to get the reasons.  The -­


20  the defense is not bound by it.  The defense is entitled


21  to show that the reason may be pretextual.  Sometimes it


22  will be.  Sometimes it will not.  But unless the -- the


23  whole guts of Title VII where the employer always gives a


24  reason is trying to show in one way or another from the


25  facts and circumstances and all the evidence that the


24


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  reason is pretextual.  And that should apply in -- in -­


2  under Batson in the same way.  But one cannot evaluate


3  from either position, from the defense position or the


4  prosecution position, whether the reason is pretextual


5  unless one hears the reason.


6

7

 And if -­


 QUESTION:  I suppose -- suppose one problem that


8  is more difficult in the Batson context -- we're talking


9  about a reason that would justify a peremptory challenge,


10  not a challenge for cause.  And I imagine that a good


11  judge and a good lawyer could come up with that kind of


12  reason for almost any potential juror.


13

 MR. BEDRICK:  We are -- most of the time the -­


14  the prosecutors are going to have race-neutral reasons. 


15  All -- all we're doing is asking for, to check for the


16  unusual circumstance when the reason is not race-neutral


17  or when the reason is pretextual.


18

 QUESTION:  I thought you didn't need a reason


19  for a peremptory challenge.  I thought that's the beauty


20  of -- of a peremptory challenge.

 QUESTION:  Is -- is that enough of a reason?


 MR. BEDRICK:  A peremptory challenge is valid


4  for any reason except an unconstitutional reason.


5

6

 QUESTION:  Right.


 MR. BEDRICK:  When this Court considered Batson,


7  the argument made by the State is we have a peremptory


8  challenge statute which is very important and you


9  shouldn't just brush it aside.  And this Court decided in


10  Batson, yes, peremptory challenge statutes are important,


11  but the Equal Protection Clause and the U.S. Constitution


12  are even more important, and as in the conflict between


13  those two, the Equal Protection Clause, which is


14  preventing racial discrimination, which is protecting the


15  rights of the individual jurors not to be discriminated,


16  which is protecting the right of the defendant not to be


17  tried by a jury chosen with discrimination, and which is


18  protecting the rights of the public not to have the


19  criminal system upset by discrimination, the -- this Court


20  in Batson decided that the Equal Protection Clause under


21  -- trumps the right for -­


22

 QUESTION:  So what I said wouldn't suffice.  You


23  say that wouldn't suffice as a reason.

 MR. BEDRICK:  I would say any -- I would say a


25  -- the -- I don't want to put you -- Your Honor in those

1  shoes, but a prosecutor -- we've never seen a prosecutor


2  not have a reason.  So if you -- so if you were the


3  prosecutor and you said, I have a hunch, the trial judge


4  would probably ask, counsel, please I need more than a


5  hunch.  Please give me the reason for your hunch.  And


6  your answer is I don't like jurors who have beards, I


7  don't like jurors who have long hair, I don't like postal


8  workers, some basis for the hunch.  Any prosecutor who is


9  not discriminating would have a basis for that hunch.

 If there are no questions, I'd like to save my


11  remaining time for rebuttal.

 QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Bedrick.


 Mr. Schalit, we'll hear from you.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH K. SCHALIT


 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


 MR. SCHALIT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


17  please the Court:


18

 The more likely than not standard identified by


19  the California Supreme Court gives content to the prima


20  facie case requirement and preserves the proper balance


21  between the anti-discrimination principles enshrined in


22  the Equal Protection Clause and the State's and parties'


23  interest in using peremptory challenges to select a


24  qualified and unbiased jury.


25

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  you have any observation on the apparent jurisdictional 

2  problem we have?  Can you give us a hand? 

3

 MR. SCHALIT:  I'll attempt to do so, Your Honor. 

4  The situation I think is akin to that under which multiple 

5  claims are raised and a court of appeal disposes of it 

6  based on one ground and does not discuss anything else. 

7  And that court is therefore -- thereafter reversed on 

8  appeal.  I think that is a final judgment.  The -- the 

9  defendant in this case has been deprived of his reversal 

10  and that is what -­

11

 QUESTION:  Even when it's been remanded, when 

12  the judgment is, you know, I decided on this ground and 

13  then I remand it for further proceedings in the case? 

14

 MR. SCHALIT:  I think so, Your Honor, in that 

15  the -- the legal issue is -- is still present as to the -­

16

 QUESTION:  That's not the test.  The test is 

17  whether the case is final. 

18

 MR. SCHALIT:  Regrettably, Your Honor, 

19  unfortunately I haven't had time -­

20

21

22

 QUESTION:  Yes, we sort of sprung it on you. 

 MR. SCHALIT:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  Okay.  I just thought you might have 

23  an answer. 

24

 MR. SCHALIT:  That's as best as I can do.  My 

25  apologies.

1

 QUESTION:  You have an issue that's finally 

2  decided in this case. 

3

4

 MR. SCHALIT:  Correct, Your Honor. 

 QUESTION:  And that will be law on the case. 

5  But you don't have a judgment, a final judgment in the 

6  case because now there are all those issues that the 

7  intermediate appellate court said it left open.  It gave 

8  some hints about what validity it thought they had, but -­

9  but there is -- there are a number of issues that are 

10  still to be opened.  So the judgment isn't final.  Only 

11  one issue in the case is. 

12

 MR. SCHALIT:  My apologies, Your Honor.  Beyond 

13  what I've already articulated in terms of that -­

14  deprivation of that reversal based on that issue is the 

15  extent of my knowledge, this issue not having been 

16  briefed. 

17

 QUESTION:  May I ask you this question about the 

18  California standard?  Is it -- did you just say the 

19  standard is the judge must decide that it's more likely 

20  than not that there was discrimination?  Or -- and I think 

21  it would be quite different to say -- the judge must 

22  decide that a reasonable juror could conclude that it's 

23  more likely than not that there was a -- discrimination. 

24

 MR. SCHALIT:  No, Your Honor.  It is not the 

25  latter test.

 QUESTION:  It's not the latter. 

 MR. SCHALIT:  No. 

 QUESTION:  And why shouldn't it be the latter? 

 MR. SCHALIT:  Because the judge is operating as

6  the prima facie case requirement, which is one that when 

7  the prima facie case is met, entitles the objecting party 

8  to prevail -­

 QUESTION:  In your -- in your ordinary civil 

10  trials, which view does the -- is -- what is the rule in 

11  California?  Would -- would it be the one I stated or the

13

 MR. SCHALIT:  That depends on the function of 

14  the prima facie case in term -- in -- in the context in 

15  which it's being used.  There are two terms -­

25

3

 MR. SCHALIT:  Correct, Your Honor. 

 QUESTION:  And why do you say there's a

5  the -- the distinction rests on the fact that the -- at 

6  the -- at the close of -- of whatever argument or point 

7  the -- the defense counsel makes, that he's entitled, in 

8  effect, to -- to win the point.  But that's not so. 

9

 MR. SCHALIT:  In the face of his opponent's 

10  silence, Your Honor -­

11

12

13

 QUESTION:  In the face of silence. 

 MR. SCHALIT:  Correct, Your Honor. 

 QUESTION:  That's a further -- I mean, a further 

14  fact in evidence.  I mean, if -- if somebody puts in a -­

15  a permissive case in a -- in a civil action and the 

16  defense puts in nothing, the -- the jury may or may not 

17  ultimately award for the -- for the plaintiff.  They may 

18  -- but in -- in this case, I take it the way it works, 

19  there is a -- a presumption that aids the objecting party 

20  and therefore the objecting party wins.  Is -- is that 

21  your understanding? 

22

23

24

 MR. SCHALIT:  Essentially, Your Honor. 

 QUESTION:  Yes. 

 MR. SCHALIT:  In the -- in the Batson context. 

25  It is not a presumption in the McDonnell sense of having 

31


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  proved certain predicate elements.


2

 QUESTION:  Okay.  But if the -- if, on the other


3  hand, the prosecutor does make a response, then there's no


4  presumption.  Then the -- the judge simply has to make a


5  determination.


6

 MR. SCHALIT:  Correct, Your Honor.  The judge


7  must evaluate the response and the -- and the rest of the


8  evidence in determining whether the objector has met his


9  ultimate burden of persuasion.


10

 QUESTION:  And -- and when he does that, he may


11  very well, in effect, say, yes, there's evidence here from


12  which I could infer discriminatory intent, but I don't


13  infer it.  I am not wholly convinced by it for whatever


14  reason.  And that's -- that's a possible resolution by the


15  court, isn't it?


16

 MR. SCHALIT:  In a stage three, Your Honor, of a


17  Batson proceeding?


18

19

20

 QUESTION:  Yes. 


 MR. SCHALIT:  Yes.


 QUESTION:  So at -- at the last stage, the trial


21  judge is acting as if he were -- it were a bench trial,


22  and it's up to him to decide whether there was or was not


23  a discriminatory purpose.


24

 MR. SCHALIT:  Correct, Your Honor.  Having now


25  heard the reasons, the trial court will evaluate the


32


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  credibility of the prosecutor.  As the plurality


2  recognized in Hernandez, frequently the credibility of the


3  striking party will be dispositive.


4

 QUESTION:  But -- but if no reasons are given,


5  it's your position that automatically it's determined that


6  there's a constitutional violation.


7

8

9

 MR. SCHALIT:  Correct, Your Honor.  That is -­


 QUESTION:  The other side says no.


 MR. SCHALIT:  Well, that ignores the disposition


10  in Batson itself in which the Court explained that on


11  remand it was up to the trial court to determine whether


12  there was a prima facie case, and if the prosecutor did


13  not come forward with his race-neutral reasons, the


14  judgment had to be reversed.  It is that -­


15

 QUESTION:  But isn't the -- the position that -­


16  that you are advocating, if I understand it correctly, is


17  that the court saves the prosecutor that burden by the


18  court, before turning to the prosecutor, to say what's


19  your nondiscriminatory reason.  The court itself first


20  thinks of can the court think of a good reason, and if the


21  court thinks of a good reason, it never asks the


22  prosecutor.  That's the -- that's -- as I understand your


23  case, you say that's how it works.


24

 MR. SCHALIT:  Not entirely, Your Honor, in that


25  it is not the court's obligation nor do California courts


33


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  seek out to save the striking party.  What they do do is


2  attempt to determine whether the objecting party has met


3  its burden of persuasion at that first step, and in


4  considering everything before it, it will make that


5  determination.  Now, there may be -­


6

 QUESTION:  Well, do you think -- suppose there


7  were 12 peremptory challenges and there were 12 African


8  American prospective jurors there and all of them were


9  stricken.  Is there enough case made if there's an


10  objection by the defense counsel?


11

 MR. SCHALIT:  Well, Justice O'Connor, certainly


12  numerosity is an important point or an important


13  consideration.


14

15

 QUESTION:  -- in my example.


 MR. SCHALIT:  Your -- Your Honor, your example


16  actually needs additional facts.  If, for example, one of


17  those African American prospective jurors said, I hate


18  cops and the second was wearing, you know, Crypts colors


19  in a case involving the Bloods, and the third was half


20  asleep and the fourth had some other obvious explanation,


21  then no.


22

 QUESTION:  Well, so, the trial judge can look


23  into that as a part of the prima facie case.  He can look


24  into what the jurors responded?


25

 MR. SCHALIT:  Yes, Your Honor, because of the -­


34


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  it is the trial judge's obligation under Batson to


2  evaluate all the facts and circumstances.  Batson itself


3  recognized that the prosecutor's questioning during voir


4  dire may support or refute -­


5

 QUESTION:  Suppose I'm the trial judge and I


6  consider, you know, there are reasons why the prosecutor


7  -- legitimate reasons why the prosecutor might have


8  exercised this challenge.  Do I go further?


9

 MR. SCHALIT:  I think it's up to the trial -­


10  trial judge to determine whether the objector has met his


11  burden of persuasion as more likely than not.  If I can


12  see a legitimate reason --


13

 QUESTION:  Well, I -- the -- the case is the one


14  I -- I gave you.  There's an objection.  And I say, you


15  know, there are reasons why this prosecutor might have


16  done this.  Do I quit at that point and say, well, you


17  haven't made out your case?  That's the way I understand


18  the California rule, incidentally.  If there -- if there


19  are reasons that might have allowed the prosecutor to give


20  the peremptory challenge, the prima facie case may not


21  have been made out.


22

 MR. SCHALIT:  And I think it's important, Your


23  Honor, to distinguish the rule as understood on appeal in


24  California from the rule in application in the trial


25  courts.  It is not can we hypothesize a potential reason


35


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  in -- from the trial judge's perspective that there's a


2  challenge here.  It is up to the trial judge to determine


3  from all of the evidence whether it is more likely than


4  not.  And maybe I have a reason but -­


5

 QUESTION:  But it's very odd that he would do


6  that without even asking the prosecutor to comment.


7

 MR. SCHALIT:  Not -- not particularly, Your


8  Honor.  If the prosecutor has -­


9

 QUESTION:  I mean, it's odd in the sense that


10  California is one of the only States that does it.


11

 MR. SCHALIT:  Well, Your Honor, if the


12  prosecutor three African American prospective jurors, all


13  of whom are defense attorneys and they're struck by the


14  prosecutor, there's nothing odd about not asking about


15  that.  They're all defense attorneys.


16

 If, however, maybe, you know, there was a little


17  something that one of the jurors did and I can sort of see


18  the reason for that, but they struck 12 of them and I sort


19  of see a reason, that's not enough most likely in the more


20  likely than not context.  And the prosecutor will be


21  required to state reasons. 


22

 Now, that is different than on appeal where, of


23  course, the judgment of the trial court is presumed


24  correct and the trial court is the entity that has seen


25  everything.  And if on the face of the record, there's


36


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  something that appears to be the reason, well, then that


2  must be used on appeal, just as in the other appeal to


3  support the judgment below.  But it is the trial court's


4  obligation to evaluate everything before it, and to


5  determine --


6

 QUESTION:  Well -- no, I didn't mean to -­


7  complete your -- the -- the problem I have with -- with, I


8  guess, that argument and -- and with the California


9  position is this.  I assume that under Batson when and if


10  the time comes for the prosecutor to make a response, we


11  want a -- a context in -- in which the prosecutor at least


12  has got a fair shake to -- to persuade the court.  And on


13  the California system, which you're defending, the judge


14  does not, in effect, ask the prosecutor for a response


15  until the judge, in effect, has already found against him


16  on the merits because on your view, the prosecutor has


17  said implicitly, by a preponderance of the evidence, they


18  have proven discrimination.  Anything you'd like to say


19  about that?  That's a very different thing from saying,


20  this side's case is in and I might find for them, but I -­


21  I haven't yet.  What do you have to say?  It -- it in


22  effect on -- on the California scheme forces the -- the


23  court to say I've already ruled against you based on the


24  merits unless you say something. 


25

 MR. SCHALIT:  Yes, Your Honor, and that is the


37


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  purpose of the -- of the prima facie case requirement.  It


2  is to allocate the introduction of the burden of proof and


3  it is to protect the constitutionality of the State


4  statute and the nature of the challenges as being


5  peremptory.


6

 QUESTION:  But it puts the prosecutor in a -- in


7  rather a difficult spot if -- if you get to that point.


8

9

 MR. SCHALIT:  Yes, and that -­


 QUESTION:  Because the prosecutor has already


10  been told you lose unless you've got a darned good reason.


11

 MR. SCHALIT:  Just as the employer is told that


12  essentially in a Title VII case when the evidence is


13  introduced on those four McDonnell Douglas factors and the


14  evidence is persuasive.


15

16

17

 QUESTION:  But -- but it seems to me -­


 QUESTION:  No. 


 QUESTION:  -- the opposite is also true for what


18  Justice Souter is saying.  The -- the judge says, you're


19  going to win unless you say something. 


20

21

22

 MR. SCHALIT:  Well, then there's -­


 QUESTION:  No. 


 QUESTION:  So I -- I -- in that instance, he


23  obviously says nothing. 


24

25

 MR. SCHALIT:  Correct, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  He doesn't say you're going to win. 


38


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  He's going to say there is enough to require you to


2  respond.  Whether -- whether you win or lose is up to me


3  after the response. 


4

 MR. SCHALIT:  In the -- in the Batson setting,


5  in the Title VII cases, in any case in which there is a


6  prima facie case found, going back to Kelly v. Peters with


7  Justice Story, there is such evidence that unless


8  rebutted, the party with the burden of persuasion will


9  prevail.


10

 QUESTION:  That is true if you've got a


11  presumption working.  It is not true if you simply have a


12  -- a standard that -- that allows for the permissive


13  inference.  If -- if nothing more than a permissive


14  inference is involved and the case -- and the defense puts


15  in no case, the plaintiff may or may not win.  The only


16  thing that makes the difference is -- is whether a


17  presumption operates to convert the permissive case into a


18  victory, and whether the presumption is going to operate


19  or not is a question of -- of policy.  It's not a question


20  of logical relationships. 


21

 MR. SCHALIT:  Certainly it does operate when


22  there is a presumption established by the court, as this


23  Court did in McDonnell Douglas.  It also operates when


24  there is a -- what Wigmore referred to as a strong mass of


25  evidence.  That concept cannot be alighted from the


39


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  definition of a prima facie case in that -­

2

 QUESTION:  May I ask you this question just to 

3  be sure I -- I have your position?  The other side says 

4  California is the only State in the Union that follows 

5  this strict a rule and the Federal courts all follow the 

6  -- the other rule.  Are they right on that, or do you 

7  think they're -- you have company in other parts of the 

8  country? 

9

 MR. SCHALIT:  We are -- there are -- there are 

10  other cases that announced the same standard.  Maryland 

11  announced it.  Connecticut announced it.  The court below 

12  recognized that.  There are a handful of cases on the 

13  other side that recognize inference.  The Ninth Circuit 

14  does. 

15

 QUESTION:  The legislature overturned it in 

16  Connecticut.  Isn't that so? 

17

 MR. SCHALIT:  My belief is that actually the 

18  Supreme Court of Connecticut under its supervisory 

19  authority established a sort of -­

20

 QUESTION:  Anyway, it's no -- Connecticut is not 

21  out of line anymore. 

22

 MR. SCHALIT:  Not -- yes.  They don't apply it, 

23  but they don't apply it based on their supervisory 

24  authority.  As an understanding of the meaning of Batson, 

25  it's still valid.  And because it's actually California, 

40


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Maryland, and Connecticut that have considered the meaning 

2  of Batson and the Title VII cases.  The other cases -- the 

3  Ninth Circuit just looked at the word and said inference. 

4  They isolated that word from the rest of the Batson 

5  opinion.  That's not the appropriate way to read an 

6  opinion.  It must be considered in context.  Batson 

7  expressly told the courts to look to the Title VII cases 

8  for an explanation of the operation of the prima facie 

9  case rules. 

10

 QUESTION:  But in Title VII there would be a 

11  presumption if the employer said nothing.  If the -- if 

12  the plaintiff shows the McDonnell Douglas factors and the 

13  employer doesn't come up with any reason at all, I thought 

14  at that point, plaintiff wins because there's a reasonable 

15  inference, plus presumption.  Plaintiff wins.  When 

16  defendant comes forward with a nondiscriminatory reason, 

17  then the presumption drops out of the case.  Plaintiff 

18  shoulders the burden of persuasion. 

19

 MR. SCHALIT:  Correct, Your Honor.  And that is 

20  one example of a prima facie case with a shifting burden 

21  of production that entitles the party to prevail in the 

22  face of silence. 

23

 The other example included in that same section 

24  of Wigmore is the strong mass of evidence, and he later 

25  explains that those things are different in operation and 

41


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  they differ -- but the same in effect.  And the effect is


2  the same.  The operation is different and the operation -­


3

 QUESTION:  But I thought that -- that this Title


4  VII, the idea of reasonable inference plus presumption -­


5  that that's supposed to be the formula for Batson as well.


6

 MR. SCHALIT:  Not presumption in the sense that


7  there are four elements of McDonnell Douglas that apply in


8  a Batson context.  There can't be those four elements. 


9  Every time there's a challenge in a Batson setting, the


10  four elements of McDonnell Douglas, for example, would


11  have been met.  The juror would have been a minority


12  qualified, excused, and replaced. 


13

 The -- the reference in Batson to the Title VII


14  is not to a presumption, but to the operation of the prima


15  facie case rules, and the operation of those rules are


16  such that you provide sufficient evidence to entitle you


17  to prevail in the face of silence.  And Wyoming ties that


18  together with being synonyms for the same mechanism.  They


19  are akin to presumptions. 


20

 QUESTION:  I thought he said that the


21  presumption operates in the run -- mine run of cases, it's


22  the presumption that the -- what you call the strong


23  evidence test -- that's Batson for special instances and


24  it isn't the dominant rule.


25

 MR. SCHALIT:  That -- Your Honor, Wigmore


42


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  recognized there are these two means in which you can


2  create the prima facie case.  One is the presumption.  And


3  that is helpful in a case in which there's a run of the


4  mill type facts and in the run of the cases, that fact


5  that is presumed, more likely than not, follows from the


6  predicate facts.  That cannot be applied in Batson. 


7

 What does apply in Batson, however, is the other


8  aspect of the prima facie case mechanism recognized by


9  Wigmore which is the strong mass of evidence concept. 


10  That has to be what is applied here in that the nature of


11  the jury selection -­


12

 QUESTION:  The -- the problem with -- with this


13  is, though, is that, say, in the employment discrimination


14  case, there's been discovery.  The events have happened


15  outside the hearings of the court.  There has been time to


16  look at it.  Here the alleged wrong is occurring right in


17  the courtroom in front of the judge.  And so all they're


18  saying is that the judge should, in an appropriate case,


19  say, hey, what's going on here, Mr. Prosecutor.  That's


20  all.  And -- and it seems to me that's a very, very


21  minimal intrusion on -- on the trial. 


22

 And the -- the State of California's rule seems


23  to presume that the defense counsel, if -- if he's the one


24  objecting, has the resources of discovery and -- and the


25  opportunity to -- to reflect and -- and to find other


43


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  evidence.  He doesn't.  The jury is being selected now.


2

 MR. SCHALIT:  Precisely, Your Honor, and that is


3  to his advantage.  As -- as U.S. v. Armstrong recognized,


4  the res gestae takes place in front of the court.  It


5  takes place in front of the parties therefore.  Everything


6  that that party needs is available to the party.  This is


7  not Swain where the objecting party would have to engage


8  in some sort of historical discovery and analysis. 


9  Everything the party needs is there, and the striking


10  party has -­


11

 QUESTION:  Everything the party needs except the


12  state of mind of the prosecutor, and the -­


13

 MR. SCHALIT:  Correct, Your Honor, to which he


14  is not entitled until he demonstrates entitlement to


15  relief and is able to overturn the statute and make it


16  unconstitutional as applied.  This Court has already


17  rejected -­


18

 QUESTION:  Of course, the irony of that is that


19  if -- if you had an ordinary civil lawsuit and the


20  plaintiff files a complaint on information and belief -- I


21  have good faith and belief such and such happened -- then


22  he takes a deposition and asks the defendant did it


23  happen.  But here you can't do that.  You got to know the


24  answer to what your information and belief is before you


25  file your complaint.


44


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 MR. SCHALIT:  That's -- that's the nature of


2  privilege of peremptory challenges, the nature of any


3  other privilege that protects information. 


4

 This Court has already rejected this sort of


5  inference standard in its voir dire cases.  It's -- it


6  requires that you inquire of jurors, if there's a


7  possibility of -- not if there's a possibility of


8  prejudice but if it's constitutionally significant. 


9

 QUESTION:  Is it appropriate in a case like this


10  to weigh, on the one hand, the importance of the interests


11  that are protected by the Batson rule and, the other hand,


12  the burden on the prosecutor by having to answer the


13  question?  Is that an important part of the analysis? 


14

 MR. SCHALIT:  No, Your Honor.  It's not a


15  question of the burden of the -- of the 10 seconds it


16  takes to state an answer.  It is a question of the burden


17  on the peremptory challenge system and the effect on the


18  voir dire process.  A low standard will create an


19  incentive to bring these motions more frequently.  That


20  requires excusing the jury every time.  That requires


21  taking a proceeding and getting an answer.  And that may,


22  in turn, require proceedings through rebuttal.  Well,


23  let's go through our dozen discharged jurors and piles of


24  questionnaires to do a determination of whether this is


25  pretext. 


45


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 Moreover, it is the nature of the peremptory


2  challenge system that is entitled to protection.  These


3  challenges are peremptory.  We don't want to discourage


4  challenges based on hunches which will be discouraged


5  under a lower standard.  This gives the trial courts a


6  clear guidance. 


7

 QUESTION:  Of course, there are those -- I


8  remember Justice Marshall used to take the position that


9  it would be better for the system as a whole if we


10  entirely abandoned peremptories because you -- you're


11  better off if you always know what the reason is.  At


12  least that's a permissible view.


13

 MR. SCHALIT:  Yes, that was his view, Your


14  Honor.  And the reason he had that view was because he did


15  not like the Batson rule which required a flagrant showing


16  of discrimination in order to rise to the level of a prima


17  facie case.  He understood that a prima facie case was one


18  that entitled the party to relief.  That was the -­


19

 QUESTION:  But they -- most -- most


20  jurisdictions -- most courts that considered this issue


21  have the reasonable inference and that gives rise to the


22  presumption.  California is in a minority.  Are you saying


23  that California is right and everyone else is wrong?  Or


24  that you're both right?


25

 MR. SCHALIT:  Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure


46


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  that the numbers are that stark, given that most cases -­


2

3

4

 QUESTION:  Whatever.  There is a divergence.


 MR. SCHALIT:  There's certainly a divergence.


 QUESTION:  Now, are you saying there is only one


5  right way and that's California's, or are you saying it's


6  up to the States?  They can have one rule or the other.


7

 MR. SCHALIT:  Your Honor, I think that certainly


8  the footnote in Batson in the final part of the discussion


9  recognizes the -- that it is left to the States to


10  determine procedures to govern Batson.  Now, on the other


11  hand --


12

 QUESTION:  Does that mean -- procedures to


13  govern -- that one State can have reasonable inference


14  gives rise to presumption and in another, as California,


15  can have strong likelihood?


16

 MR. SCHALIT:  Quite possibly, Your Honor, in


17  that we believe more likely than not is -- is the result


18  from Batson given the Title VII description.  On the other


19  hand, there is that -- that footnote and leaving to the


20  States. 


21

 And it is not unheard of, to return to Justice


22  Kennedy's earlier question, to have some variance.  And I


23  think one good example of that is incompetence and Medina


24  v. California, which recognized that California could use


25  the more likely than not standard and place that burden on


47


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  the party claiming he was incompetent.  Other States can


2  have a different burden.


3

 QUESTION:  Because you -- you said something


4  about one of the reasons you're resisting this is it may


5  -- it prolongs the trial and you have to clear the jury


6  and the -- in the -- the places that have reasonable


7  inference plus presumption, has there been this slowing


8  down, the clogging of the court?  Has -- has what you're


9  predicting played out in reality?


10

 MR. SCHALIT:  Your Honor, I'm not aware of


11  anyone having conducted a time in motion study of -- of


12  voir dire in the various States to find out how they're


13  proceeding.  Certainly the system does not have to


14  collapse in order to conclude that the more likely than


15  not standard, with its advantages and its compliance with


16  Title VII, with the holding in Batson, with the nature of


17  declaring the statute unconstitutional as applied, is


18  constitutionally prohibited.  It is a somewhat surprising


19  notion to suggest that using the lowest of the three basic


20  burdens of persuasion is constitutionally prohibited.


21

 QUESTION:  I -- I did -- the question I asked


22  you was just a purely practical one.  Has what you


23  predicted as the adverse consequences, if you loosen up


24  the -- what the plaintiff has to show -- what the


25  defendant has to show -- and my understanding is that -­


48


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  that it hasn't been a big problem in the Federal courts,


2  in States.


3

 MR. SCHALIT:  I think it's unknowable, Your


4  Honor, that the -- the extent to which the system is


5  burdened is not something that can be readily determined. 


6  You can infer that there is a burden imposed on it, one


7  that California can legitimately seek to avoid by using


8  the most common burden of persuasion.


9

 QUESTION:  Well, how does California handle a


10  challenge for cause?  Does it clear a courtroom every time


11  someone makes a challenge to cause?  Does it call counsel


12  up to the bench to give their reasons simply to the judge


13  on the record or some third way?  How does -- how does it


14  handle it? 


15

 MR. SCHALIT:  Frequently it's done at the -- at


16  the bench, Your Honor. 


17

 QUESTION:  Well, this -- couldn't the same thing


18  be done on -- on a Batson challenge? 


19

 MR. SCHALIT:  It's not typically done that way. 


20  The -- the -­


21

22

 QUESTION:  Well, why couldn't it be?


 MR. SCHALIT:  The -- the first step perhaps


23  could be, but at some point there's going to need to be


24  most likely further proceedings or to then go back and


25  determine whether those reasons are pretextual.  We'll


49


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  have to excuse the jury to go through the questionnaires


2  and -- and do a comparison. 


3

 And that wouldn't happen in a -- in a challenge


4  for cause.  The -- the challenge for cause is pretty much


5  over at that point because the judge knows it's just that


6  one juror and -- and can make that determination based on


7  that juror and -- and the information presented by the -­


8  the challenging party.  A Batson proceeding is much larger


9  than that.


10

 Your Honors, the -- the more likely than not


11  standard is an appropriate standard.  It is supported by


12  the effect on the statute declaring it unconstitutional as


13  applied.  It avoids using an inference standard that does


14  not provide guidance to the trial courts, a standard that


15  this Court has already rejected in the voir dire context. 


16  It maintains the proper balance between the anti­


17  discrimination goals of the Equal Protection Clause and


18  the peremptory challenge system what this Court -- which


19  this Court has repeatedly recognized plays an important


20  function in serving the selection of a fair and qualified


21  jury.


22

23

24

 The judgment should, therefore, be affirmed.


 Thank you.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BEDRICK


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR. BEDRICK:  Thank you, Your Honor. 


 In this case, the prosecutor preempted all three


6  African American jurors, leaving a black defendant to be


7  tried before an all-white jury in a case that had racial


8  issues.  If this Court -- this is a paradigm of a prima


9  facie case.  This is a much stronger prima facie case than


10  that which is required in virtually all of the Federal


11  courts. 


12

 If this Court does not reach this question


13  because it finds something that still is alive below, I


14  respectfully submit that this Court would be sending a


15  very poor message to the State courts and a very poor


16  message to the Federal courts, namely, that yes, it is


17  technically in error but it's not important enough for us


18  to decide.  I'd respectfully ask the Court to reach this


19  issue.


20

 In terms of what would happen if the States -­


21  at the State court, I don't think I -- I could never get


22  back to this Court or anywhere else.  Let us say I go back


23  to the State court of appeal.  The State court of appeal


24  rules against me on the evidentiary issues and says,


25  counsel, on the Batson issue we'd like to rule for you but

1  the State supreme court said no, so we can't do anything. 

2  Review at the State supreme court is discretionary.  I 

3  file a petition for review and the State supreme court 

4  says we decide that -- we already decided that.  We don't 

5  care.  Get out of here.  Review dismissed. 

6

 I then will be trying to come to this Court, 

7  having gotten no opinions from the court of appeal, having 

8  gotten a postcard denial from the State supreme court and 

9  I would not be able to get here.  I think that will be --

 QUESTION:  Yes, you would.  You'd have a -­

 QUESTION:  We'll be waiting. 

 (Laughter.) 

 QUESTION:  You'd have a decision from the 

14  highest Court in the State that has ruled on it, and you 

15  could -- you could come here.  You would have then -­

16  let's say you have a judgment affirming the conviction. 

17  You could come here from that. 

18

 MR. BEDRICK:  If -- if that was a guaranteed 

19  invitation, Your Honor, I would accept it. 

20

21

 (Laughter.) 

 MR. BEDRICK:  But odds on getting to this Court 

22  aren't quite so guaranteed as -­

23

 QUESTION:  We will -- we will already have done 

24  the work.  Your odds are better than most people. 

25

 (Laughter.)

 QUESTION:  So will you.


 MR. BEDRICK:  Yes.


 QUESTION:  Well, and importantly, we know what


4  the California Supreme Court's final word is on it


5  already.


6

 MR. BEDRICK:  We don't know.  Every time around,


7  they make up a new definition.  They had strong


8  likelihood.  They had not -- they had dispositive


9  inference.  They had conclusive presumption.  This time we


10  -- this time they made up more likely than not.  They may


11  make some other standard.  We don't know what they're


12  going to do, and it's a -- it's a moving target and it is


13  -- the target is moving in the direction of denying -­


14  denying consideration of these cases and the target is


15  moving in the direction of denying the opportunity to show


16  whether or not there's discrimination. 


17

 If the California court's standard of


18  preponderance of the evidence is allowed to apply, we


19  believe that will eviscerate Batson because that means you


20  cannot get in California what you would get -- at least


21  eviscerate Batson in California because that would mean


22  you cannot get in California what you could get anywhere


23  else in this country on these facts -­


24

 QUESTION:  But maybe they can get it from the


25  Ninth Circuit.

 MR. BEDRICK:  That is possibly true. 

 QUESTION:  It's definitely true.  Hasn't the 

3  Ninth Circuit disagreed with the California Supreme Court? 

4

 MR. BEDRICK:  Yes, and we have this continuing 

5  battle where counsel is required to spend and waste 

6  enormous amounts of time going back and forth and back and 

7  forth.  I mean, I guess this case could become my career. 

8  I'd sort of ask the Court --

9

10

 (Laughter.) 

 MR. BEDRICK:  -- to let me go on and -- I want 

11  to represent my client, but I'd ask the Court to let me go 

12  and do something else. 

13

14

 (Laughter.) 

 MR. BEDRICK:  In conclusion, I would ask to 

15  point out to the Court that obtaining the reason is the 

16  most important thing we're asking here.  It's very simple. 

17  Most of the time it will solve the problem.  We won't be 

18  bouncing back and forth between courts. 

19

 Discrimination cannot be shown unless the 

20  challenger's reasons are known.  I would ask this Court to 

21  decide this case in a way that challenger's reasons become 

22  known. 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. 

24  Bedrick. 

25

 The case is submitted.
