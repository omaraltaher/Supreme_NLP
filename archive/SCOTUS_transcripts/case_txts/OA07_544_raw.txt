 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

next in Case 07-544, Hedgpeth versus Pulido.

 Mr. Friedlander.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMY FRIEDLANDER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Respondent has agreed with us that the ninth 

circuit was wrong when it said that the error here and 
the one in Stromberg were structural defects.

 The remaining question is whether Respondent 

can salvage the Stromberg rule by making it part of a 
proper harmless error test as he attempted to do.

 His harmless error test is wrong for several 

reasons, but the Stromberg part of it was wrong for 
basically one reason.  He makes the Stromberg rule into 
a rule of harmless error, and it is not even a correct 
rule of error.

 This Court has defined "instructional error" 

to require not merely a mistake in instruction, but a 
reasonable likelihood that the jury misapplied the law. 
So when Respondent says, invoking Stromberg, that to 
instruct the jury on valid and invalid theories is

harmless error if the jury adopted a valid theory, what 
Respondent is saying is nothing more than that no error 
occurred in the first place.  Because the jury found 
everything it needed to find in order to convict and, 
therefore, did not misapply the law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do that again, will you?
 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  We need to have a 

reasonable likelihood that the jury misapplied the law. 
That's how we get to error.  Respondent invokes 
Stromberg to say if the jury is instructed a right way 
and a wrong way and they went the right way, we have 
harmless error.

 No.  What we really have is no error at all. 

Because there is the -- the jury did not misapply the 
law.  Moreover, Stromberg is not even a correct rule of 
error.  Because under Stromberg you have error if the 
jury could have misapplied the law. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Can I interrupt you?  You 

are saying no error occurred, and on page 11 of your 
brief you say, "An unconstitutional instructional error 
occurred in this case because there was a reasonable 
likelihood the jury found," and so forth and so on.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  Yes.  I agree that error 

occurred in this case.  What I'm trying to argue here is 
that Respondent is entirely off base in importing the

Stromberg rule into a harmless error determination. 
Stromberg is, at most, a rule of error.  The jury went 
the wrong way.  That is a rule of error, but it is not 
even a correct rule of error because under Stromberg you 
say, could the jury have gone the wrong way; whereas, 
under this Court's modern precedent you have to have a 
reasonable likelihood that the jury --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But you said that's what 

happened here.  That's what your brief says.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  Yes.  I agree that there 

was an error here but not because of Stromberg.  Because 
this was a reasonable likelihood that the jury 
misapplied the law.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But you should have said 
"no" to the question, I think.  Because I thought the 
question -- whatever it was, you are saying that there 
isn't a reasonable likelihood that its error influenced 
the outcome.  You are not saying that?

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  There is a reasonable 

likelihood that the jury misapplied the law.  That's the 
error question.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  Then the harmless error 

question is:  Given that they misapplied the law, do we 
know under the requisite degree of certainty -- Chapman

on direct review, Brecht here -- that they would still 
have found him guilty of felony murder under a proper 
instruction?

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do you agree that the 

California Supreme Court gave an incorrect explanation 
to the answer to that question?  They said there was no 
harmless error because the -- the jury made a specific 
finding that rebutted that, and that finding depended on 
the difference between the word "and" and "or."

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  I'm not sure I followed 
the last part of the question, but I agree with you if 
what you are saying is that the California Supreme 
Court, in effect, applied a Stromberg-like test.  They 
said "necessarily resolved."

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  No.  I'm -- I'm 

questioning the basis for the Supreme Court's conclusion 
that the error was harmless.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  Their basis for the 
conclusion was the jury's "special circumstance" 
finding.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right.
 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  Now, they did not 

consider, when they made that "special" -- when they 
interpreted that "special circumstance," the "and/or" 
mistake that was embedded in the instructions.

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Which meant that the jury 
really hadn't answered the question they thought it had 
answered.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  No, it didn't mean that. 

We don't agree with that.  We don't believe that that is 
a correct interpretation of the instruction.

 But let me skip past that if you'll allow 

me.  Even if you -- even if you accent any meaning from 
that "special circumstance" finding -- and we don't 
agree with that but even if you did -- you had at a 
minimum here the nature --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  If you do that, you are 
removing the basis for the California Supreme Court's 
decision.

decision, yes, I think that's right.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  All right.
 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  Okay.  But it doesn't 
matter because we are going to apply Brecht anyway.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Could you clarify the -- the 

category of cases that would be affected if your 
argument is accepted?  There would be -- an error would 
be -- would not be harmless under Brecht if it had a 
substantial or -- or injurious effect, right?

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  True.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, what is the standard 

under California law for submitting a theory of 
liability to the jury?  Presumably, you have to have 
some evidence in support of it.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  I'm not sure I understand 

the question.  I think that goes to the question of 
whether there is error in the first place in submitting 
a factually unsupported theory.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you are -- you are 

arguing that there are instances in which, when a theory 
of liability is submitted to the jury, the error -- and 
it's erroneous -- the error can be harmless.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  Yes.

submitting the theory of liability to the jury in the 
first place?  You have to have -- presumably, there has 
to be some evidence in support of that, right?  How 
much?

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  I don't think -- I don't 

think I know the answer to that question.  It would 
certainly be error under California State law if there 
is a reasonable -- if they have the same reasonable 
likelihood standard that the Federal courts have, if 
there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury 
misapplied the law.

 Now, in a -- but you seem to be focusing on 
an evidentiary sufficiency, and I think that's governed 
by Griffith where if you -- if you have an insufficient 
-- if you have insufficient evidence to support the 
theory, then it's inappropriate --

JUSTICE ALITO:  What I'm asking is:  When is 
there going to be a case in which a theory of liability 
is submitted to the jury and it's -- and it's erroneous 
-- multiple theories are submitted; one erroneous.  And 
yet it would turn out that the submission of the 
erroneous theory did not have a substantial or injurious 
effect.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  This one -- this case --
this case was submitted to the jury on two alternative

theories:  One of them correct, pre- killing aiding and 
abetting; one of them incorrect, post-killing aiding and 
abetting.  And it didn't have a substantial injurious 
effect because we know that at an absolute minimum here 
the jury found that the defendant acted -- aided and 
abetted robbery with reckless indifference to human life 
and was a major participant in the robbery.  And those 
findings were not compatible with post-killing aiding 
and abetting.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought there was --

that there was this -- there were three possibilities, 
and one was that the defendant didn't do anything 
before, didn't do anything during, but was simply an 
accessory after the fact.

 If the jury believed that, then there was no 

way it could convict him of the crime that he was 
convicted of.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  Well, the jury rejected 

accessory after the fact but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do we know that?  Was 

there a special verdict?

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  They were instructed on 

accessory after the fact as the lesser offense and they 
found in essence robbery and felony murder.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  They found the greater

offense, so there would have been no need for them to go 
to the lesser included offense.  Your trouble is -- and 
I think the problem that we are having is that in 
finding the greater offense, they may have done so under 
a theory of accomplice liability that was consistent 
with the accomplice simply coming in at a late stage in 
the proceedings.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  Yes.  That's right.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I mean, that's the 

difficulty we are having.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  Yes.  There is a 

reasonable likelihood that in deciding felony murder 
they failed to decide that he engaged in the robbery 
before the killing.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Right.
 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  However, they went and 

found the special circumstance in which they found 
reckless, aiding and abetting with reckless indifference 
to human life and as a major participant.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I thought the, the 

difficulty with using that as a means of answering the 
first error was that the way the special circumstance 
instruction was phrased, they could have found the 
special circumstance without finding anything more than 
that he came in at a late stage.

MR. FRIEDLANDER:  No.  That's not correct. 

I don't believe that's correct.  It is true that part of 
the instruction, that and/or difficulty, focused on a 
different question, a different point, said that if you 
-- if they -- I'm blanking out but --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  The second -- go ahead.
 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  It didn't address the 

reckless indifference to human life and the major 
participant, but that was embedded in the instructions, 
and from the start the courts that have looked at this 
and have reached this question have all agreed that 
there was a jury finding of reckless indifference to 
human life and major participant, and they have 
disagreed as to what it might have meant.  Okay?  Now, 
the U.S. district court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do we -- in this --
how do we know what the jury found?  They just came in 
with a guilty verdict; is that right?

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  No.  They came in with a 
special circumstance finding.  The special circumstance 
finding that this was --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Isn't the special 

circumstance finding the one that had the word "or" in 
it, and therefore allowed the jury to give a post-
killing interpretation of the event.

MR. FRIEDLANDER:  No.  The special --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  I thought that was what 

the California Supreme Court relied on?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I agree with Justice 

Stevens.  I thought that was the whole problem, the "or" 
and the "and" is the problem for you.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  The -- I'll read from JA 
14.  This is the special circumstance instruction that 
was -- was mistaken:  "The murder was committed while 
the defendant was engaged in the commission or attempted 
commission of a robbery, or the murder was committed in 
order to carry out or advance the commission of the 
crime of robbery, et cetera."

 Now, that -- that finding alone we agree if 
you -- if you -- if you just follow that finding, that 
doesn't implicate the defendant.  But you have to read 
at JA 13, the instruction, JA 13:  "The defendant with 
reckless indifference to human life and as a major 
participant aided and abetted in the commission of a 
robbery which resulted in the death of Flores."  That's 
at JA 13.

 So there were multiple findings here.  And 

-- and the district court which -- this is at the bottom 
of the first paragraph of JA 13.

not getting it.  Help me out here.  One possibility 
under -- under the instruction at JA 13 is "or assisted 
in the crime of robbery."  And the other instructions 
because they are erroneous leave open the possibility of 
finding that he assisted in the crime of robbery only if 
he came in late.  And that's why it does not solve the 
original error.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  No.  The -- the problem 

with the, I think you're mixing up two things here.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I may be doing that.
 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  The felony murder 
instructions did not speak to this question of 
contemporaneity.  They left it open.  That was error. 
We acknowledge that that was error.  Okay?  So they 
arguably find felony murder, aiding and abetting felony 
murder based on post- killing aiding and abetting.  Now, 
the jury has to get to the special circumstance finding, 
right?

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.
 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  And now it has to decide, 

among other things, as I -- as I read to you, "did he 
aid and abet robbery with reckless indifference to human 
life and as a major participant in the commission of a 
robbery which resulted in the death of Flores?"  That's 
at JA 13.  So what we --

error.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Then that doesn't cure the 

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  Yes, it does, and the 

reason that it does is because the harmless error test 
is not whether the jury actually made the finding that 
it needed to make; rather, the harmless error test is do 
we know from the evidence and from the findings that the 
jury would have made the findings that it was required 
to make had it been properly instructed?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It seems to me that 
you're arguing one of two things:  First, that there was 
no error at all under Stromberg; or second, that if 
there was error, it was harmless error.  And I thought 
the case was about whether or not the Ninth Circuit 
erred in concluding that harmless error analysis didn't 
apply to a Stromberg error.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  Yes.  I'm not arguing the 

first point.  I -- I concede there was error.  I just 
wanted to make the point that Stromberg itself is an 
incorrect rule of error.  But I can see that that's led 
us down a path that I didn't need to go down.

Now, we are certainly arguing harmless 

error.  As for the Ninth Circuit's opinion, we said --
the Ninth Circuit said this is structural error.  We 
don't even start a harmless error analysis.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The district court didn't 

say that.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  No, it did not.  And --
and we said that's wrong.  This is trial error, not 
structural error.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So if we were to say, 
Ninth Circuit, you were wrong, but the district court 
was right --

MR. FRIEDLANDER:  Well, the district court 

was right to the extent that it found it to be trial 
error.  It was wrong to the extent that it found it to 
be prejudicial trial error.  But Respondent has agreed 
with us that this is not structural error, that we need 
to do a harmless error analysis, and what Respondent has 
done is import into this harmless error analysis we are 
saying the Stromberg rule; and it doesn't belong there.
 The Stromberg rule is not a proper rule of 

harmless error.  It's at most a rule of error.  I'd 
like --

should have been harmless error.  Did it perform the 
proper --

MR. FRIEDLANDER:  It's incorrect in the way 

that you're thinking it is incorrect, but it was also 
incorrect in another way.  It was incorrect in a way 
that it applied too strict a standard.  It said has this 
question been necessarily been resolved; and it said 
yes, it has been necessarily resolved.  Well, that's not 
the question.  The harmless error question --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  The -- answer was 
incorrect, too, wasn't it?  And that answer was 
incorrect?

 MR. FRIEDLANDER:  That answer was incorrect; 

and as well as what you're thinking, it was incorrect, 
in that they premised it on a factual basis that was not 
in fact the case.  But I better reserve time for 
rebuttal.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 MR. SHAH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I think the Chief Justice framed the main 
issue in this case properly.  Consistent with the last 
two decades of this Court's instructional error 
jurisprudence, the Court should hold that the type of 
error at issue is not structural and is subject to 
harmless error review.

 The Ninth Circuit's contrary interpretation 
of Stromberg creates the untenable result that adding an 
invalid theory -- adding a valid theory to an invalid 
one somehow makes the error worse.  Even Respondent now 
rejects that interpretation.  It follows that this Court 
should reverse the Ninth Circuit and remand for 
application of harmless error review under Brecht.

 The main issue --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's what the district 

judge did, right?

 MR. SHAH:  Yes, Your Honor.  The district 

court did apply harmless error review under Brecht.  The 
court of appeals, of course, did not.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It could just review the 

18

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

district court's decision using the standards that the 
district court used?

 MR. SHAH:  This Court could do that, but the 

longstanding and customary practice of this Court is 
that when the court of appeals does not address the 
harmless error question, that it remands to that court. 
It did that in Rose V. Clark, in Pope V. Illinois and 
California V. Roy, and more recently in Recuenco.

 And in several of those cases the 

intermediate court or the district court, in the habeas 
context, did address it and the court of appeals didn't 
in all of those cases that the Court did remand for 
application of harmless error.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I wasn't questioning 
that.  The issue, is the United States position say 
structural error was wrong, harmless error was right, 
and then just have the Ninth Circuit review the district 
court's decision that held that there was harmless error 
the way it would ordinarily review a district court 
decision?

 MR. SHAH:  Yes, Your Honor, but I would add 

that this Court should also clarify the scope of that 
harmless error inquiry.  I think there are two important 
principles.  There is no logical reason to apply a 
narrower form of harmless error review in this case than

the Court did in Neder.

 So I think that this Court should clarify 

that the principles of harmlessness articulated in Neder 
should apply on remand to the Ninth Circuit.  I think 
those of those principles bear mention.

 First, the question is not what the jury 

actually or necessarily found, but rather, it 
encompasses what a rationale jury would have found 
absent the error.

 And I think the second important point for 

this Court to clarify is that harmlessness review is not 
limited to cases, is not limited to cases where the 
relevant elements are undisputed, but rather even when 
disputed, a reviewing court should consider the entire 
record and determine whether, in light of the jury 
finding, there is sufficient evidence to support a 
contrary verdict.  And then it should remand, Your 
Honor, to the court of appeals to apply those 
principles.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why do you say in light of 
the jury finding when you have disavowed any necessity 
that the jury had found this?

 MR. SHAH:  Well, Your Honor, we do --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean "in light of the 

jury finding," why don't you just drop that.

MR. SHAH:  Well, Your Honor, we think it's 
important because there are certain jury findings that 
we know the jury made in this case.  The jury returned a 
special circumstance verdict.  And we know based upon 
that verdict that at a minimum, the jury found that 
Respondent was a major participant in the crime -- just 
taking the facts of this case, the Respondent was a 
major participant in the robbery, that he exhibited a 
reckless disregard for human life.

 And we also know that the jury rejected a 

duress defense.  The jury was instructed on that 
defense, and yet the jury came back guilty.

 So I don't think that the -- that the 

inquiry should take place in a vacuum, but, of course, 
the reviewing court should have the benefit of the 
limited jury findings that we do know were made, and 
then apply the sufficiency inquiry in light of those 
jury findings.  There is no reason to disregard the jury 
findings that were made.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Suppose it's not, in 

the abstract anyway, necessarily true that this case 
follows a fortiori, because here, at least you have a 
valid theory.  That may make it a harder case, because 
the jury had based its entire verdict on an invalid 
theory.

It may be more difficult than a situation 
where you've got a theory of the case that is invalid 
because a particular element is missing.  And you can 
look and see whether or not that was harmless or not.

 MR. SHAH:  I would disagree, Mr. Chief 

Justice.  I think there are two possibilities in a case 
with alternative theories.  One possibility is that the 
jury relies upon the defective instruction.  For 
example, there is one element omitted just like the 
instruction in Neder.  If that's what the jury had done, 
then this case is no different than Neder, no better, no 
worse, right.

 The other possibility, however, is that the 
jury relies on the completely valid theory.  If the jury 
relied on the completely valid theory, then there is 
even less of a problem than Neder.  There is no problem 
at all.

 So I don't see how the error in this 

alternative valid theory and defense theory circumstance 
could be any --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  The difference is when you 

only got one theory, you know what he relied on.  When 
you got alternatives, how do you know which one he 
relied on?

 MR. SHAH:  Well, you don't -- you don't,

Your Honor.  And that's what the reviewing court has to 
decide.  But in either scenario, if it -- if you assume 
that the jury relied on the defective theory, then we 
are in the same box as in Neder, and the reviewing court 
would decide whether there was -- you know, they would 
apply the harmless error review to the missing element 
and decide whether there was sufficient evidence to 
render that error harmless; or the court could ask, 
well, is that uncontraverted or overwhelming evidence 
that the defendant would have been found guilty under 
the valid theory.

 And that would also be a permissible 

inquiry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I guess, 

though, the point is when you have invalid and valid 
theories, it would be a little harder than Neder, 
because they don't have to make any findings under the 
valid theory.  You know, because you don't just have to 
fill in a missing piece of the puzzle, as in Neder.  You 
have to -- they might have been working on an entirely 
different puzzle.

 MR. SHAH:  Well, Your Honor, in almost all 

conceivable cases there is going to be at least some 
overlap between -- between the two theories.  And what 
the -- the reason why that's relevant is because you

know that when the jury has returned a general verdict 
of guilt, they have necessarily found beyond a 
reasonable doubt that each of those elements has been 
satisfied.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  No.  But in this case the 
question is whether the uncle did it or the nephew did 
it.  And if there is a lot of doubt about -- about -- if 
there is substantial reason to believe maybe it was the 
uncle, they might have taken the easy case out.  I think 
this is vastly different from a single theory case.

 MR. SHAH:  Well, Your honor, here's why --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Because it's an -- there 

is plenty of evidence that he might have been guilty 
after the fact.  There is no doubt about that.  But 
there is doubt about the former.

 MR. SHAH:  Your Honor, here's why I think 

the cases aren't that different, because, you know, at a 
minimum from the general verdict of guilt if you take a 
case like this, you know that the jury found that there 
was an unlawful killing.  You know that the jury found 
that there was a robbery.  You know that the jury found 
that Respondent was involved in the robbery.  The only 
element that we don't know --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Perhaps after -- after the 

death occurred.  That's all we really know.

MR. SHAH:  It is possible that the jury 

would have found that, and that's the question that the 
reviewing court would perform in harmless error review, 
just like if there -- basically that is the exact same 
question the Court would form, would do under Neder if 
the timing element were omitted all together.  The 
reviewing court would look at the evidence and decide is 
there sufficient evidence to support an after-the-fact 
participation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So what we are 

talking about, in other words, is the application of 
harmless error, which may or may not be harder in the 
multiple theory case, and not the question of whether 
harmless error analysis should be applied.

 MR. SHAH:  Yes, Your Honor.  That's going to 
be completely fact dependent whether it's harder or not. 
But I think analytically it's exactly the same as in 
Neder.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Aren't there going to be 
cases in which there's enough evidence to support the 
submission of a theory of liability to the jury, but so 
little that the court is going to be able to say that 
it's harmless under -- that the submission of the 
invalid theory was harmless under Brecht?

 MR. SHAH:  Yes.  I mean, you can image in a

case -- take Neder.  By this Neder instruction, the one 
omitting the materiality element, was submitted to the 
jury certainly enough evidence to support it, and then 
there was another valid theory --

JUSTICE ALITO:  There is difference.  An 

element of the defense has to be submitted to the jury. 
And it may be that that it's -- the element is 
undisputed, but a theory of liability isn't going to be 
submitted to the jury unless there is some evidence to 
support it.

 MR. SHAH:  Well, Your Honor, if -- if there 
is some evidence to support it, if we were in a direct 
review context, that's the inquiry that Neder says.  So 
on a clean slate it might be that if there is sufficient 
evidence to support a contrary verdict, that that would 
end the inquiry.

 But in many of these cases we are going to 
know that the jury has made at least some findings, has 
found some of the elements.  And that might inform the 
harmless error inquiry, just like in this as we know 
that the jury has found things like a respondent was a 
major participant, exhibited a reckless disregard for 
human life, discounted a significant portion of this --
of his statement by rejecting the duress defense.

 If there are no further questions, Your

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. BRADLEY O'CONNELL

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. O'CONNELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Unlike the Sarausad case argued earlier this 
morning, this is a case of conceded constitutional error 
under the reasonable likelihood standard, the same 
question that consumed so much of the Sarausad argument.

 We acknowledge that this is a trial error 

and is subject to the Brecht prejudice standard.  And as 
I believe Justice Souter commented during the Sarausad 
argument, in a Brecht situation, the defendant wins the 
benefit of the doubt.  That is a lesson of this Court's 
decision.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I agree with that.  And my 

question is going to be -- at some point, both of you 
seem to agree with that so -- pretty much, it's a 
harmless error standard of review.  I think a wrote a 
case on that, which says that --

MR. O'CONNELL:  Yes.  You wrote on O'Neal, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.  So why don't we

just send it back and say apply the standard?

 MR. O'CONNELL:  Your Honor, although the 

Ninth Circuit admittedly used a structural defect 
nomenclature with which we don't agree, we believe that 
the Court can't -- that upon considering both the Ninth 
Circuit decision and the district court decision, this 
Court can affirm because the inquiry which the Ninth 
Circuit did conduct was actually a case-specific 
inquiry, not really a structural defect inquiry, and 
when an examination of the evidence and the verdicts and 
the instructions and anything else indicative of the 
jury's thinking still leaves the court uncertain whether 
the jurors relied on the valid or the invalid theory, 
that's a substantial and injurious influence.  That is 
grave doubt.  That is equipoise, in the language of Your 
Honor's opinion.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You're saying that I should 
have grave doubt myself and any judge would have to.  He 
made an argument here I think that wasn't such a bad 
one.  He said look at page 14 and you'll see the 
mistake, you know, in the joint appendix.

 MR. O'CONNELL:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  There it is.  And it's 

absolutely wrong.  The basic instruction under the law 
says you have to be engaged in the crime and you have to

have a certain state of intent.  You have to have 
committed this murder in order to help the crime or at 
least in order to escape.

 MR. O'CONNELL:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's wrong.  Put them 

together, but then look at the instruction on page 13, 
which he actually gave, and the one on 13 really does 
seem to say that, or more so.  It says, you can only 
apply -- jury, you can only apply this special 
instruction if two things are true:  First, in lines 9 
through 12 of that instruction, it seems to repeat that 
you have to be engaged in the crime.  And then just 
before that, it says, and you have to have one of two 
states of mind.  You have to either intend to kill the 
person or at least be recklessly indifferent.  And since 
that's what we said on page 13, the fact we made a 
mistake on page 14 doesn't matter that much.  That's one 
of his arguments that I'm sure they have a lot of 
evidentiary ones and a bunch of other ones.

 MR. O'CONNELL:  Your Honor, I think the 
answer to that question is in the underlying trial 
reporter's transcript at pages 1015 to 1016, the 
district attorney's cross-examination of Mr. Pulido. 
The district attorney developed the theme quite 
effectively that, even under Mr. Pulido's own account,

he exhibited reckless indifference because he saw the 
mortally wounded victim lying there, and the D.A. said, 
did you try to resuscitate him?  Have you ever had a CPR 
class?  I did once.  Well, did you do CPR on him?  No. 
Did you call 9-11?  You didn't care whether he lived or 
died, did you?

 So this entire line of cross-examination, to 

which the district attorney came back again, though 
somewhat less dramatically, at 1330 of the transcript 
and again at 1337 to 1338, commenting that he -- that 
Mr. Pulido did not go back in at some later point to 
check on the victim's condition, that entire line of 
cross-examination encouraged the theme that even under 
Mr. Pulido's own account of the facts, he showed 
reckless indifference.  And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the error wasn't 

harmless.  And that's an argument you can make before 
the Ninth Circuit on remand.

 MR. O'CONNELL:  That certainly is an 

argument that if the Court -- if the Court is convinced 
that the Ninth Circuit's analysis in substance --
because I realize the nomenclature -- the nomenclature 
was inconsistent with harmless error, and I'm not going 
to defend that.  If the Court is convinced that the 
substance of the Ninth Circuit's analysis was so far

removed from what harmless error analysis requires in 
this context, we agree that the usual course would be to 
send it back.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, why don't we 

just take them at their word?  As you say, they are 
applying the wrong nomenclature.  It would be easy 
enough for them when they get it back to say, oh, we 
meant, you know, harmless error under Brecht.  But that 
seems to me to be at least an open question.

 MR. O'CONNELL:  Your Honor, I think I could 

best answer that by offering my own critique of the 
Ninth Circuit opinion and -- which may explain why it 
may be unnecessary.  In my opinion, what the analysis 
that the Ninth Circuit conducted was equivalent to a 
sufficient analysis, equivalent to the point of 
equipoise discussed in O'Neal.  That is to say, it 
reviewed the evidence and said -- and the verdicts and 
the instructions -- and said we're uncertain, we can't 
tell which way the jury went.

 My critique of the Ninth Circuit's -- at 

least its per curiam opinion, as opposed to one of the 
concurring opinions, is that in fact this is not just a 
general verdict case.  We know a great deal about the 
jurors' thinking in this case.  We know that by a vote 
of either 8-4 or 4-8, the jurors rejected the

prosecution's primary theory, which was that Pulido 
personally shot the victim and that, in the prosecutor's 
words, Aragon had nothing to do with this, Aragon wasn't 
there, Aragon isn't a murderer.

 We also know -- and this will be another 

echo of the Sarausad case -- we also know that 
throughout their five days of deliberations, the jurors 
submitted question after question directed to what are 
now -- what are concededly defective erroneous 
instructions, and moreover, those questions focused 
right in on the defect in the instructions and in 
particular the timing of Mr. Pulido's assistance.

 And I refer the Court in particular to the 
jurors' handwritten diagrams of alternative conceptions 
of felony-murder aiding and abetting liability, which 
are at 36 to 38 of the joint appendix, and also the 
jurors' question at page 41 of the joint appendix 
whether -- this goes right -- this goes, as the district 
court said, to the crux of the issue:  Does the 
defendant have to have knowledge before or during the 
crime of the -- of the unlawful purpose of the 
perpetrator?  And as to both of those questions the 
judge said:  Go back and reread those same instructions, 
which of course were erroneous.

 So my critique of the Ninth Circuit opinion,

which is again slightly different, I think, than the 
State's, would be that it neglected to mention that 
compelling evidence that in fact the jurors actually 
found a set of facts corresponding to the invalid late 
joiner theory, because in my view what -- the analysis 
the Ninth Circuit conducted gets us to a point of 
equipoise, and that's enough for Brecht.  The defect in 
the Ninth Circuit's analysis is they neglected to also 
factor in those juror queries, and in my view the juror 
queries move us from a state of equipoise to a very high 
probability that the jurors relied on the -- and adopted 
a factual scenario corresponding to an invalid theory.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Under Brecht, you 

have the burden of showing a substantial injurious 
effect.

 MR. O'CONNELL:  Well, actually, Your Honor, 

as understand O'Neal the Court specifically renounced 
describing it as a burden, and in fact said that we are 
not going to use the "burden" terminology, and rather 
than talk about allocating burdens, we are going to 
address it from the perspective of the judge and say, if 
the judge is in equipoise, that is sufficient.

 We also know that -- drawing upon the 

relationship between the Brecht standard and others, we 
know that a Strickland standard is deemed to -- that if

you have Strickland prejudice, you don't have to go 
through a separate Brecht analysis.  Because of 
Strickland, reasonable probability also satisfies 
Brecht's substantial and injurious influence.  Well, 
this Court has said again and again, in construing 
Strickland, it does not require a more likely than not 
showing; it simply requires a showing sufficient to 
undermine confidence in the outcome.  And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you think you win 

under Brecht?

 MR. O'CONNELL:  I think we will under 

Brecht, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You think the Ninth 

Circuit, although it didn't use that label, actually 
applied the Brecht standard?

 MR. O'CONNELL:  In substance, it did even 

though, as I said, I will -- I can't -- I can't run from 
the language the Ninth Circuit actually used.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure.  Well, then it 

seems to me you agree with your friend that the Brecht 
standard -- and the government -- that the Brecht 
standard applies.

 MR. O'CONNELL:  Yes, we do, Your Honor.

over is whether the Ninth Circuit applied that standard

or not?

 MR. O'CONNELL:  Yes, Your Honor, whether it 

applied it in substance.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why don't we just 
send it back and ask them?  Say:  We can't tell.  The 
parties are having disagreement about what you did. 
What did you do?

 MR. O'CONNELL:  Your Honor, as I said a 

little earlier, if I fail to persuade the Court that the 
substance of what the Ninth Circuit did was --
effectively satisfied Brecht as interpreted in O'Neal, 
then I agree that's an appropriate course, and we 
indicated that in the final section of our brief.  There 
is not --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm sure that would be -- I 

mean, what worries me is proliferating arguments among 
judges.  Why not just say, you know, apply Brecht.  I'd 
like it with the O'Neal clause because it seems to me 
the O'Neal clause applies.

 MR. O'CONNELL:  I agree, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Just go do it.  And then 
they can say "we already did it," or they can say "we 
didn't already do it, but we'll do it now."  Let them

don't -- I don't strenuously object to that because, as 
I've mentioned if the court, if the court remains, 
remains of the view that what the Ninth Circuit did was 
simply incompatible with Brecht, then I agree it should 
be sent back and I -- and I understand why that might be 
the Court's inclination.  Let me offer another angle for 
why what the Ninth Circuit did is entirely compatible 
with Brecht.

 In civil cases, this Court routinely applies 

the same sort of general verdict analysis which in 
criminal cases has become to be known as the Stromberg 
line.  In fact, it did it as recently this summer in the 
Exxon Valdez case.  Now civil cases don't have Chapman, 
they don't have structural defect; civil cases are 
subject to a harmless error standard which ultimately 
goes back to the identical statute which was construed 
in Kotteakos.

 And going back to the opinion of the Court 

in O'Neal, in addressing the relationship between 
Kotteakos/Brecht harmless error review and civil 
harmless error review, the Court indicated he think 
rather strongly that those standards are either 
equivalent or to the extent that they differ, the 
Brecht/ Kotteakos standard is less forgiving of error 
because of the liberty interest at stake.  Now that

means two things.  From a retrospective point of view of 
simply construing this Court's different lines of cases, 
I think it demonstrates that this general verdict 
analysis is entirely consistent with a Kotteakos type 
harmless error analysis, but it also has some 
perspective implications, because if this Court were to 
wholly disavow that type of analysis and say that has 
nothing to do with harmless error review, that's going 
to impact civil cases, too; and obviously in all this 
Court's opinions, the Court is considering not only the 
immediate case, but what is going to happen if we -- if 
we rule one way or another.

 So this case -- this case supports a finding 
of prejudice under that O'Neal equipoise and as for the 
Ninth Circuit did, that's not what it called it, it even 
more strongly supports prejudice when one factors in the 
rest of the record, notably the juror -- the juror 
queries and another item which I think may be responsive 
to some of Justice Alito's earlier questions, which is 
the strength of the evidence on the various theories.
 There were three theories and obviously 

there was evidence in support of the prosecution's main 
theory that Pulido shot the victim himself.  There was 
evidence -- obviously there was substantial evidence in 
the form of Pulido's own testimony in support of the

invalid late-joiner theory.  Out of these the one theory 
that had least support in the record before the jury was 
the valid aiding and abetting theory, because no witness 
testified to a scenario in which Pulido assisted in some 
fashion or another prior to the shooting; nor did the 
prosecutor attempt to develop that type of scenario in 
argument because the prosecutor was very clear: 
Prosecutor said you're going to get aiding and abetting 
instructions just in case.  They only apply -- if --
they only come into play if you were to believe the 
defendant's story which was a real whopper; but if you 
believe the defendant's story the felony murder rule 
applies.

 But then the prosecutor immediately went 

back, "but I don't think it applies at all, Aragon 
wasn't there.  Aragon didn't do it.  Pulido did it," and 
prosecutor went back to his primary theory.

 So the theory which the -- present in the 
instructions was least before the jury, was the valid 
aiding and abetting theory, yet defining this conceded 
error harmless depends on the notion either that the 
jury actually adopted a pre-shooting aiding or abetting 
or that they necessarily would have adopted one if 
properly instructed.

 There is one final point I'd like to make,

which is there is a qualitative aspect to Brecht; and 
when one has an error under which the defense testimony 
even if believed renders the defendant guilty 
erroneously, that derails the entire defense.  That it 
seems to me is the quintessential substantial and 
injurious influence; because it practically renders the 
trial nullity by erroneously telling the jury even if 
you find this set of facts, the defendant is guilty.

 So for these reasons and additionally for 

the very thorough prejudice analysis found in the 
district court opinion, we urge the Court to affirm, 
despite the Ninth Circuit's inept nomenclature, but in 
the event the Court is dissatisfied with that 
explanation, we have acknowledged that the appropriate 
course in that instance would be to send it back under 
Brecht.

 Unless the Court has any further questions, 

I'm prepared to submit.

MR. FRIEDLANDER:  We agree that we need to 
do Brecht.  We disagree on what Brecht is.  Respondent 
is telling you that Brecht is the error test, whether 
the jury relied on the valid or invalid theory.  That's 
what he says Brecht is.  In Calderon v Coleman, this 
Court said there is a difference between the error test 
and the harmless error test.

 All these questions that the jury asked went 
to the question of error.  Did the jury misapply the law 
by failing to find a contemporaneity aspect of felony 
murder?  They did not go to the harmless error question 
of what the jury would have done had it been properly 
instructed.

 We urge the Court in remanding the case to 

make clear that the error analysis must be kept separate 
from the harmless error analysis.  This is a mistake 
Judge Thomas made in his concurring opinion.  We -- he 
assumes -- he sees a mistake in an instruction; he 
assumes that the mistake rises to the level of 
constitutional error; and then he does a prejudice 
analysis by deciding whether the mistake caused the jury 
to misapply the law.  In other words, he -- he applies 
an error analysis to decide prejudice.  And what he does 
is he includes all this evidence of the questions the 
jury asked when those questions went only to the

misapplication of law that was the error, and did 
nothing to show the basis of the jury's special 
circumstance finding, which is the heart of the harmless 
error determination here.  If there are no further 
questions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Mr. Friedlander.  The case is submitted.
