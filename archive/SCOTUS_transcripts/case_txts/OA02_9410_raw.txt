          CHIEF JUSTICE  REHNQUIST:   We'll hear  argument

next in No. 02-9410, Michael D. Crawford v. Washington. 

          Mr. Fisher.

            ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

          MR. FISHER:   Thank you, Mr. Chief  Justice, and

may it please the Court:

          The   Confrontation   Clause    prohibited   the

admission of the accomplice's custodial statement here for

two reasons:   first, because its interlocking  nature did

not establish its  reliability under this  Court's Roberts

jurisprudence; and second, and more fundamentally, because

the accomplice's custodial  statement amounted to  out-of-

court  testimony  that  was   never  submitted  to  cross-

examination, in violation of the traditional understanding

of the right to confrontation. 

          QUESTION:  When  you say out-of-court testimony,

Mr. Fisher, what do you mean by the word testimony? 

          MR. FISHER:  What I mean,  Mr. Chief Justice, is

someone  giving  a statement  out  of  court  that is  the

functional  equivalent  of what  they  would do  in court,

which is to say they're giving the authorities a statement

that is  describing an event in a way that they understand

is going to be used in a criminal investigation.

          QUESTION:  So it may --  it -- the -- it applies

to the --  if it's made  to the authorities  but not to  a

third person?

          MR. FISHER:  Ordinarily that's the -- that would

be the dividing line.

          QUESTION:  Why is that?

          MR.  FISHER:   Well,  because the  Confrontation

Clause, to go back to the text and to start with the text,

talks about  being a witness against somebody.  And the --

and  the common understanding  of that  term is to  give a

statement  that you understand  is going  to be used  in a

criminal investigation, and when you're giving a statement

to  the  authorities, here  a  custodial statement  to the

police, that's  a different  situation than  the ordinary,

everyday occurrence of speaking to a friend or a colleague

or something. 

          QUESTION:  But your ultimate criterion is was it

made with the understanding that  it would or probably  be

used for prosecutorial purposes.

          MR. FISHER:   That's the way  I read the  -- the

term  witness  against  in  the  Constitution.   It's  the

gateway to the Confrontation Clause.  Yes, Justice Souter.

          QUESTION:   So in  an auto  accident, a  private

investigator   --  it's  a   serious  accident.    Private

investigators for both of the parties come out and make --

and make notes  of what the witnesses said.  Is -- is that

testimonial? 

          MR. FISHER:  The private -- 

          QUESTION:  It's a later criminal proceeding  and

it's -- 

          MR.  FISHER:  Well,  I mean,  I -- I  think that

that's  the kind  of  a statement  that ordinarily  is not

going  to be testimonial.  You know, an auto accident -- I

take it you're -- you're talking about an auto accident in

terms of a criminal case.  But --

          QUESTION:  Well,  it's -- it's an  auto accident

and insurance investigators are all over the scene when it

later turns into a criminal case.

          MR.  FISHER:   I  mean,  that's  the kind  of  a

situation  that  there could  be  a difficult  question in

something like that, but I think that is likely not to  be

testimonial.

          QUESTION:  Well, it's --

          QUESTION:   What  about if  the -- what  about a

police officer who does the same thing?

          MR.  FISHER:     I  think  the   police  officer

certainly tips the balance and  certainly when somebody is

talking  to  a  police  officer,  that's  the  kind  of  a

statement they understand is going to be used in court.

          QUESTION:  Well, if -- if we're going to change,

as  you   suggest  in  your  brief,  to  using  this  term

testimonial,  it  certainly  does  not   bring  any  great

certainty,  does it, if you say something tips the balance

one way or another?  Obviously, you're  going to get a lot

of close cases. 

          MR.  FISHER:   Well,  I  understand,  Mr.  Chief

Justice, there are going to be some close cases out on the

margins, and I acknowledge that.  But what the testimonial

approach does is it covers  the core cases, the ones  that

the Confrontation Clause has always been concerned with.

          And really, it's not so  much a new test.   What

-- what  the testimonial  approach does is  really sum  up

what this Court itself did  in interpreting the common law

and  bringing  that  under  the   umbrella  of  the  Sixth

Amendment  starting  in  Kirby  and  Mattox,  the  Court's

earliest decisions on the Confrontation Clause, really all

the way up through Douglas in the 1960's where actually in

that very  opinion the Court uses  the term to  describe a

custodial  confession  --  the  Court  uses the  term  the

equivalent of  testimony.   And so  that's the  kind of  a

situation we're talking about to --

          QUESTION:  When you --

          QUESTION:  But you -- you -- your proposal would

effect a significant change in doctrine, I guess, from the

Roberts case, and I think even under your proposal certain

testimonial  statements would  be  admissible against  the

defendant,   for   instance,  where   the   defendant  has

contributed  to  making  the  witness  unavailable and  so

forth.

          MR. FISHER:  Well, the --

          QUESTION:  I  mean, you -- you  would still have

some testimonial statements in there. 

          Tell me which  of our  cases, since the  Roberts

decision,  would  have  come  out differently  under  your

proposed approach.

          MR.  FISHER:   I  don't  think, Your  Honor, any

cases since Roberts.

          QUESTION:  No case. 

          MR. FISHER:  Nor any case before Roberts.

          QUESTION:  Then why change?

          MR.  FISHER:   Because  the lower  courts aren't

getting it  right, Chief  Justice Rehnquist,  and I  think

that the  problem is, is that the Roberts approach sets up

a  framework that  is both  unworkable in practice  and is

leading to consistently  anomalous results.   And I  think

it's --

          QUESTION:  Idaho  would have -- v.  Wright would

have come out the same way because the doctor who took the

statements of the child was  acting at the request of  the

police? 

          MR. FISHER:   That's how I understand  the facts

of the case,  Justice Kennedy.   The victim was --  was in

police custody  at the time of the examination, and it was

in  coordination  with the  police.    So, yes,  Idaho  v.

Wright,  as well  as all this  Court's other  cases, would

come out.

          But it's important, you know, to go back  to the

question and  say, you  know, why  change from Roberts  if

we've gotten to the right places in -- in our cases.   And

the answer  is, you know,  certainly this Court  may never

have to change from Roberts,  but simply understanding the

way that  Roberts is working in the lower courts I believe

should  cause  this  --  cause  the Court  great  concern.

The --

          QUESTION:   But isn't --  isn't that our  -- our

function  in part?  We occasionally  take cases from lower

courts  to  straighten  out  misconceptions.    Presumably

that's how these things get worked out.

          MR. FISHER:   That's correct,  Justice O'Connor,

but, you know, I would submit that you're going to have to

practically  fill your  docket  with Confrontation  Clause

cases doing error correction in  order to come out correct

in all these cases. 

          QUESTION:  Well, we've --  but we've had Roberts

for 23 years, and we  certainly haven't filled our  docket

with Confrontation Clause cases.

          MR. FISHER:  Well, that's right.   And that's --

and -- and what's happened, because you haven't done that,

is  the lower  courts  are reaching  some  very, very  bad

results.  I was responding  to Justice O'Connor's question

about  why change  from Roberts  if we're  getting to  the

right solution, and the reason is because the way that the

test is  framed, it just simply is unworkable in the lower

courts.   As  we  cited  in our  brief,  there  are --  we

gathered  20  factors  that  lower  courts are  using  for

indicia of reliability.  We could have listed 40 or 50.

          The  United States is asking you, as well as the

State, to stick  with this -- stick  with this reliability

approach for all of its faults.   And you know, the -- the

ironic thing with that kind of a -- of -- of a position is

the more testimonial  the statement is, the  more reliable

it is, and in turn --

          QUESTION:  Before you give  the reasons, I --  I

want to go back to what you said.  You say the test should

be  functional equivalent  of testimony.    The functional

equivalent  is a little  vague, and the  law professors in

their amicus brief  suggest that  the question should  be,

would a  reasonable person  in the  position of  declarant

anticipate that  the statement  would likely  be used  for

evidentiary purposes?   Would you accept that as a -- a --

would you adopt that phrasing  of the question, or do  you

have a  different  phrasing, or  do you  think  if we  did

follow  your  approach,  the  opinion  should  simply  say

functional equivalent?

          MR. FISHER:  Well, first of all, Justice Breyer,

you  don't have  to get  too far  into that  in  this case

because, of course --

          QUESTION:  No, no.  But I mean it's true that --

I realize  that, but -- but  perhaps we could do  a little

bit  better  than  say  just testimonial.    If  --  if we

accepted your approach --

          MR. FISHER:  I think --

          QUESTION:   --  so I'm  -- I'm  --  I want  your

opinion on that.   I mean, there -- we have several briefs

here.  We have variations on the theme, and I want to know

which variation  you think  is the  best or  which is  the

worst.  I read you one of them. 

          MR. FISHER:  I think  I agree with the  starting

point of the functional equivalent of testimony.  And then

I  think  that the  law  professors' test,  the reasonable

expectation,  is  a good  test,  and I  would  -- I  would

embellish that by saying that I think that what we have is

99 cases out of 100 that's  going to be the situation that

I -- I believe the Chief Justice brought up, which  is the

-- somebody speaking to the  authorities in the course  of

the investigation of a crime,  somebody giving a statement

to the authorities or directing one to them. 

          QUESTION:  Would  there be anything that  fit in

your category  where the person  to whom the  statement is

made  is  not  an  officer,  either  a  police  officer or

prosecutor?

          MR.  FISHER:   I  think there  may  be, and  the

reason -- I  think there may  be a --  a rare, rare  case,

Justice Ginsburg,  in a scenario -- you know, come up with

hypotheticals.   One possible  scenario might  be somebody

giving a statement to  their friend and directing  them to

tell  the  police.     So,  you  know,  simply   using  an

intermediary where we  know the statement is  going to the

police, but --

          QUESTION:   Why -- why  should it depend  on the

intent of  the declarant?   I -- why  is that --  why does

that make the  declarant a witness  within the meaning  of

the Confrontation Clause?  I mean, suppose  -- suppose the

police  get  --  get  the  statement  from  the  declarant

surreptitiously.   They do  not let  -- let him  know that

they  are,  in  fact,  the police.    That  --  that would

disqualify it under  the law  professors' test from  being

testimony? 

          MR. FISHER:  Well, in that --

          QUESTION:  Because  he would not know  that this

was going to be used in court.

          MR.  FISHER:   Well,  I mean,  I think  that's a

situation  -- you know, and this is where the definitional

problem gets difficult.  I mean, because the other part of

the Confrontation Clause  is a limitation on  State power,

and  it says --  you know,  going all the  way Blackstone,

it's a  limitation on  the State  molding statements  that

it's going to use later  in a criminal investigation.   So

if that kind of a situation were present where somebody is

molding  somebody's  statement,  I  think  that  might  be

something the  Confrontation Clause is  concerned with  as

well. 

          And  that   goes  back  to   Justice  Ginsburg's

question  to  say  that,  yes,  there  may  be,  you know,

difficult  cases  --  difficult hypothetical  out  in  the

margin, but what  we have here is a  test that covers what

are the time-and-again  cases that are coming  before this

Court and coming before the lower courts.

          QUESTION:  Well, but --

          QUESTION:    Are you  -- just  -- just  with the

dialogue with  Justice Scalia,  because I'm  interested in

the same problem, is it  the intent of the speaker  or the

intent of the person taking the statement that would be --

be more relevant in your view?

          MR. FISHER:  Well, certainly I -- I -- you know,

you don't have to decide that question in this case, but I

think that if either one of them --

          QUESTION:   Well, of course -- of course, we do.

I mean, I  -- I really object to saying, you know, just --

just don't worry about it.  We'll worry about it later.  I

mean, if there are real  problems that come up later,  I'm

not going to buy your -- your retreat from Roberts.

          MR. FISHER:   I see, Your  Honor.  I  think that

proper -- the proper test would be if -- if one of the two

people is  so --  you know,  is doing  something with  the

purpose  of  understanding  it's going  to  be  used in  a

criminal  case, then we  have a testimonial  situation.  I

think you -- this Court could say that, but it -- you have

to look back --

          QUESTION:  You  mean either  the speaker or  the

person taking the statement.  Is that what  you're saying?

I don't understand your response. 

          MR. FISHER:  I think certainly the speaker and I

think  there may be situations  -- and this  is -- this is

something the Court can deal with about when this -- about

when the  -- when the governmental officer is the only one

and  --  and  is  under   such  a  circumstance  that  the

governmental officer is  molding the  statement in such  a

way and molding what somebody is going to say --

          QUESTION:  Well, you know,  the concern we ought

to have with your approach is we're going to get into some

very  tricky  questions if  we go  your route  in deciding

what's  testimonial,  and why  buy  a pig  in  a poke,  in

effect? 

          MR. FISHER:  Well, the  first reason is because,

as I said, if  you have difficult cases out on the margin,

I  submit  to the  Court  the Constitution  could tolerate

that.

          QUESTION:  Yes, but I think the professors there

are  thinking  that  isn't  difficult.   I  think  they're

thinking it is the question of whether a reasonable person

in the declarant's position would think it was likely that

this was going to be used in testimony because if you look

to the position of the police, you will suddenly find that

tape   recorded   informant   testimony  of   an   ongoing

conspiracy, while they're  planning to  rob the bank,  and

suddenly is kept out  of court.  And  there is no  reason.

We wouldn't keep  it out of court  today.  It would  be --

come in  under the co-conspirator rule.   So I  think that

they wrote these  words in this  brief thinking about  it,

and now if we're suddenly going to go and -- and open this

all up to a whole bunch  of other things, I'd be a  little

nervous about it too.

          MR.  FISHER:    No, I'm  sorry,  Mr.  -- Justice

Breyer.  I may have misunderstood partially the suggestion

-- the  hypothetical that I was  getting.  I  think you're

correct  that  the  traditional   kind  of  co-conspirator

statements  under that kind  of a situation  would come in

under either approach.  What I understood the hypothetical

to be  was a situation where somebody,  after a conspiracy

is done, is doing -- 

          QUESTION:  It's your  view that a co-conspirator

statement is not testimonial then?

          MR. FISHER:  I think  that's the ordinary course

of events.  Yes, Justice Ginsburg. 

          QUESTION:  Well,  why is  that if  it meets  the

test of a statement made to the police? 

          MR.  FISHER:    Well, if  there's  an undercover

officer present, it  meets -- it meets  the -- the  -- you

know, the test  of a statement  made to  the police.   But

then I  think this  is where  the law  professors have  it

right, and this is where I'm agreeing with Justice Breyer.

          QUESTION:    Not  --  you're  right.   It's  not

automatically.    Under  the rule  today,  if  it's  a co-

conspirator  statement,  right  in   the  police  station,

because it's  an ongoing  coverup conspiracy,  I guess  it

would come in.  But I think under the new rule, if in fact

everybody in that room knows that  it is likely to be used

as a substitute for testimonial use at trial, it would not

come in.  I think that's the point of the change.

          MR. FISHER:  I think that's correct. 

          QUESTION:  And -- and --

          QUESTION:   Well, how  -- how about  a wire tap?

You've got a wire tap  going, and you hear co-conspirators

on -- on the  other end of the wire.   Is that testimonial

or not?

          MR. FISHER:  I think that's the traditional kind

of co-conspirator  statement that  is not  covered by  the

testimonial approach.  And -- and I think --

          QUESTION:  And under your approach it would come

in without difficulty.  It  would not be testimonial.   Is

that what you're saying?

          MR.  FISHER:    Without  difficulty  as  to  the

Confrontation Clause, yes, Justice O'Connor. 

          And I think it's important when we look at these

hypotheticals to  compare what we  have on the  other side

when you  look at the Roberts approach.  Under the Roberts

approach, no  matter  how much  -- you  know, if  somebody

gives an  out-of-court affidavit,  if  somebody speaks  ex

parte to a  grand jury, even if a witness  takes the stand

in the  middle of a criminal trial --  in -- in a criminal

trial and puts blame directly  on the defendant, and then,

for  example, were  to die or  suddenly go  missing, under

Roberts  you  have  the situation  where  the  trial judge

doesn't  strike the  testimony, doesn't  disallow it,  but

looks to its reliability.

          And the  odd thing  -- and  this is  what I  was

getting to  earlier.  Compared to  what the State  and the

Solicitor  General  are proposing  to  you today,  the odd

thing  is the more  testimonial it  is, the more  it comes

under the core  concern of  the Confrontation Clause  that

started  in Raleigh's  trial  and has  moved  all the  way

forward --  the more  testimonial it  is, the more  likely

it's pass -- it is to pass the Roberts test.

          QUESTION:  Well,  let's look  at this very  case

and tell me whether the result is any different at the end

of the day under Roberts versus your test.

          MR. FISHER:   I think  the answer is  absolutely

not, Justice O'Connor.  Under  this Court's Wright opinion

--  you  know,  the  rationale for  the  lower  court  was

interlocking confessions.   Under this Court's Roberts  --

I'm sorry.   Under this Court's  opinion in Wright,  it is

only  the inherent  indicia  of reliability  surrounding a

statement  not other  evidence at  trial that a  judge can

look to.  So --

          QUESTION:   And therefore?  I mean, relate it to

this case, if you would.  Tell me whether the result would

differ under your proposal and under Roberts in this  very

case.  Why  don't you focus  on the statement and  tell us

why it would or would not be different? 

          MR. FISHER:   It  doesn't matter  in this  case,

Justice O'Connor, for two reasons.

          First  of all, because  under Wright, you cannot

look to the defendant's confession  in order to assess the

reliability of  Sylvia's statement,  and  that's what  the

Washington Supreme Court did.

          The  second reason is even if  you could look to

that  --  to the  substantive  evidence at  trial, several

other  indicia  showed   that  the   statement  here   was

unreliable.  The -- the witness was drunk.  She said she'd

been  in  shock   during  the  events.     She  gave   two

inconsistent  statements within a 4-hour span.  She was in

police custody after being told  that it depended what she

told the officers as to whether  or not she'd be allow  to

leave.  So  there are several, several  reasons to believe

that the statement here -- 

          QUESTION:  Is it --

          MR. FISHER:   -- you  know, is excludable  under

both tests. 

          QUESTION:  Why is it excludable under your test?

          MR.  FISHER:     Well,  under   the  testimonial

approach, Mr. Chief Justice? 

          QUESTION:  Yes. 

          MR. FISHER:  For the  simple reason that she was

in custody giving a statement, giving a confession or a --

or a custodial  examination to police officers  knowing it

was  going  to  be  used  in the  criminal  investigation.

That's the traditional -- it is  -- is the most common  --

it is the core concern of the Confrontation Clause.

          QUESTION:  How --

          MR. FISHER:   It brings us  all the way  back to

Raleigh's trial. 

          QUESTION:  How about a statement like in Mancusi

or  one of those  cases where  the witness is  given prior

recorded testimony?  There's been an opportunity to cross-

examine.  The  witness is  presently dead or  unavailable.

Does that come in under your system? 

          MR. FISHER:   Yes, Mr.  Chief Justice.   Mancusi

comes out exactly  the same way, and here's why.  And this

shows  why my  test  -- why  the  testimonial approach  is

actually quite narrow.  All  the testimonial approach says

is the witness has to  have had a chance to  cross-examine

the witness. 

          QUESTION:  The defendant. 

          MR. FISHER:  If, when it comes time for trial --

I'm sorry?

          QUESTION:  The defendant. 

          MR. FISHER:   I'm sorry.   The defendant has  to

have had  a chance to cross-examine the witness.  If trial

rolls around and  the witness  is unavailable, through  no

fault of  the parties,  and there's  been adequate  cross-

examination,  as  in Mancusi  and  actually as  in Roberts

itself -- and -- and I actually --

          QUESTION:   Cross-examination by  the defendant,

not by somebody else. 

          MR. FISHER:   Right.  The statement  needs to be

given  in  the  defendant's presence  with  the  defendant

himself having the opportunity to cross-examine. 

          QUESTION:  Would -- would your approach overrule

Inadi?

          MR. FISHER:  No, I don't believe it does.

          QUESTION:  So  you wouldn't have to say  -- show

that a particular declarant was unavailable. 

          MR.  FISHER:   You  would  have to  show  that a

particular declarant is unavailable --

          QUESTION:  Well, then --

          MR.  FISHER:    --  if  it  were  a  testimonial

statement.  What -- what --

          QUESTION:   Well,  then how about  a spontaneous

declaration?

          MR.  FISHER:  Well,  that's the kind  of a thing

that's traditional hearsay.  It's  outside of the scope of

the phrase  witness against.  It's outside of the scope of

the testimonial approach.

          QUESTION:    So  it  would  come in  under  your

system? 

          MR. FISHER:  An excited  utterance comes out the

same way under --

          QUESTION:   Without  --  without having  to show

unavailability. 

          MR. FISHER:  Right.   It's just purely a hearsay

question, Justice -- Chief Justice Rehnquist. 

          QUESTION:  Because you say that's outside of the

Confrontation Clause entirely, not lumping all of hearsay.

I thought your whole point is we don't want to lump all of

hearsay under the Confrontation Clause.

          MR. FISHER:   That's exactly right.   I'm sorry,

Justice --

          QUESTION:  But  there's one aspect of  this case

that before your  time is up I  hope you can enlighten  me

on.  The reason that  this witness is unavailable is  that

the defendant has  exercised his right to prevent his wife

from testifying against him.  Is that correct?

          MR.   FISHER:    It's  --  it's  close,  Justice

Ginsburg.  Washington law renders as a default rule that a

spouse is  unavailable to testify against  another spouse.

Mr. Crawford here declined to waive that privilege.

          QUESTION:  All right.  But because he could have

not asserted that or not waived it, why doesn't that carry

over  also?  Why  doesn't her  immunity -- his  control of

whether she  can speak -- why doesn't that control as well

the use of  the substitute for  her testimony?   If --  if

there is such a privilege,  why doesn't it cover both  her

actual  testimony  in court  and  the substitute  for that

testimony? 

          MR. FISHER:  Well, I mean, I think you're asking

me as  a Federal issue.   As -- you  know, as a  State law

issue, Washington State law has decided that the second --

that  the  out-of-court  statement  can  come  in.   As  a

Federal --

          QUESTION:  I just don't  understand the logic of

it. 

          MR.  FISHER:  As  a --  well, the reason  -- you

don't understand the logic of the State law rule?

          QUESTION:   The State -- yes, to say that he can

keep her  off the stand, but he can't prevent a substitute

for -- for that statement --

          MR. FISHER:  I agree,  Justice Ginsburg.  It  is

--  it is  a somewhat odd  State law  rule.  There's  a --

there's a case called State v.  Burden that the Washington

Supreme Court held that the marital privilege applies just

to the -- just to actually facing your spouse on the stand

in the course of a trial because  it -- you know, it helps

your spouse avoid  the possibility  of perjury and  things

like that.  And it  said it doesn't apply to  out-of-court

statements.  I think you could make a very strong argument

that it ought to apply to both, but as a State law matter,

the  Washington  Supreme  Court  has  said  only  in-court

testimony. 

          Unless the Court has any further questions, I'll

reserve the remainder of my time. 

          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Fisher.

          Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you. 

            ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

     ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

          MR.  DREEBEN:   Mr.  Chief  Justice, and  may it

please the Court:

          If  the   Court  reaches  the   second  question

presented in this case, the United States submits that the

Confrontation Clause  should be  properly construed  to be

limited  to testimonial  statements  and their  functional

equivalent,  but it should not  be an absolute bar against

the admissibility of that kind of statement. 

          QUESTION:   Well, you kind of want it both ways.

It's kind of an odd position.   Has the Government taken a

different position on the testimonial aspect in the past?

          MR. DREEBEN:  No, Justice O'Connor.  We took the

same position with respect to the limitation of the clause

to testimonial statements  in White v. Illinois,  and this

Court  rejected that  submission by  a 7  to  2 vote.   We

renewed it in  this case in light of the  Court's grant of

certiorari on the  second question presented in  which the

petitioner's position is  that this Court has  too broadly

construed  the   Confrontation  Clause,  but   within  its

compass, it should be given an absolute prohibition. 

          QUESTION:  I  don't -- I don't  understand.  You

-- you say it's limited to testimonial statements.  The --

the clause is limited to testimonial statements.  However,

it is not absolute. 

          MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct. 

          QUESTION:   Are there any  other provisions that

are in the Bill of Rights that are not absolute and can be

overcome by  proof that the -- that the overall purpose of

the  truth-serving  function  is  --  is  achieved?    For

example, the right  to jury trial.   Do -- do we  approach

that by saying, oh, in  a really complicated case where  a

jury would impede  rather than  facilitate the finding  of

truth  like, you know,  a Sherman  Act case, yes,  it says

there's -- you're -- you're entitled to trial by jury, but

the  whole purpose of  it is  to achieve truth,  and where

that purpose wouldn't  be served,  let's forget about  the

jury?  We don't say that, do we?

          MR. DREEBEN:  No, Justice Scalia, but --

          QUESTION:   Then  why  do we  say  it about  the

Confrontation Clause?  And that  -- that's essentially the

Government's argument, that -- 

          MR. DREEBEN:   The Court has  said it about  the

Confrontation Clause --

          QUESTION:  I know it has.

          MR. DREEBEN:  -- in a variety of contexts.

          QUESTION:  And -- and  the issue here is whether

we -- we should retreat from those statements. 

          MR. DREEBEN:   Well,  starting from  the overall

structure of the Sixth Amendment,  the Court has construed

many  of  the rights  in  the Sixth  Amendment  not to  be

absolute in certain contexts.   The jury trial  right does

not extend to all criminal prosecutions as the language of

the Constitution  would provide.  It does not -- the right

to counsel does not extend to every criminal case in which

a  --  arguably the  text  would  require.    The  --  the

Compulsory Process Clause has been held --

          QUESTION:    That  -- that's  just  a  matter of

limiting  the scope.   The right to counsel.   Do you have

the  right to counsel for, you know, at -- at every moment

during  --  during recesses  in  the trial  and  so forth?

That's --  that's just a matter of the  scope of it, not a

matter of  saying, yes, this is within the scope.  This is

testimonial,  but  we  nonetheless  will  not  follow  the

command of  -- of  the constitutional  provision that  the

accused is entitled  to be  confronted with the  witnesses

against him. 

          MR. DREEBEN:  What this Court has said about the

Confrontation Clause is that it incorporated a preexisting

common law right  that had common law  exceptions with it,

and those common  law exceptions  were capable of  growing

and  being   developed  along   the  lines  of   analogous

principles.

          QUESTION:   Growing and being developed  so that

the -- the guarantee of confrontation is  just a guarantee

that in  the future we'll  -- we'll leave  it there  if we

think it should be there.

          MR. DREEBEN:   It's not an absolute  guarantee. 

What helps to,  I think, explain  that is to look  at what

confrontation  involves.   It  involves  having a  witness

who's  under oath,  who is  subject to  cross-examination,

who's  demeanor can be  observed by  the jury, and  who is

brought face  to face with the  accused.  Now,  this Court

has held in  a number of cases  that all or some  of those

components of confrontation may be dispensed with when, in

the necessities of the case and in order to obtain witness

-- witnesses who will be able to testify at  the trial, it

is required to do so. 

          For   example,   in  the   instance   of  former

testimony, you have oath, cross --  and cross-examination,

and you  have at one point the defendant face to face with

the  witness,   but  you   do  not   have  the   important

confrontation right of the jury  having the opportunity to

observe the demeanor of the  witness.  And the Court  held

that that is required because  the necessities of the case

require overcoming what would otherwise be a confrontation

right.

          Similarly in  Maryland v. Craig, the  Court held

that  the  literal  face-to-face  right  to  confront  the

witness may be overcome by the necessities of the case.

          QUESTION:  But  then maybe your position  is not

different from -- from theirs in this respect, if you take

the law professors'.  If you say, as you do in your brief,

that  it   allows  testimonial   evidence  in  where   the

circumstances are such that they serve the same underlying

purpose  as  the  Confrontation Clause,  then  all  you're

saying  is the same  thing that they  say here.   Will the

accused have had  an adequate opportunity to  confront the

witness?   In other  words, like a  -- a prior  trial.  Is

that all you're saying?  Because if that's so --

          MR.  DREEBEN:   No.    It's definitely  not what

we're saying, Justice Breyer. 

          QUESTION:  No,  it certainly  isn't.  You're  --

you're defining the  underlying purpose much more  broadly

          MR. DREEBEN:   We define the  underlying purpose

of the Confrontation Clause --

          QUESTION:  To achieve  the truth.  And  if there

are other indicia --

          QUESTION:  Oh, achieve the truth.

          QUESTION:  Yes. 

          MR. DREEBEN:  To serve the truth-seeking mission

of the --

          QUESTION:  Sir Walter Raleigh -- if they came in

-- Sir Walter Raleigh -- in fact, it is shown that all the

--  the statements  made out  of court against  Sir Walter

Raleigh were made in front of 12 bishops, and at that time

that  was  a  very,  very  good  security  that  this  was

completely true.   Twelve bishops who saw the thing and --

and they,  you know, go -- they  say, absolutely accurate.

In -- in  your opinion,  that would  then come  in in  Sir

Walter Raleigh's own case.

          MR. DREEBEN:  I doubt seriously that -- that Sir

Walter Raleigh's case would come out differently under our

approach.  What we are talking about --

          QUESTION:  In other words, Sir Walter Raleigh --

it came out that they did introduce this thing.  So you're

saying if we take -- if we take -- 

          MR.  DREEBEN:    The  witnesses were  available,

Justice  Breyer,  in  Walter  Raleigh's  case.    And  our

position on  the availability  of witnesses  is that  when

they are available, they should be brought in.

          QUESTION:  You would overrule Inadi then?

          MR. DREEBEN:    Oh, definitely  not,  Mr.  Chief

Justice.  Our view of Inadi is  that the statements of co-

conspirators made to each other out of court in connection

with the -- with the conspiracy are almost invariably non-

testimonial statements.  There may be a few rare instances

in which the co-conspirators are continuing the conspiracy

and speaking to law enforcement,  and in that context,  in

the unlikely event  that the United States  submitted that

those  statements  were coming  in  for the  truth  of the

matter  asserted  and not  because  they were  false, then

perhaps there would be some issue about our approach.  But

in the vast majority of cases --

          QUESTION:    Well,  what  about  in  this  case?

There's a co-conspirator's statement. 

          MR. DREEBEN:   There  was no  suggestion in  the

lower courts that these two individuals were attempting to

further  the  conspiracy or  that  there was  a conspiracy

going on at the time of the statements. 

          QUESTION:  Well, I was going to say there was no

conspiracy found, was there?

          MR.  DREEBEN:     That's  --   these  --   these

statements  were  admitted,  Justice  Souter  and  Justice

O'Connor, as statements  against penal interest.   And the

basis for the State court decision in letting them in --

          QUESTION:  And  not as a so-called  interlocking

-- well, it was an interlocking --

          MR. DREEBEN:   Yes.   The  -- the  Confrontation

Clause --

          QUESTION:  -- type of confession or something. 

          MR. DREEBEN:   The  hearsay basis  was statement

against penal interests.   The confrontation argument that

was accepted by the Washington Supreme Court  was that the

confession  of Sylvia  Crawford  interlocked, which  meant

that  it  overlapped  and  paralleled  the  confession  of

Michael Crawford --

          QUESTION:   But the  Government doesn't  endorse

that position, as I understand it. 

          MR. DREEBEN:   We do not endorse  that position,

Justice Stevens. 

          QUESTION:    What is  your  position as  to what

should have happened with this statement? 

          MR.  DREEBEN:   This statement should  have been

excluded, Justice Kennedy.  It  -- first of all, we  think

that under --

          MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct. 

          QUESTION:  -- this theory.

          MR. DREEBEN:   Under Roberts,  as explicated  in

Idaho v.  Wright,  corroborating evidence  that serves  to

show the reliability  of a particular statement  is not an

acceptable  means of  vindicating its admission  under the

Confrontation Clause.

          I can think of only two possible reasons why the

confession of the  defendant when  it interlocks with  the

statement made out of court  might be treated differently,

and neither of those arguments seems to me to be valid. 

          One  would  be  if,  as  a factual  matter,  the

defendant's  own statements  showed that  the out-of-court

statement  was reliable  to a  degree not  found with  any

other  corroborating  evidence,  and I  don't  think  that

that's --

          QUESTION:  Well,  couldn't he be impeached  with

his out-of-court statement? 

          MR.  DREEBEN:    He  certainly  could  and   was

impeached with his out-of-court statements.

          And this brings  me to the second  reason, Chief

Justice  Rehnquist.     The   defendant  can   attack  the

reliability of his own out-of-court  confession.  He's not

bound by  some notion of estoppel that because he said it,

therefore it must  be true.   And the record in  this case

reflects  that Michael  Crawford  attempted  to present  a

self-defense at  trial that was substantially  more robust

than the  statements that he made at  the time.  And under

Crane  v. Kentucky, this  Court has held  that a defendant

can attack the reliability of his own statements.  So even

if the  statements did  directly interlock,  in the  sense

that the  defendant's statements matched  the out-of-court

declarant's statements, that would not  render them per se

reliable for confrontation purposes. 

          QUESTION:  But they didn't match, and that's the

oddest thing.  On the key thing, the most important to the

defendant,  he  suggested  that  the   --  the  person  he

assaulted  had reached  for something before  the assault.

And her testimony -- or her statement is that it  was only

after the defendant  assaulted the victim that  the victim

reached in -- in his pocket.  I don't see how  those could

be said to interlock.  They seem to clash with each  other

on the key point in the case.

          MR.  DREEBEN:  And  -- and  the State  made that

point in  its rebuttal  argument.   So there  -- there  is

certainly ample basis  for saying that under  existing law

the statements do not come in.

          The question for  the Court is should  the Court

revisit its Ohio  v. Roberts jurisprudence because  of the

concerns    about   whether    Ohio    v.   Roberts    was

constitutionally accurate.

          QUESTION:  Well, concerns by whom?

          MR. DREEBEN:  Concerns  that I think are  -- are

raised by reading the Confrontation  Clause as an original

matter before this Court's jurisprudence made all  hearsay

subject to the Confrontation Clause. 

          Now, we do not submit  that there is a practical

need  for the  Court  to revise  its  jurisprudence.   The

United  States   has  not   encountered  a   significantly

difficult burden in  admitting evidence under the  hearsay

rules under the Roberts approach as -- as it  has now been

articulated.  And we also acknowledge that the Court would

have to develop a jurisprudence to decide what testimonial

statements  means,  if  the Court  adopts  the testimonial

approach.

          What we do submit is  that the way in which  the

word  witness  against  is used  in  the  Sixth Amendment,

particularly when  read  in  light of  the  way  the  word

witness  is used in  the Fifth  Amendment and also  in the

Sixth Amendment's Compulsory Process Clause, that the word

witness  was  meant to  refer  to people  who  were giving

evidence for  purposes of a case, not to people who simply

happen to observe  facts in the world  and made statements

about them  and that are  now being  used as hearsay  in a

criminal trial.

          QUESTION:    Do  you  think  that  developing  a

jurisprudence  to  decide  what  constitutes   testimonial

statements  is  any  more  difficult   than  developing  a

jurisprudence to determine what are sufficient  indicia of

reliability  to overcome  the  text of  the  Confrontation

Clause?

          MR. DREEBEN:  No, Justice  Scalia.  I think they

both involve certain challenges.

          What  exists today  is a  body of  law  that has

examined  the  indicia of  reliability question,  and with

respect to certain statements in the testimonial category,

such as victim  statements to  the police  in a  condition

that might be likened to an excited utterance or sometimes

in statements in  aid of  medical diagnosis or  treatment,

and also true  statements against penal interests  such as

guilty pleas  by a defendant  that does not  implicate the

defendant  on  trial  but  simply  acknowledges   criminal

conduct,  the  lower  courts  have  concluded  that  those

statements do have sufficient indicia of reliability to be

admitted.

          And our concern  is that if  this Court were  to

adopt the testimonial approach, that it not do so in a way

that would foreclose lower courts from taking advantage of

evidence  that  is  reliable,   unavailable  from  another

source,  important  in  criminal  prosecutions  and  well-

grounded  in the theory  of the Confrontation  Clause as a

vehicle for achieving truth in criminal trials.

          QUESTION:  Why unavailable  from another source?

Let's  say  you  have  this  --   this  self-incriminating

confession, but  the person is  available.  You  could put

him on the stand to  test whether that confession that  he

made was true or false.  Why  -- where do you -- where  do

you  pull this requirement that --  that he be unavailable

from?    If indeed  it  doesn't violate  the Confrontation

Clause  because  it's sufficiently  reliable, why  does he

have to be unavailable? 

          MR. DREEBEN:  Our position  is that with respect

to testimonial statements, the preference  is to get live,

in-court  testimony  with  all of  the  benefits  that the

Confrontation Clause envisioned for testimony.

          But sometimes  a defendant who pleads  guilty is

still  awaiting  sentencing,  and as  this  Court  held in

Mitchell v. United States, the defendant still has a Fifth

Amendment privilege and  can refuse to testify  on grounds

of privilege.   Other defendants who plead guilty in their

own cases will sometimes refuse to testify even on pain of

contempt,  and at that  point the choice  for the judicial

system is either admitting that's  -- that evidence in the

criminal trial or  excluding it  altogether and risking  a

manifest  failure  of  justice  because  there  isn't  the

evidence. 

          And  I  think  it's  important  to   distinguish

between those kinds of statements, the excited utterances,

911  calls, true statements  against penal  interests that

implicate only one --

          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.

          MR. DREEBEN:  Thank you --

          QUESTION:  Mr. Sherman, we'll hear from you.

            ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN C. SHERMAN

                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

          MR. SHERMAN:   Mr. Chief Justice, may  it please

the Court:

          The State of  Washington is asking the  Court to

-- I  guess, to  simply  say --  excuse me  -- retain  the

reliability framework of Ohio v. Roberts.  Excuse me.

          The  --  the  primary part  of  Ohio  v. Roberts

that's important to  the State is the  reliability factor,

and the reason  that -- that  that's important is  because

essentially  Ohio v.  Roberts  recognizes that  there  are

other rights  and interests at  stake in a  criminal trial

other  than  the  defendant's confrontation  rights.   For

example,  it recognizes  that society  as  a whole  has an

interest  in seeing  that  criminal  activity is  properly

addressed. 

          QUESTION:  We could have  written it that way, I

suppose.    I mean,  the  Confrontation Clause  instead of

saying  in all  criminal prosecutions,  the accused  shall

enjoy  the  right  to  be  confronted with  the  witnesses

against  him, we could have added, comma, unless there are

other considerations. 

          MR. SHERMAN:  That's correct --

          QUESTION:   It doesn't say that.  It says in all

criminal prosecutions,  the accused shall enjoy  the right

to be confronted with the witnesses against him.

          MR.  SHERMAN:    That  -- that's  correct,  Your

Honor.  And when I --

          QUESTION:  Where  -- I mean, I  don't understand

where we derive this permissibility of not allowing him to

confront the witnesses against him  so long as we come  to

the judgment that the evidence is inherently reliable.

          MR.  SHERMAN:    Well, Your  Honor,  I  guess to

answer that question properly, I  -- I'll speak to what  I

at least  read and heard actually petitioner had in one of

the amici briefs concerning the -- the history surrounding

the Confrontation  Clause and how we got to have the right

to confrontation.   And essentially  what I  -- I  gleaned

from that is there, at a point in time, was not a right to

confrontation, and over the course of centuries, the right

developed.  But it appears  to me that it developed  based

-- developed  based upon  really what  public policy  was,

that the -- the society would not  tolerate the inequities

of  the  systems  that were  in  place  that  were denying

confrontation and felt that it was  fair that this concept

of confrontation take place.

          So when the  -- the Framers of  the Constitution

put that right into the Bill of Rights, it was based upon,

in my view,  their perception that the  public policy that

their society  at that time  wanted to recognize  and make

everyone  know  that they're  retaining  that to  be their

right. 

          I don't think, though, that it  would rationally

follow that  -- that  they intended  that everything  that

they said be written in stone and --

          QUESTION:  No.  That may be --

          QUESTION:   It  could be amended.   It  could be

amended.  I mean, you know, there's an amendment provision

in the  Constitution, but -- but until it's amended, it --

it does seem to say that in all criminal prosecutions, you

-- you have the right to be confronted.

          MR. SHERMAN:  And I would agree.  And in fact, I

-- I  think one of the points that --  that I -- I want to

make is that a literal interpretation of the Confrontation

Clause bars the petitioner's proposal  and the proposal of

amici  and the  proposal  of  the  State to  maintain  the

Roberts framework.

          QUESTION:  Why?

          MR.  SHERMAN:     If  you  take   literally  the

Confrontation Clause, I believe that it --

          QUESTION:      It   says   witnesses,   confront

witnesses.   A witness  is a  person who  testifies and  I

don't see any literal problem there.

          MR. SHERMAN:  I --  I believe that everyone that

comes and sits on the witness stand and says anything that

is going to be used --

          QUESTION:    A  typical case  that  --  where it

should come in, but I guess under their proposal it would,

and under  the status quo it probably wouldn't.  We have a

case  of  drug conspiracy.    During the  conspiracy, well

before anybody  is caught, they discover, through whatever

means,  that there's a  cup on  the mantel, a  pewter cup,

that's filled with drugs.  Who does it belong to?  Does it

belong to  the defendant?  We have a witness who overheard

the defendant's  wife shout  out from  the kitchen,  Dink,

have you got  your pewter cup?   It's on the mantel.   All

right?  Does that come in or not come in?  Whether it does

or not, it's not a Confrontation Clause question.

          You  say  that  we  should   make  that  into  a

constitutional  question.     We   should  have   all  the

constitutional courts going into it or not?

          MR. SHERMAN:  Well, I -- I respectfully disagree

with Your Honor --

          QUESTION:  Why? 

          MR. SHERMAN:   -- that it's not  a Confrontation

Clause question. 

          QUESTION:  All right.  You say  it is.  In other

words, every time  that a -- that a -- a  trial in any one

of 50 million trials in the United States decides to admit

some hearsay,  in principle, you  go into  habeas and  the

Federal judge  has to decide whether that hearsay is or is

not,  quote,  reliable,  end quote,  for  purposes  of the

Confrontation Clause.  That's the present system.

          So you're the prosecuting attorney.  Correct? 

          MR. SHERMAN:  Correct. 

          QUESTION:   You  have experience  in  this area.

Tell me if this is right. 

          What I would  expect to have happen  is that all

these habeas courts,  when they get real  hearsay, nothing

to  do with the trial, you know,  real hearsay like I just

talked to you about, they'll find it reliable if the -- if

the -- if the State court admitted it. 

          Then, however, they get  to this kind of  a case

where  the   police  were   actually  there   writing  out

affidavits  which they're  going to  introduce, and  there

what they'll say is, no, it's not reliable. 

          So in  order to  make the  Roberts system  work,

what  will  happen is  you  have  to  have  two  ideas  of

reliability.   Now, has that been  a problem or am  I just

making  that  up?   Because  what  they're  saying is  the

Roberts thing makes no sense.   If you take it  seriously,

it keeps out  stuff that  should come  in and  it lets  in

stuff that  should stay  out.  And  if you  don't take  it

seriously,  which  is  what must  have  happened,  it just

produces a mess.

          MR. SHERMAN:   To address the first part of your

question,  Your  Honor,  I  believe  what  I  was  --  was

attempting  to  say  was  that  the Confrontation  Clause,

strictly interpreted, it is  going to not let  any hearsay

of any kind in.  Yes, that is my position.

          QUESTION:   You  mean the  -- the  only kind  of

evidence that can become -- come in at a criminal trial is

from a witness who's physically present in the courtroom.

          MR. SHERMAN:   I believe  that that  would be  a

strict interpretation  of the  Confrontation Clause,  Your

Honor. 

          To  answer  the  second  part   of  --  of  your

question -- 

          QUESTION:  From your own  experience.  I'm quite

interested  actually, if  -- if  you followed  what I  was

saying.

          MR. SHERMAN:  Well, actually --

          QUESTION:   You work  in this area  and I'd like

you --

          MR. SHERMAN:  I do and --  and I can say from my

experience,  I  have  had  very  few problems  arise  with

Confrontation   Clause   principles   under   the  Roberts

framework.  And -- and as a matter of fact, in 12 years of

practice, this  is the first time  I've ever seen  -- I've

seen an interlocking confession come up. 

          But I think that the reason that --

          QUESTION:  Do you think this was interlocking?

          MR. SHERMAN:  I do, Your Honor. 

          QUESTION:   Well, they certainly  differed on  a

key element.  I'm not sure it would come in under Roberts.

          MR. SHERMAN:   And, Your  Honor, I --  I believe

that the court of appeals  also, at least the majority  of

that court, believed  that there was a  difference between

what the -- Mr. and Mrs. Crawford were saying, but the  --

our supreme court  looked more  closely at the  statements

and observed that in fact they were saying the same thing.

          QUESTION:  Wasn't  the whole point  of admitting

it that  -- that she had,  in effect, said there  -- there

was no weapon, the victim was not taking a weapon out, and

that was on the basis of her statement the prosecutor made

exactly that argument?  Wasn't that why it came in?

          MR. SHERMAN:  No, not  specifically that -- that

she said that he wasn't taking one out because clearly she

didn't say that.  And if in fact that was the --

          QUESTION:  Well, her description did not include

one.  And -- and wasn't that the basis of the prosecutor's

argument, that this wasn't self-defense?

          MR.  SHERMAN:  In  part, and  -- and --  but his

description did not include a -- a weapon either.  Both of

their descriptions --

          QUESTION:    No,  but  the  implication  of  his

description was that  he reasonably thought something  was

coming out and he then in one of his  statements said, you

know, it was him or me.   And the reason her statement was

admitted was  that it  was not congruent  with that,  that

there was no indication in her statement that a --  that a

-- a weapon was being withdrawn.  So at the -- I  -- isn't

--  isn't that  the  reason that  the  statement, for  the

purpose it was admitted, was not interlocking? 

          MR.  SHERMAN:    I believe  that  that  was that

prosecutor's interpretation  of -- of  that evidence,  and

that is in fact what he argued  at trial.  I think he  was

incorrect.  I think that if  you look at the statement, it

very -- Sylvia Crawford very clearly says that -- that the

victim appeared that he was  reaching for something in his

pocket.

          QUESTION:  After the assault.

          MR. SHERMAN:  No, Your Honor, I respectfully --

          QUESTION:  Why don't  we look at this since  the

testimony is there?  I read it that way.

          MR. SHERMAN:    And --  and,  Your Honor,  as  I

indicated, so did  apparently my deputy prosecutor  and so

did our court  of appeals.  Our --  our supreme court read

it as -- as I am.

          QUESTION:  But one of the worrisome things about

treating all these  things as just hearsay reliability.  I

don't  understand how this  testimony comes in.   When the

woman testified  -- when the woman said in her statement I

was drunk,  I closed my eyes,  how could that  possibly be

reliable?

          MR. SHERMAN:   Well, she  did say those  things,

but she  also said things that indicated that that was not

quite  --  quite correct.    She also  said,  well, I  saw

certain things going.   I saw Michael stab  the victim.  I

saw the victim doing these --

          QUESTION:   But she  said at  that time  she had

been  drinking and she  -- that  happened before.   I just

don't  understand  this   reliability  test  that   allows

something to come  in that doesn't coincide with  what the

defendant himself said, and that  the declarant is saying,

oh, I was scared.  I closed my eyes.

          MR. SHERMAN:  Well, and -- and I understand Your

Honor's question and -- and  position.  One of the  things

that obviously  you can't  get out  of the  flat piece  of

paper is -- is what her true  condition was, and that is a

problem.   But I don't recall her saying specifically that

she was drunk at the --  at the time, merely that she  had

been  drinking  and she  indicated  that Michael  had been

drinking as well.  But I don't know that --

          QUESTION:   She did say  that she shut  her eyes

and didn't really watch.  Those were her words.  I shut my

eyes and didn't really watch.  How could such testimony be

reliable?

          MR. SHERMAN:  Well,  because she at the  same --

in the  same breath  was able to  accurately describe  the

same events that Michael had described in his statement. 

          QUESTION:  But  that's unreliable.  I  mean, you

have a witness who says two -- two opposite things.  I saw

this, and on the other hand, I shut my eyes.

          MR.  SHERMAN:    And --  and  I  understand Your

Honor's  position  on  that.   I  --  I  just respectfully

disagree.   I don't think that those factors by themselves

necessarily render it to be unreliable.

          QUESTION:  May I ask --

          QUESTION:     But   suppose  we   said  it   was

unreliable.  Let's suppose we held that.  And in this case

it goes out.  All right.  Now, so we've had a pretty tough

standard in  your view of what counts as reliable and not.

It's been  a pretty tough standard.   It has to  be really

reliable. 

          MR. SHERMAN:  Right.

          QUESTION:  Okay.   Now,  what's going to  happen

when the  courts, the Federal courts or  the State courts,

apply  that  tough  standard  of  reliability  to  hearsay

statements  that have to  do with  the -- involved  in the

commissions of the crime itself?   In other words, not  --

not when they're in the police station giving confessions,

but like the example I gave you with the cup. 

          Now,  suppose we  apply  the tough  standard  of

reliability  to  those.   Would  that  make  a difference?

Would they  then start to be kept out because they violate

the Confrontation Clause?

          MR. SHERMAN:  I think  at -- at a certain  point

the tougher you make the standards for hearsay to come in,

the fewer pieces of hearsay that are  going to come in.  I

don't think  that that's  necessary in  this case  because

what -- if --  if we're simply talking about  interlocking

confessions and whether such a thing exists and if they --

as  the question presents,  if there  will ever be  such a

thing as a confession that sufficiently interlocks so that

it will be  sufficiently reliable to  be admitted or  not,

the Court  could simply say there's just never going to be

a situation that comes before us where they will interlock

sufficiently and -- and be admittable -- admitted. 

          QUESTION:    Mr. Sherman,  on  this  question of

interlock, I know  we've referred  to interlock in  Bruton

cases where they've got joint trials of the defendants and

that sort of  thing.  What is the  strongest case you have

for  the  proposition  that  absent  a  joint  trial,  the

interlocking  nature of a confession --  or a statement is

critical?

          MR. SHERMAN:    I think  it would  be this  case

that's before the Court today, Your Honor. 

          QUESTION:  I  see.   So none  of our  precedents

support that proposition.

          MR. SHERMAN:   I  think actually  the only  time

this  Court  has  addressed the  interlock  theory  on its

merits --

          QUESTION:  Is in the Bruton-type --

          MR. SHERMAN:   -- was in Lee v. Illinois when it

was simply the  issue of  the interlocking confession  and

there wasn't  any side issues of co-defendants in the same

trial or any of those other issues.

          QUESTION:   But  -- but  we  have said  in other

cases that the reliability, which -- which Roberts insists

upon, has to be established from the statement itself  and

not from other statements.  Right?

          QUESTION:     Which   would   seem  to   exclude

interlock --

          QUESTION:  Interlocking confessions.  That's the

problem I have with it.  We -- we haven't had such a case,

but the standard  that we expressed in  Roberts would seem

to   exclude  interlocking  confessions   as  establishing

reliability.

          MR. SHERMAN:  And if Roberts were the  only case

that -- that the Court were to look at, that I think would

--  I would agree that  would be the case.   But in Lee v.

Illinois,  I  think this  Court  very clearly  accepted --

interpreted the concept  of interlocking confessions,  and

thereafter in  Cruz v. New  York.   But in Lee,  the Court

actually  set  forth a  test  to be  used  -- at  least in

Earnest v. New Mexico, the Court called it a test -- but a

test  to  be  used  in  determining when  an  interlocking

confession can be admitted.  Now, that followed Roberts.

          QUESTION:   But wasn't  that a  joint trial?   I

can't remember for sure. 

          MR.  SHERMAN:   I don't  believe that Lee  was a

joint trial, Your Honor.  In fact, I think in -- Lee was a

case in  which the Court -- this Court determined that the

confessions did  not sufficiently  interlock to  make them

reliable to be admitted, and also there was --

          QUESTION:      I   thought  Lee   involved   co-

defendants. 

          MR. SHERMAN:   Well, I --  I believe there  -- I

don't  --  I  don't recall  there  being  co-defendants at

trial, and  I may be mistaken about that.  My recollection

is that the  -- the two holdings of Lee were, one, that --

that they couldn't be corroborated  by other evidence; and

two,  that  the  confessions simply  weren't  sufficiently

interlocking.  And I may be  mistaken.  I just -- I'm  not

recalling there being co-defendants tried at the same time

in that particular case. 

          But my  point being  that Lee,  of course,  came

after Roberts  and, in my mind, established a third way of

--  third form of  -- of determining  reliability that was

separate  from what  was  in Roberts.    Roberts had  your

indicia  of  reliability  and  your  well-founded  hearsay

exception, and  then in Lee  it's my perception  that this

Court formed  a third  test, that  being the  interlocking

confession rule test, and that --

          QUESTION:   But the  bottom line was  that it --

that  that test was not met in the case, that there wasn't

a sufficient interlock.

          MR. SHERMAN:  That -- that wasn't met in the Lee

case, and that was the decision of the court of appeals in

this  case.  And  it was  our supreme court  that reversed

that and said,  no, we believe that  they did sufficiently

interlock.

          QUESTION:   I thought that  what we said  in Lee

was simply that  assuming that an interlocking  confession

exception exists, this  didn't meet it.  I -- I don't know

that we --  that -- that we spoke as though there was such

an exception.   We just said  assuming it does  exist, the

facts here don't --  don't meet it.   Isn't that what  the

case held?

          MR. SHERMAN:  I think perhaps.  I -- I know that

in  the  very  least the  Washington  State  Supreme Court

interpreted it to be a test, and I know that in Earnest v.

New Mexico, this  Court called it  a test for  determining

when interlocking confessions  can come in.  So  taking it

from both of those cases,  the Washington Supreme Court in

the very least determined that it was a test, and in fact,

in I believe  it's State v.  Rice said  we adopt this  new

test  from --  from  Lee v.  Illinois  as to  interlocking

confessions.

          QUESTION:   I thought actually  that there  were

five members of the  Court in Lee v. Illinois  to say that

confessions of a co-defendant are presumptively unreliable

for purposes of Roberts.

          MR. SHERMAN:  Correct, Your Honor. 

          QUESTION:   And that  even  if there  was a  so-

called interlocking confession exception, it wasn't met in

that case. 

          MR. SHERMAN:  And  -- and I can understand  that

interpretation.   I -- it just --  I'm -- I'm certain that

it's not  the  interpretation that  the  Washington  State

Supreme Court made, and in fact, most courts --

          QUESTION:  Well, maybe they better re-read it.

          (Laughter.) 

          MR.  SHERMAN:   That's  entirely possible,  Your

Honor, and I'm certain that after today, they will -- they

will do so. 

          (Laughter.) 

          MR. SHERMAN:  The  point -- but the  point being

that if there is not an interlocking confession rule, then

there is not.  If this  Court says we -- there will  never

be  a  situation  where   one  co-defendant's  confession,

regardless of how identical it is to the defendant's, will

ever be reliable  enough, then so be it.   Then we'll have

that test.   It will be straightforward and can be applied

accordingly.

          That,  in  all  candor,  is  the lesser  of  the

State's concerns in  this coming  -- in  this case  coming

before  this Court today, the primary concern of the State

actually  being that  this  Court  retain the  reliability

standard  of --  of  State --  of Ohio  v.  Roberts for  a

variety  of  reasons  that  relate  essentially to,  as  I

indicated earlier, this  underlying recognition that there

are  simply  other  interests  at  stake  other  than  the

defendant's that really need to be addressed.

          QUESTION:  Why  should the Court retain  it when

this very case gives us  an example of how arbitrary  that

determination is made whether it's reliable?  When a court

can call  something --  a witness  -- a  declarant in  the

shape this one was and say that's reliable, shouldn't that

make us worry about using that test?

          MR. SHERMAN:  Well, I  have to say that I  don't

think this Court  or any court can make a test that is not

going  to  have  some  problems,  and in  fact,  both  the

petitioner and  the learned  professors  admit that  their

system have  -- has problems too.   Any system is going to

have problems.   The bugs are going  to have to  be worked

out.  It'll take years of -- of cases,  and the -- and the

reality is -- and I, of course, mean no disrespect to  any

judge --  anytime you  get --  you have  a judge making  a

discretionary decision, on  the same set of  facts there's

simply going  to be  some judges  that  will make  exactly

opposite  decisions  based  upon the  same  set  of facts.

That's just human nature.

          In this case -- and the point that I'm trying to

make is that  Ohio v. Roberts is a known  quantity, it's a

known entity.  I haven't experienced any problems with its

application  personally   or  in  cases  that   have  been

addressed at  my  office since  I've been  there.   A  new

system that is  proposed by the  petitioner and the  amici

simply fails to take into consideration, as this Court did

in Ohio  v. Roberts, that there are other rights and other

interests  that are  involved  in  a  criminal case.    It

doesn't address problems  concerning witnesses that become

unavailable  through no  fault  of the  State.   Yet,  why

should  society  suffer  to   have  a  criminal  defendant

released simply because a witness has become unavailable?

          And you know, you can't always prove a defendant

has made  a witness unavailable.   That is a  really tough

standard.

          There are similar other cases where particularly

young witnesses, who are perfectly  capable of telling you

exactly what  happened to them or  what they've seen  in a

nonconfrontational  setting, but  yet,  because of  either

fear or intimidation,  they are simply unable to come into

court and testify in front  of a bunch of strangers or  in

--  probably in front of the very person who is alleged to

have victimized them.  They're not going to be able to say

a thing.  Yet, there needs to be some way to get what they

can say in front of a jury.  I -- I think that any  system

that prohibits  that is just going  to be contrary  to the

interests of  society in general  and to the  interests of

the other parties that --  that are involved in the  trial

other than the defendant. 

          And if there are no further questions, thank you

very much. 

          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Sherman.

          Mr. Fisher, you have 3 minutes remaining.

          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

          MR. FISHER:  Thank you, Your Honor. 

          I  think   it's  important  to   concentrate  in

rebuttal  on  the  State's  suggestion  and the  Solicitor

General's suggestion  to retain the  reliability prong  of

the Roberts framework.

          The Solicitor  General agrees  with us that  the

history of the -- that -- that  you ought to be looking to

history here,  and the  history on  this point  is crystal

clear.  From Rex v. -- Rex v. Paine in 1696, other English

cases before the Constitution, and then this Court's cases

after the Constitution was adopted, principally Kirby  and

Mattox, and all the way  through Douglas, the -- when  the

situation arose that  a witness was unavailable,  the rule

was  clear  if  the  --   if  --  if  the  statement   was

testimonial,  given  to  the  authorities,  it had  to  be

excluded.  And it's not -- and  the -- and the balance was

struck  by the Framers  not --  not just because  of these

public policy  considerations, but because of  the Framers

were  insisting  upon  an  adversarial  method  of  giving

testimony.  And  when the Framers  decided, when that  was

not  present, that we  were simply  not prepared to  -- to

admit the testimony. 

          And so  what we  have is  we have  a clear  rule

until at least the 1970's that reliability doesn't matter.

And the only time reliability -- first was adopted by this

Court.  The only time it became important was in Dutton v.

Evans when you  had a non-testimonial statement,  and then

in Roberts  when this  Court created  a general  framework

that it allowed reliability, all of a sudden, be into play

when we were  stretching the  Confrontation Clause in  our

view too far. 

          But once you bring the Confrontation Clause back

to the proper  scope, as we're  asking you  to do and  the

Solicitor  General is asking you to  do, there's really no

reason anymore to -- to  keep the reliability prong.   The

reliability prong was -- was adopted by this Court to deal

with the  problem of hearsay  that was coming  outside the

testimonial type setting.  Once you -- once you read it --

read  that  problem  away,  we're  back  to  the  original

understanding of the Confrontation Clause. 

          And the reason that you ought to stick with that

-- Justice Ginsburg I think put the nail on the  head when

she said the reason we're here today is that you have a --

you --  you have --  what you have  now is a  system where

trial judges can  reach almost  any conclusion they  want.

That's shown in our briefs.  The Solicitor General doesn't

even  describe  to  you how  reliability  --  doesn't even

defend reliability findings  in light of all  the briefing

by -- by the petitioner and by amici.

          And so I think that  when you look at that,  you

show that the very concern that gave rise to Raleigh trial

--  and I would  say parenthetically  that I  believe Lord

Cobham was  unavailable in  the trial.    That's what  the

transcript  says.   And  the very  problem was  that trial

judges  could do these reliability determinations in place

of -- of a clear rule of when testimony could be given.

          Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Fisher.

          The case is submitted.

          (Whereupon,  at  11:56  a.m.,  the  case in  the

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
