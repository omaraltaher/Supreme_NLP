 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH
 

1
2
3
4  first this morning in Case 10-209, Lafler v. Cooper.
5
6
7
8
9  and may it please the Court:

10
11  press this morning regarding deficient plea advice. 
12  First, this Court has consistently limited the effective 
13  assistance right to ensuring the reliability of the 
14  proceedings where a defendant is adjudicated guilty and 
sentenced.  Mere outcome is not the Strickland prejudice 
15
16  standard. 
17
18  assistance claim, the defendant --
19
20
21  reliability of the proceedings.  How does that fit with 
22  Kimmelman, where we said it, the right to effective 
23  assistance, does attach to suppression hearings, 
24  obviously where evidence would not make the proceedings 
25

the first?  You say mere outcome is not enough, 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could I -- can I stop you on 

 Second, when asserting an ineffective 

more reliable? 

3
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. BURSCH:  Justice Kagan, even in 

 The second point that I wanted to press this 

substantive or procedural right, and this Court has 
already held that a defendant has no right to a plea 
bargain. 

1
2  Kimmelman, the Court remanded back to the lower courts 
3  to determine whether there was prejudice, and the 
4  obvious implication was that if there was no prejudice 
on the fairness of the adjudicatory proceeding itself, 
5
6  there would be no Sixth Amendment violation. 
7
8  morning was that when asserting an ineffective 
9  assistance claim, a defendant must show deprivation of a 
10
11 
12 
13
14  plea advice creates intractable problems 
15
16
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, isn't there a 
17  right to make a critical decision on whether to accept 
18  or reject a plea bargain, once offered?  There's no 
19  right to demand one or to keep it, but isn't there a 
20
21
22  not guilty plea is an assertion of the defendant's 
23  constitutional rights.  It's invoking the right to trial 
24  that the Sixth Amendment contemplates.  And so this 
situation is really more like Fretwell.  It's not a 
25

right to make that kind of critical decision? 

 MR. BURSCH:  Justice Sotomayor, the -- the 

 Third, every possible remedy for deficient 

demonstrating the right --

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

or procedural constitutional right; and you have no 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose this were a death 
-- a death case, and roughly the same facts, failure --

1  decision that you have, for example, whether to have a 
2  jury or not to have a jury, or whether to have this 
3  attorney appointed for your counsel or not, because in 
4  each of those cases you have an underlying substantive 
5
6  right to a plea.  And so this fork in the road is really 
7  an illusory one, because you have no right to choose the 
8  other side of the fork. 
9
10
11  failure to communicate.  And that leaves me just one 
12  other question based on your opening remarks.  We can 
13  think about adjudication as having a constitutional 
14  violation, injury, and remedy.  Are you saying that 
15
16  injury, or was there a violation and an injury but just 
17  no remedy? 
18
19
20
21
 MR. BURSCH:  Yes, I'm saying that there's no 
22  violation, because in order to prove a Sixth Amendment 
23  violation, you have to demonstrate unreliability of the 
24  adjudicatory process.  I'm also saying that there's no 
25

reasonable remedy, and I'll talk about that in a minute. 

there was a violation in the abstract here but no 

 MR. BURSCH:  I'm saying --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So if you could do all of 

that, including the death penalty, I --

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

he had no constitutional right in it.  And so, really 
the remedy -- I'm sorry.  The severity of the sentence 
doesn't enter the analysis once you've established that 
there has been no violation. 

1
2  particular, I would refer this Court right back to the 
3  Fretwell decision, because there, too, defendant and his 
4  counsel had an opportunity to raise a Collins objection 
that would have changed the sentence to avoid the death 
5
6  penalty in that case.  Collins obviously was overruled 
7  before habeas process, and this Court held that the 
8  defendant could not use the vehicle of an ineffective 
9  assistance claim to regain that lost opportunity because 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When you say no violation, 
you don't mean that there was no ineffective assistance 
15
16  of counsel?  I thought that was conceded, that there was 
17  ineffective assistance. 
18
19  Ginsburg.  We have conceded for purposes of argument 
20
21  is a two-part test, and even after you get past the 
22  deficiency prong, there's still the question of whether 
23  this casts some doubt on the reliability of the 
24  proceedings.
25

that there was ineffective assistance.  But Strickland 

 MR. BURSCH:  That's correct, Justice 

Official 

 With respect to the death penalty in 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I thought that the 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Sounds like a good argument. 
 (Laughter.) 
 MR. BURSCH:  Well, the reason why it's wrong 

1  second part of the test asked about harm.  And here the 
2  person is sitting in prison for three times as long as 
3  he would have been sitting in prison had he had 
4  effective assistance of counsel at the plea bargaining 
stage.  So, why doesn't that just meet the requirements 
5
6  of Strickland, both deficiency and prejudice? 
7
 MR. BURSCH:  Well, that's actually the best 
8  argument that the Respondent has in this case.  And the 
9  reason --
10
11
12
13  is because this Court has been very careful to define 
14  what that harm is.  Specifically, the word was "outcome" 
15
16
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And outcome -- there is a 
17  different outcome here.  He's sitting in prison for 
18  three times as long.  That's a different outcome. 
19
20
21  process.  In fact, specifically, the language was 
22  whether absent the deficiency, the defendant -- I'm 
23  sorry.  Absent the deficiency, the factfinder would have 
24  had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.  And what we 
have here is a situation where everyone acknowledges --
25

in Cronic and Strickland.  If you --

 MR. BURSCH:  Yes, but the Court went on to 

define "outcome" to mean reliability of the adjudicatory 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

ineffective?  And if he is, we would find prejudice 

1
2  cases.  The sentencing cases, the determination of guilt 
3  is over, and the question is, is this person sitting in 
4  jail for 1 day longer because his counsel was 
5
6  there.  So, why isn't the same thing true here? 
7
8  that simple.  If there was some legal error, you know, 
9  an error to which he had a constitutional right, then 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17
18  understand that answer, because that answer seems to 
19  suggest that the -- that the assistance being provided 
20
21  notes, you've conceded that the assistance is 
22  ineffective.  That assistance has led to a much, much, 
23  much longer sentence.  You know, as opposed to some of 
24  the sentencing cases suggest that 24 hours is enough, 
25

certainly what you said is exactly true.  But if you're 
talking about more or less days because of, for example, 
a judge thinking that the -- the difference between 
crack and cocaine sentences was not appropriate or other 
things that are really up to the discretion of the trial 
court judge, Strickland says absolutely those things are 
not Sixth Amendment violations. 

was not ineffective.  But here, as Justice Ginsburg 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I guess I don't 

Official 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, take the sentencing 

 MR. BURSCH:  Well, I don't believe it's quite 

this is 10 years or something.  And, you know, that 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. BURSCH:  Well, let's try another 

a higher sentence, that's still not a Sixth Amendment 
violation. 

1  should be the end of the game, no? 
2
3  sentencing hypothetical, where it's clear that there was 
4  deficient performance.  Say that there's a local trial 
court judge and everyone knows that he has a certain 
5
6  predilection that if you like the local sports team, 
7  he's going to give you a break.  If the attorney comes 
8  in and he does not press the argument that this 
9  convicted defendant likes the local sports team, he gets 
10
11 
12
 Really, once you shift to sentencing, the 
13  question is, were you legally entitled to the result? 
14  And simply because he failed to appeal to the right 
discretionary tendencies of the trial court doesn't 
15
16  really make a difference.  Here we're talking, 
17  obviously, about the guilt phase, and it's much easier 
18  here because it says clearly in Strickland and Cronic 
19  and Kimmelman and many, many other cases that that 
outcome difference, the harm difference, has to be 
20
21  reliability of the process itself.  It's a process --
22
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You acknowledge, though, 
23  that it's ineffective assistance of counsel if you're --
24  well, no, I guess you haven't acknowledged.  Let me ask 
25

you:  Have you provided ineffective assistance of 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

that ineffective assistance of counsel? 

 MR. BURSCH:  Under the Court's first prong of 

deficient.  But the important thing is if it didn't have 
any effect on the subsequent trial and sentencing, then 
it would not be a Sixth Amendment violation. 

1  counsel if you are a lousy bargainer?  You're just no 
2  good at the -- you know, at -- I don't know -- the game 
3  of bargaining.  And so, you do a bad job in bargaining 
4  down the sentence, I mean a notoriously bad job.  Is 
5
6
7  Strickland, you would have to look at whatever the 
8  standards of professional practice were, and depending 
9  how lousy the bargainer was, it could or could not be 
10
11 
12 
13
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I don't even agree 
14  with the first part.  I don't think our legal process 
15
16
17  Bargaining is not what this is about, and that's why 
18  this Court has held in Weatherford and other cases that 
19  there is no right to the plea bargain itself.  And 
20
21
22  with that when 95 percent of the criminal cases are 
23  disposed of by way of bargaining? 
24
25

 MR. BURSCH:  Because in the 95 percent of 
cases that are disposed of that way, this Court has 

is -- is a bargaining game.  Shouldn't be. 

 MR. BURSCH:  Well, we could agree with that. 

that's really the second --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You can -- you can agree 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

is the conviction.  And this Court frequently 

1  already held in Padilla and Hill that there is a 
2  constitutional right to have effective counsel when 
3  you're accepting that plea.  And the difference is when 
4  you're accepting a plea, you're being convicted.  That 
5
6  establishes different tests when you're waiving a right, 
7  for example the right to go to trial, versus invoking a 
8  right, going to trial. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How can you talk about 
9
the reliability of a process or its fairness when you 
10
11  have an attorney who has fundamentally misgauged the 
12  law?  How can a trial be fair when the attorney is going 
13  into a trial thinking his client can't be convicted 
14  because the shots fired hit below the waist?
15
16
17  trial ever be fair? 
 MR. BURSCH:  Because there's no evidence 
18
19  here, not even a contention, that his belief had any 
20
21  proceeding.  And this Court has drawn a bright-line rule 
22  at trial.  You know, if you look at the preliminary 
23  hearing, if there's attorney error there, deficiency --
24
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but you skipped over 
a step.  I think we do assume that the deficient advice 
25

 MR. BURSCH:  Because --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, how can that kind of 

impact whatsoever on the fairness of the trial

 MR. BURSCH:  Well, I --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- your answer was a

Official 

 MR. BURSCH:  Right.  Again -- but that fork 

little too facile on that point. 
 MR. BURSCH:  I think --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We have to assume there's 

1  led to the -- the determination to plead not guilty. 
2
3  in the road is not one to which he has a substantive 
4  procedural right.
5
6  question -- that's the question we're confronting.  So, 
7  I think --
8
9
10
11
12
13  ineffective assistance of counsel in advising the client 
14  the nature of the charge for the -- so that the client 
15
16  guilty. 
17
18
19  this case, correct?
 MR. BURSCH:  Correct, we are assuming that. 
20
21  But what I would submit respectfully is that the plea 
22  stage isn't any different than a preliminary hearing or 
23  a line-up or a suppression hearing, where if there was 
24  some deficient attorney conduct, this Court would still 
then look to see whether it had an adverse impact on the 
25

 MR. BURSCH:  Right. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We have to assume that in 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company

Can he get relief? 

 MR. BURSCH:  Absolutely.  Under Hill and 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, explain why defective 

1  adjudication of guilt. 
2
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose the defective 
3  advice causes the defendant to enter a plea that he 
4  would not have entered if he had been properly advised. 
5
6
7  Padilla, this Court has said when you give up your right 
8  to trial, that's a very different situation and that 
9  there is a remedy for that.  And --
10
11  advice causing a plea, that qualifies, but defective 
12  advice causing defendant to turn down a plea --
13
14
15
16  between deciding to proceed with counsel, in which case 
17  there's -- there's no barrier to entry, or deciding to 
18  proceed without counsel, giving up the constitutional 
19  right.
20
21  not the difference at all.  It seems to me the 
22  difference is when you plead guilty you deprive yourself 
23  of the 24-karat test of fairness, which is trial by jury 
24  before nine people who have to find you guilty beyond a 
25

 MR. BURSCH:  It's just --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- does not?
 MR. BURSCH:  It's just like the difference 

reasonable doubt.  When you plead guilty, you give up 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, the difference -- that's 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 When you don't plead guilty, you get what is 

 MR. BURSCH:  That would be our position, 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I take it, then, Mr. Bursch, 

to entry.  It's only when you give up those rights. 

1  that. 
2
3  the best thing in our legal system.  You can't do any 
4  better than that.
 MR. BURSCH:  Justice Scalia, you said it much 
5
6  more artfully, but that's exactly the point I was trying 
7  to make with Justice Ginsburg, that when you invoke your 
8  constitutional right, your right to have an attorney, to 
9  go to a trial, to have a jury, we don't set up barriers 
10
11
12  you would have the same answer if the State had never 
13  provided counsel at all.  So long as -- if the plea 
14  negotiations were all done between the prosecutor and 
15
16  refused to provide the individual defendant with 
17  counsel, but so long as the person in the end decided, 
18  oh, I don't like this plea, I'll go to trial, then it's 
19  all fine and dandy under the Sixth Amendment?
20
21  because that's consistent with this Court's holding in 
22  Coleman and Wade and Kimmelman, that --
23
24  position in a capital case?
25

the individual defendant, and the -- and the State 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that would also be your 

 MR. BURSCH:  Yes.  Under Fretwell, this Court 

14

different --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right. 
 MR. BURSCH:  -- that you are entitled to 

1  held definitively that so long as the reliability of the 
2  adjudicatory process and sentence were intact, that the 
3  deficient advice didn't affect it, that the severity of 
4  the punishment was not legally relevant.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, your position is you're 
5
6  entitled to effective assistance of counsel before you 
7  plead guilty, but you're not entitled to effective 
8  assistance of counsel in evaluating plea offers? 
9
 MR. BURSCH:  I would say it slightly 
10
11
12
13  effective counsel at every critical stage; however, it 
14  is not a Sixth Amendment violation unless it casts doubt 
15
16
17  question:  Is it a violation in the abstract then, of 
18  damnum absque injuria? 
19
20
21
22  and Cronic cases, there is no damage, there's no Sixth 
23  Amendment violation, unless you can prove the prejudice. 
24
25

 MR. BURSCH:  I'm sorry.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Damage without injury. 
 MR. BURSCH:  No, because under the Strickland

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That gets back to my 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, all of this is 

theoretically interesting, and it may be that capital

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. BURSCH:  That's exactly right.  And let's 

error-free trial. 

1  cases are sui generis here.  But I thought the heart of 
2  your argument was that there just is no way to 
3  unscramble the eggs in this situation; there is no --
4  and that was your third point, and I understood it.
 MR. BURSCH:  Correct. 
5
6
 JUSTICE ALITO:  There is no remedy that can 
7  put the parties back into the position where they would 
8  have been had the error regarding the legal issue not 
9  occurred.
10
11  talk about the two remedies that are most frequently 
12  bandied about in the circuit courts.  The first is to 
13  order a new trial.  And to us, it makes no sense to 
14  order a second trial after you've already had a first 
15
16
 In addition, you think about these habeas 
17  cases; if you're issuing a habeas writ and vacating a 
18  sentence 8 or 9 years after the fact, like you are here, 
19  essentially you're releasing the defendant, because 
20
21  sparse.  And so, that's the natural effect of that. 
22
 And in Cooper's brief, he doesn't even 
23  advocate for a second trial; he asks for specific 
24  performance.  The problem with that is there you're 
infringing on the prosecutor's discretion, which is 
25

witnesses will die, they'll move away, memories will be

which is it has to be approved by a judge and all that 
stuff?  I don't see what's terribly difficult about 
that. 

1  sacred, to say what his plea offer is going to be.  And 
2  circumstances have changed once a trial has taken place. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, "sacred" is a 
3
4  little strong, don't you think?  I mean, it is a -- to 
some extent, unfair to the prosecutor because he knows 
5
6  already he's got a guilty verdict in his pocket, and he 
7  has to go back.  But why is it so terribly difficult to 
8  tell the defendant he has a right to accept that offer 
9  if he wants, but then go through the normal process, 
10
11 
12 
13
14  separation of powers.  But you bring up an important 
15
16  respects.  The first is that you learn more information. 
17  So, here, for example, the prosecutor learned that not 
18  only did Mr. Cooper shoot Kali Mundy, but he did it 
19  while she was screaming and running away from him. 
That's a changed circumstance.  He might not give the 
20
21  same plea.  Even more so in Frye, where they learned 
22  that he was picked for another criminal violation after 
23  the plea was given, and the prosecutor testified that he 
24  would have taken the plea back when he knew that.
25

 But the bigger changed circumstance is the

22  would have pled guilty for 50 years in jail, okay? 
23  That's my imaginary case.  I can think of one where 
24  there's prejudice.  He's dead.  All right?  So, what's 
25

haven't seen anything in any case which was other than 
case specific.  That is, this issue hasn't been decided 
before, not to my knowledge.  The language can be taken 
out of those cases, as you've very properly done.  And 
so, there's nothing that I could find in the cases. 
Nothing in the Sixth Amendment itself.  In 95 percent of 
the cases, they do plead guilty.  And what's the problem 
about ordering the prosecution to simply repeat the 
offer he gave before? 

 Well, I mean, I don't really see if there --

the yardstick by which ineffective assistance of --

1  amendment, not in -- not a holding, et cetera?
 
2
 MR. JAY:  Well, I think that -- let me
 
3  address that capital hypothetical that has come up
 
4  several times.  And I think that it's instructive,
 
5
6  and look at what remedy they order when there has been 
7  ineffective assistance that shakes the reviewing court's 
8  confidence in the proceeding that produced it.  They 
9  order a new proceeding.  They don't order a specific 
10
11 
12
13  stop you there because I don't understand it.  The 
14  suggestion is -- I'm not taking this case; I'm making up 
a hypothetical since we're discussing it really based on 
15
16  the next case.  The defendant never heard the offer, 
17  never heard it.  It is crystal clear that if he'd heard 
18  it, he would have accepted it.  Okay?  I'm trying to 
19  separate out difficulties of this case, which strikes me 
as difficult because of the facts, from the principle. 
20
21  And what I want you to do is to tell me why I shouldn't 
22  accept the principle, and then we can worry about what's 
23  a clear case. 
24
25

 MR. JAY:  But I think the principle, 

Justice Breyer, is that you look at what the -- you look

offer.  That's my hypothetical. 

produced?  If the defendant can show, for example, that 

1  at what it is the Court's being asked to set aside. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Death.  Let's say death. 
2
3
 MR. JAY:  Right.  So, in this case, you look 
4  at the death sentence.  How was that death sentence 
5
6  he got bad advice about the plea --
7
 JUSTICE BREYER:  He shows that never did he 
8  ever become aware, because his lawyer was sleeping and 
9  moved on vacation and never told him about the plea 
10
11
 MR. JAY:  I think that's actually an easier 
12  hypothetical than the bad advice because you could show 
13  that if the lawyer then gets -- stands up and does a 
14  bang-up job at trial, right -- the defendant is 
15
16  any prejudicial effect on the trial.  That means that no 
17  other lawyer doing a better job could have gotten the --
18  could even show a reasonable probability that a 
19  different verdict would ensue.

22  capital murder conviction. 
23
24  is different.  And did you think it is inconceivable

convicted of capital murder.  The defendant can't show

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  If you don't 

 MR. JAY:  I'm happy to do the capital case, 

1  such as a rule requiring that, in a capital case, any 
2  offer of a noncapital sentence as part of a plea bargain 
3  actually be waived by the defendant in court so that 
4  this doesn't come up?  This is not a capital case.
5
6  think that it certainly --
7
8  want to do the capital case?  I'm still trying to get to 
9  the principle.
10
11  Justice Breyer. 
12
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'll change my hypothetical 
13  and say all that happened was that this perfect trial, 
14  because of mandatory sentencing rules, led him to prison 
15
16  would have given him 2 years.  Now, he is in prison for 
17  48 years more, and I consider that that's at least 
18  harmful to him.  So, where the amendment doesn't speak 
19  of it, where the misbehavior of the lawyer is crystal 
clear, where it's 48 years more in prison, what is it 
20
21  that bars what seems to me obvious that an inadequate 
22  assistance of counsel, remedial through a specific 
23  decree saying reinstitute the offer, led to enormous 
24  unfairness and prejudice?
25

for 50 years, as compared with a plea bargain which 

 MR. JAY:  Two points, Justice Breyer.  I'm --

22
 

Alderson Reporting Company

this defendant entitled, had this -- to a lesser 

case, Fretwell would have come out the other way. 

1  and I want to make sure that I get out my answer to your 
2  capital hypothetical, because you don't look just at 
3  whether the sentence that resulted was worse than the 
4  sentence that could have resulted.  If that were the 
5
6  That's death if -- with no objection made, life sentence 
7  if the objection had been made.  So, it's not an 
8  outcome -- it's not a narrow comparison of outcomes. 
9  What you look at is how the sentence was produced.  Is 
10
11  sentence? 
12
13  lawyer at sentencing, is there even a reasonable 
14  probability that the -- that that lawyer, through a 
different strategy for identifying a legal error --
15
16
17  the assertion that Justice Breyer made that this was 
18  unfair.  This man deserved to get the sentence he got, 
19  didn't he?  He had a full and fair trial.  A jury of 12 
20
21  determined that he deserved that sentence.  How could it 
22  be unfair to give him the sentence that he deserved?

 MR. BURSCH:  Yes, that's correct.  In every

 MR. JAY:  And in those cases, Justice Breyer, 

sentencing.  That may well have been the same bad 

the Sixth Amendment entitles that person to a new 
proceeding.  The Sixth Amendment never entitles the 
person to have a court order a particular sentence. 
 And you can't use the prosecutor's offer 

1  people don't get the sentence that they deserve because, 
2  for example, the lawyer was inadequate.  I mean --
3
4  you show that the lawyer had a bad strategy at 
5
6  strategy that led the lawyer to recommend a not guilty 
7  plea.  Let's go to trial on my crazy strategy.  If he 
8  can show that and he can show that a better lawyer with 
9  a better strategy would produce a different result, then 
10
11 
12 
13
14  made at a different time as the benchmark and say, well, 
15
16  therefore, the prosecution must be forced to live with 
17  it now.  And that's because a plea offer rests on a 
18  number of considerations:  the need to obtain the 
19  defendant's cooperation in other cases; the desire to 
20
21  and, frankly, to avoid the risk of an acquittal.  And 
22  the prosecution in this case and in cases like this one, 
23  where there has been a reliable conviction and reliable 
24  sentencing, the prosecution has already incurred all of 
25

the prosecutor was okay with it at this other time; 

those burdens.  So, to look at the 51-month minimum

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Jay, you don't contest 

 MR. BURSCH:  We don't -- we don't think --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, because we've said that 

1  offer that was made 8 years ago and have that be the 
2  benchmark simply is not something that this Court has 
3  ever done in its Strickland cases.  And I think that 
4  it's revealing about the Respondent's --
5
6  that plea bargaining is a critical phase, entitling 
7  somebody to a lawyer and to an effective lawyer, do you? 
8
9  that's not part of our argument here.
10
11  many times; isn't that right? 
12
 MR. BURSCH:  Well, the Court -- let me be 
13  precise, Justice Kagan, because there are two things 
14  that the Court can be talking about.  There's the --
15
16  defendant, and that's where the Court has customarily 
17  used language like "critical stage," a confrontation 
18  between the defendant and the prosecution. 
19
private advice between the lawyer and the client, and 
20
21  we're not contesting that he has a right to have that 
22  advice be effective. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  What we have recognized, 
23
24  right, is that plea bargaining is a critical phase 
25

there's the -- the interaction between the State and the 

because about 98 percent of the action of the criminal 

 That's not what we have here.  This is about 

25

we've said.  Isn't that right? 

 MR. BURSCH:  Well, I don't think the Court 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, it's not a critical 
phase.  It's only a critical phase depending on the 

1  justice system occurs in plea bargaining.  And to
 
2  deprive somebody of a lawyer at that stage of the
 
3  process, where 98 percent of the action occurs, is
 
4  inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment.  That's what
 
5
6
7  has faced up -- faced this particular situation, Justice 
8  Kagan. 
9
10
11  outcome of what happens at that phase? 
12
13  that Mr. Cooper in this case had a right to receive 
14  effective advice about whether to enter this plea.  But 
15
16  because what --
17
18  critical phase before in our Sixth Amendment 
19  jurisprudence where the right to a lawyer depends upon 
20
21  where if one outcome results, there is no Sixth 
22  Amendment right, but if another outcome results there 
23  is? 
24
25

what has -- what happens during that critical phase, 

 MR. JAY:  Well, again, we don't think this is 

in any way crucial to deciding this case, but 

 MR. JAY:  We are -- we are assuming that --

we're -- our position is that he wasn't prejudiced

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it's correct, but is 
it enough?  Do you want us to write an opinion that plea 

1  Scott v. Illinois, Justice Kagan, is an example of that. 
2
3  couldn't it be said that what our cases hold is that 
4  pleading guilty is a critical phase?  Would that be 
5
6
 MR. JAY:  It certainly is correct that 
7  pleading -- that a guilty plea hearing, where the 
8  defendant --
9
10
11  negotiations are not a critical stage of the criminal 
12  process unless at the end of the day a guilty plea 
13  results?

is guilty and he wishes he had pleaded guilty sooner.

13  ineffective assistance of counsel claims is the State 
14  has to bear the burden of the unconstitutionality.  And 
so, that is a price that this Court has said the State

17  violation, because there is no perfect --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How can the judge -- the 
18
19  judge -- he knows what the plea -- let's say he knows 
what the plea bargain was, but he also knows that for 
20
21  one of the crimes, felon in possession, that alone, the 
22  sentencing range is 81 to 135.  So, without any --
23  considering anything that happened at trial, the judge 
24  knows that the plea bargain was for less than if the man 
25

had been charged with -- only with a felon in

 MS. NEWMAN:  Yes, that's accurate. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, it -- it seems most

 MS. NEWMAN:  No, I would disagree with that. 

plea bargain was an ordinary plea bargain.  This was not 
anything extraordinary.  It was very run of the mill. 
It was -- it was a run-of-the-mill case --

1  possession. 
2
3
4  unlikely that a judge would have accepted the plea 
5
6
7  This -- in this Court -- and I can represent to the 
8  Court, in my practice before this Court, which I have

14  true that the sentence range was 81 to 135 for a felon

18  So, the guidelines may have been high for the felon in 
19  possession offense, but, however, the judge -- in 
20
21  would not take discretion away from the judge.  So, in 
22  fashioning the remedy, in adopting the remedy of the 
23  Sixth Circuit if this Court were to do that, this case 
24  would go back before this same judge if he's still on 
the bench, and it would be -- would put people back --

1  Mr. Cooper would accept the plea, but the judge retains 
2  sentencing discretion. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  It wouldn't be a problem. 
3
4  The problem with Justice Alito's hypothetical, I take 
5
6  has to, for a reasonable time, extend the same offer. 
7  And then if it's accepted, you go to the judge.  The 
8  judge doesn't have to accept the plea. 
 MS. NEWMAN:  Right.  You can't find --
9
JUSTICE BREYER:  You can't make him do that. 
10
11  But I have a bigger problem with this case, which is --
12  which I may be the only one to have.  But as I've looked 
13  at it, I don't see ineffective assistance of counsel 
14  within the AEDPA meaning.  That is, you have two courts 
in the State which have said this is not ineffective. 
15
16  And as I look at it, it's somewhat ambiguous at best. 
17  And we have the Sixth Circuit saying it is.  Well, I 
18  know both sides agree, but I mean, both sides couldn't 
19  make us decide a case by saying there's a murder when in 
20
21
 I mean -- so, what am I supposed to do about 
22  that?  I find this a tough case.  I've read the record, 
23  and in my own opinion at this moment, perhaps no one 
24  else's, there is no ineffective assistance of counsel 
such that the Sixth Circuit could set that aside -- a 
25

fact it's not.

 What do I do? 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If Justice Breyer permits 

1  contrary finding of the State court. 
2
3
4  me to add an addendum to give the reasons why I might 
agree with him or a way of viewing this, as I read the 
5
6  lower court's decisions, they said there wasn't 
7  ineffectiveness because he was just trying to get a 
8  better deal. 
 And I think that, translating what he said, 
9
the very reasonable view by the court was the prosecutor 
10
11  may think of a lesser charge, because if this guy really 
12  wanted to kill this woman, he would have hit her head or 
13  her chest, but he aimed low.  So, he was really just 
14  angry and shooting enough so that if he hit her, okay, 
15
16  heinous intent to execute, you know, a gunshot to the 
17  brain.  And so, he was hoping to negotiate something 
18  better.  If that's -- Justice Breyer is shaking his 
19  head.  If that in fact -- if this is an AEDPA case, and 
we have to give deference to the State courts, doesn't 
20
21  that resolve this case?

 The court of appeals in Michigan also did 

1  to their finding.  There's no question under AEDPA 
2  there's -- there's deference.  And there's actually no 
3  question there's sort of a doubly deferential review, 
4  given the Strickland analysis.  However, the State 
courts did not decide this case on Sixth Amendment 
5
6  grounds.  So, there is nothing to give deference to. 
7  The State courts decided this, and the trial court said 
8  Mr. Cooper made his own choices.  That's not an 
9  ineffective assistance of counsel analysis.
10
11  not engage in a Sixth Amendment analysis.  They adopted 
12  the trial court and said that Mr. Cooper made his own 
13  choices.  So, there is -- and this claim was raised 
14  specifically on Sixth Amendment grounds from the very 
beginning of the appeal until it reached this Court. 
15
16  So, there is no AEDPA deference to give to the State 
17  courts' decisions.  There is no question as well that it 
18  was ineffective assistance, because the State court

 MS. NEWMAN:  It's a sentence recommendation, 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes -- well, which is

3  sentence, correct? 
4
5
6
7  he has discretion. 
 MS. NEWMAN:  Correct. 
8
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, is he allowed to 
9
take into consideration all that's happened before, not 
10
11  just with respect to guilt or innocence or the result of 
12  the trial, but in imposing the sentence or approving it? 
13
 MS. NEWMAN:  Well, he can take into account 
14  anything that he could have taken into account in the 
15
16
17  learned at trial, I take it.

22  accept this.  What happens then?  You have a new --
 MS. NEWMAN:  I would say that's not an

JUSTICE SCALIA:  We would have a new trial; 

1  back to the judge.  We agree with you, and we send it 
2  back to the judge.  We reinstate the offer, okay?  He 
3  accepts the offer.  It goes to the judge, and the judge 
4  says:  No, this is outrageous.  I'm not going to approve 
5
6
 What happens then? 
7
 MS. NEWMAN:  Well, in that case, the case 
8  would proceed under Michigan law.  In that case, the 
9  judge would say --
10
11  is that it? 
12
 MS. NEWMAN:  No.  I don't -- I think it would 
13  be perfectly acceptable to say a new trial is not -- not 
14  an appropriate remedy in this case, because he had a 
15

17  turns it down, then the prior trial is valid; is that 
18  right?

 MS. NEWMAN:  It would depend on the reasons 

why the judge would turn it down. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA.  Yes.  Yes, then the prior 

trial is okay?

 MS. NEWMAN:  It's not that it's okay, but I 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why?  Why?  I mean, 

why wouldn't the remedy be, as -- judging what you said 

 MS. NEWMAN:  Right. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And the judge has the 

1
2  think under imperfect circumstances, it's the result 
3  that we're seeking. 
4
5
6  before, is an order saying to the prosecution 
7  re-institute the plea bargain and give him whatever, a 
8  week or whatever it is?  Now, we imagine the defendant 
9  says I accept.  So, then they go to the judge, just as 
10
11
12
13  freedom to accept that or to reject it. 
14
 MS. NEWMAN:  Correct.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  If he rejects it, there is 
15
16  no plea agreement.  Now the defendant must plead.  He 
17  can plead guilty or not guilty.  And whatever flows from 
18  that, flows from it. 
19

21

23  just been found guilty by a jury of 12 with an entirely 
24  fair proceeding, or else he doesn't have a new trial.

 MS. NEWMAN:  That's a -- also a perfectly

 MS. NEWMAN:  Okay.  The --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You could do it.  You don't

7  under my suggestion, have a new trial, even though there 
8  was a trial that took place 2 years ago or whatever it 
9  is, correct?
10
11
12  the argument. 
13
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, if you're the 
14  defense counsel, the best thing for you to do is not 
communicate any plea offer you get, and then if your 
15
16  client is found guilty, then you can go back and say, 
17  oh, by the way, I didn't tell you about this, and he 
18  gets a whole new trial. 
19
20
21  very high bar, as this Court said in Padilla.  And it's 
22  not a bar that can often be met.  And so, you have to 
23  show under a Strickland analysis deficient performance 
24  and prejudice.  So --
25

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I don't know if that's 

 MS. NEWMAN:  No.  The -- the bar on habeas --

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't know that that's
 

 The trial turns out to be a disaster. 

1  going to be so --
2
3  performance --
4
going to be so hard to show.  Do you think it's feasible 
5
6  to draw a distinction between this case, where there was 
7  arguably inaccurate legal advice, and the case in which 
8  the defense attorney simply makes a terribly mistaken 
9  calculation about the chances of a favorable verdict at 
trial?  A favorable plea bargain is offered, caps the 
10
11  guy's possible sentence at, let's say, 3 years.  The 
12  defense attorney says:  We've got a great shot at an 
13  acquittal.  Let's go to trial.  I'm going to rip the 
14  prosecution's witnesses apart.
15
16  Convicted on all counts, 25 years.  Do you think that 
17  it's impossible for the rule that you want us to adopt 
18  here to be applied in that situation as well? 
19
20
21  courts on non-habeas review are very deferential to 
22  strategic decisions.  Almost anything that qualifies --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you say that.  But, 
23
24  as an administrative matter, I think we have to have 
25

difficult, because this Court on habeas review and State 

some concern that these plea negotiations and 

 MS. NEWMAN:  I think it would be much more 

40
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 We're going to have inquiries post hoc on 

1  discussions are in myriad circumstances.  The defense 
2  attorney is by the water cooler; the prosecutor walks by 
3  and says I'm thinking of offering you a good bargain in 
4  the Jones case.  He knows he's going to have that 
prosecutor in court the next day and really beat him. 
5
6  He thinks he's going to soften him up.  So, he doesn't 
7  communicate it to the client, and the prosecutor later 
8  says withdrawn. 
9
all of these negotiations and discussions.  And it seems 
10
11  to me that, absent some other rule, which I don't think 
12  we have the authority to impose, that all plea offers 
13  must be in writing and be stated with specificity, that 
14  if -- what you're proposing is simply unworkable.
 MS. NEWMAN:  I disagree, Your Honor.  We've 
15
16  had Hill -- we've had Strickland and Hill jurisprudence 
17  for three decades.  There's -- there was a floodgates 
18  argument when Hill was decided, that we're going to have 
19  all these people that the -- and we've had, since 
20
21  is a critical stage, and --
22
23  follow your rule; isn't that right?

McMann v. Richardson, this Court saying plea bargaining 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And most of the circuits 

 MS. NEWMAN:  Right.  We already have

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Go ahead.
 MS. NEWMAN:  Yes, we have unanimity in the 

1
2  opened. 
3
4
5
6  Federal circuits, and we have -- almost every State that 
7  has addressed this issue has addressed it in the same 
8  manner.  And so --
9
the remedy?  Here, the court said that the writ shall be 
10
11  granted conditioned on the State taking action to offer 
12  the 51-to-85-month plea.  So, that doesn't bind the 
13  judge, but it does bind the prosecutor. 
14
15
16  possibility of the prosecutor saying, I would have 
17  withdrawn that initial offer. 
18
19
remedy is -- is that the remedy that's uniform?  That 
20
21  the prosecutor has no discretion, only the judge does? 
 MS. NEWMAN:  Well, the remedies vary.  When I 
22
23  said "unanimity," I didn't mean every -- every court in 
24  every circuit does -- handles this exactly the same way. 
25

 MS. NEWMAN:  Correct. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, the prosecutor -- the 

 MS. NEWMAN:  Correct.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And it removes the 

Unanimity in the sense that every Federal circuit and

different factual circumstances, that there are a lot of 
variation in them, and to give a substantial amount of 
discretion to the lower courts to work out what the best 
remedy is, consistent with that factual variation. 

1  almost every State that has addressed this issue, and
 
2  they've addressed this issue for over 30 years, has
 
3  found that there is an -- there is a cognizable Sixth
 
4  Amendment violation that can be remedied on appeal.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And perhaps the lack of 
5
6  unanimity on the remedy question is appropriate.  I 
7  mean, people have been trying to suggest different 
8  remedies.  But perhaps one way to deal with the remedy 
9  question is to recognize that these cases present very 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  Strickland and Hill were decided. 
17
18  variation do you think justifies a categorically 
19  different remedy?  I mean, it seems to me some of the

24  certain fact situation could make one okay and the other 
25

 MS. NEWMAN:  Correct. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What factual -- I mean, give 

 MS. NEWMAN:  Absolutely.  And it's the same 

thing the courts have been doing, again, since

remedies are good and some are bad.

 MS. NEWMAN:  Well, even in the two cases 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  And why was that 

of counsel violation.  In my case and Mr. Cooper's 

 MS. NEWMAN:  -- rejected -- pardon?
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why was that okay there? 

1
2  before the Court today -- I mean, in Mr. Frye's, case he 
3  accepted a plea, and the State court ordered a new trial 
4  as the remedy for the -- for the ineffective assistance 
5
6  case --
7
8  okay there? 
9
10
11  What -- what factual circumstances made that okay there? 
12
 MS. NEWMAN:  Well, that just -- I don't know 
13  that the factual circumstances make it okay, but it was 
14  the remedy that the State -- I'm not sure I understand 
your question.  It was a remedy that the State ordered, 
15
16  and, in this case, it's just the remedy that was ordered 
17  by the Federal court was the remedy --
18
19  the -- where the defendant turns down -- where a plea is 
turned down and the defendant goes to trial.  Are there 
20
21  any facts in -- any facts that would make any remedy 
22  other than specific performance the correct remedy in 
23  that situation? 
24
25

 MS. NEWMAN:  These cases are so 

fact-specific, Your Honor, I don't want to evade the 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  You have a situation where 

44
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  You recommend -- you 

recommend specific performance as the remedy for your 

sense. 

 MS. NEWMAN:  That's correct. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  So, what I'm looking for is 

1  question about a hypothetical, but there's -- every case 
2  is so fact-specific that I think there's -- the 
3  possibility exists that a -- that the remedy would --
4
5
6  case, and I agree with you that is -- if there is to be 
7  a remedy, it's the only remedy that makes a -- any 
8  modicum of sense.  The remedy of giving a new trial when 
9  the person has already had a fair trial makes zero 
10
11
12
13  any situation in which -- you said leave it to the 
14  discretion of the trial judge.  But what is -- what 
discretion is there?  What remedy in that situation 
15
16  other than specific performance would be an 
17  appropriate -- would remedy what you claim to have been 
18  the violation? 
19
20
21  appropriate remedy that -- that puts every -- that is 
22  narrowly tailored to the Sixth Amendment violation, and 
23  that's what this Court has said. 
24
25

think the -- the remedy in the Sixth Circuit is the only 

 I mean, this Court has given direction to 

the courts, to the lower courts, that you just narrowly 

 MS. NEWMAN:  Well, in Mr. Cooper's case, I 

45

bargain. 

1  tailor the remedy to fit the situation, because there's 
2  so many factual discrepancies --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what's wrong -- let me 
3
4  go back because I'm now becoming convinced -- I'm trying 
out what Justice Scalia suggested.  Maybe that does work 
5
6  better.  What -- what you'd say is, first, throw the 
7  defendant out, unless you are convinced that not only is 
8  there ineffective assistance, but also it would have 
9  made a difference; he would have accepted the plea 
10
 MS. NEWMAN:  Correct. 
11
12
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So, now they have to hold 
13  the plea bargain open.  They then do it.  They then go 
14  to the judge, like any plea bargain.  Ninety percent of 
the time the judge will say fine, and that's the end of 
15
16  it. 
 MS. NEWMAN:  Correct. 
17
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But should the judge decide 
18
19  that this is a case where he would reject a plea bargain 
for any one of a variety of reasons, then our assumption 
20
21  was wrong, and we reinstate the previous trial.  Now, 
22  the -- just say it's over?  You were tried, you were 
23  convicted, that's the end of it. 
24
25

 Now, what's wrong with that as a remedy?  I 
mean, what's -- why is that -- why does that muck up the 

46
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 That's, I think, pretty much what 

think maybe that's okay. 

 MS. NEWMAN:  Well, I -- I believe it is what 

(Laughter.) 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't -- it's your 

1  criminal justice system in some way? 
2
3  Justice Scalia suggested, and I -- and I am now trying 
4  that out, because the more I think about it, the more I 
5
6
7  he suggested.  And I --
8
9  me.  I don't --
10
11
12  suggestion that we set aside a perfectly fair 
13  conviction. 
14
15
16  If you're going to set it aside --
17
18
19  back in.
 MS. NEWMAN:  Well, again, right.  It's going 
20
21  to depend on what happens -- happens below, and that --
22  we don't -- I mean, the -- the concept here is one --
23
24  the question.
25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  This is just a hypothetical. 

 MS. NEWMAN:  Right. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- I think you should put it 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't -- don't blame it on 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're -- you are begging 

 MS. NEWMAN:  Okay. 

47
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

back to, I think it was Justice Alito or Chief -- or the 

MS. NEWMAN:  Right. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- would have never 

 MS. NEWMAN:  Absolutely. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right?  But it goes 

1
2  yes, Justice Breyer's first statement, you have to prove 
3  the guy was going to take the plea, because there's no 
4  sense in -- in giving him a remedy that he --
5
6
7  sought. 
8
9
10
11  Chief Justice's question, on what basis can the judge 
12  reject the plea?  You have said earlier that he has to 
13  put aside any information he learned during the trial. 
14  And that's really the nub of this case.  What are the 
15
16  reject the plea? 
17
 MS. NEWMAN:  That -- any grounds that would 
18  have existed in the original circumstances.  So, if the 
19  judge -- in -- in Michigan, there's a variety of reasons 
20
21  sentencing recommendation. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, how are you ever 
22
23  going to know that the defendant would have accepted the 
24  plea agreement?  Because by not accepting it, he's got a 
25

grounds that you're proposing the judge can use to 

Official

why a judge can say I -- I'm not going to accept this 

chance of going scot-free.  He's going to have a fair 

48
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 So, how is a judge supposed to say -- I 

a judge supposed to go back and decide whether that's 

 MS. NEWMAN:  Well, always -- in large part, 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why? 
 MS. NEWMAN:  -- in making that determination, 

1  trial, that's the assumption; and he may be acquitted. 
2
3  mean, presumably the defendant will always say, I would 
4  have taken that deal, because it's better.  Well, how is 
5
6  true or not? 
7
8  it's not going to depend on the defendant; it's going to 
9  -- in larger part it's going to defend on -- depend on 
10
11
12
13  because Strickland always looks at strategy.  I mean, 
14  that -- that's the underlying --
15
16
17
18  Justice's question.  The Chief Justice said how are you 
19  going to know -- you have to show prejudice.

21

49
 

Alderson Reporting Company

how is the judge ever going to know, be able to decide, 

 MS. NEWMAN:  The same way that the trial 

had testimony from the trial attorney.  The trial 

answer the Chief Justice's question yes or no. 
 MS. NEWMAN:  I don't think I can --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How is the judge --
 MS. NEWMAN:  -- answer it yes or no. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How is the judge --

1  he that would have, but how is the trial judge going to 
2  make a credibility determination on that -- on that 
3  issue?  I guess it's just a credibility determination. 
4  I don't know how he's going to do it.  I think you can 
5
6
7
8
9
10
11  whether the defendant would have accepted the deal or 
12  not? 
13
14  courts decide any question of fact.  In this case, we 
15
16  attorney told the judge, I told him not to accept the 
17  plea because he legally could not be convicted of the 
18  charge.  I mean, Mr. Cooper was --
19
20
21  defendant's choice. 
 MS. NEWMAN:  But he -- but he has a right to 
22
23  the assistance -- to the effective assistance of counsel 
24  in making that critical choice, and he didn't have the 
25

effective assistance of counsel.  He wrote -- Mr. Cooper

choice; it's not the lawyer's choice.  It's the

16
17  that chance because I just don't want the chance of 
18  going to jail; I'm willing to roll the dice.  Other 
19  people will say, no, that's too much.
20
21  one way or the other, but how is a judge supposed to 
22  decide?  Ask him, are you -- do you take chances? 
 MS. NEWMAN:  No, by -- by looking at --
23
24  Mr. Chief Justice, by looking at the evidence in the 
record before him.  In this case, Mr. Cooper wrote --

7
8  Cooper wrote two letters to the judge saying, I want to 
9  accept a plea.  Mr. McClain, the trial attorney who 
provided the incompetent advice, told the judge in a 
10
11 
postconviction hearing that Mr. Cooper wanted to take a 
plea.  I mean, there -- there is no -- it is beyond 
12 
13 
question in this case. 
14
15
16  This was a relatively short and simple trial.  But let's 
17  say a prosecutor offers a plea deal in a case in which 
18  the trial is going to take 6 months and it's going to 
19  cost -- and it's going to cost a million dollars, and if 
they try that case, there are going to be other cases 
20
21  that they won't be able to try.  The plea is rejected, 
22  the case is tried, and then afterwards the -- the remedy 
23  is to -- to -- to reinstate this plea offer, which was 
24  predicated on the relieving the prosecutor of the burden

 MS. NEWMAN:  I'm saying it's unfair to say 
15
16  that the trial erases the unfairness when there was no 
17  possibility but for a conviction at the end of the road. 
18  So, this was a certain guilty plea or this was a long 
19  guilty plea under the math of a trial.

22  decide not to convict no matter what the evidence. 
23
24  there was no possibility --

 MS. NEWMAN:  There was no defense.  I mean, 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's up to the

3  Juries -- I don't want to say often, but it's not --
4  it's certainly not inconceivable that a jury may decide 
5

7
 MS. NEWMAN:  That's true, but in this case, 
8  Mr. McClain told Mr. Cooper he would be convicted.  I 
9  mean, he assured him of conviction.  He said:  You will 
be convicted at the end of the trial; you're just going

 MS. NEWMAN:  Sorry.  I didn't hear the rest. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In most cases in which a 

those cases, do most of the trial judges not permit or 
don't find that the defendant has met their burden of 
proving that he or she would have taken the plea? 

1  most of the cases in which motions of this kind are 
2  brought to trial, judges -- if there is a defense of 
3  mistaken identity or of "I didn't do it," that judges 
4  often find the defendant has not proven that they would

9  misidentification or "I just didn't do this act," in

13
14  out that if you have a valid defense, it would be 
harder.  But I -- I would agree with that -- if that's a 
15
16  hypothetical, that if you have a valid defense, it would 
17  be a lot harder to be in this position of showing that 
18  you would have taken the plea. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I thought in this case, 
19
and you can correct me if I am wrong, that your client 
20
21  told the attorney from the beginning:  I did it; I want 
22  to plea.

He went to trial because he believed legally his client

2  incompetent advice.  He never --
3
4
5
6  would be convicted of a lesser offense that would put 
7  him in a better position than if he had accepted the 
8  plea.  That was the only reason. 
9
10
11  there was no defense.  Does that mean you didn't -- he 
12  had a frivolous defense or that he literally didn't put 
13  on a defense; just said, look, the State has to prove 
14  the case and they haven't done it.

 MS. NEWMAN:  I'm not saying literally no

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's something the

to kill her.  He shot her, you know, below the waist. 

 MS. NEWMAN:  Except the defense counsel on 

client legally that's the only thing that could happen 
to him, so he was in a better position by going to 
trial. 

1  jury could have accepted, right?  Even if it's not 
2  legally true that if you shoot him -- at the -- the 
3  person below the waist, that's not a defense, but I can 
4  see a reasonable juror saying he probably didn't intend

 MR. BURSCH:  Thank you.  I'd like to start at 
18
19  the one point where I think all of us, including counsel 
20
21  after an error-free first trial doesn't make sense.  And 
22  that right there says a lot about Mr. Cooper's case, 
23  because a Strickland remedy is typically a new trial. 
24  And it's exceedingly strange that they're now saying 
25

 Thank you, Your Honor. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Mr. Bursch, 4 minutes. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH 

that I don't want a new trial.  That demonstrates that 

58
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

on both sides, agree, and that's that a second trial 

Official 

 First, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, it 

trial result could simply be re-imposed.  And the 

1  what they are claiming is not a Strickland violation. 
2
 I would like to address, Justice Breyer, 
3  your suggestion that maybe you could have specific 
4  performance of the plea; and if it's rejected, then the 
5
6  question is:  Well, what's the problem with that?  And I 
7  can tick off at least five. 
8
9  takes away the prosecutor's ability to withdraw the 
plea, which he or she undeniably would have had the 
10
11 
right. 
12
 Second, as Justice Alito said, it ignores 
13  that there's information that could be learned in the 
14  interim.  Mr. Cooper shot three or four other people.
15
16  error-free trial has taken place.  The prosecutor has 
17  taken the risk of putting that 8-year-old sexual abuse 
18  victim on the stand, and you cannot take that risk away. 
19
20
21  discretion. 
22
23  problems.  Say the offer was plead to A, we'll dismiss 
24  B.  He rejects it based on deficient advice.  You go to 
25

trial.  He is convicted on A and acquitted on B.  And 

 Third, it ignores the fact that an 

 Fourth, as I already mentioned, we've got 

the separation of powers issue and prosecutorial 

 Fifth, we're going to have intractable

clear is that, under this Court's existing precedent, 

 The second point I want to make is about the 
death situation.  And that's one we take very seriously. 

1  now we're going to try to enforce the plea on A?  I 
2  mean, that's almost a double jeopardy problem.  So, 
3  there's intractable problems. 
4
5
6  And, Justice Alito, it may be that in a death penalty 
7  situation, there could be a due process right or some 
8  other constitutional right that may mitigate in favor of 
9  requiring something to be put on the record.  But what's 
10
11  that is not a Strickland violation because the amount of 
12  the sentence, whether it's death or 50 years, has 
13  nothing to do with the reliability of the adjudicatory 
14  proceeding and the sentence.
 Finally, the last point that I want to make 
15
16  is something else on which we can all agree.  Mr. Cooper 
17  is guilty of shooting Kali Mundy.  He also got exactly 
18  the sentence that the people prescribed for the crime 
19  that committed.  There is very little unfair about 
20
21  it's the position of Mr. Cooper that it is unfair to 
22  have a fair trial.  And from our perspective, that is 
23  really the beginning and the end of this inquiry. 
24
25

holding him to that sentence.  As Justice Kennedy said, 

 And unless you have any further questions --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I have one, but it's more 

60
 

Alderson Reporting Company

amended so that judges, trial judges, before imposing a 

1  appropriate, I think, for the Government of the United 
2  States.  Under the Federal rules, Rule 11, there has to 
3  be a colloquy before a plea is entered.  Do you think 
4  the Federal rules and perhaps State rules should be 
5
6  sentence inquire:  Have there been plea offers; have 
7  they all been communicated to the defendant? 
 Is that good practice? 
8
 MR. BURSCH:  It could be good practice, but 
9
it wouldn't have solved the problem here, because even 
10
11  if they had put the fact of the plea on the record, the 
12  problem was the alleged deficient advice that the lawyer 
13  gave to the client in private.  And so, that doesn't 
14  solve the core problem.  The core problem is that 
15
16  fair trial. 
17
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if they had -- if 
18  plea offer had come out -- well, I don't know how it 
19  would work.  When you enter a not guilty plea, you enter 
20
21
22  under your theory then, would have had to inquire: 
23  Well, what advice did your attorney give you with 
24  respect to that?  And then evaluate whether that advice 
was good advice or bad advice.  And I would respectfully 
25

they're trying to claim that it was unfair to have a 

a not guilty plea.
