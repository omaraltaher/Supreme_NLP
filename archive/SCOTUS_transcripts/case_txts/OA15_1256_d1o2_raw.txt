CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

first this morning in Case 15-1256, Nelson v. Colorado. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

Mr. Banner.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART BANNER 

 

 

 

 

7 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

MR. BANNER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

please the Court: 

 

 

10 

            

When a judgment is reversed, a person who 

   

   

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

has paid money pursuant to the judgment is entitled to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get the money back.  That's common sense, and that has, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unsurprisingly, been normal practice for centuries. 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

As far as we can tell, Colorado is the first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

State ever to adopt a rule to the contrary.  In Colorado 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now, when a judgment of conviction is reversed, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

State keeps the defendant's money unless the defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

files a separate civil action and can prove, by clear 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and convincing evidence, that she's actually innocent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What is the basis of -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

of the right?  You said the person whose conviction is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overturned has a right to get the money back.  Is it a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional right?  What kind of right is it? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MR. BANNER:  It's -- it's a right under the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

common law of property that's existed for centuries; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

2 

that it has always been the case that a successful 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellant gets her money back. 

 

 

 

 

4 

3 

            

In this case, the money was taken from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

Shannon Nelson and Lewis Madden pursuant to criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions, but -­

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It has to be -- it -- it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

has to be constitutional if Colorado says we don't want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to follow the common law.  This is not the law here. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

10 

            

MR. BANNER:  Well, but -- but here -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So -- so if it's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

constitutional, then -- then what's the -- what's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis for -- for your case? 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

MR. BANNER:  No.  So here, the Colorado 

  

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

supreme court did not say that this money belongs to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State of Colorado.  Rather, the Colorado supreme court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said the Exoneration Act is a good enough remedy for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

returning the money to Nelson and Madden. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

You're absolutely right, though, to say that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

if the Colorado supreme court had said it doesn't matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what process we use because it's not their property, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's the State's property.  If the Colorado supreme 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court had said that, then you're right.  Then we would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be having to say -- making an argument that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution itself gives the money -- gives a right to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the money to Nelson and --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Make that argument. 

  

 

 

 

MR. BANNER:  Excuse me? 

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Make that argument. 

  

 

 

 

5 

MR. BANNER:  Okay.  So if -- if Colorado -­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

if the Colorado supreme court had said that this money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

belongs to the State rather than to Nelson and Madden -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Madden, that would be tantamount to charging people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money for the privilege of trying them unlawfully. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Right?  It would be the State taking money as a result 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a trial that has been reversed, a trial that was 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

conducted unlawfully.  That would -­

  

 

 

 

12 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The dissent here said 

  

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

something quite simple, which was the only entitlement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the money was the conviction. 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

16 

            

MR. BANNER:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If the conviction has 

  

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

been voided, then what legal right does the State have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to retain the money? 

 

 

 

19 

            

20 

            

MR. BANNER:  We agree with that exactly. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The Colorado supreme 

  

 

 

 

21 

22 

court, on the other hand, said when you paid the money, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we were entitled to it.  So where -- there's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

disconnect there. 

 

24 

            

If they were entitled to it initially, we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

still back to the operative question of why are they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

entitled?  What is the constitutional right for you to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

get it back? 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

MR. BANNER:  The State was entitled to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

money initially because there were judgments of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction in place, judgments of conviction that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required the payment of the money.  Those judgments of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction no longer exist.  They were reversed on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal.  Shannon Nelson was retried and was acquitted of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all charges.  Lewis Madden convictions were reversed and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the prosecutor declined to -- to retry the case.  And so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while it was the State's money while the convictions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existed, once those judgments of conviction cease to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exist, at that point it's no longer the State's money. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought your argument 

    

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

was -- was this, but what you're saying now and a lot of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your brief is much more complicated, but the simple 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument I thought was this: 

   

 

 

18 

            

This was your client's money.  It's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

certain amount of dollars.  Okay.  It was taken away 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

from them as a result of a trial that was flawed and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore they were deprived of that property without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due process of law.  I thought that was the argument. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Am I right or not? 

   

 

 

            

MR. BANNER:  You're right. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  Now, if that is the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

argument, there are two complications that I see in your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefing.  One is that you concede that they could be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

denied restitution for equitable reasons.  Let's just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

4 

take that. 

 

5 

            

Where -- where else in the law of due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

process would something like that come up? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

MR. BANNER:  We -- we -- the reason why we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

said that is that in several of -- of this Court's older 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases, the Court describes these refunds as equitable. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

Now, in a -- in a garden variety -- in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

garden variety criminal cases like this one, there would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be no equitable considerations that would interfere with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a refund of the money. 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

But there -- there are -- it's possible to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

imagine other sorts of cases where it would.  And so, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for example, the Court -- as this Court mentioned, as we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say in the -- in the reply brief, this Court mentioned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an example in which an insurance case in which a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refund -- a full refund would provide overcompensation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

for some reason to -- to the successful appellant, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in such a case, the refund for equitable reasons would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to be scaled back. 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

In an ordinary criminal case like -- like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

ours, there's nothing like that.  Those -- those sorts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of equitable considerations are very, very far from --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review

2 

from -- from a case like this one.  And, you know, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Colorado talks -­

25 

the basic argument, it's our money by virtue of State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law, and once the conviction disappears, why doesn't the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State have to proactively return the money?  In other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words, why is it even required for the person to bring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any kind of refund action against the State? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BANNER:  No.  The State does proactively 

  

  

 

 

 

 

have to refund the money.  There -- there is no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement for the successful appellant to bring -- to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring an action.  Rather, the -- what the -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So your complaint is not to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the nature of this action and to exactly what you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to prove.  You're saying that as soon as the conviction 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is vacated, the State has to put a check in the mail. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BANNER:  Well, okay.  That may be a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

little too -- a little too simple.  So that the -- in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our view the -- the -- a proper procedure would be the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure that was followed in these cases, where, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after -- in Shannon Nelson's case, after she was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquited, she filed a motion back in the original trial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court saying, look, I've been acquited, please give me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my money back. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.  I guess I'm asking, if 

    

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

your theory is right, why is even that necessary?  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your theory is right, it seems -- I mean, you know -­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, you might file a motion because the State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hasn't done what it's supposed to do, but it seems as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

though the obligation on the State's part is immediately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to put a check in the mail.

7 

            

MR. BANNER:  No, that's right.  That's 

  

  

 

 

 

8 

9 

right.  That's right.  And so when that hadn't happened 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

after several months we filed the motions in both cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

11 

            

Well, the -- the other -­

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I was just -- I -- I 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

understood you in responding to Justice Alito to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the State had to give the money back because they'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquired it as a result of a flawed prosecution.  Is 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

15 

that right? 

 

16 

            

17 

            

MR. BANNER:  Right. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's not 

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

true for some of the payments.  You know, there's a $30 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

docket fee.  In other words, that's not something that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depends upon whether the conviction is valid or not in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the normal case. 

 

 

22 

            

MR. BANNER:  Well, yes.  Well, in -- in -­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24

filing fees that are collected from any litigant, win or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lose.  There's nothing like that in this case.  This is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all money that is contingent upon the existence of a

JUSTICE ALITO:  The other complication that 

  

 

 

 

 

I see in this make-whole argument, in other words, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State took things away from you, they took property away 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from you, and when the conviction is reversed, they have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to restore you to the position you were in before the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution.  Is this, the -- the restitution and all of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these fees are small in comparison with the main thing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was taken away, and that was -- that was liberty. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So if your argument is correct, why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't this -- what -- did -- didn't the State -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State took away your clients' liberty without due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process of law, so would they be automatically entitled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be made whole in that respect? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BANNER:  No.  And the reason -­

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Why not? 

  

 

 

            

MR. BANNER:  The reason -- I'm -- I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting -- the reason for that is that while there's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

long historical tradition of providing refunds of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

monetary payments upon the reversal of the conviction, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is no comparable tradition of providing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensation for periods of lost liberty. 

 

 

 

 

 

1

3

5 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's why Colorado 

  

 

 

 

6 

passed the Exoneration Act. 

 

 

 

7 

            

MR. BANNER:  Exactly.  Exactly.  If there -­

  

  

  

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

if there already was a tradition of providing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

compensation for lost liberty, there'd be no need for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes of exoneration -­

 

 

 

11 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if tradition -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

mean, if tradition like that can defeat the argument for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensation for time wrongfully spent in prison, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can tradition defeat the argument that you make with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to the fees and the restitution? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

MR. BANNER:  No, because the tradition is -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

is the -- the normal practice for centuries has been to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refund monetary payments that are contingent upon a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment when that judgment -­

 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Oh, okay.  So the argument 

  

  

 

 

 

 

21 

is tradition could do it if there were such a thing. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

MR. BANNER:  If there were such a thing, if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

the opposite -- right.  And so it's a -- it's a -­

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

25 

tradition. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But we have to look at the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can we look at the

tradition again?  It seems to me for constitutional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons, not for State law reasons, that's where I'm

somewhat confused.

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

              

I mean, who -- who cares about tradition if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State says X and the tradition is Y, unless there's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a constitutional -­

 

 

            

MR. BANNER:  No, no, that's right.  That's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

right.  That's right.  And so -- and so tradition -­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tradition comes in, you know, in -- in determining what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process is due, courts always -- always look to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tradition.  Tradition is -- is always a factor in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

considering what would -­

law for a moment. 

   

 

16 

            

17 

            

MR. BANNER:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are -- are you saying that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23

25 

if a State creates a right under State law, it cannot 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

unduly complicate that right by flawed procedures, under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our procedural due process jurisprudence? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BANNER:  Well, I'd say it even more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply than that.  I would say that when a State is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

holding onto property that belongs to one of its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens, the State has an obligation to have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure that is adequate for returning the property. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

              

I mean, that's the -- that's the error that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

we're complaining about in the Colorado supreme court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Below, the supreme court said the -- the Colorado 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supreme court analyzed this as a procedural due process 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  The court said the question is:  Is the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exoneration Act a good enough procedure for returning 

   

 

 

 

 

 

this money to Nelson and Madden?  The Colorado supreme 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court applied Mathews v. Eldridge and the State cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following Mathews v. Eldridge, and the Colorado supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court determined yes, this is a good enough process for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

returning the money to Nelson and Madden.

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21

your argument has moved from the simple one I started 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out with, which is that you're absolutely entitled to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made whole, to the argument that they have to provide -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we look to tradition and we have -- we have to see 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what sort of tradition is adequate. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So what would be an adequate procedure here? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BANNER:  They -- they have to be made 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole -- I guess I don't think I'm saying anything 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

different from what you're saying.  I'm saying that what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Due Process Clause requires is for Colorado to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide a process adequate to make defendants whole when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

their convictions -­

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  So what is that process

after the conviction is reversed? 

 

 

 

 

14

MR. BANNER:  Well, I'm simply -- simply to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

refund the money.  It's their money.  Colorado can't 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

make defendants have to prove that they're actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

innocent in order to get their own money back. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I thought -- let's -­

    

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

let's take the act.  What parts of the procedure of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

act are you saying violate due process? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MR. BANNER:  Well, the -- the requirement of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

proving one's innocence in order to get one's own money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back.  That's -- that's the most -- that's the most 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

obvious one. 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It would seem to me that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

if the State had an equitable reason, it should prove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it, not you. 

 

 

16 

            

MR. BANNER:  Oh, exactly.  Exactly.  And as 

  

  

  

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

I've said, the State talks a lot in very general terms 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about equitable principles, but the State has yet to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identify what equitable principle entitles to not refund 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

the money. 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think the 

  

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

requirement to start a separate civil action comports 

   

 

 

 

 

 

with due process? 

 

 

24 

            

MR. BANNER:  That's -- that's a harder 

   

  

 

 

 

25 

question.  So let's imagine a requirement that you have

15

to file a separate civil action, but all you have to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove is that your conviction was reversed, right?  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was -- if it was something that -- that ministerial, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe.  Maybe that would satisfy due process.  Although 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

even there, I suppose, it would be hard to see what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose would be served by such an action when you -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You'd have to get -- pay

a filing fee -­

12 

            

13 

            

MR. BANNER:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You would have to engage 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BANNER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And we're talking about 

  

 

 

 

 

14 

hundreds of dollars, not even a thousand in one case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

So -­

 

16 

            

17 

            

MR. BANNER:  That's right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- if any -- it seems to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

me any requirement that you sue to get the money back. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

MR. BANNER:  I agree.  I agree.  As I was 

    

    

   

  

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

saying, it would have to be a very streamlined -- some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very streamlined, very easy sort of civil action.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- that would be pointless.  I mean, it would be 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hard to see what purpose would be served by requiring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such an action.  I'm agreeing with you.  What purpose 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be served by that when you can just do what

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I assume you apply the

7 

8 

Mathews framework.  Do you agree that the court got it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right, or do you think even under Mathews the court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

below got it wrong? 

 

 

 

9 

            

MR. BANNER:  Oh, no.  Under Mathews, the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

Court got it terribly wrong.  I mean, the -- the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Colorado supreme court's application of Mathews was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically to say due process requires some kind of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearing.  Well, the Exoneration Act, that gives you some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of a hearing, so good enough. 

   

 

 

 

 

15 

            

If you look at the -- the Mathews factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

one by one, they all point very, very strongly in -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favor of finding the Exoneration Act an inadequate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

remedy. 

19 

            

It's -- first of all, this is -- this is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

defendants' property, not the State's property. 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

Second of all, this is a terrible procedure 

   

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

for returning property to -- to successful appellants. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Exoneration Act act was not really intended to serve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that purpose.  It doesn't serve that purpose at all. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's -- it's -- virtually ensures that successful

what interest the State has in holding onto this money;

there -- there's no chance that either of these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants will ever be re-prosecuted.  This money will 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

never belong to Colorado.  Colorado has yet to explain

than what the law of the land has always been.

11 

            

12 

            

MR. BANNER:  Correct. 

  

 

You know, the thing about this case is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

what Colorado is doing here has never been done before. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So there is no precedent directly on point at a very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

high level of specificity.  So we have to look to other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lines of the Court's due process precedent.  That's what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

we've done. 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it -- it seems, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Mr. Banner, that you could be approaching this in two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways.  I mean, one is you could be claiming a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive due-process right along the lines that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Colorado said you were doing, and then you came back and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said no.  Now, if you were suggesting that you had a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive due-process right, then surely tradition 

 

 

 

 

 

would be important.

1 

            

2 

            

MR. BANNER:  That's right. 

  

 

 

19 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But in -- if you're looking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

at procedural due process, I would have thought that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

your argument is the simple one of:  This is property 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under State law; it's -- it's my property, it's your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

client's property.  And then we apply the Mathews test 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to determine what kind of procedure is due -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

9 

            

MR. BANNER:  That's right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- to get that property 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

back.  And tradition -­

  

 

 

11 

            

12 

            

13 

that. 

14 

            

MR. BANNER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- wouldn't be any part of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BANNER:  No, that's right.  And so if -­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

looking just at the Mathews test, you're absolutely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right.  Tradition would not be part of that.  But the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mathews test is not the only way the Court has looked at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this general class of issues.  And as I said, because -­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because no State has ever done what Colorado is doing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're -- we're -- we're trying to draw from various 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strands of due process precedent.  One strand is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

Mathews test. 

 

23 

            

But there -- another strand is the -- you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

know, the cases like Honda Motor and so on that say if a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State takes away a procedure that has traditionally been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

present, traditionally been afforded, that's a pretty 

   

 

 

 

 

20 

good sign that the State is violating due process.

3 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What did Colorado do 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

before the Exoneration Act with respect to returning -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

MR. BANNER:  Just -- just gave back the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

money just like every other jurisdiction.  That's right. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

And so the -- the novelty here is that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

case got to the Colorado supreme court immediately after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Exoneration Act was enacted, and the Colorado 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supreme court said, oh, now we have a statute that tells 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how money is supposed to be refunded to exonerated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants.  Under State law, that must be now the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusive remedy for defendants to recover the money. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

But before -- before the Exoneration Act, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

there -- there was no statute governing this -- this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

topic, just like in many jurisdictions.  And in -- just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a matter of routine practice, successful appellants 

   

 

 

 

 

 

got their money back. 

 

 

 

19 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, is that true?  I mean, 

    

  

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

I still don't understand the difference between the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simple argument that you're required to be made whole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the argument that a court could deny restitution 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on equitable considerations as this court has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

said. 

25 

            

So which is your argument?  You 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

automatically get it back; that's the end of it.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

don't -- no procedure is necessary -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

4 

            

MR. BANNER:  No -­

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- or that you could be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

denied receiving the money back for equitable reasons? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

MR. BANNER:  You automatically get it back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

unless there is some equitable reason that you shouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get it back.  But what I'm trying to say is in an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary criminal case like this one, there is no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable reason why you shouldn't get it back and it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impossible almost to conceive of an equitable reason. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The reason why -­

 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if the State says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

that you -- that the defendant has the obligation to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

move for a stay of the judgment of restitution when the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant takes an appeal, and if the defendant doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do that, then the money is not refunded? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

MR. BANNER:  Yeah.  That's -- that is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

impossible under State law for indigent defendants to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seek a stay of monetary payments pending appeal for two 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

reasons. 

22 

            

One is that you have to -- to get a stay 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

pending appeal, you have to post a bond in the full 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount of the payment.  That's way out of reach for any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indigent defendant.  In fact, we talked to experienced 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

Colorado defense lawyers who say they have never heard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

ever of any indigent defendant seeking a stay of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

monetary payments pending appeal.  Our clients, indigent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

defendants, they couldn't -- they couldn't have done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

that. 

6 

            

Second, by statute, stays appear to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

unavailable where the money is being taken from the -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellant's inmate accounts, which is the case here.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even -- even if they had some sort of money outside of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their inmate accounts -- excuse me.  I'm sorry.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

money had been taken from the inmate account, so -- so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the second reason why a stay would be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

unavailable. 

14 

              

I should add -­

 

 

15 

            

16 

            

17 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Should we be -­

  

 

 

 

 

MR. BANNER:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Should we be 

  

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

differentiating between some jurisdictions that don't 

 

 

 

 

 

collect the money until the conviction is final and a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction that's overturned on collateral review where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the possibility of money having been collected may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exist?  Should there be a difference in how we think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about those two situations? 

 

 

 

24 

            

MR. BANNER:  No, because -- because whatever 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

the reason for the disappearance of the judgment of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

conviction, the key thing is that these are -- these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

are -- the State's only right to this money is in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgments of conviction.  And so regardless -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I have a problem 

   

   

  

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

because there are some cases in our jurisprudence -- not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in English jurisprudence, but certainly in American 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisprudence where the payment of restitution to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third party would have been good reason, an equitable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason for the State not to have to return that money. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

11 

            

12 

            

MR. BANNER:  Yeah.  Let me -­

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what do we do -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BANNER:  Let me -- let me say -- let me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

say a word about -- about restitution in -- restitution 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the -- in the modern sense of restitution.  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

restitution -­

 

16 

            

17 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Paying the victim. 

  

 

 

 

MR. BANNER:  -- to victims.  Right.  Right, 

  

  

  

 

 

 

18 

right, right. 

 

19 

            

Restitution in -- in Colorado is -- you can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

only have restitution pursuant to a criminal conviction. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Without a criminal conviction, there can be no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

restitution.  There's no separate proceeding.  There's 

  

  

 

 

 

no separate proof apart from the amount of restitution; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise, it's just -- it's just part of the sentence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What do States generally do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

if they've collected this money, they've paid it out to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the victim, and then the conviction is overturned?  Do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

they usually leave the money with the victim and just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take it out of their general treasury, or do States try 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to take it back from the victim? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

MR. BANNER:  That -- that, I do not know. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

And the thing is there -- there are very few reported 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases raising the issue of refunds of restitution after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reversal of a conviction.  And I think the reason it 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

must be that restitution, although -- restitution to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

victims, although quite old in principle, really has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only been applied in significant amounts recently. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But your argument is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

if -- let's say there's a very substantial judgment of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution and the money is paid to the victims.  Let's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say they're victims like the ones in this case, so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's -- it's therapy -­

 

 

 

 

18 

            

19 

            

20 

            

MR. BANNER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- for abuse. 

  

 

 

 

And then even after the judgment has become 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

final, if there is -- if -- if the defendant is given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief on collateral review, the State would have to -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have to compensate the defendant for all the money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was paid to the victims.  That's your argument? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

MR. BANNER:  I -- well, I agree with all of 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

25 

1 

2 

that except for the word "compensate."  The State would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to refund the amount of money it had taken from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

defendant. 

4 

            

Remember that -- that -- I mean -- and then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

as between the State and the victims, that's between -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's -- that's between the State and the victims. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's no -- there's no bearing on the -- the property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights or the due process rights of the defendant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

Bear in mind that all the money the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

collects from convicted defendants, whether denominated 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution or denominated anything else, all of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money the State is spending on something.  The State -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State isn't hiding that money under a mattress.  All 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of that money, even -- even fines paid into a State's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general fund, the State is spending that money on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

something. 

17 

            

And so it's -- it's no excuse when -- to -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

when you -- when you owe a debt to say, oh, gees, I'm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorry, I already spent the money on something else. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you don't have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

make that argument to prevail in this case, do you?  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think there's -­

 

 

23 

            

24 

            

MR. BANNER:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- some severe equitable 

  

 

 

 

 

25 

problems with -- with the -- with the hypothetical of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

2 

the State having paid the -- the victim and the victim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having spent the money. 

 

 

 

3 

            

MR. BANNER:  No, no.  You -- you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

26 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

misunderstand me.  The State is saying -- I'm not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about the victim spending the money.  I'm -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meant to be talking about the State saying, well, I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorry, we can't -- we can't -- upon the reversal of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction, the State saying we -- we can't refund the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money, sorry, we already disbursed it as restitution to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

the victims. 

 

11 

            

And what I'm saying is the State disburses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

all the money it collects for one purpose or another. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That doesn't set restitution apart from anything else. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

15 

            

16 

Mr. Banner. 

 

If I could reserve the balance of my time.

The dispositive question in this case is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

substantive, not procedural.  Petitioners are not 

  

 

 

 

 

claiming that they've been denied an opportunity to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove that they are -- that they meet the substantive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

elements of the Colorado Exoneration Act.  Instead -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The argument is that that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

27 

3 

4 

5 

6 

Act is an inappropriate procedure; that the procedure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set up by the Exoneration Act where they have to prove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves actually innocent is a procedure that does 

   

 

 

 

 

 

not comport with due process. 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Justice Ginsburg, if I 

  

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

understand Petitioners' argument appropriately, what 

 

 

 

 

they're saying is that they shouldn't have to prove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual innocence at all.  So those procedures, because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are geared toward and focused on that inquiry, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't have to apply.  And what that means is what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners are arguing is that they have a substantive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to automatic compensation without having to prove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything at all.  And so that's why -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I think that that's 

   

  

 

 

 

17 

18 

just mistaken, General.  They're saying that they have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general State law property right in the money. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

Now, do you disagree with that?  Do you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

think that this is their money? 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  No, Justice Kagan.  That is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

the nub of the dispute.  The question in this case is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether, as a matter of substantive -­

   

 

 

 

 

24 

            

25 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Whose money is it? 

  

 

 

 

 

GENERAL YARGER:  This is the State's money, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

as the Colorado supreme court held.  You could look at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 

2 

Petitioner -­

 

3 

            

4 

money? 

5 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why is it the State's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

GENERAL YARGER:  Because, as -- as

7

12 

13

18

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Petitioners acknowledged during opening argument, it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

properly taken pursuant to a conviction. 

   

 

 

 

            

And the Colorado supreme court described 

 

 

 

 

 

this money as public funds.  It never said that this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property of the -­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it's -- it's money 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's conditioned on a valid conviction.  And when that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

valid conviction goes away, it seems the most natural, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obvious thing in the world to say that the State's right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to that money evaporates at exactly the same moment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Why isn't that true? 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Justice Kagan, it's the 

  

 

 

 

 

same reason that, upon reversal of the conviction, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly the Petitioners can't be subject to that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction anymore.  They have to be released from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

incarceration, and they cannot be subject to continued 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposition of the monetary judgment. 

 

 

 

 

            

But what due process has never held, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what this Court's decisions have not held -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm not talking about due 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

process.  I'm merely just talking about whose money it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

is.  Under State law, State property law, whose money is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it?  They say it's their money because there's no longer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a valid conviction.  You say notwithstanding that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

valid conviction has been reversed, it's the State's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money.  I want to know why. 

    

 

 

 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  The reason why is that -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, first of all, the Colorado supreme court described 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this as public funds.  And that's precisely how this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court and other courts have treated this when they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

encounter the issue of sovereign immunity.

10 

11

So, for example, United States v. Gettinger,

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

this Court held that claims like these are not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

return-of-property type claims.  They are claims that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

can be subject to sovereign immunity.  And if that is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true, it's not property of the criminal defendant after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a lawful conviction has been entered and -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could you just sort of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

describe to me in sort of common sensical terms, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, rather than point me to a sovereign immunity case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or something, just in common sensical terms why is this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State's money? 

 

 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  It's the State's money -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

just as it -- just as the State lawfully incarcerated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these defendants -- and Petitioners don't dispute that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

The State lawfully, but erroneously, took the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

defendants' liberty away in this case.  That was lawful. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Same as the court -- or the State lawfully took custody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of and property in the State's -- or excuse me -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal defendants' money.  And -­

2 

3

6 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- so do you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

any obligation to return the money at all, pursuant to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any procedures?  Could you just say once -- once you pay 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the money, we have no procedure for you to get it back. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In fact, we won't give it back to you ever.  It's our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money, we don't have to give it back. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  So long as the conviction 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

itself existed at the time that the money was taken, no, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State does not have that obligation.  Just as it was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required to pass the Exoneration Act in order to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensate criminal defendants who were erroneously but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not wrongfully convicted, otherwise they have to prove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they meet the elements of, for example, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional tort; that they were wronged in some way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if you said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

instead of the $128 for this, the $30 for -- if you said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody who is convicted owes the State $10,000 and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you don't -- you don't get it back if you're later -- if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the conviction is later overturned. 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  That is the rule that this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

Court has adhered to, and that -- that is precisely the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31 

implication of courts that, when deciding these claims, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look for waivers of sovereign immunity, because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assumption is that the deprivation of both the liberty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the property at the time of conviction is lawful, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that the property passes into public funds.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was Mr. Banner wrong, 

  

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

then, when he told us that before the Exoneration Act, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Colorado, like every other State, just gave the money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

back? 

11 

            

12 

Your Honor. 

 

13 

            

14 

            

15 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  He is -- that is incorrect, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What did Colorado do -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

GENERAL YARGER:  Well -­

  

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- with respect to 

  

 

 

 

 

16 

monetary sanctions before the Exoneration Act? 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  They -- they didn't have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

authority to give it back.  One example I can give -­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and there aren't many -- is People v. Noel.  It's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Colorado court of appeals case from 2005 where the court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declined to order what -- what they describe as a refund 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of amounts charged for probation, even though that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction was later overturned. 

 

 

 

24 

            

Now, the chief case they reply upon is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

Toland v. Strohl.  It's a Colorado case from 1961.  And 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

the court there did order refunds of the fines, but in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

that case, and as interpreted by the Colorado supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court in this case, there was specific wrongful conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that violated the Constitution on the part of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justice of the peace that presided over that case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

So as the Colorado supreme court understands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

it, that was a case about wrongful conduct on the part 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of someone adjudicating the case, rather than merely an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

erroneous conviction that requires the status quo to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restored after that conviction was overturned. 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you denying that 

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

there were courts -- lower courts that routinely ordered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the refund of these monies? 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

15 

Sotomayor. 

16 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  I -- I am, Justice 

    

   

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think in the briefing, 

    

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

we're pointed to any number of situations in which lower 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts did order -- automatically gave -- ordered the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money to go back. 

 

 

 

20 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Justice Sotomayor, we're 

  

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

not denying that there are certainly some courts that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have done so.  But there are many courts that do not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treat these claims as return-of-property claims.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

treat them as claims for compensation against the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for which a waiver of sovereign immunity is required.

question of labels.  And -- and if you have no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction to justify the -- a payment of money because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's been voided, why is it your money now?  Just simply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because you collected it beforehand, even though the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis for the collection is wrong?

GENERAL YARGER:  Well, that would be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

forfeiture situation.  And there are other -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why isn't this 

  

 

 

 

13 

comparable to forfeiture? 

 

 

14 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Well, in fact, the 

  

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

forfeiture proceedings in some cases provide a useful 

   

 

 

 

 

 

analogy.  If the district court orders forfeiture and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- someone with an ownership interest in that property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not properly appeal or seek a stay of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disposition of that forfeited property -­

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's go to the stay. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Could you -- can you honestly say to me that if this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant had moved for a stay, that the trial court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have granted one?  In how many cases do you think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the thousands of convictions that Colorado goes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through would a court order a stay?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What a wonderful

procedural quagmire you're throwing on courts below. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The number of vacated convictions are tiny.  The number 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of proceedings you want now with stay motions to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determined by trial courts is hundreds, if not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thousands.  That's what you're advocating.

GENERAL YARGER:  I'm sorry, Justice

court to decide whether a stay is appropriate.

question:  Suppose we have a criminal trial.  The jury 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

comes in with a verdict of guilty.  And then the trial 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge said judgment vacated.  There was insufficient 

  

 

 

 

 

 

evidence to convict.  In that case, the defendant would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not owe any fees to the State; right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  That's correct, Your Honor.

says there was sufficient evidence; appeal.  The court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of appeals then says there was insufficient evidence, so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we vacate the conviction.  In that case, all that money 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is kept -- can be kept by the State?  What's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference whether the finding was made by the trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge or by an appellate court?

that time, there was a lawful conviction in place, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is what's required.  And that's why the question in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case is whether this is a return of property that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is properly thought of as the criminal defendants or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a claim for compensation.  Just as in United States 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

v. Gettinger where the conviction was overturned because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute on which it was based was unconstitutionally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vague, the Court -- this Court denied compensation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because there was no waiver of sovereign immunity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We're not talking about 

  

 

 

 

 

19 

compensation.  We're talking about getting your money 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

back. 

21 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Well, that's the -- Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Ginsburg, that's the question.  Is this properly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

considered under State law or under the Constitution as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a substantive matter property of the criminal defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or is it not?  And --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It says on page 27 of their

brief, they had three cases, one going back to 1832 of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court that says the law is that when you reverse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the judgment in a civil case -- I wouldn't know why it 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would apply, too, as well as to criminal -- that you -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the person on the other side gets the money back. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, it doesn't say what law.  And, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

moreover, you heard your brother here say, well, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Colorado supreme court said that this wasn't a question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

here of whose property it was, it was a question of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy.  The property belonged to the criminal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

defendant. 

13 

            

Now, so, one, what do you say about those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

cases?  Two, what did the Colorado supreme court say as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a matter of property law? 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Yes, Justice Breyer.  First 

  

  

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

of all, the cases -- there are cases that say upon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reversal of an erroneous judgment, there can be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution.  But -­

  

 

20 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It doesn't say "can."  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

says the law raises an obligation to the one who's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

received the benefit of the erroneous judgment to make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution to the other party -­

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

25 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Well -­

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- or creates an 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

obligation.  It doesn't say "may." 

  

 

 

 

2 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Respectfully, Justice 

  

 

 

3 

Breyer, some -- some courts use that specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

formulation -­

 

37 

5 

            

6 

            

7 

            

8 

            

9 

            

10 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  This Court used that. 

  

 

 

 

 

GENERAL YARGER:  This -­

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  This Court was the one -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

GENERAL YARGER:  This Court likewise -­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  In 1832.  All right. 

  

  

 

 

 

GENERAL YARGER:  In two cases, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

Breyer, Atlanta Coast Line Railroad, which is a Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cardozo case from 1935, and United States v. Morgan, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is a case from 1939, the Court overturned an order 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the district court and yet declined to provide a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refund because what the Court said is it had to remand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a hearing on the merits of the substantive dispute. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

18 

            

One of Petitioner's own sources, a -­

   

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm more interested in what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

does the -- did the Colorado supreme court say, this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his money, but we don't have a remedy?  Did it say, this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is our money and we don't have to have a remedy?  What 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did it say? 

 

 

23 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  It said that these amounts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

are considered public funds such that a statute is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

required providing that courts may draw on public funds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

to award these amounts.  So what the Colorado supreme 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38 

court necessarily decided was that this is not under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State law property of the criminal defendant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's a 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

question, it seems to me, of -- you keep talking about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensation.  The issue is restitution.  And under 

  

  

 

 

 

 

normal equitable principles of restitution, it, in fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still is the property of the person from whom the money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has been taken away.  And I wonder if your -- your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis has to be adjusted when you appreciate that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's not compensation.  It's not sort of the normal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State, give us some money.  Under equitable principles, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's State, give me my money back. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Yeah.  Justice -- or 

  

  

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

Mr. Chief Justice, that is the question, is under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historical treatment of this issue, is this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property properly considered return of money?  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

courts do say restitution.  They also say that it is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim of unjust enrichment that depends on factors, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including the merits of the case.  One of Petitioners' 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own sources, a Tainter article -­

   

 

 

 

22 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose we go by the -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

what this Court said in 1832, which seems like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historical tradition.  Suppose I take that, unless you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

give me a reason not to, as stating what the law is. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

That's what it says. 

 

 

 

39 

2 

            

3 

            

So what's your response to that? 

 

 

 

 

 

GENERAL YARGER:  My response to that, 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

Justice Breyer, is I -- respectfully, I don't think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

that's exactly what the law says.  If the law says it, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if Petitioners establish a substantive due-process right 

   

 

 

 

 

to this money back, we agree with them.  Colorado law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't vindicate that particular substantive interest. 

 

 

 

 

 

And we're not arguing that it does. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  For known -- the issue, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

I've never known us to wonder or call it a substantive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due-process right to own money.  Money is property.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all have a right to own our property; correct? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

15 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Yes, Justice Sotomayor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So I'm a little confused 

   

  

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

by what you're asking for.  They're saying it's my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money.  Whether I agree with that or don't, if it is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their money, then you need to do a procedure that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comports with due process; correct? 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

21 

            

22 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And you don't deny that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

GENERAL YARGER:  I don't deny that, no.  And 

    

  

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

so the question is whether under either State law this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is properly considered -­

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about we borrow from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

double jeopardy?  Once the -- once the judgment is void, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you no longer have a basis to that property.  It's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

theirs.  They had -- it was their money to begin with. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The only basis you had to collect it or keep it was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional conviction.  Once it's voided, you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

no basis to keep the money. 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  And, Justice Sotomayor, I 

  

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

think that that wouldn't necessarily explain cases like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gettinger from 1927 when this Court denied that kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a remedy.  Or ex parte Morris is another example where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court ordered that certain forfeited property be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

returned, but the Court said, "The Court has no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority to order the United States" -- "property that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had been placed in the United States to refund."  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the question is -­

 

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  General, can I go back to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

17 

what -- I'm sorry.  I interrupted you midstream. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

19 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's the -- you said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

"that's the question" as though something big was coming 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

up. 

22 

            

(Laughter.) 

23 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  I think I've, Justice 

    

 

 

 

24 

25 

Kagan, probably said it before.  It's just a question of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether this is treated as a return of property or a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

claim on compensation. 

 

 

41 

2 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  So you said to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

Justice Sotomayor, you said we agree that if this were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their money, we would have to refund it in normal ways 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent with procedural due process. 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

7 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Yes, Justice Kagan. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  So it really all does 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

depend on whether we think it's their money or it's your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

money. 

10 

            

11 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  That's -- that's correct. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So if this were your money 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

on this -- on the simple theory of, there once was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction, it once was valid, we collected the money at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that time, and that makes it our money going forward 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forever and ever, no matter what happens to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction.  If that's your theory, it's not only true, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the Chief Justice said, that you wouldn't have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide any remedy or any process for getting that money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back; right?  You could just keep it and say, doesn't -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can prove your innocence, you cannot prove your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

innocence.  Too bad.  It's our money.  You agree with 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that.  I think you said that to the Chief. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

24 

Kagan. 

25 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  That's correct, Justice 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And it would also be true, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

42 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

would think, that even if that conviction were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

improperly gained, not just in the sense that it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later vacated, but let's say it was the State's fault 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that conviction occurred; in other words, let's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, oh, I don't know, there was a Brady violation or 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

something like that.  It would still be your money. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Justice Kagan, in that -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

that actually neatly illustrates the decisions that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States like Colorado have to make.  Before the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exoneration Act, for example, criminal defendants whose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions were overturned for error and they were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually innocent had no remedy, except if they proved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some sort of a wrong such as the one you're describing. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Then they could sue for a constitutional tort.  In fact, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a significant case from Colorado had exactly that.  A 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal defendant sued for a Brady violation and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

received millions of dollars in compensation. 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

But what the -- the State is not required to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

do is merely because the conviction is overturned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide compensation for losses that occur attendant to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a conviction that is overturned. 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does your -- does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

your analysis -- why doesn't it apply to criminal fines? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

In other words, the fine for whatever the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

offense is, you know, $10,000.  In other words, it's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

money that they paid fees along with the process.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43 

the end of the process.  You're convicted, you pay a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$10,000 fine.  Why don't -- when the conviction is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overturned, why don't you say, well, you know, this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our money now, it's in the State treasury, you can't get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it back because of sovereign immunity? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Mr. Chief Justice, two 

  

 

 

 

 

points.  These -- these amounts here are -- are not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purely punitive, so that precise question isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented, but our line does not depend on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference between punitive fines and payments such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these and neither have past -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You say your line 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

doesn't depend.  Does that mean you could apply this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule to fines? 

 

 

16 

            

17 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Yes. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Really?  Are fines 

  

  

 

 

 

18 

19 

in Colorado unredeemable once you -- once you put them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the treasury?

GENERAL YARGER:  As we understand the 

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Colorado supreme court's decision, yes.  Just as this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court held in Gettinger, that was a fine that the court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not repay even though the conviction was invalidated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for constitutional reasons and the -- and the reason the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court didn't order the fine repaid was because of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

sovereign immunity.  So -­

  

 

 

44 

2 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.  So what happens 

  

  

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

then?  I mean, you -- I grant you have a tough side of 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this argument.  It doesn't seem very fair.  But the -­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the -­

 

 

 

6 

            

(Laughter.) 

7 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You have a corporate 

   

  

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

criminal defendant, you can't put him in jail, and -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and so what they do is they fine the corporation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$15 million.  And then the State says, by the way, why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal?  If you win, we're not going to give you the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money back as the Chief Justice said.  We'll assert 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

sovereign immunity. 

 

14 

            

Now, there's something wrong with that.  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

trying to put my finger on it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

(Laughter.) 

17 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Justice Breyer, if there's 

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

something wrong with that, then there was something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong with those long -- the cases decided previously. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And this is -­

 

 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe they were right in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

1832 and then they went off on a wrong track. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

(Laughter.) 

24 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe those cases were 

  

 

 

 

 

25 

wrong.  I don't -- I don't know.  I have to go read them

and figure it out.  But -- but it can't be that there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no point to an appeal.  Because we're not going to give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you back the fine. 

 

 

 

4 

            

5 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Well -­

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now -- now, that, I stop 

   

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7

right there and then I'm asking -- I don't know what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your -- I have to ask him, and that's why his brief has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

several different arguments, because it's hard to figure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out, but there's -- okay. 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

Do you want to say anything in response to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

this question? 

 

12 

            

(Laughter.) 

13 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Justice Breyer, I 

  

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

understand what you're struggling with.  We -- we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

struggle with it as well, but the -- the law in Colorado 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supported by decisions of this Court and others in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1800s and early 1900s suggests that this is a question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of whether the State has decided to provide this kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensation.  And if the Court rules that this is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter of substantive procedural -- or excuse me, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive right under the Constitution, I think you do 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

encounter very significant problems about why 

 

 

 

 

 

compensation isn't awarded for the serious deprivation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of liberty that occurs -­

 

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Why does it -- why does it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

matter who owns this money at this time under Colorado 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46 

law?  This was the defendants' money and it was taken 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away from them.  So if -- at -- you say that at some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point it ceased to be their money and it became the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state's money.  But then you have to show that it was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken away pursuant to due process, and consistent with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1

due process.

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Yes, and the due process 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is, as -- as Petitioners admit, and they did so below in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their petitions for rehearing to the Colorado supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  They said that the -- the depravations of their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liberty and their property comported with due process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because a conviction supported the imposition of costs, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

fees, and restitution. 

 

 

              

I believe my friend Mr. Banner said it again 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

today, so that is the due process that lead to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

deprivation. 

18 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, how can the 

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

conviction -- how -- how can the conviction have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reversed if -- if they were convicted consistent with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

due process? 

 

22 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Your Honor, there were 

  

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

errors -- there were errors in these trials, but the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is whether there was process sufficient to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow the conviction to attach, and certainly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

47 

1 

Petitioners don't argue otherwise. 

 

 

 

2 

            

If there were defects sufficient enough that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

this was a wrongful deprivation of liberty, for example, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

like the Manuel v. City of Joliet case this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

encountered.  There would be a claim for compensation 

   

  

 

 

 

 

due to a wrongful defect in the due process in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures that led to that deprivation. 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

But the question here, there was no wrongful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

conduct that occurred, there was an error that occurred. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the way that this Court's precedents have treated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is not as a return for property but as a claim for 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

compensation. 

13 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why should -- why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

isn't it a violation of the takings clause? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

16 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  For the same -- so -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Private property 

  

 

 

 

17 

18 

shall not be taken without just compensation.  Don't ask 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for any procedure or process.  Just give me just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

compensation. 

20 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Chief Justice Roberts, 

  

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

Mr. Chief Justice, that's why the -- the tax cases that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners cite don't apply here either.  That's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

precise issue there where there's simply no process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given before the taking occurs. 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

Here, the criminal process supported the 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

conviction and that was an appropriate conviction at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

time it was entered. 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

And -- and, again, if that were true, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

Mr. Chief Justice, it wouldn't explain why there's no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional requirement to provide compensation for 

 

 

 

 

 

the deprivation of liberty that occurs. 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

mean, what are you going to do?  You can't -- you can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give them back whatever time they've spent in jail.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just can't do it, but you can give them the money back. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  That's true, but -- but you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

can compensate them for it and certainly for a very long 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time the common law and other principles of -- of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisprudence have supported the notion that you can -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can either order restitution or some other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensation to account for a deprivation such as a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

deprivation of liberty. 

 

 

18 

            

And so if the rule were that this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

Petitioners' property and it was -- and it certainly was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners' liberty before it was properly, although 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not wrongfully although erroneously taken, it's unclear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why Petitioners' principle wouldn't apply to the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

question. 

24 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Was there any -- you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

know, I -- one source of the difficulty we're having, it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

seems to me, is that the Exoneration Act was addressed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

to some -- a situation very different than what we have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  It was addressed to, you know, someone wrongfully 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imprisoned for 20 years and the State felt some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligation to remedy that at least in a symbolic way. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But in order to qualify for that you do need to show all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these other things. 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

            

And -- I mean, is it completely settled?  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

guess we have the decision from the Colorado supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court that that same act applies, and this strikes me as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a very different situation. 

 

 

 

12 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

I -- I agree with you that the substantive right 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

encompassed by the Exoneration Act is very narrow, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it doesn't cover the claimed right that's at issue in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case, and what the Colorado supreme court told us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that there is no other statutory mechanism for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of compensation that Petitioners are seeking in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

this case. 

 

20 

            

So I agree with you, the Exoneration Act is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

very narrow and is not addressed to -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, thanks for 

  

 

 

 

 

23 

agreeing with me.  I don't think that's what I said. 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Okay.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess what I said 

    

   

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

is that by its -- its -- as I understand the background 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at least, the act was not addressed to the specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation.  It was addressed to a different situation, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

and yet the court below has interpreted it far more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broadly, not narrowly but broadly, to cover a -- a very 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

different situation. 

 

8 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  I don't -­

    

 

 

9 

10 

11 

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that's necessarily a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

fair understanding of what the Colorado supreme court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was thinking of. 

 

 

12 

            

What the Colorado supreme court was thinking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

of was where is the statutory authority to order this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

type of refund.  The court hadn't really encountered 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this situation before, and so it looked and it found 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only the Exoneration Act.  So what it concluded is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a matter of substance, compensation like the kind of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensation that Petitioners are seeking in this case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is available only on a claim of actual innocence. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

So I'm -- I'm agreeing with you because, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

yes, the -- the statute is that narrow, but the Colorado 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supreme court determined that as a matter of law, this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- this is public property and there must be a -- a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper claim for compensation against state funds and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there wasn't one in this case.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  General, you said a couple 

   

  

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

of times that if -- if we were to look at this as this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not public property once the conviction is vacated, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that instead it once again becomes the criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's property, the acquitted defendant's 

 

 

 

 

property, if that were true what kind of procedure would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to set up to return the property, do you think? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  Justice Kagan, I think it 

   

  

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

would -- would be fairly minimal.  I think it would 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involve, perhaps, a motion filed in the district court. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think the only burden that could, perhaps, be placed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on a criminal defendant would be proving the amounts 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that were, in fact, taken from the defendant, and then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there would have -- there could be, for example, time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limits put in place. 

 

 

 

16 

            

But if this truly is Petitioners' property, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

they -- they would have to be minimal requirements. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This is what they, they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

made a motion. 

   

20 

            

GENERAL YARGER:  That's correct.  So it 

  

  

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

would be similar to the route that they -- they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attempted to take, but the courts below held that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not have authority except in the case of Madden, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just for the -- for the -- for the fees.

me it was not their property.  In other words, even -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but even if it was, once it's in your treasury they

is their property, then due process requires them some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure to get it back, and that's the question.

their property or public funds as the Colorado supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court held, and, therefore, there's -- there can only be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a mechanism for compensation from public fund for those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

losses?  And so that is the key question in this case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

15 

            

16 

Mr. Yarger.

If there are no further questions. 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

  

 

 

 

Mr. Banner, you have four minutes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STUART BANNER 

 

 

 

 

19 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

MR. BANNER:  Okay.  Just a couple of -- a 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

21 

couple of quick things. 

 

 

 

22 

            

First of all, this -- I believe that this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

argument is the first time in this litigation that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State has come out and said, "This is -- this money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

belongs to the State."  The Colorado supreme court did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

not say that.  The Colorado -­

  

 

 

 

 

53 

2 

            

3 

either. 

4 

            

5 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It doesn't say the opposite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BANNER:  It doesn't say the opposite -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So what do we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

do about that? 

 

 

7 

            

MR. BANNER:  But -- but -- but the -- what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

the Colorado supreme court did was to skip over that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question and proceed straight to the next logical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question that would occur if it was -- the money was our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property, which is, is the Exoneration Act an adequate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure for returning it? 

 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because that could be 

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

consistent with the money's their property, but they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have an obligation to give it back. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

MR. BANNER:  Not really, because -- because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

if it was -- if the -- if the -- if the money is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State's property, then it doesn't matter.  They don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to provide any procedure to give it back; right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

So the -- the question with the -- that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Colorado supreme court actually decided, the one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing -- the issue -- I mean, the part of the decision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we're attacking is that this is an adequate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure for the return of the property.  Okay.  That's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

my first point.  The --

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  They use the word "return"? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

54 

2 

I'm looking for something here -- but, I mean, you see 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

what's -­

 

4 

            

5 

            

MR. BANNER:  Yeah.  No, I understand. 

   

  

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm looking for something 

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

here in the opinion that will -- that I could just say, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Okay.  See?  They concede that it is this man's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

property.  They concede it."  But I haven't found that 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

sentence.  That's my -­

  

 

 

10 

            

MR. BANNER:  Well, unfortunately, they don't 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

explicitly concede it.  They assume it, is what -- is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what we would say. 

 

 

 

13 

            

14 

            

15 

you. 

16 

            

17 

other -­

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 

  

 

MR. BANNER:  I know that's not helpful to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

All right.  The other -- the other -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

(Laughter.) 

19 

            

MR. BANNER:  The other quick point I want to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

make is, I just want to explain very briefly why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign immunity has never been thought to be -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide any bar to these refunds.  And that is, we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not asking for the right to bring a new lawsuit against 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State.  The State already brought these suits 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

against us when it charged Nelson and Madden with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

crimes; right?  We're not -- we're not seeking a new 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 

judgment against the State.  We already have judgments 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in these cases, judgments in our favor.  We won.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yet the State is holding on to our money as if we lost. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

We're not seeking compensation.  We're just 

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

seeking a refund of the money that we paid pursuant to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgments that no longer exist. 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, wait, as long as you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

have a minute. 

   

10 

            

(Laughter.) 

11 

            

12 

            

13 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean -­

    

 

 

MR. BANNER:  I'm not going anywhere. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- let's go over your case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

that you like, the Bank of Washington v. United States, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1832.  And it says "the law."  What law?  The common -­

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

17 

common law. 

 

18 

            

19 

            

20 

            

21 

of.  So -­

  

 

22 

            

23 

            

24 

            

MR. BANNER:  The common -- I believe the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Common. 

  

 

MR. BANNER:  I believe all those cases -­

    

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That is what I am afraid 

   

  

 

 

 

 

MR. BANNER:  -- are about the common law. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, yeah. 

  

 

 

MR. BANNER:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.
