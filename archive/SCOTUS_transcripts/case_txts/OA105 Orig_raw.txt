 (10:04 a.m.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 
first this morning in Case 105 on our original docket, 
Kansas v. Colorado.

 General Six.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE SIX
 ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

 MR. SIX:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Article III makes a clear distinction 

between the Court's appellate and original jurisdiction, 
and expressly grants Congress power to make exceptions 
and regulations for appellate jurisdiction, but Congress 
is not granted the same power over original 
jurisdiction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's an extremely 

sensitive clause in Article III.  We can decide this 
case without relying on the distinction you just 
discussed, can't we?

 MR. SIX:  Well, I think can you, and the 
Court certainly can interpret the statute not to even 
reach the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and 
avoid that constitutional conflict.  And I think the 
stronger reading of the statute arrives at that very

result.

 The statute at issue, the cost provision, 28 

U.S.C. section 1920, states:  "A judge or clerk of any 
court of the United States may tax as costs the 
following."  And it lists six subparagraphs, including 
subparagraph 3 at issue here, Fees and Disbursements for 
Printing and Witnesses.

 The statute has two terms in it that are 

defined, "judge" and "court of the United States," and, 
importantly, one term in 28 U.S.C. section 451 that is 
defined but does not appear in the cost provision, and 
that is "Justice of the United States."  "Justice of the 
United States" is defined as "the Chief Justice and the 
Associate Justices of the Supreme Court."  The cost 
provision says "a judge."  "Judge of the United States" 
is defined as including judges on the court of appeals, 
the district court, the Court of International Trade, 
essentially the listed courts and the Article III 
judges.

 JUSTICE:  But, on the other hand, "court of 

the United States" is defined specifically to include 
the Supreme Court.  So you have a contradiction no 
matter which way you flip it.  On the one hand, it says 
"judge," which does not include the Justices of the 
Supreme Court.  On the other hand, it says "court of the

United States," which does include the Supreme Court. 
So why should we pick one -- one answer to the 
contradiction rather than the other?

 MR. SIX:  You don't have to pick.  And 
you're correct, "the court of the United States" is 
defined to include the Supreme Court.  But the strongest 
reading of the statute gives meaning to all of the words 
in the statute, and it says you can be a judge who 
appears in the court of the United States.  And if you 
think about it, there's a circle of judges that are 
defined here and a circle of courts that are defined 
here, and where the two overlap, where you are both a 
judge and in the court of the United States, the statute 
should apply.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about --
MR. SIX:  And that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It also says 

"clerk."  We may not be judges, but we certainly have a 
clerk.

 MR. SIX:  You do, and 28 U.S.C. section 

1911, another provision in Title 28, specifically deals 
with the Supreme Court Clerk.  And throughout title 28, 
the Supreme Court is treated differently than the lower 
courts.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is 1911 a stand-alone

provision that would justify relief for you, or do we 
have to also refer to the general cost statute?

 MR. SIX:  I don't think the Court would 

refer to the general cost statute in its original 
jurisdiction cases at all or any authorization from 
Congress.  28 U.S.C. 19 --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but let's assume 
that we think Congress can control this, this issue, 
this question.  Now, I'm asking if 911 isn't a 
stand-alone section so that you can interpret it without 
reference to 1920.

 MR. SIX:  I mean, I would -- if your 

assumption is Congress has the power to do it and has 
done so through 1911, I read 1911 more as simply a grant 
of the discretion the Court already has.  They are 
turning over to the Supreme Court the power to have the 
clerk set costs.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If I think this case is 

controlled by 1911, do I have to refer to 1920?

 MR. SIX:  No.  I don't believe you have to 

refer to 1920.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why can't you rest your 

case just on 1911?

 MR. SIX:  Because in the original 

jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, Congress isn't given

power to make exceptions or regulations over original 
jurisdiction.  And in the 219 years of the Court's 
original practice, they have never referred to a 
congressional cost provision, and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are you saying that 1911 

doesn't cover expert witness fees because it's not 
included within the term "other necessary 
disbursements"?

 MR. SIX:  I believe the expert witness fees 
in this case were vital to the resolution.  They were --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Were they within 1911?
 MR. SIX:  I don't believe they were other 

incidental disbursements.  That's not our position.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Other necessary 

disbursements.

 MR. SIX:  Other necessary disbursements.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Incidental to the case. 
You don't that think that covers expert witness fees?
 MR. SIX:  If -- if this Court determines 

that Congress has the power, and it's done so through --
since 1911 -- has the power and done it from 1911, I 
certainly would accept that position as the result. 
However, I would point out to the Court that I think the 
expert witness costs and the work was vital to the 
resolution of the case here.

JUSTICE ALITO:  If you're reading of the 
statute is correct, then I take it we would have the 
discretion to decide what would be appropriate expert 
fees.  Is that correct?

 MR. SIX:  Absolutely.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  If that's so, why shouldn't 

we exercise that discretion by saying that the expert 
fees that are available in case of the original 
jurisdiction of this Court should be the same as the 
expert fees that would be available in a district court? 
Maybe they are too low in the district court, but why 
should there be -- why should we as a discretionary 
matter, if we have the discretion, provide for radically 
different fees depending on the court in which the case 
originates?

 MR. SIX:  Clearly the Court has the power to 

make that rule for original cases.  However, the 
original jurisdiction was developed when the States 
agreed to submit and ratify the Constitution, submit 
their sovereign immunity to resolution in the original 
jurisdiction to handle unique disputes between the 
sovereign States.  And as the Court said in Florida v. 
Georgia in 1854, "The analogies and rules and 
foundations of law that apply to private parties are not 
necessarily a good fit for sovereign States.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but Justice Alito is 
saying we have discretion, we look for guidance, we have 
guidance from Congress.  They have adhered to the $40 a 
day limit in very important cases; why don't we just 
say, Justice Alito is suggesting, that this is -- that 
this is a good guidepost for us and we will follow it?
 MR. SIX:  Because what Colorado's position 
is that they are telling you that the Special Master's 
hands were tied; that the Special Master couldn't even 
exercise that discretion in a bright line rule that 
would save $40 a day.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We are saying it's our 

discretion and our discretion is guided by what Congress 
has suggested so there is uniformity in the system and 
so forth.

 MR. SIX:  Clearly, the Court would have the 

power to do that.  However, there has only been 
approximately 200 original jurisdiction cases in the 219 
years of the Court.  To suggest that the rules --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In all those -- in all 

those cases has the Special Master ever called a court's 
witness, that is a court's expert, appointed a court's 
expert, and if so what is the pay rate for such a 
witness?  I mean, courts of the United States, district 
courts, occasionally appoint witnesses, court witnesses

as distinguished from party's witnesses.  Do you know if 
that's happened in Special Master situations?

 MR. SIX:  I can tell you it didn't happen in 

this case.  I certainly can't speak to whether it's 
happened in other cases involving special masters, so I 
don't know the answer to that.  Certainly 1920 makes a 
distinction for court- appointed experts rather than the 
expert witnesses appearing under subsection 3 of 1920.
 I think the important point to consider, 

though, is in the original jurisdiction the Court in its 
219 years of developing essentially an interstate common 
law in these cases has never relied on the trilogy of 
cost statutes that the court discussed in Crawford 
Fitting, with is I essentially Colorado's position:  You 
have to apply Rule 54D first to have the court even have 
the discretion to award costs; then you get to 1920, 
which the Court said is the arena of costs; and only 
after that do you get down to 1821, which tells you 
you're limited to $40 a day.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How do Special Master fees 

work?  The Special Master always has fees and the 
parties I think usually divide them.  How does that --
how is their authority to order them --

MR. SIX:  Sure.  Rule 53 of the Federal 

Rules of Civil Procedure deals with special masters in

the lower courts.  It has no application here and wasn't 
used.  The Special Master's fees, which total 
approximately a million dollars, just shy of that, were 
resolved by the parties after the Special Master was 
allowed to exercise discretion on that area of cost.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, what if they hadn't 

-- what if the parties hadn't resolved it?

 MR. SIX:  If they hasn't resolved the 

Special Master's --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.  How would the -- how 
would the Special -- what would be the authority of this 
Court to make an order that the Special Master be paid X 
dollars?

 MR. SIX:  Well, I think the authority of the 
Court comes from the order appointing the Special Master 
to handle the case and to do the specific things that 
were --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  We just, we just 

regressed one step.  Where does the authority come from?

 MR. SIX:  To appoint a Special Master?
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.
 MR. SIX:  It's an inherent authority the 

Court has in original jurisdiction cases.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  So that the authority to 

compensate is inherent?

MR. SIX:  The authority to compensate is 

inherent.  In the Judiciary --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Are you making -- would you 

make an inherent authority argument here?

 MR. SIX:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Regardless of original 

jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction, would you say 
that this Court simply has the inherent authority to, to 
in effect to decree these sorts of claims.

 MR. SIX:  Well, again there is a distinction 

between appellate and original and, focusing on 
original, I think the Court has entirely the authority. 
The Judiciary Act of 1789, which gave the Court 
exclusive jurisdiction over these disputes, didn't set 
forth any procedures to govern the disputes.  That's 
always been carefully preserved to the discretion of the 
Court to apply each unique case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  General Six, under your 
reading of the statute, 1934 particularly, would the 
Court have authority to charge your fees to your 
adversary, shift attorney's fees?

 MR. SIX:  Yes.  In the original jurisdiction 

the Court would have the inherent authority to do 
fee-shifting if the --

request in this case?  Why should -- why should 
attorney's fees be treated differently from expert 
witness fees?  Let me put it that way.  Or should it be 
treated differently?

 MR. SIX:  The Special Master should have the 

discretion to consider all the costs and unique 
circumstances of the case.  In this case we chose expert 
witness fees --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  We should have the 

discretion.  Why do you keep talking about the Special 
Master?  He's just -- he's just our amanuensis. 
Ultimately it's our discretion, isn't it?

 MR. SIX:  It is, and the benefit of having 

the Special Master make a recommendation is we could 
have gone through these different categories of costs 
and come up with a recommendation.  The Court certainly 
could have learned --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I take it the usual 

practice is for the parties to settle this matter and 
submit an agreed amount to the Special Master; is that 
correct?

 MR. SIX:  The way it's worked in this case 

is the Special Master has provided guidance, like on the 
Special Master's fees.  The Special Master suggested it 
wouldn't be unfair to award them two-thirds Colorado,

one-third Kansas.  After that the parties resolved it, 
just like we resolved every other issue of cost where 
the Special Master was allowed to apply that discretion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So why didn't -- -

then are we here?  We are talking about limited amounts. 
So much more is at stake on the merits and why wouldn't 
the parties just say, well, when it comes to Special 
Master fees this is what we are going to agree to.  It 
doesn't have to be limited to $40.  You can agree as 
part of a global settlement to whatever you want.

 MR. SIX:  Well, the Special Master's fees 
we resolved.  The experts fees at issue here, of course 
that bright-line rule was drawn by the Special Master 
and he never was allowed to make a recommendation to the 
Court to consider that.  In balancing -- the remedies in 
these cases are highly equitable remedies.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Would you just answer my 

question of a moment ago.  Why should expert witness 
fees be treated differently from attorney's fees?

 MR. SIX:  Well, in this case they should be 
treated differently because the model at issue that the 
experts for Kansas developed, the HI model, was used to 
prove our claims at trial, which would have --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  You used lawyers to prove 

your case, too.

MR. SIX:  Excuse me?
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  You used lawyers to prove 

your case, too.  Why should they not be compensated?

 MR. SIX:  Because we considered the special 

circumstances of the model.  It proved the claims at 
trial.  It was adopted by the Court in 2004 in Kansas v. 
Colorado to monitor compliance in the Arkansas River 
Basin.  It's the water use -- it's applied by the 
Colorado State water use rule.  So it was special 
features like that that we wanted to present to the 
Special Master to explain why the fees should be fairly 
balanced and divided in a way other than he did.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  I don't understand that to 

be an answer to why he didn't also ask for attorney's 
fees.

 MR. SIX:  Well, in a particular case where 
perhaps a order of the Supreme Court wasn't followed or 
some other situation developed, fee shifting may be 
appropriate.  In this case we felt the expert model we 
developed was so vital that it would be persuasive to 
the Special Master and fair and equitable to award it to 
us.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you know whether any 

other -- you didn't know, in answer to my last question, 
what the practice had been, but with respect to expert

fees in other original jurisdiction cases, has the Court 
ever deviated from the $40 or when it was $30, $30?

 MR. SIX:  In original cases the Court has 
never referred to any of that trilogy of cost statutes 
discussed in Crawford Fitting.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But have they ever 

approved a Special Master's recommendation of a rate for 
the expert witness that deviates from the $40?

 MR. SIX:  I think the answer to that is yes 
and I would direct the Court to New Jersey v.  New York 
in 1931, which was a division of the waters of the 
Delaware River.  And the Court pointed out in that 
opinion that a mass of evidence was presented to the 
Special Master, and on costs the Court said:  "The cost 
of the cause shall be divided 35 percent to New Jersey, 
35 to City of New York," and so on.  The "cost of the 
cause" I would argue is the cost to get the case to the 
point where it was resolved.  In the boundary dispute --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you know -- do you 
know whether there were expert witnesses in that case?
 MR. SIX:  It does not say in the published 

opinion exactly what the cost of the cause is.  However, 
from a fair reading of the -- the water distribution 
issues, I wouldn't imagine it would be possible to do 
that without experts.  But I would point the Court to

the boundary dispute cases where the Court has discussed 
the costs of surveyors, mappers, geographers, 
historians, and divided the cost in boundary disputes 
equally between the States -- not each State to bear 
their own cost, but divided them equally.

 And the -- the experts that are involved in 
resolving a boundary dispute, I think, are no different 
than the hydrologists and engineers and the type of 
experts that we used in this case.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You're right.  They are all 
different.  They did a lot of work on that.  I -- I know 
they did a lot of work on this.  Congress has a statute, 
and the statute is:  We don't care if the witness is 
Albert Einstein, Steven Spielberg, or the local 
zookeeper.  Okay.  We don't care.  We don't care if they 
did a lot of work or a little work.  We want them to be 
paid $40 a day, period.  It's too much trouble to figure 
out how much work they did.  That's what we want. 
That's the law.

 Now, Justice Alito said:  I agree with you 

for argument's sake; we are not bound by that rule.  But 
I take it his question, which I heard no answer to, is: 
Assume you are right; we are not bound by the law; 
still, why shouldn't we follow it?

Court has always tried to reach an equitable balance --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Have do you any example 

where Congress had a statute which says every court in 
the United States must pay da-da-da, whatever that 
number is; it's $382.50, okay.  Now, despite that clear 
statute, this court for exactly the same thing paid a 
different amount.  Is there any such case?

 MR. SIX:  I'm not aware of that.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  And is there 

anything in the -- in the nature of litigation?  And 
there might be.  I'm not asking it as a rhetorical 
question.  Is there anything in the nature of original 
jurisdiction lawsuits that, as a general matter, would 
call for higher fees to be paid for witnesses, or to 
make a distinction between expert witnesses and others, 
or to do other things that would complicate it?

 I'm not speaking of your case.  You have a 
wonderfully strong case in your case.  I want to know 
about in general, in original actions.

 MR. SIX:  I would suggest the only 

difference is the parties.  And the Court in its 219 
years --

JUSTICE BREYER:  If anything, the parties 

are in a better position to pay the money than the 
average person.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I assume -- I assume 
your answer is that it's -- that it's our business, and 
we don't have to agree with Congress; that we -- we may 
think $40 a day for the zookeeper and for Albert 
Einstein is ridiculous.  And, therefore, if it's up to 
us, we would adopt a different rule.  Isn't that your 
answer?

 MR. SIX:  That's exactly my answer.  And if 

you think -- if Congress can adopt a congressional --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'm not sure that 
answer is -- is at all adequate.  Number one, what is 
there, as Justice Breyer pointed out, that's so 
different about this case?

 Let's say one landowner secretly and 

intentionally is stealing another landowner's water, and 
-- and he has no legal right to do that.  And the only 
way the injured landowner can recover is to hire a very, 
very expensive expert, a hydrologist.  And by the time 
he goes to court, he is really going to lose the benefit 
of the damages.  Congress has said too bad.  That's the 
way it is.

 Why isn't it that way with States, 

especially, as Justice Breyer said, when States can 
really afford the -- afford it better than the 
landowner.  What's the difference?

MR. SIX:  The difference is the Court has 
indicated for original cases:  These are such disputes 
of a serious magnitude that can affect whole populations 
that the model case for even taking a case is where the 
acts between the States would be a causus belli, a type 
of thing that would lead to war.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I haven't seen -- I 
mean the $40 limitation makes absolutely no sense, does 
it?  I mean I never saw an expert who would agree to 
spend the day appearing in court worth being called an 
"expert" for $40.

 I mean the fact that -- I guess I'm just 
repeating Justice Scalia's question.  The fact that 
Congress has picked an arbitrary number with no basis in 
reality doesn't mean that we should do the same.

 MR. SIX:  I would agree.  The special 

master 's fees, for example, for one person -- and he 
was an excellent special|master -- were almost a million 
dollars.  The appearance fees for the 22 experts Kansas 
had amounted to approximately $30,000.  So that 
different there, I think, demonstrates the very 
unfairness --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's not unfair to have a 
rule which says each party pays his own experts, win or 
lose.  That's the rule, isn't it?

MR. SIX:  I don't think that's the rule in 

original jurisdiction cases.  At least the Court has 
never said that.  The Court has --

JUSTICE BREYER:  If you lose this case, if 

we were to follow Congress, we would have adopted a rule 
where, because the $40 is trivial, each party pays his 
own experts.  Is that right or wrong?

 MR. SIX:  I think that's correct, but we 
didn't lose.  And the Court found that Kansas proved 
that Colorado violated a compact for over -- for over 50 
years by clear and convincing evidence.  But one point 
I'd like to make --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, can we do this then? 
I think maybe in many cases that are technical in nature 
it might be quite a good thing for the losing party to 
pay the winning side's lawyers.

 MR. SIX:  The Court would have that ability 

to do that in original jurisdiction --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, should we do that, 

too?  If we are going to have them pay the experts, why 
don't we have them, the losing side, pay the lawyers' 
fees?  That would be quite a revolution.

 MR. SIX:  Because in the original 

jurisdiction cases involving prevailing parties or 
litigious cases, the Court has traditionally and

historically awarded the prevailing party costs.  And if 
Congress can make a congressional limitation on cost, 
Congress could pass a statute that says:  You have to 
take all original jurisdiction cases, or you can't use 
special masters, or you can't use certain special 
masters in cases involving Colorado and Kansas.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Could you save that for the 

lower courts?  I mean, you are -- you are trying to 
distinguish what it can say for the Supreme Court when 
the Supreme Court is the trial court vis-a-vis what it 
can say, and has said, for the lower courts.

 MR. SIX:  Yes, It could say that for the 

lower courts.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?
 MR. SIX:  Because --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You think that, so long as 
Congress could not create the lower courts at all, once 
it creates them it can -- it can tie their hands to any 
sort of absurd rules?

 MR. SIX:  I think they could pass a rule 

like they did, Rule 54 -- 53, which allows for special 
masters, and they could through the Rules Enabling Act 
pass a rule that says you can't use special masters.  I 
think you get into whether that's --

with your assumption that just because Congress need not 
have created any lower Federal courts, the only Federal 
court required by the Constitution is this Court, 
therefore once Congress creates them, it can do whatever 
it wants with them.  I -- I don't agree with that.

 MR. SIX:  Well, I would certainly focus more 

on the original jurisdiction issue here and haven't 
focused as much on that issue, but --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When we award the --

the special master's fees in original cases, do we 
specify who will bear those fees?

 MR. SIX:  Yes, you do.  In -- you do in the 

cases that have discussed costs.  For instance, in 
boundary dispute cases you have suggested that the cost 
-- the costs will be divided equally; in litigious 
cases, that they will be awarded to the prevailing 
party.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do we include the 

special master's fees as part of the costs that are 
allocated?

 MR. SIX:  Yes, and in this case the parties 
have agreed to that and never made an issue about that. 
And there is no --

we say in our orders who bears the special master's 
fees, why -- why would the parties agree to it?

 MR. SIX:  Well, in this case -- maybe I 

misheard your question.  The order appointing the 
special master did not resolve the issue of fees.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.
 MR. SIX:  And the parties did not agree to 
that ahead of time.  It was an issue to be determined 
and decided at the end of the litigation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't it -- isn't it 

customary for it to be divided 50/50?  I mean, we 
periodically will approve the fees that the special 
master charges and then they are divided between the 
parties.  And I thought that they were divided 50/50. 
Is that not so?

 MR. SIX:  Well, as the case progressed, the 
special master submitted bills that were divided 50/50. 
At the conclusion of the case the parties suggested 
reasons and special circumstances that should allow the 
special master to apply discretion.

 He then suggested it wouldn't be unfair to 
award the special master fee costs two-thirds Colorado, 
one-third Kansas because of the unique features of the 
case.  And the parties then settled the special master 
fees with that guidance.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Of course, I think you 

gave the answer earlier.  Rule 53 allows for the -- an 
order to say that one or both parties shall pay the 
special master fee.  So if we are going to follow other 
analogies, we don't have much problem here with expert 
witness fees -- pardon me -- with special master fees. 
It's under Rule 53.

 Of course, you say we don't have to follow 
that as a model, but it is a model if we -- if we were 
to look to congressional and -- and to other rules.

 MR. SIX:  It is a model; however, the Court 
has always carefully preserved its discretion to treat 
each dispute between the sovereign states as a unique 
dispute.  And the Court never even enacted an original 
action rule until 1939, so after 150 years.  And in 1939 
the Court enacted Rule 5, which just set up the bare 
minimums of commencing the action.  And Rule 17 today 
has essentially the same framework that tells the 
parties how to start the action but reserves all the 
other rules to the discretion of the special master.

 It does point to the Federal Rules of Civil 

Procedure and the Rules of Evidence as guides but not 
binding, mandatory rules that tie the Court's hand.

that we are the only court that is required by the 
Constitution.  But we are -- we are not just the only 
court for original actions in -- in -- in all appeals. 
Can Congress prescribe division of costs and expenses in 
the appeals that come to us from the lower Federal 
courts?

 MR. SIX:  Well, the Court has, in 1913, 

determined that -- excuse me, in 1912, that when a case 
is affirmed, the Supreme Court can adjudge costs for 
damages and delay.  So they have directed, I think, a --
a regulation at the appellate jurisdiction, but never at 
the original jurisdiction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You mean Congress 

has done that?

 MR. SIX:  Congress, I'm sorry.
 I would like to reserve the remainder of my 

time for rebuttal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. SUTHERS

1821 of Title 28 is unambiguous.  It provides that a 
witness in attendance at any court of the United States 
shall be paid an attendance fee of $40 per day in 
addition to travel and accommodation allowances.

 Section 451 of Title 28 defines "court of 
the United States" to include this Court, the Supreme 
Court of the United States, and that definition has been 
part of the statute since 1948.  Because witness fees 
are only at issue in the Supreme Court in cases of 
original jurisdiction, it's apparent that Congress 
intended the limits set forth in 1821 to apply in such 
cases.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So what if they said 

in original actions no fees shall be allowed to any 
special master appointed by the Supreme Court?

 MR. SUTHERS:  Chief Justice, it would then 
be up to the Court to decide whether that's somehow an 
intrusion into your --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If we allow -- if we 

allow Congress to regulate fees in our original 
jurisdiction in that matter, it seems to me that we've 
given up the principle and we are just negotiating over 
price.

that you've allowed Congress to legislate some aspects

of your original jurisdiction.  Congress has told you in 
what is now Section 1251 that your original jurisdiction 
is not entirely exclusive.  Only State versus State is 
exclusive, and all the rest of your jurisdiction is 
nonexclusive.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Isn't this an area, 
though, where we should be particularly sensitive?  In 
other words, one reason that we were given original 
jurisdiction in these cases is that the States were 
afraid of what Congress would do in its own courts, the 
courts it set up -- might set up under the Constitution.
 I think it would be surprising if you told 

the States at the framing that Congress gets to regulate 
this original jurisdiction where you, for example, can 
sue the Federal Government, that -- I think that would 
be surprising.  It would not be regarded by them as a 
significant safeguard.

 MR. SUTHERS:  Chief Justice, if it was such 
a sensitive issue, why is it we are now in 2008 and this 
Court has never decided to enact any kind of rules --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we don't know -- -
General Suthers, do we know what has happened in past 
original jurisdiction cases?  Maybe it hasn't come up

commensurate with the qualifications and the work that 
the expert has done.  We don't know if that has or 
hasn't happened in the past, do we?

 MR. SUTHERS:  Justice Ginsburg, we -- we 
looked at it very carefully -- and it's difficult to 
research -- but we could not find an original 
jurisdiction case where there was an award of witness 
fees outside the -- this $40 per day limitation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did you find any cases 
where the special master had appointed his own witness 
as distinguished from the parties?

 MR. SUTHERS:  No.  We did not.  But --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you -- but you 

recognize that if a special master appointed a witness, 
or the court, that that witness would be paid a 
compensatory fee?

 MR. SUTHERS:  Whatever the special master 

determined was appropriate.  That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Now, in a -- in a case 
like this one, where the nature of the work that the 
expert did seemed to be very helpful to both sides, 
isn't it odd that the special master chose the court 
expert, that expert would be compensated fairly but if 
you have one party calls an expert who renders great 
service to the Court, to both sides, doesn't get

compensated?  Isn't that an anomaly?

 MR. SUTHERS:  The special master, Justice 

Ginsburg, found clear direction from the statute and did 
not believe that he had an option in the matter, if 
you're talking about the unfairness of it.  Number one, 
this situation here is no more unfair to Kansas than any 
litigant in Federal court.  And number two, it's 
appropriate matter to take to Congress.

 The last time they changed it was 1990 from 

$30 to $40.  I think it's time to revisit it.  But it 
is, in fact, what Congress has dictated should be the 
compensation --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not a matter of 

unfairness to Einstein anyway.  I mean, you know, the 
expert witness is going to get his money.

 MR. SUTHERS:  That's correct, Justice.  They 

certainly did in this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The question is --
MR. SUTHERS:  Both sides can vouch for that.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The question is whether one 

side can get some money from the other to help pay for 
it.

 Do you happen to know whether at the time 

the original jurisdiction of this Court was established, 
there was such a thing as the charging of expert witness

 MR. SUTHERS:  Justice Scalia, I do not.  We

do know --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't either.
 MR. SUTHERS:  -- that it's 1853 when for the 

first time Congress, desiring to have uniform fees, 
began the structure of expert witness fees.  It started 
at $1.50 a day, in 1853.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Do you -- may I ask you a 

statutory question just about the application of the 
statute.  As -- as you have pointed out, if the $40 
applies it's because I -- it is, in effect, a 
determination of a particular item under section 1920: 
Judge and clerk of any court of the United States may 
tax its cost.  My question is this.  One of the items 
covered by 1920, one of the items that a judge or clerk 
may tax, is fees of the clerk.

 Under section 1911, which relates entirely 

to the Supreme Court, there is a provision that the 
Supreme Court may fix the fees to be charged by its 
clerk.  That is totally redundant if 1920 covers the 
Supreme Court of the United States.

 Doesn't it follow, therefore, that section 
1920 was -- despite its reference to any court of the 
United States, doesn't it follow that that statute was

not intended to apply to the Supreme Court; and doesn't 
it follow from that that either the Supreme Court's 
authority is to fix the fees if this is a fee to be 
charged by the clerk or, in the alternative, that there 
is no statute on it at all?

 But the main point is unless 1911 is totally 

redundant in -- in referring to fixing the fees to be 
charged by its clerk, then 1920 must not cover the 
Supreme Court.

 MR. SUTHERS:  Justice Ginsburg, 1920 --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  I'm greatly flattered.

 MR. SUTHERS:  Justice Souter, Justice 

Souter, sorry.  Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  You're not the first to 

have done that.

 MR. SUTHERS:  1920 there may be some 

redundancies in it, but it's much more expansive than is 
1911.  It talks about court reporter fees, printing --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Oh, we didn't -- no 
question about that.  I recognize 1920 goes a lot 
further.  But there is no -- there is no need in 1911 to 
say to that the Supreme Court may -- may fix the fees to 
be charged by its clerk if the Supreme Court is already

covered by 1920.

 MR. SUTHERS:  Justice Souter, I think if you 

look at the history of it, 1911 was enacted at the 
same -- there is a separate statute -- statute that 
applies to the court of appeals and to the district 
courts.  I think it's like 1913 and 1914.  So I -- I --
I don't think that you can --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  In other words, if it's 
redundancy it proves too much is what you're saying?

 MR. SUTHERS:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.
 MR. SUTHERS:  I think the important thing 
about 1911, in response to Justice Kennedy's question, 
it is limited to fees charged by the Supreme Court 
clerk, cost of serving process and incidental 
disbursements.  It does not address witness fees in --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you think it includes 

printing fees?

 MR. SUTHERS:  1911 does not, unless --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You don't -- you don't 

think that --

MR. SUTHERS:  Incidental disbursements?
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- what number here?  You 

don't think that 1911 would allow the clerk to charge 
for printing fees?

MR. SUTHERS:  As an incidental disbursement, 

it may.  But it clearly does not address witness fees.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the reason I ask is 
because printing, in 1920, printing and witness fees are 
in -- in the same sentence.

 MR. SUTHERS:  And I -- I don't know whether 

printing would be considered incidental disbursements.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So if you allowed 

printing, then I think it would allow witnesses under 
1911. Citing Crawford Fitting, this Court made clear 
that no statute will be construed to authorize taxing 
witness fees and costs, unless it refers explicitly to 
witness fees.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It is -- I mean, if you 
want to really get a little complicated, the -- you 
have -- you have 11, and 11 talked about the Supreme 
Court fees and then we have 20 and that talks about all 
the other fees, right?  Okay.  So the thing is, you 
can't pay money in the United States unless have you 
some authorization, but 1911 gives the Supreme Court 
some authorization to fix fees.

 Now we look back at 1821.  And 1821 tells 
you how much mileage per diem and subsistence will be. 
It says he will be paid an attendance fee of $40 per 
day.  Doesn't say you couldn't pay him more.  Just says

that's what he is entitled to.  Now of course, in the 
lower courts, you can't pay him more because there is no 
authority to pay him more.  But in the Supreme Court, 
there is authority to pay him more.  That comes out of 
1911.

 I mean, I grant you that this is -- what I'm 
actually doing here is I'm trying to avoid this problem 
of whether Congress can start legislating the details of

Kansas, were trying to get around, in Federal court,

Fitting.  In that case you held that the prevailing

own expert, is limited by the statute unless we're 
talking about a contract or express statutory --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Which part did they think 

limited it?  Was it 1821 they thought limited it?

 MR. SUTHERS:  Yes.  And by the way, there is 

a contract here.  It's the compact between, the 1949 
compact between Kansas and Colorado, and --

JUSTICE BREYER:  In an ordinary case, if a 
witness -- doesn't -- never does go to court, but just 
goes to a deposition, that's the only thing, he goes to 
a deposition, does he get paid the 40 dollars?  He goes 
to a lawyer's office; he's never in attendance at a 
court.  But Do they count that as being in attendance at 
a court?

 MR. SUTHERS:  I don't believe so, Justice 

Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Then where is his --
MR. SUTHERS:  It's liberally construed.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  What?
 MR. SUTHERS:  It's liberally construed.  You

one thing on the table if I could.  How do you deal with 
the problem that Justice Ginsburg raises:  If a court 
wants to appoint an independent expert and pay him more 
than $40 a day?  Do you say that's flatly prohibited? 
And if it's not flatly prohibited, what is the authority 
for doing so, other than 1911?

 MR. SUTHERS:  Justice Stevens, nothing 
prevents higher compensation for a court-appointed 
expert.  We are talking about --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But what authorizes it? 

Doesn't 1911 authorize it?

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, then what does?
 MR. SUTHERS:  The inherent authority of the 

Court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Then why don't you have 

the inherent authority to pay expert witness fees a 
little more money, then?

 MR. SUTHERS:  Because the statute addresses 

that.  It does not address --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The Constitution says that 

no money shall be -- shall be withdrawn from the 
Treasury except by appropriations made by law.  I think 
-- I think you need a law to spend -- to spend the 
government's money.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  You're not spending the 

government's money; you're spending the litigant's 
money.

 MR. SUTHERS:  Well, in the case of the -- of 

the Court appointing an expert, it is typical at the 
conclusion of the case as part of the cost for the judge 
to determine what was an appropriate award the losing 
party -- what they should pay as part of that expert's 
expense.  But that's not what we are dealing with in 
1821.

now, as long as I'm starting down the road to outer 
space, why not -- could we say, look, they were very 
impressive models these people did; on both sides they 
had terrific experts, very expensive; and would we have 
the authority to say to the master, although you didn't 
treat them as your experts, you should have done, for 
purposes of paying them.

 MR. SUTHERS:  Justice Breyer, you are the 

Supreme Court and if you found that this statute --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't want to be

statute was an intrusion which somehow violated your,

why would you want to get into the business -- going to 
Justice Alito's point -- you have so far refrained from 
enacting your own rules on this highly procedural matter 
of expert witness fees.

you have done it before in -- in highly procedural 
matters where you do not -- no one here is doing 
anything that prevents your exercise of original 
jurisdiction, that expands your exercise of original 
jurisdiction.  The cases also say that your original 
jurisdiction is self-executing, doesn't need any 
statutory implementation; but this is a -- a totally 
procedural matter, much as -- in fact, I think less of 
an intrusion, when the -- when the Congress said to you 
these cases will not be exclusive jurisdiction.  Even 
though they are part of your original jurisdiction.

 This is a very procedural matter.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Could I ask you what --

what are the fees to be charged by its clerk, referred 
to in 1911.  "Supreme Court may fix the fees to be 
charged by its clerk," and then the next paragraph says 
the fees of the clerk.  Is that what the first paragraph 
refers to, the fees of the clerk?  Or does it mean other 
fees that the clerk charges which could include costs? 
Are the costs part of the fees to be charged by the 
clerk?

 MR. SUTHERS:  I don't believe so, Justice 

Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They are not?  Fees of the 
clerk -- in 1920 says fees of the clerk in Marshall, but

that could be taxed as costs.  Right?  A judge or clerk 
can tax as costs the following.

 1911 says Supreme Court may fix "the fees to 

be charged by its clerk," and you say that doesn't 
include costs.  Boy, it's a messy, messy bunch of 
statutes, don't you think?

 MR. SUTHERS:  Not -- not a whole lot more so 

than others I've seen.
 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well --
MR. SUTHERS:  By the way --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's some comfort.
 MR. SUTHERS:  -- it has been pointed out to 
me in this compensation of court-appointed experts that 
that is specifically addressed in section 1920, 
paragraph 6, compensation of court-appointed experts is 
covered there.  So there is that statute authority which 
you indicated there should be.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but that taxes costs, 
and it doesn't say the Supreme Court may fix costs.  May 
fix the fees to be charged by its clerk, which you say 
don't include costs.

 MR. SUTHERS:  I don't believe they do.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So that wouldn't allow to 

us fix that.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Except 1911 may do two 

things.  Number one it may authorize the Supreme Court 
to fix the fees to be charged by the clerk.  And then in 
the second paragraph it for taxing of those fees, the 
cost of serving process and other necessary 
disbursements; so it does two things.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it tells you how they 
are to be taxed.  It doesn't say what their level is to 
be.  May be taxed against the litigants as the court 
directs, but I don't see any authority to fix them --
fix the amounts.  It's not a very good statute, really.
 MR. SUTHERS:  If I may, once again going to 
the issue of why I think some uniformity is important in 
original jurisdiction cases, is because so many of the 
cases are not exclusive jurisdiction; and there is in 
fact a need for uniformity here; and the fact that this 
Court has not chosen to issue a conflicting rule, I 
think is very significant.

 If in fact you had set an appropriate fee 
for expert witness fees in case original jurisdiction, 
and Congress came along and said gee, no; it shouldn't 
be that, you should be stuck with $40, then we might 
have some kind of a constitutional issue here; but 
absent that, I simply don't --

Congress had done nothing?  In other words, let's say 
they haven't addressed costs at all.  Would we be able 
to set what we think are reasonable attendance costs?
 MR. SUTHERS:  I would concede that you --

you probably could.  But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Pursuant to what 

authority?

 MR. SUTHERS:  Your inherent authority over 

original jurisdiction cases.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if we have 

inherent authority over original jurisdiction cases, how 
does it -- how come it disappears whenever Congress 
decides to legislate in the area?

 MR. SUTHERS:  Because Congress is 

entitled -- you've recognized their right to deal with 
certain types of issues.  I find it very interesting 
that Kansas cited Ford v Georgia, because that case says 
Congress has undoubtedly the right to prescribe the 
process and mode of proceeding in original jurisdiction 
cases as fully as in other Federal courts, but that the 
omission to legislate such process does not deprive the 
Court of its constitutionally conferred jurisdiction. 
If this is something you have historically --

level of fees a mode of proceeding?

MR. SUTHERS:  Chief Justice, I would argue 
that the setting of fees is a procedural matter; and it 
is -- and has to do with the mode of proceeding in a 
case.  That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there any -- do 

you think $40 a day for an expert is a realistic 
assessment of what experts charge?

 MR. SUTHERS:  Absolutely not, Chief Justice. 

And in fact, of course, as I think Justice Breyer 
pointed out, Einstein does not only get $40 a day.  We 
pay them a lot of money; but Congress has decided $40 is 
what they -- what they get.  Congress ought to revisit 
it.  There is no question about it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Parties pay a lot -- a 
lot of expenses and then they may be -- may or not be 
reimbursed to the prevailing party; but the prevailing 
party in our system certainly doesn't get anything like 
the full cost of the litigation.

 MR. SUTHERS:  That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg.  They certainly do not.  Experts in this case 
were paid lots and lots of money, and they don't even 
get that when the court has -- it's not -- at least the 
trial courts --

more.

either.

 MR. SUTHERS:  That's exactly right.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  May I just get clear on 

your view of inherent power?  As I understand it, you're 
-- when you answered it, in a situation in which the 
slate is completely clean, we would have inherent power, 
you're using "inherent power" in effect to be a kind of 
default power.  If Congress hasn't acted, somebody has 
got to do something.  That's got to be us, so -- so we 
would have the authority.  But you are not using the 
term "inherent power" in the sense of being a power 
which is sort of essential and indefeasible by Congress 
in any respect.  Is that correct?

 MR. SUTHERS:  That's correct, Justice 

Souter, to the extent that there was nothing applicable 
to this and it came before you, should expert witnesses 
get compensated some -- some amount, Congress hasn't 
spoken on it, I would think, as a matter of default, you 
could say yes.  And -- but --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Do you think there is --

there is any inherent power in, let's say, this Court --

statute saying the Supreme Court of the United States 
shall not have authority to punish direct contempt, 
would that statute be constitutional in your view?

 MR. SUTHERS:  No, Justice Souter, it would 
not be because then it's interfering with your ability 
to do what courts do as a central matter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Isn't that a pretty 

slippery slope then that you're on?  Because if in fact 
parties are going to be reluctant to -- to hire the kind 
of experts that are necessary, unless they think that at 
the end of the day there is going to be some kind of an 
equitable disposition of the expense, at that point that 
starts interfering with the conduct of the kind of 
business that the Court ought to be engaged in.

 MR. SUTHERS:  Justice Souter, it's not 

telling you how to decide cases.  And there is another 
case before the Court in which Congress reinstated 
time-barred cases.  That's the kind of thing that 
intrudes on your judicial function.  Setting witness 
fees doesn't come close to doing that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if Congress -- really 

you think Congress could set any -- there's not some 
point at which it is so destructive of the process here? 
What if Congress provides that the winning -- that the 
winning party shall pay the costs of the losing party?

I would suggest it might be to the -- did they do 
something wholly irrational like that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But that would be a matter 
of due process, not a matter of inherent power, I take 
it.

 MR. SUTHERS:  I believe that's correct. 

That's correct.

 Members of the Court, Special Master 

Littleworth spent a lot of time on this case.  He has 
been fair, competent, and conscientious in resolving all 
the issues before this Court, including this issue of 
expert witness fees.  It was the plain language of the 
statute and the clear direction of the case law that led 
him to his conclusion that the expert witnesses' fees 
were limited by statute in this case.  We would ask you 
to deny Kansas's exception to the final report, and that 
the Court should enter the proposed judgment and decree.

 Mr. Chief Justice.  If there are no other 

questions from the Court, I'll conclude my argument.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE SIX

 ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

 MR. SIX:  1920 didn't appear in 1948 

magically.  It came from the 1853 Fee Act.  And the 
language in the Fee Act was, "A judge shall tax costs." 
"A judge" -- it says, "Costs shall be taxed by a judge 
or clerk of the court."  I'm sorry.  And 1920 says, "A 
judge or clerk of any court of the United States."  In 
1853, as the Court has discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, 
the Fee Act applied to the circuit courts.  It says that 
in its title.  And "judge" in 1853 meant a lower court 
judge.  In 1920, we have exactly the same word -- "a 
judge" who can tax costs -- and we have a definition 
that Congress tells us it means exactly the same thing.

 Under Colorado's reading "court of the 

United States" would expand to read "judge" right out of 
the statute, and it would make the statute apply to 
"magistrate judge," for example, which is not included 
in the definition, but they're somebody who wears a robe 
and presides over a court of the United States, and it 
would apply to Justices, even though 451 in title 28 
defines "Justices" as a separate group.  So that's not 
--

the word "judge."  A "judge of the United States" is a 
Supreme Court Justice or a judge of an inferior court.

 MR. SIX:  And certainly Congress isn't tied 
to the way the word is used in the Constitution, no more 
than the paper I got on my way in here told me not to 
refer to any of you as "judges."

 The point, I think, is that the Fee Act was 
carried forward to 1920, and the language is almost the 
same.  The only thing they have added is a definition of 
"court of the United States."  And if after 168 years, 
Congress is going to tread on the Court's original 
jurisdiction, they ought to at least have some express 
language that they intend to do that -- do so, where the 
Court could at the very least adopt a clear statement 
rule that would require Congress to say, "We are going 
to do this now.  We've never done it in our history, but 
now after 168 years we are."

 Not only that, Colorado's position relies on 

the fact that they did this in 1948, and it's gone 
unnoticed by the Court, any major treatise, or 
commentary --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm sorry.  I got mixed up 
on my dates.  The words "in any court of the United" --
what the words are now is "in any court."  It says 
"court of the United States includes" in 451 courts.

When did that language come in?
 MR. SIX:  In 1948.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  In '48?
 MR. SIX:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So the inclusion wasn't 
there till then.  Now, normally, in the '48 revision, 
the rule is they intended to make no substantive change. 
When they did intend to make a substantive change, they 
said as much.  So is there anything in the history of 
that that suggests they intended to make a substantive 
change here?

 MR. SIX:  No, there isn't.  And they changed

JUSTICE BREYER:  So, in other words, the 
language "in addition to the courts listed in section 
451 of this title," that -- those words I just said have 
no appearance in the statutes before 1948?  Yes or no.

 MR. SIX:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  They do appear before?
