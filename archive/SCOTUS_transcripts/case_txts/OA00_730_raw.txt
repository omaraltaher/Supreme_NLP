CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 00-730, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta.


Mr. Pendley.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. PENDLEY


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. PENDLEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


In 1989, the small family business that is


Adarand lost a Federal contract because of a racial


program and the race of its owner, Randy Pesh. 


In 1995, this Court held that Adarand had


standing to seek forward-looking relief because that


program prevented it from competing on an equal footing.


In 2001, Adarand returns to this Court because


it still can't compete on an equal footing.


QUESTION:  Mr. Pendley, treat, if you will,


fairly shortly coming up in your argument, the Government


says that in a direct procurement program, these sort of


preferences that you're challenging are simply not used in


Colorado.  You say they are.  Do we simply have a factual


dispute here? 


MR. PENDLEY:  No, Your Honor.  The evidence is


quite clear that the program still exists in Colorado.

There are a number of mechanisms -- the Government calls


them means; Adarand calls them tools or mechanisms -- by


which the Government implements this complex statutory


scheme that it has.  It has monetary incentives, which


included the subcontracting compensation clause, which the


United States now asserts is turned off in Colorado as a


result of the benchmark studies. 


But in addition --


QUESTION:  You don't challenge those, as I


understand it. 


MR. PENDLEY:  Your Honor, Adarand has challenged


all manner in which the --


QUESTION:  But they apply only in the State


subsidized programs, and you're -- you're claiming that


your challenge is limited to the Federal programs. 


MR. PENDLEY:  No, Your Honor.  The monetary


incentives apply in the direct Federal procurement


program.  In --


QUESTION:  I thought -- I thought the monetary


incentives have been declared unconstitutional by the


district court, affirmed by the Tenth Circuit, and that's


out of the case. 


MR. PENDLEY:  Not at all, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  -- what they call the


subcontracting --

 MR. PENDLEY:  Compensation clause, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Compensation clause?  Didn't both


courts hold that that was unconstitutional? 


MR. PENDLEY:  What happened was that the -- the


district court held that the entire program, all of


section 8(d) of the Small Business Act, was


unconstitutional.  The United States, on the 20th of June


of '96, asked the court to narrow its decision to include


only the subcontracting compensation clause.  On the 23rd


of June, the district court declined. 


At the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Tenth


Circuit held the district court was right as to the 1996


subcontracting compensation clause, but there was a new


subcontracting compensation clause now in place, and it


had been changed sufficiently.


QUESTION:  The one that you were complaining


about last time around, that one has been held invalid. 


Is that so? 


MR. PENDLEY:  It -- it -- Your Honor, it is the


same.


QUESTION:  The Government hasn't challenged


that.  Is that --


MR. PENDLEY:  Excuse me.  I don't understand. 


QUESTION:  The Tenth Circuit, I thought, said


that the clause that you were complaining about last time

around was invalid.  It agreed with the district court to


that extent.  The Government hasn't challenged that


determination.  So, what you were originally complaining


about is now over and gone.  Is that correct? 


MR. PENDLEY:  No, Your Honor, it is not correct. 


The subcontracting compensation clause is still alive and


it still applies against Adarand.  As this Court held in


Jacksonville, simply removing that selfsame program does


not allow the case to be moot.  The -- the United States


is still implementing --


QUESTION:  You just answered my question. 


MR. PENDLEY:  I'm sorry. 


QUESTION:  You said they -- they removed the


program. 


MR. PENDLEY:  No, Your Honor.  They did not


remove the program. 


QUESTION:  I didn't ask you if the case was moot


or not because of it, but it's no longer what -- the


specific thing you were complaining about no longer


exists.  Is that right? 


MR. PENDLEY:  It is not right, Your Honor. 


Adarand continues to maintain the subcontracting


compensation clause is in place in Colorado.  It is in


place in Colorado and it applies against Adarand.


QUESTION:  If we disagreed with you on that, are

there other issues on which -- which are live and which


you have standing --


MR. PENDLEY:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  And what are those?


MR. PENDLEY:  Absolutely, Your Honor. 


Your Honor, on the issue of standing or


mootness, this Court held in 1995 that Adarand had


standing, and as the Court said in its Adarand 2000


opinion, in the Adarand case and in the Laidlaw case, the


issue is now is not an issue of standing but one of


mootness.  Has, indeed, the Adarand case been mooted? 


It has not been mooted because the United States


in its tool bag of mechanisms by which it applies this


program -- it still has others. 


To answer your question, Justice Kennedy, it


has, for example, the monetary -- the mandatory


subcontracting plans.  These are plans that the United


States requires of contractors to adopt, and Adarand put


three of them in the lodging at tabs A, B, and C and on


through K of our -- Adarand's lodging in its reply brief


and which the United States, on three separate instances


since this Court ruled in Adarand 2000 -- where the United


States has used the mandatory subcontracting plans against


Adarand.  And in fact, all three guardrail portions of


those three contracts were won by -- I'm sorry.  It's in

QUESTION:  Are these in --

QUESTION:  Are these provisions you just


mentioned in paragraphs 4 through 6 of 15 U.S.C. 637 --


MR. PENDLEY:  Yes, Your Honor, they are.  They


are --


QUESTION:  That's -- those are the plans as to


which the court of appeals said in -- in one sentence, a


rather terse comment, nor are we presented with any


indication that Adarand has standing to challenge


paragraphs 4 through 6. 


MR. PENDLEY:  Well, as this Court said in


Adarand 2000, the courts and parties have been confused as


to the difference between standing and mootness, and the


Tenth Circuit was confused as to mootness and standing,


resulting in the Court's Adarand 2000 decision and it


appears to be still confused as to the two. 


QUESTION:  It -- it says that you have no


standing to attack these paragraphs that we've just


discussed, and -- and you don't challenge that in your


petition for certiorari or in your -- or in your opening


brief.


MR. PENDLEY:  Well, Your Honor, we believe the


issue of standing is always before the Court.  It was not

an issue -- it was not an issue in the original petition


in 1989.  Yet, standing was addressed, as it properly is


always by the Court.


QUESTION:  The issue of lack of standing is not


always before the Court.  The Court -- the Court certainly


cannot render a judgment in a case where there is no


standing but where a party doesn't -- doesn't present any


-- any standing material, the Court is not going to go


looking to see whether, in fact, there is or not.


MR. PENDLEY:  Well, Your Honor, the --


QUESTION:  All the cases you're citing are cases


where both of the parties assumed standing and the Court


looked into it on its own.  But -- but where -- where


standing has been denied below and -- and the party


doesn't come forward challenging that denial, I don't know


of any case where we say standing is nonetheless an issue.


MR. PENDLEY:  Well, Adarand believes that


standing is under rule 14(a) is fairly included within the


questions presented because it was plain error for the


Tenth Circuit below to hold that Adarand did not have


standing because the Tenth Circuit below addressed the SCC


and yet declined to address the statutory program that


we're --


QUESTION:  Mr. Pendley.


MR. PENDLEY:  Yes, ma'am.

 QUESTION:  Did you challenge below the Small


Business Act provision, section 8(d)(4) through (6)?


MR. PENDLEY:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  In


Adarand's amended complaint on the 22nd of January of


1996, Adarand challenged all the statutes, all the


regulations, and all the contract provisions promulgated


as a result thereof. 


QUESTION:  Were -- were -- did Adarand bid on


contracts issued by States with Federal assistance?


MR. PENDLEY:  Yes.  Adarand has bid on State-


assisted or Federal-assisted State contracts --


QUESTION:  Were they at issue in the suit? 


MR. PENDLEY:  It's not at issue in this case,


Your Honor.


QUESTION:  So, the only thing that you now say


you're challenging are contracts -- direct contracts --


MR. PENDLEY:  Yes, ma'am. 


QUESTION:  -- with the Federal --


MR. PENDLEY:  Yes, Your Honor.  It's the direct


Federal procurement program which remains unchanged.


QUESTION:  And the Tenth Circuit seemed to think


that you did not challenge those Small Business Act


sections that I referred to. 


MR. PENDLEY:  Well, the Tenth Circuit was


absolutely incorrect.  It's plain error for the Tenth

Circuit to reach that conclusion.  The Tenth Circuit


looked at -- for example, this Court held that Adarand


challenged two things:  number one, the financial


incentives; and number two, the statutory and regulatory


regimes, the racial presumptions that are their


foundation.


QUESTION:  Can you cite us any filing in the


district court that specifically referred to section


8(d)(4)?


MR. PENDLEY:  Yes, Your Honor.  In -- on --


first of all, on the 20th of June of 1996, the United


States appealed to the district court and said Adarand


only challenged the SCC.  It didn't challenge everything. 


The district court denied that. 


Then on the -- on the 19th of -- of August of


1998, the United States, in its appeal to the Tenth


Circuit, said the district court held that Adarand had


standing to challenge everything and -- and we don't think


that's true.  In our --


QUESTION:  Well, we have a joint appendix. 


Could you refer us to the pages where you challenged


section 8(d)(4) through (6)?  Can you say on page so and


so of the joint appendix, it shows that we did that?


MR. PENDLEY:  Well, Your Honor, I -- I can cite


to the pleadings that Adarand filed in this case where

Adarand asserted that all parts of the program, all the


statutory provisions that allow this program to exist and


the United States to implement it, have been -- have been


challenged by Adarand. 


QUESTION:  What it says on --


QUESTION:  Was there a separate question in your


petition for certiorari addressed to 8(d)(4) through (6)?


MR. PENDLEY:  No, there was not a separate


question addressed to that, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  They didn't say you didn't file it. 


What the -- what the circuit said in footnote 32 on page


84 of your appendix, the parties have not addressed


paragraph (4) of section 8(d) at all, and because there is


no indication from the parties that Adarand has or will


bid for contracts governed by that paragraph's


requirement, we do not address it in great detail. 


Now, I take it that the problem here is that


since that time, you have tried to get a contract and you


have tried to get a contract from a contractor who has in


the contract the very clause you're trying to attack. 


If I'm right about that, what are we supposed to


do?  The lower court didn't address the issue you want to


raise.  The lower court thought you had no standing at


that time.  You probably didn't have standing at that


time.  You probably do have standing now.  So, what is it

you suggest we do?  Do we send it back to the lower court? 


Do we dig the whole thing?  Do we do something else?


MR. PENDLEY:  Your Honor, Adarand had challenged


consistently -- first -- first of all, the subcontracting


compensation clause is one mechanism that the United


States developed to implement the statutory program that


Adarand challenges.  Adarand challenges not just that tool


or mechanism by which it's implemented, but those statutes


that are used. 


This Court held in Adarand 2000 that the


subcontracting compensation clause came directly out of


8(d)(4)(E).  That was the holding of this Court in -- in


Adarand 2000.  And so when the Tenth Circuit holds in the


footnote to which the Justice cited, that -- that the


parties have not discussed it, in fact there was no need


to discuss it because it was clear that this was the


mechanism by which -- this was the statutory mandate by


which the United States used the subcontracting


compensation clause against Adarand.


QUESTION:  What's the answer to Justice Breyer's


question? 


time --


MR. PENDLEY:  That Adarand had standing at that


QUESTION:  No.  What are we supposed to do?  He


gave you a premise and said, what do we do?  Do we send it

back?  Do we dig?  Do we something else? 


QUESTION:  But -- but the premise was that you


had no standing at the time the court of appeals wrote


this decision.  Do you agree with that premise? 


MR. PENDLEY:  I do not, Your Honor.


The reason Adarand does not agree with that


premise is because the Laidlaw decision holds that once


Adarand had standing, as a result of this Court's 1995


decision, that standing continued until such time as the


United States somehow made the case moot as the result of


the revocation of --


QUESTION:  Well, I thought Laidlaw stood for the


principle that standing is judged as of the time the suit


is filed. 


MR. PENDLEY:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And subsequent changes affect


mootness possibly, but not standing.


MR. PENDLEY:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Is that correct? 


MR. PENDLEY:  That's my understanding. 


But -- so -- the question before the Court --


QUESTION:  My question was not quite so


technical.  It seemed to me that you're trying to raise a


serious issue and the fact is that the Tenth Circuit never


addressed it.  Now, the reason that the Tenth Circuit

never addressed it is what they say; it's because you


didn't address section (4) -- subsection (4) of section


8(d).  And they didn't address it because there was no


indication there would be any practical problem in the


future because you didn't -- they at time thought you


weren't bidding on the contract.  Things have changed.


That's the premise of my question.  It's not a


technical question.  It makes that practical assumption


that's in paragraph -- in footnote 32.  And so my question


was, what should we do?


MR. PENDLEY:  Conclude that the Tenth Circuit


was wrong in stating what it stated in that footnote


because Adarand specifically challenged 8(d)(4).


QUESTION:  Well, you raised it, but you surely


didn't address it.  In fact, you didn't even address it in


your principal brief, and the Government has certainly not


addressed it in their -- in their principal brief because


everybody thought the fight was about these -- these new


regulations that -- that modify the -- the Subcontractor


Compensation Clause, rather -- rather than this other


clause. 


Now, you may well have preserved the objection,


but the fact is it hasn't been discussed below and it has


barely been argued in the briefs here.  Your reply brief


is devoted to it, but the Government's principal brief

certainly isn't. 


MR. PENDLEY:  Well, what -- what Adarand


addressed was the -- at the Tenth Circuit was the


constitutionality of this -- of this racial program, and


-- and there are a number of mechanisms by which the


racial program is implemented against Adarand.  That flows


out of section (4)(d) -- section 8(d)(4) -- (4) to (6).


QUESTION:  That's right, but all of those other


mechanisms the Government says in their brief have been


washed away by -- by the -- by the benchmark study


provision, which eliminates -- which eliminates the


difficulty.  And in your reply brief, you do not contest


that.  You simply say that despite the benchmark study,


there is still one other objection we have, and then --


and then you focus on the -- on the subcontractor


commitment requirement in -- in 8(d)(4).


MR. PENDLEY:  It is one of the mechanisms by


which the United States continues to implement this --


this regime, this program. 


QUESTION:  And that wasn't discussed below and


had barely been discussed in the briefs here. 


MR. PENDLEY:  In addition, Adarand -- Adarand


noted that the benchmark study allows it to be turned on


and turned off, and it still can be turned -- turned on in


the State of Colorado.

 QUESTION:  But what do you mean by that, to be


turned on and turned off? 


MR. PENDLEY:  Well, here's what the -- pardon


me, Mr. Chief Justice. 


Mr. Chief Justice, the United States asserts we


do these benchmark studies.  We do them about once a year


and we decide where underutilization takes place. 


Now, these benchmark studies don't comply with


Croson because they don't examine qualified, willing, and


able.  They don't look at subcontracts, and -- and they


assume that racial disparity means racial discrimination. 


But the United States says, in those States in


which there is not underutilization, we will not use some


of our mechanisms, like price evaluation adjustments and


other -- other monetary incentives.  However, we retain


the ability to use the monetary -- excuse me -- the


mandatory subcontracting clause, as -- as Adarand has


pointed out in its lodging. 


In addition, the United States reserves the


power to use these set-asides to achieve the goal.


QUESTION:  You say they reserve the power.  Does


that mean that in a State where they say -- like Colorado


where they say we're -- we're not using it, they -- they


nonetheless do use it or that they could later use it on a


different study?

 MR. PENDLEY:  That's -- that's what our lodging


demonstrates, Mr. Chief Justice.  It demonstrates the


United States is today still using in Colorado the


mandatory subcontracting clauses.  In addition, the United


States continues to use, as its 9 March memo points out,


the set-asides in Colorado, as well as the mentor protege


program.  So, these -- these programs by which the United


States uses the racial preference program in Colorado --


those mechanisms still exist. 


But tomorrow the United States, as a result of


an overdue benchmark study, could conclude, well, now


Colorado is into the underutilization category.  These


monetary mechanisms go back on.


QUESTION:  But to the extent that your -- your


answer, in effect, tells us that the controversy is live


and presented based on what you have in a lodging, you're


really asking us to make a -- a determination of fact in a


disagreement between you and the Government as to whether


they're being used or whether they're not being used.  And


doesn't it make much more sense for us to send -- if


that's what the case is going to turn on, doesn't it make


much more sense for us to send it back to facts -- to


courts that engage in fact-finding and that will make that


determination on the basis of evidence as distinguished


from our making it on the basis of a lodging?

 MR. PENDLEY:  Well, the United States cannot


assert that it does not use the mandatory subcontracting


incentives because it's required by law.  It's required by


8(d)(4) to (6).


QUESTION:  It has asserted that.  I mean --


QUESTION:  That's what I thought they said in


their briefs. 


QUESTION:  Maybe -- maybe you say -- I mean, and


they have filed a memorandum from Arthur Hamilton, Federal


Lands Program Manager.  Now, your assertion is that that


is not authorized by law. 


MR. PENDLEY:  I'm asserting that it violates law


and it violates the regulation.  It violates 48 C.F.R.


19201.  Your Honor, if you could hear me out on this. 


On the -- on the 9th of March, the United States


was -- on the 24th of February, the United States was


invited by the Tenth Circuit to provide us additional


indication as to how this case is moot.  On the 9th of


March, Mr. Hamilton wrote a memo, and he said, here's how


it's moot.  We're not going to use the SCC in Colorado


anymore. 


Now, of course, as of the 30th of June of '98,


apparently under the benchmark studies, they had stopped


using the SCC, but now all of a sudden on the 9th of March


of 2000, they say, well, now we're not going to use it

anymore. 


So, Adarand comes forward to this Court and


says, it doesn't matter if they stopped using the SCC as


that 9 March memo shows, Your Honor, the United States


says, we'll use the requirements of the bar and we'll use


the set-aside.  And then --


QUESTION:  Mr. Pendley, may I ask you --


MR. PENDLEY:  Your Honor, may I -- may I finish


this?  I apologize.  This is important to my case.


And so -- so, Adarand files this lodging and


says, wait, look, they're still using these FAR's and


they're hurting us. 


And so, on the 24th of August, the United States


comes forward and says, oh, oh, wait, we've changed our


mind.  Not only are we not going to use the SCC's, now


we're not going to use the FAR's either, even though on


the 9th of March we said we would use the FAR's.


But whether they've abandoned the FAR's and


whether they've abandoned the SCC, they are still using


the set-asides in Colorado.  And, Your Honor, I don't


think the United States should be permitted to moot this


case by withdrawing this program on the eve of this


argument and -- and then allowed to reinstitute it as soon


as this Court --


QUESTION:  Mr. Pendley, may I -- may I now ask

what is very important, I think, in this -- in this case? 


And you seem to be walking away from it. 


MR. PENDLEY:  I apologize.


QUESTION:  This Court is a court of review.


MR. PENDLEY:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Not a court of first view.  The Tenth


Circuit isn't even a court of first view.  To the extent


that you are arguing things that have occurred since the


last litigation, one would expect you to be in the


district court with the current controversy. 


So, one question is, what do we have?  What


lower court determination are we reviewing? 


And the second is, what is the concrete


controversy that you have?  Last time it was easy to see. 


You bid on a certain contract.  You were the high bidder,


and nonetheless you didn't get it.  Now, what is the focus


of this case?  It's no longer that contract because that


$10,000 bonus is out of the picture. 


MR. PENDLEY:  Your Honor, the -- the controversy


Adarand presents in 2001 is that Adarand still is unable


to compete on an equal footing because the United States


still has in its tool of -- in its tool kit mechanisms by


which it is applying this racial preference against


Adarand.  And it is a matter of mootness indifference


whether it is the -- the monetary incentives, the

mandatory subcontracting clause, the set-asides, or the


mentor protege program.  The United States is still -- it


still has mechanisms.  It's still using it against Adarand


notwithstanding its attempt to tell this Court --


QUESTION:  Mr. Pendley.


MR. PENDLEY:  -- that it's withdrawn those. 


QUESTION:  May I ask you just one question? 


MR. PENDLEY:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  I'd like you to just assume for a


minute that you're dead right on everything you've argued


so far.  I'd like you to spend a minute or 2 explaining to


me why you think the program is unconstitutional. 


MR. PENDLEY:  Absolutely, Your Honor.


The first --


QUESTION:  The specific provisions of the


statute that you challenge are unconstitutional. 


MR. PENDLEY:  Under strict scrutiny, the Court


must start, as Croson dictates, with the question, is


there a strong basis in evidence of a compelling


governmental interest?  Congress declined this Court's


invitation, and generous invitation, in 1995 to provide


that.  Instead, the Congress said, we'll leave it up to


the courts.  We don't know, and furthermore, let's get


some information on this.  Let's ask the General


Accounting Office to do a study.

 That report from the General Accounting Office


is in.


QUESTION:  Your first point is that the


congressional findings are inadequate. 


MR. PENDLEY:  There are no findings, Your Honor. 


They asked the GAO, find something for us, find the facts. 


And the GAO came back just like City of Richmond did in --


in the Croson case, and said, we don't know how many DBE's


there are.  We don't know what market they're in.  We


don't know if they're qualified, willing, and able, and we


don't know how many subcontracts they win.  The GAO said


in its report the lack of information prevents anyone from


knowing the nature of this program. 

And that's at --


that's at page 6, 26, and 27 of Adarand's petition


appendix -- or merits appendix.


The second reason it's unconstitutional, Your


Honor, is simply because it's not narrowly tailored.  It


presumes that all people of certain racial groups are


socially and economically disadvantaged and entitled to


the benefits of the program without any individualized


findings.  There are no time requirements.  It's ageless


in its ability to reach into a person's past.  Timeless in


its ability to affect their future.  There's no severity


requirements.  There's no in-the-USA requirements.  No


other construction industry requirements.  And nothing

removes the taint from an individual, not winning a Nobel


Peace Prize, not election to the U.S. Senate, and not


graduating magna cum laude from the Wharton School of


Business at the University of Pennsylvania.  Nothing


removes the taint.  And that lack of individualized


finding requirement demonstrates it's not narrowly


tailored. 


And the regulations can't save it because the


agency has admitted on the 30th of June of '98, we can't


separate the social and economic -- social and economic


determinations, one from the other, because that violates


the intent of Congress. 


Mr. Chief Justice, may I reserve my time? 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Pendley. 


General Olson, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


QUESTION:  General Olson, if -- if counsel for


the petitioner is correct, it would be fair to infer


there's a certain amount of bobbing and weaving going on


on the part of the Government in this case.  Would you


address that somewhere in your --


MR. OLSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


I certainly will.  I believe there has been no

showing of any bobbing and weaving of any sort on the part


of the Government here. 


What we have, first of all, the Subcontractor


Compensation Clause is no longer a part of this case.  To


the extent that Adarand had standing with respect to it,


that provision of the law was declared unconstitutional. 


The Government has not challenged that provision.  That --


there is no evidence in this record that that provision is


being used with respect to Adarand at all. 


With respect to the --


QUESTION:  And that was the provision that was


the focus of the original suit? 


MR. OLSON:  Yes, Justice O'Connor. 


Now --


QUESTION:  Well, cannot those under -- under the


amended statute, cannot some additional compensation be


provided but subject to the new regulations? 


MR. OLSON:  Well, if we distinguish between that


the Federal aid program and the direct Federal procurement


program and the Subcontractor Compensation Clause the


United States Government has abandoned in all respects,


those provisions have not been justified, and the United


States Government is not employing those. 


With respect to the clauses --


QUESTION:  You're not employing them on what

basis? 


MR. OLSON:  On the basis that -- that they've


been determined to be unconstitutional.  And the United


States is not pursuing that.


Now, what -- where the bobbing and weaving has


occurred is, as this Court has identified, Adarand has


changed its position.  It now has decided to challenge the


subcontractor clause provisions of the direct procurement


actions by the Department of Transportation.  But as this


Court noted and -- and the Tenth Circuit specifically


held, there was no indication that Adarand at the time was


challenging those provisions or that Adarand has or will


continue to bid for contracts or subcontracts covered by


those paragraphs, the race-conscious provisions of those


paragraphs. 


QUESTION:  Those provisions were specifically


mentioned in Adarand's amended complaint. 


MR. OLSON:  They were mentioned.


QUESTION:  Specifically mentioned. 


MR. OLSON:  The challenge was to the


compensation clause provisions.  All of the litigation, up


to the point of the reply brief in this Court, had to do


with the subcontracting compensation provisions which are


not -- no longer in this case. 


The clause that Adarand now challenges cannot be

and is not being applied in the areas in which Adarand


does business pursuant to --


QUESTION:  Well, it certainly didn't come as


late as the reply brief, Mr. Olson.  The -- the petition


for certiorari says the following, that the Government is


-- is favoring these racial minorities -- this is on page


2 of the petition for certiorari -- through a combination


of compulsion and incentives.  As to compulsion, the


statutes require every private prime contractor, on


penalty of being ineligible to win Federal contracts, to


establish and adhere to a plan to try to hire DBE's as


subcontractors. 


MR. OLSON:  The --


QUESTION:  That is precisely the issue that --


MR. OLSON:  It was -- it was mentioned in -- at


the beginning of the brief and not addressed -- those


provisions were not addressed in the arguments of the


brief. 


But, more importantly, pursuant to the


Department of Justice guidelines issued in 1996, those


race -- any race-conscious provisions in the statute may


not be applied in any area of the country unless they're


justified by the Department of Commerce benchmark study


that shows a disparity in effect in those districts.  The


Department of Commerce made its study, and in all but

eight States, which do not include Colorado, those


measures have been ruled out of bounds, and they're not


being applied.  And the Department of Transportation has


confirmed that. 


QUESTION:  But are the benchmark studies


conducted every year?


MR. OLSON:  They're to be conducted every year,


but they're not actually being conducted that -- that


often.


QUESTION:  What does that mean? 


(Laughter.) 


MR. OLSON:  Well, it's one of those -- one of


those Government programs that it is hoped will be


conducted more often than they actually get conducted,


Chief Justice Rehnquist. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  But a new benchmark study could find


that Colorado was subject to --


MR. OLSON:  Well, it's conceivable, yes.  That's


-- that's entirely possible.  But there is no evidence


that that will occur.  There is no evidence that that is


likely to occur.  That is not usual.


QUESTION:  Well, there -- there is evidence that


Adarand is working in a context where regulations are


changing year to year in order to effect the one -- this

one goal, to which it -- it claims there is a substantial


doubt in --


MR. OLSON:  There is no evidence in this record


that the subcontract clause provisions, which Adarand is


now discussing, have been applied ever in Colorado or in


those States precluded by the benchmark study.


QUESTION:  What is the basis for not applying


them, Mr. Olson?  That -- that's what puzzles me.  What


possible basis is there for the Government not to apply


them?  They are required by the statute. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, and also they are required by


the holdings of this Court to apply and interpret that


statute in a constitutional fashion.  Precisely what this


Court discussed in Adarand is to implement whatever


programs it has in a narrowly tailored fashion. 


What the Department of Justice did, after this


decision in Adarand, is enter into a lengthy study,


determined that race-conscious programs or provisions of


Federal statutes could not be applied in ways that were


not narrowly tailored, responding directly to this Court's


guidance.  As a result of that, the Department of Justice


study indicated that they would only be applied -- only --


even at the outset -- in areas where there was evidence of


the direct effects of discrimination in Federal


contracting.

 The Department of Commerce thereafter conducted


a study, did not find these disparate impact in terms of


effects of discrimination in the areas in which Colorado


exists.  In fact, in 42 -- 42 States.  And as a result of


that, the Department of Transportation has not used and


has not employed the -- the race-conscious provisions of


those clauses in those areas. 


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Olson, does -- are those


clauses covered by section 8(d)(4) through (6)? 


MR. OLSON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And I thought that Mr. Pendley argued


that, in fact, in Colorado some of those provisions have


been and are, in fact, now in contract forms. 


MR. OLSON:  They are in the contract forms, but


the Department -- that is again another carryover of


instances where they probably should be removed from the


contract forms, but they're not being implemented or


enforced to impose any race-conscious remedy --


QUESTION:  Well, why wouldn't the -- why


wouldn't the --

QUESTION:  -- contractor have standing to say


that I'm contracting, I'm trying to business in a milieu

policies, required contractors to put in clauses that

MR. OLSON:  Well --


QUESTION:  And he has standing to say that now.


MR. OLSON:  Well, he -- well, in the first


place, the three contracts that were mentioned in the


reply brief -- Adarand was not the high bidder in those


three contracts.  And Adarand has not alleged --


QUESTION:  High bidder or low bidder? 


MR. OLSON:  I mean the low bidder.  Excuse me. 


In fact, in the submission that it -- that it put before


the Court --


QUESTION:  So, despite all these years of


litigation, he still has to litigate bid by bid.


MR. OLSON:  Well, he has got to demonstrate --


as I understand this Court's holdings with respect to


standing, he's got to show some immediate impact or the


potential for actual harm.  Now, what is -- the Department


of Justice has said race-conscious remedies will not be


applied in these areas.  The Department of Commerce has


delineated the areas.  The Department of Transportation


has again, on August 24th as submitted to this Court, made


it absolutely specific that it is the policy of the


Federal Highway Administration that separate percentage


goals shall only be required in those areas where the --

MR. OLSON:  This case --


QUESTION:  I mean, these are new things the


Government is presenting.


MR. OLSON:  Well, no, no.  What the Government


has said in this August 24 memorandum is entirely


consistent with what the Department of Justice guidelines


require and what the Department of Justice and -- and the


Department of Transportation has been saying all along. 


To the extent that those provisions appear in the


contract, this -- this document, that was issued on August


24, says contracting officers shall disregard those goals


in --


QUESTION:  That's fine, but they're still in the


contracts.  I'm a contractor and I have signed a contract


that says I will make these special provisions for


minority firms, and I will -- I will try to get these


goals.  And I know that I'm subject to penalties if -- if


I do not make a, quote, good faith effort.  Have letters


gone out to those contractors that say, hey, forget about


it?  No.  No letters have gone out.  You just come up and


tell us, oh, the Government won't enforce that.  I --

QUESTION:  I don't think that that's adequate


assurance to those -- to those companies who are competing


for -- for contracts where -- where the prime contractor


has signed a commitment to get a certain -- a certain goal


of -- of minority participation.


MR. OLSON:  The -- the Department of


Transportation and the Department of Justice have


consistently adhered to the provision that those race-


conscious provisions will not be enforced in the direct


procurement program in these areas.  And there's no


evidence that they ever have been.


QUESTION:  Have they told -- have they told the


contractors and subcontractors? 


MR. OLSON:  Yes, they have, and they


reaffirmed --


QUESTION:  Where was that? 


MR. OLSON:  Well, this -- this memorandum --


QUESTION:  This went out to Federal Lands


Highway Division engineers.  We have no indication that


the people who signed these commitments have been put on


notice that these commitments do not -- do not bind


anymore.

switching it around.  It seems to me that Adarand has the


responsibility to suggest or demonstrate to this Court


that it's actually being hurt or that there is some


evidence that -- that race-conscious decisions are being


made in the contracting process.  And Adarand has not


demonstrated, with respect to even the three contracts it


mentioned, that it was the low bidder. 


QUESTION:  Do you think that for a single minute


if these clauses required racial discrimination, an


absolute clear, patent violation of the Fourteenth


Amendment, that we would say there's no standing for a


minority who wanted these removed?  Not for a single


minute. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, I -- I wouldn't contradict


that, but I would say when the Government has made it


absolutely clear that it is not enforcing race-conscious


remedies, as instructed by this Court in the first Adarand


decision, except in a narrowly tailored fashion, and


there's been subsequent legislation of a compelling need,


but that that response to that compelling need has been


narrowed down to the areas where it is necessary and --


QUESTION:  But the provision hasn't been removed


from the contract.


MR. OLSON:  The provision was not removed in


some of those contracts, and I -- I can't tell this Court

how many.  But it is -- it is explicitly clear and there


is no evidence to contradict that they're not being --


those race-conscious provisions are not being enforced


with respect --


QUESTION:  If they were being enforced, do you


agree that Adarand has standing to -- to challenge it?


MR. OLSON:  If they were being enforced and


Adarand could suggest that it was somehow affected by


that.  And it has not been able to do that either because


with respect to the three contracts, its own lodging --


and I would refer the Court in part to C1 of tab M in the


yellow -- the first volume of the yellow submission, which


is a sheet in which -- this is the Adarand submission. 


And tab M refers to one of those contracts, just as an


example.  And it says in that document -- this is an


Adarand document -- who was awarded the work we bid?  And


then it circles the company who was awarded the bid.  If


not us, why not?  And it's scribbled in here from Adarand,


we were not high -- we were high.  Excuse me. 


QUESTION:  They were the high bidder. 


MR. OLSON:  They were the high bidder and


therefore they didn't get the contract because they were


-- were not the low bidder.  And that's true if -- it


takes a little bit of combing through the record, but it's


demonstrably true with respect to those other two

contracts as well. 


QUESTION:  And -- and you think they're --


they're not at risk of that happening in -- in other


contracts when these provisions still exist in the


contract clauses and all we have is -- is your assurance?


If I were the prime contractor, I'd say, I


better not take a chance.  I understand that there is


somewhere floating around the Government a memorandum that


says that they won't enforce this, but I've never been


told about it.


MR. OLSON:  It's -- it's -- well, Justice


Scalia, it has been the documented, articulated policy of


the -- since the Department of Justice study.  The


guidelines went out to all Federal agencies not to employ


these programs, except under certain conditions.  The


Commerce Department implemented that decision, and there's


no evidence to the contrary.


QUESTION:  What programs?  Let's -- let's be


clear about what programs we're talking about.  I


understand that at an early date we said until these


studies are done and -- and the studies show no


underutilization, the compensation and the other two


programs would -- would not be used.  But as far as I


know, the first indication that the contracting commitment


would not be used is this memorandum of August 24, 2001.

Is -- is there any earlier memorandum? 


MR. OLSON:  Well, if you look at the


Government's --


QUESTION:  Dealing with the contracting clauses.


MR. OLSON:  No.  But the -- what there is is a


Department of Justice requirement imposed upon all Federal


agencies not to employ race-conscious remedies in those


areas --


QUESTION:  When -- when was that memorandum?


MR. OLSON:  That was in 1996.


QUESTION:  Well, but why, if that went out in


1996, was it necessary to have this memorandum in the


summer of 2001, if that had -- if the earlier one had any


effect? 


MR. OLSON:  Well, it -- well, the memorandum in


August of -- of 2001 reiterates the policy that the


Department of Transportation had been operating under.


QUESTION:  Would you read me the '96 one?  I


think it's -- it's pretty clear to me that the '96 one did


not cover the contracting requirement.  It just covered


the other three programs. 


MR. OLSON:  I don't agree with you.  I -- I --


QUESTION:  Where is it?  Where is it? 


MR. OLSON:  I can't -- I can't give you cite to


the record, but the -- the Department of Justice memoranda

is in the Government's appendix.  It's a -- it's a lengthy


document, and it makes it clear that race-conscious


remedies cannot be used except in those areas subject to


the Department of Commerce benchmark study.


QUESTION:  Is there another reason here why it


doesn't apply and that is -- and I read this somewhere --


that Mountain Gravel is itself a small business and for


that reason the clause wouldn't apply in any event? 


MR. OLSON:  It would not have applied in 1989


when this case first arose.  The -- that's -- that's a


very good point, Justice Souter.  When this case first


arose, Mountain Gravel was not -- was a small business


enterprise itself.  At the appendix to the Government's


brief at pages 202 to 203 to 204, the actual contract is


listed.  The box is checked, are you a small business


enterprise.  That's checked.  And then on the page which


contains the subcontractor -- subcontracting clause


itself, the language in there specifically says, this


shall not apply to small business concerns.  Now --


QUESTION:  Why is it -- why is it then that --


that what they say in the first three pages of their reply


brief, for example, is that they have to -- they want to


get a sub under a prime, that the Weenomunch Construction


Authority got the prime.  And they got the prime contract


on August 27, 2001.  And when they got the contract, they

looked up the requests for bid, and in the request for


bid, there was an appendix.  And in that appendix, it gave


an example of just what the prime had to have.  And one of


the things the prime had to have was a promise that it


would use its best efforts to try to get subs awarded to


small business -- disadvantaged small businesses.  So,


they're saying at least on that one, we saw right in the


contract -- that we saw right -- right there the kind of


thing that you say doesn't exist. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, as I say, they were not the


low bidder on that contract.  They weren't


disadvantaged --


QUESTION:  All right, but they're saying --


MR. OLSON:  -- by that contracting situation.


QUESTION:  -- give you three examples, you know. 


We're a guardrail company and we're going to go and we're


going to bid again and again and again.  And the last


three all have these examples in it, which you say I


wouldn't have gotten anyway, but maybe in the future we'll


get it anyway.


MR. OLSON:  Well, all I can say is that the


Government has announced its policy, and there's no


evidence in the record that it's acted inconsistently with


any application of race-conscious remedies in the area in


which Adarand --

 QUESTION:  So, we have just a mistake possibly,


the appendix C.  But if that's -- if that's so, do you


think we should just send this back to the Tenth Circuit


and say, okay, you sort it out?


MR. OLSON:  This --


QUESTION:  They say they're facing these clauses


all the time.  You say they're absolutely not facing them. 


Colorado isn't a place where this is appropriate.  And


that's the end of it, and let them sort it out. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, I think it's very important to


emphasize that this is a facial challenge to the statute


and to the system.  And this Court has consistently said


that unless there are no set of circumstances under which


the regulation and the statute could be enforced on a


constitutional matter -- that's the Salerno case.


QUESTION:  But what's -- what's a facial


challenge in -- in this context?  I mean, it seems to me a


lot of the questioning here and to Adarand's counsel has


been to show that Adarand was directly affected by the


thing.  And so, I -- I don't think you're really talking


about a facial challenge in the sense we use that in the


First Amendment. 


MR. OLSON:  I -- I respectfully disagree with


respect to whether Adarand was adversely affected by the


program.  They have not demonstrated that they lost a

single contract as a result of -- of the provisions which


they're -- which they've decided now to challenge. 


QUESTION:  Well, they certainly in -- in the


case we first -- we first decided, the 1995 case -- we


decided that they -- they were sufficiently affected, so


we ruled.


MR. OLSON:  Yes, and they were affected by --


we're not contending that they did not have standing to


challenge that subcontracting compensation provision.


QUESTION:  It challenged that financial


compensation provision. 


MR. OLSON:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Which now has been found to be


unconstitutional. 


MR. OLSON:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And it's out of the picture. 


MR. OLSON:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  But now we have a new set of


arguments basically. 


MR. OLSON:  Yes, and -- and to the extent that


-- that the program, as it exists, requires people to --


in order to be designated as a disadvantaged business


enterprise, must file certificates articulating that they


have been the victim of a social and economic


disadvantage.

what you mean by social or economic --


MR. OLSON:  Well, it's --


QUESTION:  There are country clubs I couldn't


get into. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. OLSON:  It's -- it's explained in the


statute both with respect to ethnic and racial prejudice


because of their identity as a group without regard to


individual qualities, and that economic disadvantage --


the ability to compete in the free enterprise system has


diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to


others in the same business area --


QUESTION:  Either -- either social or economic,


even though the social would -- would be quite irrelevant


to whether you can --


MR. OLSON:  Both -- well, that's a social -- the


use of the term in the statute described a victim of -- of


prejudice or bias, and that has had economic effect on the


individual.  Both of those points are required.  The

rulemaking.  That form has never been adopted .  I'm --


I'm reasonably confident that it never will be adopted.

float this.  Maybe this is what we'll adopt.  Right? 


MR. OLSON:  But the -- but the -- but that has


to be looked at in terms of the -- what the statute


defines as social and economic disadvantage and what the


regulations, which are in -- at pages 70 to 72a of the


Government's appendix, which define -- which -- which are


the regulation -- Department of Transportation


regulations.  And it's a -- it's a rebuttable and


challengeable position, Justice Scalia.  It has to be


signed before a notary.  The agency --


QUESTION:  Well, how would one go about


rebutting it?  I mean, who could rebut it and how would


you go about it? 


MR. OLSON:  Any adversely affected party can


rebut it.  The State may challenge it.  In fact --


QUESTION:  But, I mean, what -- what would you


have to show to rebut it? 


MR. OLSON:  Well, what you have to show to be


entitled to certification, according to the regulations,


is substantial and chronic social disadvantage in the


business world and that -- and that credit has been


impaired due to diminished capital or opportunities have

been impaired due to diminished capital and credit


opportunities, as compared to others in the same or


similar line of business.  I submit --


QUESTION:  Social disadvantage in the business


world.  What is that? 


MR. OLSON:  Social -- social disadvantage,


Justice Scalia, is defined in the statute as having been a


victim of racial or -- or prejudice of that nature, and


that it has produced economic disadvantage based upon --


QUESTION:  You say just two opposite things on


this economic disadvantage.  You say in your brief that


they -- you have to sign an affidavit that says my ability


to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired


due to diminished capital and credit opportunities.  Then


you say, moreover, if you have more than $750,000 net


worth, you're out of it.  You can't qualify. 


They say something completely different.  They


say that if you have less than $750,000, you -- you


automatically qualify.  So, that in fact, despite those


words, all that you have to say is I have less than


$750,000.  That's the end of it.  You qualify.  You say,


no, that isn't so at all.  You're out if it's over --


which is right? 


MR. OLSON:  Well, I believe that we're correct.

 MR. OLSON:  Once you -- once you --


QUESTION:  That's the right answer. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. OLSON:  And I hope I said it persuasively.


(Laughter.) 


MR. OLSON:  I think the regulations are


relatively clear.  Once you've reached a certain plateau


of economic category, you're out.  And these -- these


certifications are -- again, the regulations explain the


State must conduct a relatively careful investigation of


applications for certification.  In fact, I understand --


it's not in the record, but I understand in the last 12


months in Colorado, out of 160 applications, only 65 or --


QUESTION:  So, your point, to be absolutely


explicit, is if you are below the plateau, $750,000, you


still might not qualify as being economically


disadvantaged.


MR. OLSON:  That's correct.  That's our


position.  And I -- and I don't -- well, that is our


position.  I don't understand the analysis that would come


out the other way because I think the statute is


relatively clear with respect to that. 


The -- the -- so, the -- in the first place, the


certification process requires someone asserting under


oath, because that -- that affidavit requirement is there,

that subject to challenge -- Adarand itself said in its


cert petition in the most recent case before this one that


it was not prepared to sign a certification about social


and economic disadvantage because it was afraid of being


prosecuted for fraud, perjury, and disbarment charges and


things of that -- that sort.  So, there's plenty of


evidence that people take these things seriously, that the


statutory threshold and the regulatory threshold must be


met.  It may be challenged by people.  There are field


procedures in place and so forth.  So, that's another step


of the narrow tailoring requirement that takes place with


respect to this process. 


So, we submit that with respect to the subject


of a compelling governmental interest, this Court


addressed that very point in its first Adarand decision,


and -- and made it clear in the last paragraph of part


3(d) of that opinion that the unhappy persistence of both


the practice and lingering effects of racial


discrimination against minority groups in this country is


an unfortunate reality. 


QUESTION:  Well -- but when you get to that,


General, you have this list of people.  You know, some by


culture, you know, people from the Northern Marianas,


Macau, Fiji, Tonga, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Nauru, the Federated


State of Micronesia, Hong Kong.  How did all -- what

studies put all those --


MR. OLSON:  Well, in the first place, there's


about 30-some years of study by Congress of disadvantage


and discrimination, which this Court recognized in


Fullilove and in Croson and in Adarand, that is taking


place in the contracting industry.  Those -- those


categories --


QUESTION:  The people from Macau were


discriminated in the contracting --


MR. OLSON:  People -- people of a certain racial


background and a certain color are discriminated against


and those --


QUESTION:  But -- but this thing just sets it


out in great detail by country. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, I -- I submit that when you --


if you were to describe different people of different


national backgrounds or racial backgrounds that have been


guilty of discrimination, they may fall in any of those


categories.  They may come from a certain country in


Africa or -- or a certain country in Southeast Asia or a


certain Hispanic community.  That doesn't change the fact


that what the racial discrimination is has been on the


basis of the characteristics of skin and nationality, of


which those are simply subgroups. 


QUESTION:  Well, but -- but they aren't.  It's

only those subgroups that get the preference.  In -- in my


experience, racial discrimination is usually stupid enough


that it's not that reticulated --


MR. OLSON:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- that you discriminate against


people from Gabon but -- but not from the next-door


country.  That -- that's weird. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, what -- what the Congress said


over and over again, on the basis of detailed analytical


studies which are -- which are described in considerable


detail in the -- in the court of appeals opinion, and what


this Court has said is that there has been the lingering


effects, unfortunately, of publicly financed


discrimination in the construction industry. 


What you're referring to, Justice Scalia, is an


effort by the Government.  Now, we have all three branches


of Government recognizing a significant, serious problem


that Government has a responsibility to address.  What the


-- what the executive branch did with respect to the


regulations in its programs is put a number of measures in


to attempt to meet the very points that this Court


suggested that are ways to narrowly tailor the remedy,


which is certainly something that the Government has a


responsibility to do, to make sure that only individuals


that fall into cases where there's actual -- actually been

I submit that what we have here is the executive


branch attempting to respond to a legitimate serious


problem that all three branches of Government have been


concerned about in a highly responsible way.  And in the


face of a facial challenge, it cannot be said that there


are not ways that this -- these regulations can be


implemented in a constitutional fashion. 


And therefore, to the extent that there is a


facial challenge, the petitioner has not met, by any


stretch of the imagination, its burden.  If anything, this


case should be dismissed as improvidently granted, but if


the Court rules on the merits, these programs are


constitutional against a facial challenge. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, General Olson. 


Mr. Pendley, you have 5 minutes remaining. 


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. PENDLEY


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. PENDLEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please


the Court:


First of all, the -- the Department of Justice


guidelines, the proposed reforms have never gone final. 


They were put out in 1996.  They have never been

implemented in the direct Federal procurement program. 


Secondly and relatedly, they have been


implemented to some degree with regard to the State aid


programs, but that case isn't at issue here. 


Thirdly, the Court held in Jacksonville --


QUESTION:  How do we know they haven't been


implemented?  The -- the Solicitor General tells us they


have. 


MR. PENDLEY:  The -- the Government concedes,


with regard to the State aid program, that that's not at


issue in this -- in this case, and that's in the


Government's responsive brief.  However, the -- the


proposed reforms -- one need only look at the small


business regulations at 13 C.F.R. and also the -- the bar


regulations at 48 C.F.R.  Those are unchanged with regard


to this race-neutral approach that the -- that the United


States is talking about. 


In the -- in the Jacksonville case, what is


necessary for Adarand to show is its inability to compete


on an equal footing, the back end.  That's what this Court


held in 1995, and it is still unable to compete on an


equal footing because of these very -- various programs


they have in place. 


In the City of Jacksonville, the Court -- this


Court refused to permit the City of Jacksonville to remove

a program and submit a new program.  And this Court said,


you don't need to have the selfsame program to maintain


your challenge. 


The Government can't simply change the program,


play this little shell game, and deny this Court


jurisdiction.  This isn't even removing the whole program. 


This is simply changing the mechanism by which it is


applying it and saying, well, we're not using that bad,


old SCC anymore, but we have this other bag of tricks that


we're -- we're going to utilize. 


The -- the Court is absolutely right.  These


contractors out there are on pain of loss of serious money


if they don't comply with these mandatory subcontracting


plans.  The term is liquidated damages.  In one contract,


this guardrail subcontract, it was $105,000.  If that


prime does not issue that contract to a DBE, he loses that


$105,000.  The United States takes it from him. 


This is both a facial and an as-applied


challenge.  We have made that clear consistently.  We say


the statute is unconstitutional on both. 


And finally, let me draw the Court's attention


to the subcontracting decision by the Tenth Circuit.  It's


at page 70 to 71 of Adarand's petition appendix.  And


therein, the Tenth Circuit makes it very clear there used


to be a bad, old SCC in 1996.  That isn't there anymore.

We have a brand new SCC that's been changed and it won't


be quite so -- quite so non-narrowly tailored.  But there


still is an SCC in place. 


And finally, Your Honor, the United States told


this Court that the benchmark study is overdue, and I know


in my bones, as I know that this case has gone on forever


by the United States' effort to make it go on forever and


with broad jurisdiction from this Court, that the day this


case ends is the day the benchmark study comes out, and


suddenly and miraculously Colorado is back in the


underutilized category and all these mechanisms apply. 


I think it's incredibly amazing that on the 9th


of March of 2000, the man in charge of this program said,


don't use the SCC, continue to use the FAR and its


mandatory subcontracting plans, and that 2 weeks before we


filed that lodging that showed all those mandatory


subcontracting plans, suddenly his instruction from the


9th of March of 2000 was withdrawn and said, wait, wait,


don't use the mandatory subcontracting plans out of the


FAR.  Use the set-asides instead.  And whether they call


it the set-aside or the mandatory subcontracting plans or


the subcontracting compensation clause or the price


evaluation adjustments, Adarand is still denied that equal


footing this Court found in 1995. 


I urge this Court to reach this case on the

merits because the day this Court says it's moot is the


day Adarand gets standing again because it loses another


contract because this program is applied in Colorado, and


Adarand will start this sad process again. 


Thank you for the Court's indulgence. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Pendley.


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 11:00 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
