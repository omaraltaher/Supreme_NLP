 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 09-525, Janus Capital Group 

 (10:01 a.m.)

v. First Derivative Traders.

 Mr. Perry.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. PERRY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. PERRY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Affirming the judgment below would authorize 

private securities fraud class actions against every 

service provider that participates in the drafting of a 

public company's prospectus.  It is, therefore, nothing 

less than a frontal assault on this Court's decisions in 

Central Bank and Stoneridge.

 In those cases, Your Honors, this Court held 

that service providers may not be sued primarily in 

private class actions and left that matter for Congress 

to resolve.  And Congress did respond, not once, not 

twice, but three times, to those decisions.

 First, in the PSLRA, the Congress authorized 

a Federal action, a government action, only against 

aiders and abettors, leaving the question of private 

class actions for this Court's resolution.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, is -- who's the 

violator alleged here?  Not in the complaint, but in the 

briefs?  As I read the briefs, they claim that Janus 

itself did not make the false statement, that the two 

appellants did, that they are the actual speakers 

because they were talking about their activities, and 

they used Janus as a conduit to deceive the market. 

That's, I think, what they're alleging.

 MR. PERRY:  Justice Sotomayor, the 

challenged statements appear in the prospectuses for the 

Janus Funds, separate legal entities not parties to this 

lawsuit.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how do we sustain the 

intermediary cases when the company, through market 

analysts, divulges misleading statements?  We don't talk 

about the market analysts' falsity; we talk about the 

company's falsity, because the market analysts didn't 

have scienter.

 MR. PERRY:  Your Honor, the company -­

excuse me -- the conduit or analyst cases fall under two 

categories, neither of which is met here.

 First, they are a scheme between the 

company -- orchestrated by the company to distribute its 

information through the analysts to the market, and they 

are brought under 10b-5(a) as scheme cases.  That is

most of the analyst cases.  There is no 10b-5(a) claim 

in this case.  This is only a 10b-5(b) "making" claim.

 Second, those few cases, the analyst cases, 

that are brought under (b) involve an omission; that is, 

the company has failed to correct a statement made by an 

analyst where there is a duty to do so.  There is no 

omission claim in this case because there is no duty -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But what's the 

difference between an omission or a commission if a 

company purposely divulges a falsehood to an analyst, 

knowing it's going to be distributed in toto?  So who's 

making the false statement, the analyst or the company?

 MR. PERRY:  Your Honor, the company makes 

the statement to the market.  Under Basic, the analyst 

is the market.  It is the ears of the market that takes 

information -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why isn't -- why 

aren't the two appellants, on their theory, on -- we can 

talk about whether the complaint does or does not 

adequately allege their theory.  That's a different 

issue.  I accept that.

 But under their theory, why isn't the 

appellants the primary violator, not even a secondary? 

Because they -- they claim, I think -- and I'm going to 

find out from them -- that Janus had no scienter, that

it didn't make the false statements, that all of this 

was done in secret by the appellants, so they were the 

only violator.

 MR. PERRY:  Your Honor, the analyst cases, 

the issuer speaks to the market directly.  Here, there 

is an intervening legal entity, the Janus Funds. 

Scienter or no scienter, that is a separate 

corporation -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you mean to say to me 

that puppets become a legal defense for someone who 

intentionally manipulates the market information?

 MR. PERRY:  Justice Sotomayor, the Congress 

has drafted two statutes that deal with puppets. 

Section 20(b), which these plaintiffs have not invoked, 

makes it unlawful for one party to do indirectly what it 

would not be permitted to do directly.  That's the 

puppet statute, the ventriloquist dummy statute.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the control 

person statute?

 MR. PERRY:  No.  There's also 20(a), which 

is the control person statute, also not invoked by these 

plaintiffs.

 Those are forms of secondary liability, Your 

Honor.  In fact, the Court's questions go to the 

distinction between primary and secondary liability.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But I -- but if Janus 

had no scienter, if its board of directors did not know 

that the statements were false, they had no way of 

knowing, because as I understand the complaint -- and 

this is alleged -- the deal was secret.  So Janus itself 

could not be a primary violator.  Who is?

 MR. PERRY:  Justice Sotomayor, our position 

is nobody had scienter, and every adjudicator to look at 

these facts -- Judge Motz in the district court, the ALJ 

of the SEC -- has found that there was no scienter 

anywhere up and down the line.  So the fact that 

somebody didn't have scienter doesn't answer the problem 

here.  The question -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, somebody deviated 

from what was the announced policy, that there was to be 

no market timers investing in this -- in these Janus 

funds.  Somebody made the decision that certain hedge 

funds would be allowed to engage in that activity.  Who 

was that somebody?

 MR. PERRY:  The adviser personnel made the 

determination, Justice Ginsburg, that the policy was 

discretionary, that when it said we may refuse trades, 

the funds may refuse trades, that there are -­

discretion -­

that's alleged to have been -- the conduct that is 

alleged to have been in opposition to the announced 

policy, that is attributable squarely to -- what you -­

this is the entity you called JCM?

 MR. PERRY:  That's correct, Your Honor -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So it made the decision 

that violated the policy?

 MR. PERRY:  That's correct, Your Honor.  And 

the SEC -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Nonetheless, it's not a 

primary actor?

 MR. PERRY:  Not as to these plaintiffs, Your 

Honor.  The SEC -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But can -- can we discuss 

the case, and -- and perhaps you don't think so.  Can't 

we discuss this case, must we not discuss this case, on 

the theory that JCM's scienter, JCM's knowledge of a 

false statement, is a given in the case?

 Now, maybe you'll be able to prove 

otherwise.  You say that they're not liable anyway.

 MR. PERRY:  Justice Kennedy, you're exactly 

right.  That is the theory pleaded in the complaint.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And it seems to me that's 

what the argument here is mostly about.

 MR. PERRY:  And the question that is before

this Court, we would submit, is whether, scienter or no 

scienter, JCM can be held liable for the statements in 

another company's prospectus.  This Court has never 

held -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even though there was no 

scheme with another actor?  Even though it was the only 

violator, which is a -­

MR. PERRY:  No -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- fair reading of the 

complaint.

 MR. PERRY:  They chose not to bring a scheme 

case.  And remember, there is a second set of investors 

here:  the fund investors.  The SEC brought an action, 

secured $100 million on behalf of them.  There was a 

series of private litigation that has been resolved, 

brought by those investors.

 These investors did not purchase the 

securities offered by the -- the prospectus they 

challenge.  And, again, there's a fundamental disconnect 

between the defendant in the case and the challenged 

misstatements.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But, once again -- once 

again, if the complainants in the case, the plaintiffs 

in the case -- hypothetical case, not this case, 

hypothetical case -- were injured shareholders in the

fund, I take it you say still they could not sue JCM?

 MR. PERRY:  Your Honor, for different 

reasons.  They can sue JCM for -- for an omission, 

because there's a duty that runs from JCM to the funds. 

That was the theory advanced in that separate lawsuit 

accepted by the district court, which has since been 

resolved.

 They can't -- these plaintiffs can't bring 

an omission case, because there's no duty that runs from 

JCM out to the JCG shareholders.  The district court 

held that.  They didn't appeal that to the Fourth 

Circuit.  They didn't present that in their cert 

petition.  So they can't bring that omissions case.

 Any wrongdoing in this case -- Justice 

Ginsburg, to finish my answer to your question, the 

policy says funds are not intended for market timing. 

The adviser allowed 12 traders to trade frequently.  The 

only wrongdoing, if there is any wrongdoing, was the 

failure of the adviser to disclose to the trustees the 

deviation from the policy.  That is a State law breach 

of contract.  It may be a breach of fiduciary duty.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Perry, who wrote 

the relevant statements?

 MR. PERRY:  Your Honor, the funds made the 

statements to the public.  They were drafted -­

salaries.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So JCM paid the lawyers?

 MR. PERRY:  Correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And so it was JCM's lawyers 

who wrote the prospectus, including the relevant 

statements here, the asserted misrepresentations?

Justice Kagan.  They don't allege that in the complaint,

JUSTICE KAGAN:  They're paid by JCM.

 MR. PERRY:  Every prospectus is written by 

lawyers, Justice Kagan.  Lawyers write prospectuses.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  These are in-house counsel 

for the investment adviser.

 MR. PERRY:  In-house counsel, outside 

counsel, once they draft materials and present them to 

their client, it becomes the client's statement when 

adopted by the client.

 The board of trustees of the funds has to 

review every policy, is responsible for every policy 

drafted by inside counsel, outside counsel, consultants. 

It's not unusual for companies to retain outside service 

providers to provide any number of policies:  Employment 

policies, investment policies, everything else.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Perry, you -- you 

said that it was the fund's lawyers who drafted the 

prospectus, but, in fact, it was JCM's lawyers, the 

lawyers -- they were in-house lawyers for JCM.  And they 

served -- and they served the funds in doing this 

prospectus, but they were on the payroll of JCM, and 

they were JCM's legal department.

 MR. PERRY:  Your Honor, like all lawyers, 

they wear multiple hats.  I represent multiple clients. 

These lawyers represent multiple clients.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought they were

 MR. PERRY:  They are in-house lawyers at 

JCM, but they also represent the funds, and the SEC has 

specifically recognized in the context of investment 

companies that where an adviser counsel is representing 

the funds, his client or her client, for those purposes, 

is the funds.  And here, these lawyers are very careful 

to separate who their -- their clients are for various 

purposes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, let's say that JCM's 

principal officers and managers wrote the statement. 

You still say there's no liability?

 MR. PERRY:  Absolutely, Justice Kennedy, 

because when the statement is adopted by the issuer, it 

becomes the issuer's statement.  Only an issuer can make 

the statement -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.  It's not 

attributable, at least publicly, to JCM.

 MR. PERRY:  That's -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is there an alternate 

theory that JCM is really the day-to-day managers in 

day-to-day active control of the fund, and, therefore, 

it should be chargeable as if it and the fund are the 

same for purposes of making the statement?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And we would say that 

that's different from, say, an outside law firm or an 

auditor?

 MR. PERRY:  Your Honor, the word "control" 

appears more than a hundred times in the briefs on the 

plaintiff's side of this case in this Court, and the 

Congress has dealt with control.  Section 20(a) provides 

a separate cause of action against those who control 

another entity.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Except that I, as I read 

your brief -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong -- you 

were arguing that because there was an independent board 

of directors, presumably because there are two 

corporate -- different corporate funds -- two different 

corporate forms, that there couldn't be control person 

liability under 20(a).  You seem -- that -- I thought, 

reading your brief, that's what you were alleging.

 So you can't have your cake and eat it, too. 

Either the independence of the board makes no difference 

or it does.  So which is your position?

 MR. PERRY:  Our position, Your Honor, is 

that the Congress has dealt with the situation where you 

have two separate companies, and to make a claim against 

the second company, you have to prove control.  Whether

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Under what theory would

had control over the everyday affairs of the company, 

drafted or helped draft the prospectus, hired the 

lawyers who helped draft it, wouldn't be a control 

person?  How would you defend that?

 MR. PERRY:  Your Honor, the investment 

company, the mutual funds, are separately owned, 

separately governed.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly.  So you -­

you're -- if they can't be control persons because 

they're separate companies, then how do they escape 

being primary violators?

we're just saying that the investment adviser is a 

service provider like every other service provider. 

They are like the -­

outside counsel.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.

 MR. PERRY:  Yes, Your Honor.  There were 

changes to the market timing policy throughout the class 

period.  In fact, earlier in the class period, there was 

an express disclosure that market timing might be 

permitted pursuant to a -- a written contract.  That was 

revised later.

 The trustees asked multiple questions.  They 

were back and forth with their lawyers.  Outside counsel 

was always involved, and there are other consultants

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do the outside 

counsel you're talking about represent the fund only?

 MR. PERRY:  There's two separate sets of 

outside counsel.  One law firm represents only the fund. 

It does not represent the adviser; only represents the 

funds, Your Honor.  There's a second law firm in this 

case that represents the independent trustees.

 Six of the seven trustees determined that to 

secure their independence, because the chairman of the 

board at that time was an interested person under the 

statute, they have a separate law firm.  There are two 

law firms that have nothing to do with the adviser.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I guess my question was 

simply:  The drafters of the prospectus were the 

in-house counsel for JCM?

 MR. PERRY:  The -- the paragraph being 

challenged in this case, that's correct, Your Honor. 

The interrogatory response doesn't speak more broadly 

than that, but I agree with that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose if the 

lawyers for the trust did an inadequate job of reviewing 

the JCM drafts, they would be subject to a malpractice 

action by the trust?

 MR. PERRY:  Correct, Your Honor.  And then 

the trust, of course, has contractual and other rights 

against the adviser that it has enforced, you know, in 

this very case.  The trustees made a claim against the 

adviser for all of this underlying conduct.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What -- what happens if the 

president of the oil company, knowing that the statement 

is false, says:  We have discovered 42 trillion barrels 

of oil in Yucatan.  He writes it on a piece of paper; he 

gives it to the board of trustees; they think it's true 

and they issue it.  Joe Smith buys stock and later loses 

money.

 Can Joe Smith sue the president of Yucatan, 

of the oil company, for having made an untrue statement

these documents.  In fact, the documents say -- it's at 

page 258a of the Joint Appendix -- the trustees are 

responsible for all the policies.

 They have outsourced, if you will, certain 

functions, operational functions:  Which stock to buy, 

which stock to sell, which transfer agent to hire. 

Those are functions that could be kept in house or could 

be outsourced.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I get it.  In other words, 

you're saying, on the papers here, it's -- it's the 

trustees that manage everything.

 MR. PERRY:  That govern everything.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That govern everything, and 

these are like helpers?

 MR. PERRY:  Well, they're -- they're -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  They do a lot as helpers. 

Now, let me suggest to you, if that's one possible 

distinction, what about this distinction:  That the 

managers of a fund, even though they are outsourced 

people brought in, are liable as principals, not aiders 

or abettors, if -- following criminal law here -- if -­

they are principals if they get the false statement to 

the public through a conduit, the conduit being an 

entity or person that is unaware of the falsity of the 

statement.

That's LaFave on criminal law.  What is -­

what about that?

 MR. PERRY:  Three answers.  First, that's 

dealt with in section 20(b), which is the ventriloquist 

dummy statute that these plaintiffs didn't invoke.

 Second, the Congress looked at this very 

question in 1938 and 1939, when there were proposals to 

merge the management, the adviser function, with the 

funds, to make them one unitary entity.  And in the 

Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment 

Advisers Act of 1940, the Congress elected not do that.

 As this Court has recognized, it chose not 

to require compulsory internalization of the management 

function.  It allowed this separate entity.  And, 

therefore, when you have separate companies, under State 

law -- again, my client is a Delaware limited liability 

corporation.  The funds are Massachusetts business 

trusts.  They have nothing in common.  There's no joint 

ownership, no joint governance -­

way.

 MR. PERRY:  My third -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Assuming that they 

didn't do it for that reason, what does it mean?

 MR. PERRY:  My -- my third answer is that 

extensive regulatory involvement in the two Acts enacted 

in 1940 specifically to regulate this industry, the 

Congress never made the decision to hold the adviser 

liable for the fund's conduct.

 In fact, no statute says that, and the SEC 

has never taken that position.  There is no case cited 

in any of the briefs -- they have 234 pages, 138 cases. 

Not one holds an investment adviser liable for 

statements of the fund's prospectuses.  When the -­

Fourth Circuit said is it goes beyond; it has to go 

further.  And the -- the impression that I got from the 

Fourth Circuit's opinion is -- and it could be reduced

General, also said in the invitation brief that this 

case was not an appropriate vehicle for deciding just 

simply "help" and "participate," because what the Fourth 

Circuit was saying in other parts of its opinion was

reviewing a motion to dismiss of a complaint's 

well-pleaded allegations -- and I can go through the 

complaint's allegations, if you like, that explain how 

JCM wrote and prepared the prospectus and the policies 

for the funds and then implemented them falsely -- we 

would submit this case is not about service providers, 

but it is about Janus Capital Management being the 

primary violator.  They were the ones who had the motive 

to lie, they had the incentive to lie, and they did lie.

different question.  I understood your theory of the 

case to be that JCM is liable, basically, because they 

put it in the prospectus.

 MR. FREDERICK:  And what they did was to 

falsely represent what they would do with that 

statement.  I would direct the Court to paragraph 5.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's the 

question, I guess, that -- your response seems to beg 

the question -- is that they falsely represented.  The 

issue is whether or not something happened between their 

drafting and its appearance in the prospectus that makes 

it appropriate to say that that's a statement of the 

trust rather than a statement of JCM.

 MR. FREDERICK:  It is a statement of both, 

in the sense that the fund is attracting investors, but 

the fund is managed and controlled by the investment 

manager; here, JCM.  If -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But if JCM falsely 

represented what it would do, it made that false 

representation to the fund, and the fund, as has been 

acknowledged, would have a cause of action against JCM.

the complaint says that Janus is representing that its 

mutual funds -- Janus Capital Management, its mutual 

funds -- were designed to be long-term investments.  It 

then says in paragraph 6:  As recognized in the 

prospectuses, JCM purported market timing policy was 

designed to protect long-term investors.

 So, if you read the prospectus and you read 

the complaint, it is absolutely clear what Janus Capital 

Management is telling all the mutual fund investors of 

the world:  If you invest in Janus, we will protect your 

long-term investments.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What isn't clear from all 

of those things is that -- is that JCM made any 

representation to the public.  The representation was 

made in the prospectus issued by the fund, not by JCM.

 Now, the fund may have a cause of action 

against JCM, but what's crucial here is whether -­

representation to the public -­

fiduciary obligations to the fund investors under common 

law -- I forget where this is incorporated -- to 

rubber-stamp what they get from somebody on the outside, 

not to have independent counsel review what they're 

going to say in their prospectus?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Mr. Chief Justice, my answer 

to your question is:  That's actually a very difficult 

question under fiduciary duty law, because here the 

fiduciaries have been duped themselves.

 They, when they got the wording of the 

prospectus and the policy that JCM was purporting to 

implement -- JCM didn't tell the board that there are 12 

secret deals with hedge funds, pursuant to which we're 

going to make money by attracting long-term investors

instance that I'm aware of where a mutual fund 

investment adviser is a publicly traded company would 

that cause of action run on behalf of the manager's 

shareholders.  What we're talking about here is a 

company with a product, and they lie about the product. 

And in that instance, it's no different from the Vioxx 

case last year with Merck or the difference from the 

cold remedy case you are going to hear argument in next 

term.

 The mutual funds happen to be the product of 

the company.  They make misstatements about the product,

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, suppose this case 

didn't involve a mutual fund.  Suppose it involved a 

corporation with thousands of employees, and the 

prospectus is drafted by outside counsel.  It's adopted 

by the directors of the company without changing a word.

 Now, would that case come out the same?  And 

if not, what would -- what exactly would you have us say 

to distinguish the two?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, the outside lawyers, I 

think, are distinguishable in a number of different 

ways.  One is that they are reacting on information 

provided by the company.  That information is typically 

not subject to an independent investigation by outside

counsel to determine the truth or veracity of that 

information.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if it's alleged 

they knew exactly what was going on?

 MR. FREDERICK:  If there is scienter, where 

the lawyers knowingly act in a way that helps or that 

contributes to that fraud, they may well be subject as 

aiders and abettors.  It depends on whether you can 

establish that the lawyers have met all of the elements. 

I mean, you'd have to show reliance.  You'd have to show 

lost causation.  You'd have to show the primary 

violation of the part of the lawyers.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  They would be liable as 

aiders and abettors?  I thought there wasn't aiding and 

abetting liability.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Sorry.  The SEC would be 

able to proceed against the lawyers for aiding and 

abetting.  Whether or not there would be a private 

action would depend on whether the lawyers -- it could 

be pleaded under the heightened pleading requirements 

that they had met all of the elements of the 10b-5 

claim.  I would submit that's extremely difficult.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What is it that -- I'm 

unclear on this.  That's why I use the oil company 

example.  Plain, ordinary -- the top executives in the

oil company write the false statement.  They give it to 

a board that doesn't know it's false, and the board puts 

it out in its name.

 Now, it seems to me it ought to be clear at 

this point in securities law whether those -- the 

president and vice president are or are not liable under 

this 10-b, the (B) part.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes, and we cited those 

cases -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  And they are liable.

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Then their 

response to that is:  This is not like the president of 

the oil company, and the reason that it's not is 

something to do with the nature of the -- the obligation 

that runs between the managers and the fund, which is 

somehow different between -- you understand it better 

than I.

 Can you say what it is and what you think 

your response is?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.  What I will say is 

that they don't have a principal distinction between

if they're just the president?

 MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, at that 

point, we get into a problem, and the problem is how do 

we distinguish an aider or abettor from a principal?

 MR. FREDERICK:  An -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  At that point, I am 

uncertain indeed, and that's why I put out this for 

comment, this suggestion that you follow criminal law 

here and say at least they're a principal if they have a 

high position, they participate in it, they do all these 

things you say, and the entity that they're fooling in 

the first instance is simply a conduit, and, therefore, 

you cannot say it's a scheme, because this other part of 

the scheme wasn't part of it.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, to be a primary 

violator, you have to have met all of the elements of 

the cause of action.

it, and they made -­

on Janus being duped or not?  If Janus was not duped, if 

its board knew and JCM was doing the activity with

abetting.  There has to be something to differentiate

of the person who would not have met all of the elements 

of the 10b-5 claim.  You have to have someone -- you -­

violators.  If there is one element that is not 

satisfied with respect to that person, that person is 

only an aider and abettor and not subject to private 

remedies under section 10(b).  They would be subject to 

aiding and abetting liability under the SEC's

drawing is between making the statement and assisting in 

making the statement.  Isn't that -- isn't that what you 

just said?

we believe, and we assert in the complaint and the 

complaint is adequately pleaded, is that JCM made the 

statements.  Now, to be -­

is assisting in making these statements as if -- as in 

something you want to take place, right?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But what is the difference, 

the distinction in -- in this context?  Now, one 

possible distinction is who formally makes it, in whose 

name is it made, but that's obviously not your -- your 

position.  So, what -- what is it to distinguish a 

principal here from an aider and abettor?

over the content of the message.  That kind of 

substantive control, as -- as the Court in the Utah Ten 

Commandments case pointed out, the government can have 

speech attributed to it on the basis of it putting up a 

monument on public land.  There can be multiple speakers 

with respect to one message, and the question of how 

much substantive control you attribute to a particular 

speaker, we believe, is the appropriate way to view -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you deny that the fund 

had substantive control?  Couldn't the fund have stopped 

this statement from being placed in its prospectus? 

Didn't it have outside lawyers who advised it whether it 

should allow this statement to be included in its 

prospectus?  How can you say that they -- they didn't 

have control?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, they did not have a 

knowledge of the falsity of these statements.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that may mean that 

they're duped, but it doesn't mean that they don't have 

control.  They had control, but you say they -- they 

were duped.  But that's quite a different theory from 

saying that they had control -­

didn't have substantive control over the content of the 

message, because if they did, they would not have 

allowed these false statements to have been issued.  And 

that's the whole point -- that's the theory here.  JCM 

was luring long-term investors with the promise if you 

park your money with the Janus Funds, it will be safe 

in -- from the kinds of market timing problems.  They 

were then secretly going out and luring money from the 

hedge funds to allow them to make short trades -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But there was -- there is 

nothing in the record to indicate that that statement 

was attributed to JCM.

 MR. FREDERICK:  The public understood it 

that way.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You can -- you can play 

with the words "make" as you choose, but do we take the 

case on the assumption that you can show that it was 

attributed to JCM?  I -- I see nothing in -- in the 

record that would justify that.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, JA 275a, Justice --

Justice Kennedy -- excuse me -- says that Janus Capital 

Management reserved the Janus name for itself and that

reserve that?  You said twice in your brief that Janus 

is a name to which JCM reserves the right.  How did it 

reserve the right?

 MR. FREDERICK:  It said -- and this is at 

page 275a -- if for some reason Janus Capital 

Management's contract is terminated, the funds can no 

longer use the Janus name.  They were intending to 

trademark and get the name out there to attract 

investors to the investment adviser's method of 

investing.  And it was that type of usage that brought 

all of this together.  The fund and the management, they 

are in function essentially one entity.  The fact that 

they have contractually outsourced the management 

function should not alleviate the securities fraud that 

is alleged here.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Frederick, a substantial 

part of the power of your argument comes from this 

notion, as Justice Ginsburg said, that JCM was in the 

driver's seat, that JCM had control, that they were --

Janus was at most an alter ego of JCM and maybe 

something more, that it was just a creature of JCM.  But 

the securities legislation seems to deal with that in 

section 20.  And your case is not brought under section 

20 and, because of the relationship between mutual funds 

and their investment advisers, presumably could not be

 So, why should we think relevant the kind of 

controlled relationship that you're talking about?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Because you don't want to 

create a road map for other people to commit fraud, 

Justice Kagan, and that's what their theory does.  What 

their theory does is it says, if we set up shell 

companies or if we dupe people to make statements, we 

can commit securities fraud with impunity, because we 

won't be held liable to having made the statement, even 

though we wrote it, we had substantive control over it, 

et cetera.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Except -- except to 

the SEC, right?  Because they can pursue it under aiding 

and abetting.  It's kind of a big -­

fraud.

you were just responding by saying the problem is that

hit a pretty big bump in the road when the SEC brings an

actions.

 MR. FREDERICK:  But, no, the problem,

the facts, there's no primary violator.  Mr. Perry said 

this morning -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The SEC -­

one in which the funds ultimately cannot be proved to

of the statements in the prospectuses that they released 

to the public, then there would not be a primary 

violator.  Under section 20(e) for aiding and abetting 

liability, the Commission can bring an aiding and 

abetting claim against somebody who provides substantial 

assistance, recklessly or knowingly -- recklessly or 

knowingly provides substantial assistance to a primary

when they only found 50.  Okay?  And four people told 

him to go do something like that, but he's the guy who 

wrote it.  I'd say he didn't behave well, but I don't 

think he's the principal.

was acting specifically at the direction of superiors -­

to write.

JUSTICE BREYER:  They gave him the general 

idea, and then he did it.  He created the words, to use 

your phrase.  When you say "creating the words," he's a 

great writer.

 MR. GANNON:  It -- we do, on page 22, 

acknowledge that somebody needs to be sufficiently 

involved in the creation or dissemination of the 

statement in order to be -- in order to be deemed its 

maker or its author.  And so, it's -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Ah, now we have 

"sufficiently involved."  Once we're into sufficiently 

involved, we're back into what is sufficient to make the 

person the principal rather than the aider and the 

abettor, and apparently creating or writing the 

statement is not clear whether it is or is not 

sufficient.  So we're back into the problem.

action to be brought by a private -­

Scalia, in light of the PSLRA, which requires it to be 

alleged with particularity.  There need to be facts 

sufficient to give rise to a strong inference that the 

defendant acted with scienter.  And -- and there are 

penalties beyond Rule 11 that are -- that are imposed if 

the -- if the plaintiff is -- is mistaken in doing so.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You think attribution to 

the actor is not necessary for the actor's liability for 

a statement?

 MR. GANNON:  That's correct.  We think that 

-- and any other rule would immunize falsely attributed 

or anonymous statements.  And if the whole purpose of a 

fraud was to convince somebody that this statement came 

from Warren Buffett, so that I could turn a quick buck

before the market realized that it wasn't actually from 

Warren Buffett, the fact that it was not attributed to 

me would not change the fact that I had made the 

statement and that the market had relied upon it.

 The truth is that reasonable investors -­

and that's the test for purposes of reliance -- can rely 

on anonymous and falsely attributed statements.  In this 

instance, there's no reason to doubt that an investor 

would have relied on statements in the prospectus about 

the fund's purported anti-market timing and excessive 

trading policies.  And so, we think that there -- in 

general, there doesn't need to be an attribution 

requirement, but in this instance, it's quite clear that 

a reasonable investor could have relied on 

these statements in the prospectus.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, could you have 

-- you just admitted if there -- if the company was 

duped, you couldn't have aiding and abetting liability. 

Could you impose a 20(a) or 20(b) control person 

liability?

 MR. GANNON:  The control person liability 

also needs to have a primary violator under the terms of 

20(a).

think that this test that the SEC is using and that you

recite on page 13 is really pretty broad and that it 

might apply to a range of factual situations that are 

not before us.  Is there a way to confine our holding 

just to the mutual fund situation, and if there is, how 

would you do that?

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I think the easiest way 

would be to analogize it to the cases involving 

corporate employees.  As Petitioners acknowledge, there 

are cases where a corporate employee drafts a statement 

that's issued in the company's name.  In this instance, 

the investment adviser is management for the company, 

and the fact that they happen to be management by virtue 

of contract rather than just the internal arrangements 

of the corporation shouldn't change that arrangement.

 It -- it's also the case that if the Court 

were -- were looking for a way to narrow its holding, it 

could do so by talking about the elements of the 10b-5 

cause of action, which -- which would apply only to 

private suits and -- and not to enforcement actions 

brought by the Commission or by the Department of 

Justice.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your point is that -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it should change 

that, because Congress has made it very clear that

employees.  You -- you want us to undo a clear 

distinction that Congress has made.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, the -- the statute says 

that if somebody -- any person makes the false statement 

directly or indirectly -- and in this instance, the SEC 

sought -- got a cease-and-desist order that's reprinted 

at -- on page 407 in the joint appendix that was 

predicated on a provision of the Investment Company Act, 

section 34(b), that -- that tracks 10(b) and makes it 

unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of 

material facts.  And the Commission believed that they 

were chargeable with that violation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. 

Gannon.

 Mr. Perry, you have 4 minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. PERRY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. PERRY:  Justice Kennedy, in response to 

your attribution question, Mr. Gannon said something 

about falsely attributed or anonymous statements.  We 

have neither here.  We have a correctly attributed, non­

anonymous prospectus that under Federal law says, on the 

first page of the document, who it's attributed to, the 

Janus Funds, who have their own trustees.

seat?  Page 258a of the joint appendix, quote:  "The 

trustees are responsible for major decisions relating to 

each fund's objectives, policies, and techniques.  The 

trustees also supervise the operations of the fund by 

their officers and review the investment decisions of 

the officers."

 There is no misdirection here about who's in 

charge.  The trustees are in charge.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the -- the whole 

arrangement was made possible by JCM.  JCM wants 

long-term investors, so it puts this provision in the 

prospectus.  The board of directors have no reason to 

believe that JCM is dissembling and it's going to go out 

and seek hedge funds.

 MR. PERRY:  If it is a dupe case, Justice 

Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor, it's dealt with by 

20(b), which Justice -- Mr. Gannon did not answer. 

You'll notice 20(b) does not require a primary 

violation.  It allows the Commission to proceed directly 

against any person who acts indirectly where it can't 

act directly.  So 20(b) answers this problem.

 The Commission also -- the 34(b) of the 

Investment Company Act is broader.  There's also section 

206 and 215 of the Investment Advisers Act, which 

regulate the conduct of investment advisers.

Congress has dealt in a very reticulated 

way, and all of the questions today I would submit show 

the absence of bright lines being proposed by my friends 

on this side of the table.  They can't articulate the 

distinction between primary and secondary, between 

principal and agent, between aiders and abettors and 

anyone else.

 This is an area that needs bright lines.  It 

needs to be resolved on motions to dismiss.  Scienter 

can't be resolved on a motion to dismiss.  And the 

Congress, in the Dodd-Frank act, which the plaintiffs 

said, in their opposition in this Court to this 

certiorari petition, was going to solve the problem by 

enacting a new statute -- turns out Congress didn't 

enact that statute.

 Instead, Congress referred this issue to the 

General Accounting Office, to the Comptroller General, 

and said take a year, take all the resources of the 

Federal Government, study the problem of the distinction 

between companies that issue securities on the one hand, 

-- the funds here -- and those who provide services on 

the other hand -- the adviser here.  And tell us, come 

back to the Congress and tell us whether we need to 

solve the problem.  If the government -­

there are -- if investors in a mutual fund are duped by 

a false statement that is made in fact, is written by -­

by the management company and issued by the fund without 

knowledge of its falsity, is there any place they can 

get -- look to for relief?

 MR. PERRY:  The investors in the mutual 

fund, Justice Alito -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  In the mutual fund, yes.

 MR. PERRY:  -- got $100 million through the 

SEC action and resolved all the civil litigation. 

They're a separate class of investors, a whole different 

set of securities laws problems, because they were the 

recipients of the prospectus that offered these 

securities and that contained the false statements. 

These plaintiffs' fundamental problem -- they didn't 

purchase or sell the securities that were offered by the 

prospectus they complain about.  They can't find any 

false statements in anything -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Perry, on the 

allegations of this complaint, these plaintiffs were 

harmed by the misrepresentations, the alleged 

misrepresentations from JCM to the fund.  So if the fund 

was duped, would these shareholders, JCM's shareholders, 

have any relief?

shareholders have no relief.  And, Justice Kagan, I 

would point out in the 70 years since the Investment 

Company Act was enacted and the modern mutual fund 

industry was built, I'm not aware of any case -- and 

they certainly haven't cited one -- in which the 

investors in the parent company have ever recovered a 

dime in an SEC action, in a private action, or 

otherwise, for statements in the funds' prospectuses.

 There is a -- there is a line between 

corporate entities, and the liability runs up different 

channels.  This is a totally novel, unprecedented theory 

that they're presenting.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was the theory of -­

of the fund shareholders?  You said the fund 

shareholders recovered -- there was a settlement.

 MR. PERRY:  Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What -- what was that 

action?

 MR. PERRY:  Their theory was that there was 

an omission.  The adviser owned a duty to the fund.  The 

statements were correctly made, Justice Ginsburg.  There 

was no market timing.  When the -- when the adviser 

later allowed certain traders in, it owed a duty to 

correct those statements in the prospectuses to the 

fund.  That was the liability theory of the investors.

These plaintiffs can't pursue that liability 

theory because the duty doesn't run the other way.  It 

doesn't run from JCM to JCG's investors.  That's the law 

of this case.  And, therefore, they can't bring an 

omissions case; they have to bring an affirmative 

misstatements case for statements that were not directed 

to this group of investors.

Mr. Perry.
