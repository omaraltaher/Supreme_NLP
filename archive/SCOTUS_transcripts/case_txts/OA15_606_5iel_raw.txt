CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

 

MR. FISHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

please the Court: 

 

 

10 

            

Roughly half the trials in this country from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

New York to California to South Carolina are already 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conducted under the rule we seek today:  Mainly, a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement that judges consider evidence of racial bias 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it's offered to prove a violation of the Sixth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment right to an impartial jury. 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

This Court should require Colorado to follow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

the same rule.  Indeed, Colorado already has a turnkey 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

system for implementing an exception to racial bias. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Like every other jurisdiction across the land, Colorado 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already has multiple exceptions to the principle of jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

secrecy.  So all Colorado has to do is use that same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system already in place to administer an exception for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

racial bias. 

 

24 

25 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about religious 

  

 

 

 

 

bias?  Same thing in this case, except it's not, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

3 

know, this is how Mexicans act.  It's this is how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Catholics or Jews act, so they're obviously guilty. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wouldn't that also come under your exception? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, there's obviously, 

  

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

Mr. Chief Justice, frequently an overlap between race 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and religion.  And so for that reason, religion might be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

viewed very similarly --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All right.  Well, 

  

  

 

 

 

that seems to be avoiding the question.  Let's say there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

isn't Catholics. 

 

11 

12 

            

MR. FISHER:  All the Court needs to decide 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case today is race.  That --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I don't think 

   

  

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

that's fair.  Once we decide race -- this is not an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equal protection case; it's a Sixth Amendment case.  So 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

a recent invocation of race is an impermissible --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impermissible enough, I guess, that we will pierce the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury confidentiality.  Well, the next case is going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be religion.  So whatever we say on race is going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to have either a limiting principle that makes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense, or it's going to open up a broad category of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

cases. 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. FISHER:  I don't deny that there may be 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsequent cases if you decide this one in my favor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But I'm saying two things to the Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

5 

1 

            

First of all, you can and should do what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

Court's done in previous situations like this, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

start with race.  And the reason why is because the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has said time and again, in cases like Rose v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mitchell, in cases like Ham v. South Carolina, that race 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is different, race is unique.  It is a unique --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

8 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose we start with race. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

You're not being very helpful to the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

in your answers. 

 

 

            

Suppose we start with race, and the next 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case involves religion.  Now, how would you distinguish 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

religion from race if we were to reach an opposite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion in the religious case? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  What you would do in that case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Alito, is conduct the same analysis you're being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked to conduct here, which is look at the Tanner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors and ask how effective other safeguards are at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rooting out --

 

 

19 

            

20 

            

21 

            

22 

            

23 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Fisher, why? 

  

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  Pardon me? 

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why? 

  

 

MR. FISHER:  Why would you ask that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why?  I mean, you know, 

    

  

 

 

 

24 

25 

the Chief says this is not an equal protection case, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Sixth Amendment applies to the States through the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

6 

1 

Fourteenth Amendment; correct? 

 

 

2 

            

3 

            

MR. FISHER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I always thought the 

    

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

most pernicious and odious discrimination in our law is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on race. 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  I agree with that. 

    

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So why is a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

rule that says, given the exceptions we've recognized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

since the 1800s that have said that race is the most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pernicious thing in our justice system, why can't we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limit this just to race using principles of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourteenth Amendment as well? 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  I'm not denying that you can. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

And of course, the Constitution needs to be read 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structurally.  So not only --

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You think it's 

  

 

 

 

 

odious to have the same sort of discrimination against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone because he's a Muslim or practices Islamic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

faith?  You're saying, he's a Muslim.  Of course, you 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

know, given this, I know how Muslims behave; he 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

committed this crime.  Is that not sufficiently like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial discrimination that it should be carved out? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  It may well be, Your Honor.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly is odious.  And so --

  

 

 

 

 

25 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about sexual 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

7 

orientation?  Somebody gives, you know, a bigoted speech 

   

  

 

 

 

 

in the jury room about sexual orientation and how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular types of people are more likely to commit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes like the one before them?  Is that sufficiently 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

odious? 

6 

            

MR. FISHER:  It's quite odious.  But whether 

  

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

it would satisfy the balancing test we're setting forth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

today would be needed to decide --

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You have to have an answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

for this reason.  No one on the other side thinks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything but this is terrible jury misbehavior.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a given across the case.  It is not a question of the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

validity of the behavior.  It's invalid.  The question 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

is the timing of when somebody has to object. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

And their point is they have to object 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

before the verdict comes in.  Because if you don't have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that rule, you will, in fact, open the door to all kinds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of evils which they mention.  All right?  That's their 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

argument. 

20 

            

So what we're really asking for is your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

reply to that argument.  And it doesn't really reply to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say maybe you're going to have a bunch of other things 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too, 'cause then that strengthens their argument.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the other hand, maybe that's what you think.  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the whole question is that inevitably, opening the door 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

8 

1 

2 

3 

to these other things, which will mean tell the jury, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jury, if somebody says a racist comment, write me a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

note, the judge says, before you reach a verdict. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

Do you get the point?  That's why the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

question is being asked. 

 

 

 

6 

            

7 

            

MR. FISHER:  I --

    

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And so that's why I, too, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

would like an answer. 

 

 

 

9 

            

MR. FISHER:  So I think you've asked a more 

   

   

  

 

 

 

10 

11 

specific question about objecting, and then the more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general question that we've been talking about, about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

drawing lines. 

 

13 

            

So for objecting, let me just say, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

impossible for the defendant to object to the misconduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case because the defendant is not in the jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

room to hear it.  There's never been a right that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

depends on the jurors themselves. 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. -- please, please 

  

 

 

 

 

19 

concentrate on the question Justice Breyer --

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

21 

            

MR. FISHER:  I'm sorry.  Okay.  Okay. 

  

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- has asked you, which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

is answer his question, he's talking about the general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle.  He says everybody is afraid to open the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

door.  All right?  And to the extent that your answer is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply the door is open once you rule for me, 'cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

9 

1 

2 

3 

other bias is going to be viewed the same, it's going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hurt you.  That's what Justice Breyer said.  So tell me 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why that fear is not valid. 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

5 

why. 

6 

            

MR. FISHER:  I think there's two reasons 

    

 

 

 

 

One is you can look at the Court's cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

that I've described already, things like Rose v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mitchell, Ham v. South Carolina, where we have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race-specific rules that have never been extended beyond 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

race. 

11 

            

And the second reason is because, I know 

   

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

this isn't, strictly speaking, an equal protection case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but the same values of the Fourteenth Amendment infuse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Sixth Amendment.  And I think a helpful analogy can 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

be drawn to the tiers of scrutiny. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why isn't this national 

  

 

 

 

 

origin?  I mean, you -- you're trying to isolate race. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But this was a case of a Mexican American.  So why 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't it belong under national origin rather than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

race? 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, I think the Court's case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

law has fused the two concepts, particularly when it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes to people with Hispanic origin.  And so like the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties, and I think the government and everybody 

   

 

 

 

 

 

agrees, race and ethnicity is interchangeable in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

case.

But if I could continue my answer about the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

analogy to the tiers of scrutiny.  It's not that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, is it true with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

respect to other ethnic groups, or only true with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to Hispanics? 

 

 

7 

            

MR. FISHER:  Oh, it's most true with respect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

to Hispanics in this Court's cases, which is why we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used the term "race," and every other party in court in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case has used the term "race." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

And I think the tiers of scrutiny provide a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

helpful analogy. 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can you -- you keep on being 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

cut off before you get to the tiers of scrutiny, but --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

(Laughter.) 

16 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- the cases where the court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

has said that a lawyer has to be allowed to ask on voir 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dire about bias, does that -- is that only true of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial bias, or is that true of any other kind of bias 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

as well? 

 

21 

            

MR. FISHER:  Under this Court's cases, only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

race.  And remember, Ham was decided in 1973.  So there 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been plenty of times for that issue to percolate, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I don't of any lower court decisions that --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think it's --

    

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

11 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And then gender. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry.  Is that -- is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  I'm sorry? 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's just race you're 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  I believe so. 

    

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's just race. 

  

 

 

 

And then Batson would be race and gender; is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  That's right.  And I think 

   

  

  

 

 

1 

            

2 

            

3 

that right? 

 

4 

            

5 

            

6 

saying? 

7 

            

8 

            

9 

            

10 

that right. 

 

11 

            

12 

Batson is another helpful analogy. 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

First of all, in Batson itself, you wrote an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

opinion about race.  And of course the question of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gender came back several years later.  There were three 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dissenters in that case.  It didn't automatically follow 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the first. 

 

 

18 

            

And there is a different analysis that I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

suggest you conduct here as well.  You ask about the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tanner factors and the other factors the State has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed out, things like the composition of ordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

juries look very different when you're talking about sex 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

than race. 

 

24 

            

25 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, suppose --

  

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  Things like --

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

12 

1 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it so different? 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

Suppose somebody in the jury room, say it's an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

automobile accident, says, what do you expect of women 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drivers?  Women shouldn't be allowed to drive cars. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Every woman I know is a terrible driver.  Suppose that's 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

what was said. 

 

 

7 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, you would ask the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

questions we're asking today, but you'd ask it through a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different record and a different set of balancing.  You 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

might conclude -- and I'm not going to deny this -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court might conclude, as it did in Batson, that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should extend to sex.  But you might not conclude that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that would be a separate case. 

   

 

 

 

 

14 

            

And -- and maybe now I can make my tiers of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

scrutiny point, because remember, sex discrimination is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treated differently under the Equal Protection Clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than race discrimination. 

 

 

18 

            

And under a similar analogy, it's not that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

one is more odious than the other, or one is better, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one doesn't -- one doesn't violate the amendment; it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that different tools must be available to root out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different kinds of discrimination.  And that's the whole 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

point of strict scrutiny is we do not leave any stones 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unturned when it comes to race.  It's racial bias. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't it a fact that in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

13 

the decisions of this Court, those tiers are not what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they once were; that is, strict scrutiny is no longer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fatal in fact, and for gender discrimination you must 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have an exceedingly persuasive justification for it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Of course, Justice Ginsburg; 

  

 

 

 

 

that's correct.  And I'm just trying to give this Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an analogy that it might use to think about the problem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of how to apply the Sixth Amendment to different kinds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of alleged bias. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  It's not just 

  

  

 

 

 

 

alleged bias.  It's bias based on innate characteristics 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the offensive remarks.  But the question is:  What is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most likely to -- or a significant risk of depriving the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant of a fair trial?  And it seems to me there are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statements that have nothing to do with race or gender 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or sexual orientation or anything that might have a far 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

greater impact.  And I'm wondering why we -- we don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow impeachment of the jury verdict in those cases? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Someone, I don't know, comes in and says, I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

know that witness.  That witness lies all the time. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Believe me, you can't take anything he says.  I mean 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, in a certain -- in a particular case, could have a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

greater impact. 

 

24 

25 

            

So why don't we allow impeachment of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury processes in that case? 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

14 

1 

            

MR. FISHER:  I think it's a very important 

    

   

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

question that goes to the heart of the case, because I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think you could have also used the hypotheticals from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases like McDonald v. Pless and Tanner and Warger.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reason why is because the Court has said time and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again that race is different. 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

There's a difference between a bias, harmful 

   

   

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

though it may be, that affects only a private litigant, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compared to racial bias which is a stain on the entire 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicial system and the integrity that it's built upon. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And that is the difference, the Court said, in Rose v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mitchell.  It's the difference, the Court said, in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ham v. South Carolina.  It's what the Court has talked 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about in its Batson line of cases.  It's that stain on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the system --

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What did the -- what did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

the 20 States do? 

 

 

 

18 

            

19 

            

20 

            

MR. FISHER:  Pardon me? 

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What did the 20 States do? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  The 20 -- it's actually 18 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

States and two Federal jurisdictions.  But those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions have all limited their -- their exception 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to race.  That's what you're asking. 

  

 

 

 

 

24 

            

And remember, some of those exceptions have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

been around -- in New York, it's been around since the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

15 

'60s.  In Minnesota, it's been around since the '70s. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So we have vast experience in the States.  And when all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the arguments are made on the other side, which I would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respectfully say are all theoretical arguments about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harm that would come from adopting a rule, I stress to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court, this is not a theoretical question.  There's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

an empirical answer that is available to the Court based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the experience across the country, multiple

JUSTICE ALITO:  Race is -- race is different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for some purposes.  But why is it different from other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things for Sixth Amendment purposes?  What the Sixth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment protects is the right to a fair trial -- to an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impartial jury.  And if we allow the exception that you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are advocating, what do you say to the defendant who --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the prisoner who is going to be spending the rest of his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life in prison as a result of the jury verdict that was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determined by flipping a coin? 

   

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  I think I can give you the same 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

answer I gave to the Chief Justice earlier, which is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is woefully unfair.  But when the Court does its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

balancing of the harm to -- on the one side to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicial system of the defendant against the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest, the balance is different when it comes to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

race. 

Alderson Reporting Company

16 

JUSTICE ALITO:  How does that --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  As bad as --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  How does that connect with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

            

3 

            

4 

5 

the right to an impartial jury?  A jury can be partial 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for racial reasons.  It can be --

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

7 

            

8 

reason. 

9 

            

MR. FISHER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- partial for some other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  Because the values of the

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

Fourteenth Amendment are read into the Sixth Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as well.  And if I can give the Court an analogy, think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Bolling v. Sharpe, where the Court asked whether the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Due Process Clause applies to the Federal government --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm sorry -- the Equal Protection Clause applies to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal government, which it doesn't, by its terms.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court said, you know what, the Due Process Clause in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Fifth Amendment does, and that should be infused 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the values of the Equal Protection.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular harms of racial discrimination should be read 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into that amendment as well.  That's all we're asking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

here. 

22 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Has -- has there been any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

case, other than Bolling v. Sharpe?  In Bolling v. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sharpe, the conspicuous absence was any equal protection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle operative v. the Federal government.  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

17 

don't know of any case other than Bolling v. Sharpe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where you have that kind of reverse incorporation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

MR. FISHER:  No.  I think, Justice Ginsburg, 

    

  

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

another example would just be Ham.  Remember that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voir dire line of cases are all due process cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's nothing in the Due Process Clause that singles 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out race, but this Court's opinion does.  And it says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the structure of the Constitution and the unique 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem of race in our history and our society requires 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

special medicine. 

 

11 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you think the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

entire body of law that we have developed in connection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with racial discrimination or the Equal Protection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause is the issue and apply that to your case?  For 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, here, you have a very obviously offensive and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct appeal to -- to race.  What if it's, oh, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, he's from that neighborhood; I know people from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- people from that neighborhood always commit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes like this. 

 

 

20 

            

Now, obviously, that could well be 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

challenged as based on race, or -- I mean, is that also, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do you impeach the jury's -- the secrecy of the jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings for something like that? 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, I think the analysis 

   

  

 

 

 

25 

would be similar to what you do under the Equal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

18 

1 

Protection Clause, but it wouldn't have to be lockstep. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

So the question that's asked in the 20 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

jurisdictions that already do this is, would a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable juror have understood the comments to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about race?  Would the -- would the jurors have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood the juror who spoke to be asking them to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide the case or view the evidence based on racial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

bias? 

9 

            

10 

            

And remember, too, Mr. Chief Justice --

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The second is very 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

different from the first.  That second --

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MR. FISHER:  I'm sorry if I miss -- if I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

confused the Court, but the key, when you're talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about people such as from that neighborhood or whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or not it would be understood as race-based comments as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposed to something else. 

 

 

 

17 

            

18 

            

So a similar question --

   

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I like the second better 

    

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

because what -- otherwise, you're going to have an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidentiary hearing in every allegation, and 20 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions don't, right? 

 

 

22 

            

23 

            

MR. FISHER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There has to be a test 

   

  

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

that tells you when, what's the difference between a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stray remark --

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

19 

MR. FISHER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and something that 

  

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

            

3 

has impact. 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

 

MR. FISHER:  Right.  And so both are 

  

  

 

 

 

required, Justice Sotomayor, and I'm sorry if I was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusing about that. 

 

 

            

First, you asked whether or not it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial bias as opposed to some other kind of bias. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second, you asked whether it went to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence in the case and the defendant's guilt, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it was an off-color joke made during a break or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something like that. 

 

 

            

And let me stress two things.  One is, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions that exist already do this, and even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions like Colorado already do this. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Go back to the first -- I think -- go back 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Justice Breyer's question.  If a juror had sent a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

note out five minutes before the verdict, in this case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or any other, describing racial bias, the judge would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make all the same inquiries --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't see the problem 

    

 

 

 

 

there.  What -- what's actually worrying me about it, if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I had to write this on paper, somebody could say, well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, on -- on request the defense attorney can get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an instruction, send us a note before you reach the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

20 

1 

jury.  That could be happen. 

  

 

 

 

2 

            

But you want to go beyond that and impeach 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

the verdict. 

 

4 

            

The real reason, I suspect, is even though 

   

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

we can imagine cases that are just as unfair, flipping a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coin, et cetera, that part of the purpose of these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amendments is to create a judicial system that is seen 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as fair beyond the individual case, and indeed, being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seen as fair beyond the individual case means that it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more likely to be fair in other cases as well. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

Now, if I'm really honest, I think, yeah, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

that's probably right.  And then the history and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything become relevant.  But have you found any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

support for that? 

 

 

15 

            

16 

Breyer? 

17 

            

MR. FISHER:  For what exactly, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That what we're doing here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

in creating the exception, despite the fact that we can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think of Justice Alito's case which is just as unfair, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though it doesn't involve race, is we're trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

create a fairer system in general and one that will be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perceived as such, and there race is a special problem. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

24 

            

MR. FISHER:  Right.  So --

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So I wonder if you, and --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

and I -- if I could write it right, I think it would 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

21 

1 

make sense, but I'm asking you is there support for such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

a thing. 

 

3 

            

MR. FISHER:  Yes.  You almost spoke verbatim 

  

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

out of the Rosales-Lopez opinion, which draws from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Aldridge v. United States opinion in 1931.  So this is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle that goes quite a ways back in the Court's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisprudence, which is the perception of fairness when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it comes to racial bias and racial discrimination is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

paramount. 

10 

            

And, Justice Breyer, if I could add 

   

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

something -- if I could add two points about your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question, which we return to, about what if the jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be instructed to send a note out. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

Well, there's two problems with that.  First 

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

is, remember the jurors are always instructed, as they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were in this case, to use their common-sense experience 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the jury room, to draw on that.  And remember how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these comments are couched, as is often the case, as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Juror H.C.'s personal experience that Mexican men blah, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blah, blah, blah, blah. 

 

 

 

21 

            

And so a jury instruction at best is going 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

to be cross-cutting v. another jury instruction and not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

always work. 

 

24 

            

And even in the much easier case of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

extraneous evidence and improper influence, which are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

22 

exceptions that Colorado recognizes, as does the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system and everyone else, jurors are always instructed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not to do those things, and yet they do sometimes.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the system demands that we give a remedy when jurors 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't follow those instructions. 

 

 

 

1 

2

6 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is it that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

proceeding that you would have, I mean, if we accept 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your proposal and -- and interview the jurors, subject 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them to the -- what do you -- what do you ask them? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MR. FISHER:  So there's two -- there's two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

steps, Mr. Chief Justice. 

 

 

 

12 

            

First is a threshold showing that I 

   

 

 

 

 

13 

described earlier, that there was a statement that was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

racially --

 

15 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  But the facts 

  

  

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

are as alleged here, I guess.  What do you do once you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have that in -- in the record?  What's next? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

MR. FISHER:  So the judge asks exactly the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

same question the judge would ask with other kinds of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury misconduct like extraneous evidence.  The judge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

asks, is there a reasonable possibility that the verdict 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

was influenced by that bias? 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if the other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

jurors come in and they testify, there's testimony and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody says, yes, that's what he said, and they say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

23 

well, what would you -- but of course the guy was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilty, no doubt about it, and the other 11 said, of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course he was guilty, it was very offensive what, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, HC or whatever it was said, but, of course, he was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilty.  Everybody -- we agreed to -- you know, in five 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minutes.  Does that make a difference? 

   

  

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

MR. FISHER:  Right.  So I think you've asked 

   

  

  

 

 

 

8 

two questions there. 

 

 

9 

            

The first is, is one juror enough, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

second is, do you look at the strength of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

government's case. 

 

12 

            

On the first question, whether one biased 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

juror is enough, the Court's Parker v. Gladden decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 1966 quite clearly says yes, which, of course, is in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line with the way you treated a multimember 

   

 

 

 

 

 

decision-making body last term in Williams. 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

Now, the question on whether you look at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

strength of the government's case as to whether to grant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief, I would tell this Court that's the one issue on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the 20 jurisdictions across the country are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

divided. 

22 

            

Some say the mere fact that a single 

   

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

racially biased juror took that into account in -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issuing his verdict is enough for relief.  And some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other States will look at the overall strength of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

24 

government's case.  For, I think, obvious reasons, the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Court need not resolve that here in this case and could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come out on that question however it wished. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Right.  But you -- and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

5 

specifically what happens next?  The Chief asked the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

question. 

7 

            

8 

            

MR. FISHER:  So -- so --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you have to poll -- do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

all the jurors have to come back and each one testify? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First of all, did HC say what the two jurors said he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said?  There may be doubt about that.  And then whether 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of them were influenced by it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

MR. FISHER:  So -- so there's two questions, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

Justice Ginsburg. 

 

15 

            

The first one is, what does the evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

show, and so some juror testimony is required to bring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out who said what and in what context.  Once that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determined, the judge asks whether there's a reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

probability that the verdict was infected by racial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bias, and that question, Justice Ginsburg, is purely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

objective. 

22 

            

It's very much like what courts do every day 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

when there's a bad jury instruction.  They don't bring 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

all the jurors in and have them testify how they -- how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they interpreted the jury instruction and the like. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

They ask an objective test, saying with those improper 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statements brought into the jury room, would the juror 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have -- the reasonable probability the juror would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

erred in the way they decided. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So the idea would be the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge would say, we'll look at all this other evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

v. the defendant.  I think that they would have found 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him guilty regardless. 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  No, that -- well, that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue I was talking about with the Chief Justice on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which courts are divided. 

 

 

 

            

We think the Court might hold in a future 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case that it's enough to have a racially biased juror --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that would be a kind of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

structural error. 

 

16 

            

MR. FISHER:  That would be a question the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

17 

Court would ask. 

 

 

18 

            

What I meant when I said, look at the other 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

facts, I meant the context in which a statement was made 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

during deliberations.  So it might be that somebody said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something and then somebody immediately spoke up and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corrected that person.  They said, oh, that's not what I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meant.  I meant something else.  And the judge, as they 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do every day in jurisdictions across the country, would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hear this evidence and decide, oh, this jury wasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

26 

1 

actually --

 

2 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But here we have -- in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

case, we have a very blatant statement, but let's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider the standard that now applies on a lot of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

college campuses as to statements that are considered by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some people to be racist. 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

What would happen if one of the jurors has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

the sensibility of a lot of current college students, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and thinks that one of the -- something that's said in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury room that falls into one of those categories 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was a racious -- was a racial comment? 

   

   

 

 

 

12 

            

MR. FISHER:  We're talking here, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

13 

Alito, only about intentional racial bias.  So --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Even the first time a person 

   

  

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

says something that is considered improper on a college 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

campus today and another juror thinks that that shows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intentional racial bias. 

 

 

18 

            

MR. FISHER:  No, I think, as I said, it's an 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

objective test.  Even under the Court's equal protection 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisprudence, the Court hasn't --

 

 

 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.  How will the judge 

  

  

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

decide -- how will the judge decide whether the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement is -- is racist? 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, I think it's the same 

   

  

 

 

 

 

25 

analysis the judge would conduct in an equal protection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

27 

case, which is, is the statement asking to decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly and intentionally on its face the case based on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2

race.

MR. FISHER:  That's all you need to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Presumably the judge faces 

  

 

 

 

 

the same situation if a juror comes in during 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings, is that right, and then the judge has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make whether this is something real or not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Precisely right, Justice Kagan, 

  

 

 

 

 

or after proceedings.  Remember, jurors can walk out to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the courthouse steps, as they were told in this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's entirely proper to discuss the basis for your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict.  So if that afternoon jurors are saying, this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is how we decided the case, the judge might be asked to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make the exact same inquiries.  So there's nothing new 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the inquiry we're asking.  It's just --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does it make any 

  

 

 

 

 

difference if it were not the jurors as here, but the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the lawyer for the defense went around, contacted all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jurors and elicited this testimony?  So it wasn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jurors volunteering, but the lawyer questioning the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurors to see if he can come up with something that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would gain a new trial. 

   

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  So long as what the lawyer was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

28 

doing comported with the local rules with respect to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contacting jurors, it would be the same case.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Minnesota, which is the one place where I think there is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a case about a lawyer breaking the rules in terms of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking to a juror, there's a situation where it's a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

different case than this and the judge might deny

relief.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Yarger. 

 

          

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK R. YARGER 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YARGER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Everyone, including Petitioner, agrees that 

 

 

 

 

the citizen jury system requires safeguards to ensure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

full and fair debate in the jury room and prevent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harassment and tampering after verdicts are handed down. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the juror's alleged statements in this case are no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt reprehensible, but the vital interests that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no-impeachment rule serves apply just as readily here as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they do in other serious alleged cases of juror 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misconduct and bias.  And Petitioner has not shown --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Yarger, let's -- let's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

assume that that's true, that the State interests are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

29 

1 

2 

3 

basically the same, and also let's assume that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

safeguards, voir dire, don't operate particularly 

 

 

 

 

 

differently.  All right? 

  

 

4 

            

So I'll just give you what -- what I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

is the strongest argument on Mr. Fisher's side, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the -- that the interests in preventing unfairness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this kind are much greater; that that's really the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference, is the fact that verdicts based on race 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination pose a harm that verdicts based on other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

kinds of unfairnesses, which exist in the world, and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and are terrible, but still, that it's just not the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of harm. 

 

 

13 

            

MR. YARGER:  And we certainly don't dispute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

that racial bias is a particular problem, and a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular problem under the Constitution.  But I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think it's -- it's correct that other forms of bias 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

won't cause the same types of institutional harms.  Of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course, this Court's recognized that in JEB versus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alabama when it extended Batson to claims of gender 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bias.  And certainly a verdict based on the fact that a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant is a Muslim or a Catholic or a Mormon or any 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

religious group would just as significantly call into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

question --

 

24 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The one question is whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

identity-based harms are different than other kinds of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

30 

1 

2 

unfairnesses, as we've talked about in the Warger case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for example, or the one before that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

And then another question is whether race --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

racial bias is different from other identity-based bias, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  But -- but would you -- would you concede that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identity-based bias is different from like, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the kinds of bias that we've discussed in other cases? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

MR. YARGER:  I wouldn't concede that in this 

    

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

specific context where you're dealing with an individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and a fair trial set v. the important and vital 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests that the no-impeachment rule serves to allow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury to do its job. 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it's true that this is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Sixth Amendment case, but it seems artificial not to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think about the Sixth Amendment issue as informed by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles of the Equal Protection Clause.  And in those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles, as we've always understood them, says that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a special kind of harm in treating people worse 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and, I mean, and certainly, in punishing people because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of their race.  And maybe especially because race is so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

associated with particular stereotypes respecting 

 

 

 

 

criminality, that that's about the worst thing that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can do to a person, and it's also the worst thing that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can suggest about the criminal justice system, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

31 

1 

it allows that to happen. 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

So both of those two things, the harm to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

individual for being punished because of your race, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the harm to society writ large.  And that would, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, be the -- the fact, yes, you're right the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests are exactly the same, and voir dire functions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty similarly.  But it's just a different kind of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

harm.

20 

21 

22 

23 

            

MR. YARGER:  I -- I think it would be 

    

   

 

 

 

 

difficult in the context of the Sixth Amendment in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same courthouse in Colorado to tell one defendant that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that defendant gets to impeach the verdict because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error that happened to occur during deliberations is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial, whereas across the hall it was religious, or it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was simply the jurors disrespecting the jury system 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough to flip a coin.  And -- and that's the problem. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In all of these cases in which Rule 606(b) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is going to apply, you're going to be putting the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual defendant's Sixth Amendment right, which 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner acknowledges can be implicated in a wide 

   

 

 

 

 

 

range of cases, v. the interests that, Justice Kagan, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think you acknowledge are weighty and important, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precisely why Rule 606(b) has survived for so many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

years. 

25 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose this were a 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

32 

1 

2 

3 

capital case.  Would the government of the United States 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come and make this argument, that the person can be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

executed despite what we know happened in the jury room? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

MR. YARGER:  Well, Your Honor, I think 

   

  

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

the -- certainly, this isn't a capital case, and that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might raise different issues.  There are cases set in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the briefing that are capital cases in which the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it doesn't follow 

  

 

 

 

 

9 

from your position. 

 

 

10 

            

MR. YARGER:  And -- and it does.  And our 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

position is it -- it should apply there.  If -- if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury system is so important to be protected in these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other contexts, and is -- and this rule is necessary to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow them to fully and fairly deliberate the issues, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ought to apply in that context as well.  But, again, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think that question needs to be confronted or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answered in this case. 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you have any evidence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

that in the 20 jurisdictions that permit this -- this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge that they've been overwhelmed with cases? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

MR. YARGER:  Your Honor, there -- I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

22 

there are two responses to that. 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

First of all, we -- we don't agree with that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

count of jurisdictions or how it breaks down. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

But second of all, Petitioner does -- does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

33 

point to jurisdictions in which this exception was made, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but he doesn't link that up with evidence that -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is not occurring, that the harassment and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effects on full and fair deliberation are not being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

heard. 

6 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, you can't prove a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

negative.  That's -- that's almost impossible.  So I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

want you to tell me the positive.  Is there evidence of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some run-amuck sort of number of motions filed in any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular case based on racial discrimination, rampant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury harassment, any of the evils that you are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicting in your brief? 

 

 

 

13 

            

MR. YARGER:  Well, what we do have, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

Honor, is specific examples in these particular cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where harassment is a very real problem, specifically 

   

 

 

 

 

 

with respect to racial bias, where, after all 12 jurors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or a large number of jurors are pulled into the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courtroom, it's -- it's determined that the affidavit at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue was manufactured by the attorney, and that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegations were -- were untrue.  And an example to give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the Greer case from Massachusetts. 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

The other thing I'd say is that the Iowa 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

rule, the most permissible version of the no-impeachment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule, certainly was on the table in 1975 when this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Congress considered adopting Rule 606(b).  All of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

34 

those arguments were the same then.  All of those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments were made in Tanner and made in Warger, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what Congress and this Court decided, and the vast 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority of states decided, was that the strict version 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the no-impeachment rule best balances these -- these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests.  And it's a very difficult balance.  We 

   

  

  

 

 

 

certainly acknowledge that. 

 

 

            

But as to Petitioner's count, six states 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply that Iowa rule, and certainly, that's their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment to make.  But that doesn't mean that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception is limited only to racial bias.  In six states 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that acknowledge a Sixth Amendment exception, they don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

apply a categorical rule that allows evidence of racial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

bias to come in, in every case in which it's alleged. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They apply it sort of an extreme-cases test, and most

often --

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you just clarify 

  

 

 

 

 

something?  This -- I think Mr. Fisher told -- told us 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that in the states, whether the -- his number of 20, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yours of six, is right, that this is limited to race. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So it would not be applied to gender, sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

orientation, and apparently, national origin other than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

Hispanic. 

24 

25 

            

MR. YARGER:  Justice Ginsburg, that -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is true, that the cases that we've seen do only deal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

35 

with racial bias.  But we've seen extreme instances of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other types of bias, religious bias v. Jews and Muslims. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And certainly, I think, those courts would have a hard 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

time not extending whatever particular rule they've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted to those settings.  But, yes, we do acknowledge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that to date, the exceptions have been racial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

bias. 

8 

            

In those jurisdictions, the six 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

jurisdictions that adopt the extreme-cases rule, though, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even when there is a very disturbing statement and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

surfaces post trial, the courts still say, well, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

importance of the no-impeachment rule still applies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, and we're not going to create an exception.  And, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of course, that's exactly what the Seventh Circuit did. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What -- what exception 

  

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

would you recognize?  As far back as Reed we have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said -- qualified 606(b)'s -- predecessors in 606(b). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wagner said it:  There might be a case so extreme that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we would not apply this rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

If race is not so extreme, what, in your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

judgment, would be? 

 

 

22 

            

MR. YARGER:  Your Honor, I think the line 

   

  

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

that -- that can be drawn consistent with that footnote 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be whether or not the other safeguards that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary to assure a fair trial were made available in

that particular case.  So, for example, there are cases 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in which voir dire on race or religious bias was not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made available.  That would be a case in which, if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence surfaced post-trial that that kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misconduct influenced the deliberations, an exception 

 

 

 

 

 

might be necessary.  The same, if a court was given some 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hint that bias crept in to the jury deliberations and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't do anything about it.  That would be possibly a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation in which the no-impeachment rule should yield. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But it's -- if we're focused on that balance between --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, right now, we 

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

don't permit or require questioning on bias except for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race in voir dire, so where does your exception work? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

15 

            

MR. YARGER:  Well, it --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because things do creep 

  

 

 

 

 

16 

in.  We don't make exceptions for those things. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

MR. YARGER:  Well, I think that's precisely 

   

  

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

right.  We don't make exceptions, and we expect counsel 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in voir dire to be the mechanism through which we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explore all of these biases.  And so when it is not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken advantage of when it could have been taken 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advantage of in this case and the trial court --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The problem is it 

  

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

assumes that if the question is asked that every juror 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is going to be truthful.  You know, different people can

have different experiences.  But, you know, it is more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rare than common that when a question is asked is anyone 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

biased that most jurors won't raise their hand. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YARGER:  And, Your Honor, I think the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

same challenges arises with regard to nearly any bias 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is crucial to a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is precisely why the practice guides the defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

himself cites or Petitioner himself cites say, asking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the general question is generally not the best way to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expose those types of biases during voir dire.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, not even the general question was asked about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race of the defendant in this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But what other types 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of questions would -- what types of questions would you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

propound if you were trying to elicit whether there was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bias on the part of a prospective juror? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YARGER:  I would propound the same types 

    

 

 

 

 

 

of questions that Petitioner's counsel used below as to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other issues:  People's experiences on the subject, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

whether they believe racial issues still persist in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country, and what their attitudes are. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there are -- isn't it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

so that many lawyers won't ask that question even if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they could?  Because just by asking the question, you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

putting race in the minds of the jurors, and you'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

38 

1 

rather not do that. 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. YARGER:  That's certainly the argument 

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

the Petitioner makes here.  But what experience has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

shown is that a careful and mature voir dire on race is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not likely to infuse racism into jurors.  In fact, quite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the opposite has been observed to happen.  When jurors 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are respectfully confronted with racial issues at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outset of a trial, they tend to counter any racial bias, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether explicit or implicit, that might come up during 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the thought process. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How do you know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

that? 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

            

MR. YARGER:  That's the research that we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

cited for Professor Sommers in the briefing.  Courts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have looked at that research.  The McCowen case from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts, they said precisely the same thing.  Voir 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

dire is a good time and a good mechanism to raise these 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues to ensure that they don't --

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

20 

the --

 

21 

            

22 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's one of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. YARGER:  -- crop up. 

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's one of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

the problems here.  It may be a good time to alert 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people who have this bias not to talk about it.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems to me that's a very hard thing to measure, this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

39 

sort of bias.  And, I mean, one question, I guess, is 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

whether impeaching the verdict in this way will cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people with biases like that to keep quiet about it and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yet still have the same sort of pernicious effect on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

verdict. 

6 

            

MR. YARGER:  Well, and that's one of our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

concerns, Mr. Chief Justice.  And Petitioner 

  

 

 

 

 

acknowledges, I think it's page 16 of his reply brief, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that allowing this type of inquiry only on issues of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial bias might, in fact, drive racial bias 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

underground. 

12 

            

Now, he says that's unlikely.  The Florida 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

Supreme Court said it might happen.  And it strikes us 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it strikes Colorado that if the effect of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial-bias-only exception to the no-impeachment rule 

 

 

 

 

 

drives racism underground where it can't be confronted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and can't be reported to the judge, the balance that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Colorado strikes by not carving out subject matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions to the no-impeachment rule is a good one. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, why?  Isn't -- you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

know, there's a lot of talk about political correctness 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

or not.  And some people think it's a negative thing, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and others think it's a positive thing.  But if an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual is harboring racial bias, isn't it better to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harbor it than infect everyone else's deliberations on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

40 

the basis of it? 

 

 

 

              

I mean, if you're not saying every Mexican 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commits this kind of crime, but you're forced to argue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the evidence to convince your jurors, isn't that exactly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what we want?  Don't we want deliberations on evidence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and not deliberations on someone's stereotypes and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

feelings about the race of a defendant? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

 

MR. YARGER:  That is absolutely what we

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why shouldn't we try 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to drive it underground? 

 

 

 

            

MR. YARGER:  Well, Your Honor, with respect, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I think that if the juror harbors that bias and is on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury, that's going to influence the verdict one way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or the other. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do jurors --

  

 

 

 

            

MR. YARGER:  I don't think it's --

    

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do jurors even know about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the existence of a -- a de la rel rule -- rule -- I 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, that jurors can't impeach their verdict? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YARGER:  Justice Ginsburg, what jurors 

  

 

 

 

 

do know when they enter the deliberation room is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's a secret proceeding.  And they're told after they 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

leave that they can talk to people as much or as little 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as they want about what goes on in the jury room.

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

just as a matter of what goes on in the bar in your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State, in Colorado, particularly, I take it that in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil cases, lawyers who may be trying a similar case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all the time questioned jurors after the fact, after the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict, in order to see how to improve their arguments, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

et cetera, et cetera, in civil and criminal cases.  Is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this a problem generally? 

   

 

15 

            

And a related question:  Are there articles 

   

  

 

 

 

16 

17 

and statistics about the prevalence of this and whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or not this is disruptive to the legal system? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

MR. YARGER:  The specific post-trial sort of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

conversation between counsel and jurors? 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

21 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes. 

  

 

MR. YARGER:  I haven't seen anything like 

    

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

that.  That is a common practice in the State of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Colorado.  But one concern is that, certainly, a skilled 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer in every case is going to present evidence of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleged bias as if it were volunteered to that attorney. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

42 

And it's only after actually inquiring of the jurors, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

putting multiple jurors on the stand to get to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bottom of those allegations of what was said, when it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was said, and what it was meant in context, will we get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to whether this actually exposed racial bias on the part 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a juror or whether it was something else. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

And by that point, you have done exactly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

what Rule 606(b) seeks to prevent courts from doing in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order to create the atmosphere of full and fair debate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the jury room. 

 

 

 

11 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, when this rule was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

first pronounced, they were thinking about quotient 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdicts, coin-flipping, perhaps.  And identity bias 

  

 

 

 

 

didn't figure in back in England when this rule was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

first articulated. 

 

16 

            

MR. YARGER:  Certainly, that might be true 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

at the time the common law rule was announced.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule 606(b) was debated and adopted in the 1970s 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recently.  And since that time, no rule maker has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided to draw lines within the rule based on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject matter of the misconduct of the juror. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

And I think that reflects the tension that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

we were talking about earlier, which is it doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter what kind of bias arises in the course of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings.  All of it has significant Sixth Amendment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

43 

concerns for individual defendants.  And drawing the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

right lines only as to racial bias, but to no other type 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of misconduct, would disserve the rule and wouldn't give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an adequate reason not to draw further lines down the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

road.  And I think that would lead to the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

constitutionalization of the most permissive form of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule, the Iowa rule, which this Court and Congress and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the vast majority of States have rejected.

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

16 

            

MS. KOVNER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

please the Court: 

 

 

18 

            

Racial bias is a real problem that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

United States is committed to eradicating.  But there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are ways to address that problem without undermining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structural protections of the jury system that have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

withstood legal challenges for hundreds of years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I take Petitioner's principal submission 

 

 

 

here to be that a different rule should apply under the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sixth Amendment when a particular form of bias is at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

44

issue.  And I just want to take a moment to underscore 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

how that's really without foundation in this Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

cases. 

4 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Kovner, and it seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

there are two lines of cases which -- in which we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized that racial bias in a jury room is an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

especially important problem, and that there need to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special rules to address that problem. 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

And the first line of cases is the ones that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

on voir dire say that a lawyer who wants to ask about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial bias on voir dire has to be able to ask about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial bias, and that we've applied to nothing else 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

except for racial bias. 

 

 

 

14 

            

And the second is the Batson line of cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

where we've said we're going to prevent lawyers from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing what we otherwise allow them to do when striking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurors will lead to -- may lead to race bias in the jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

room. 

19 

            

Now, here, we have like a screaming race 

   

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

bias in the jury room.  We have the best smoking-gun 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence you're ever going to see about race bias in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury room, and notwithstanding that in these two lines 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of cases we've said there need to be special rules to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address this prevalent and toxic problem in our criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justice system, here, we're not going to do that.

And the question is, why would this category 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

of cases be different from those other two? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

MS. KOVNER:  So, Your Honor, we think this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

Court has never treated some Sixth Amendment violations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as more serious than others, and to talk about these two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lines of cases that Your Honor raises. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

If Your Honor looks at what, I think, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

Court was doing in the voir dire cases, race was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular issue that it confronted there, but it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicating -- and I think it's indicated in other cases, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to conduct the kind of voir dire that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonably calculated to detect the biases that may be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present in a particular case. 

   

 

 

14 

            

So those particular kinds of case involve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

the high risk of racial bias, and that's what why the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court said voir dire on race is required there.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to, I think, answer the question Your Honor asked 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

co-counsel, I think the Court has applied that principle 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in other contexts. 

 

 

20 

            

In the capital context, the Court has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

indicated under the Sixth Amendment you sometimes need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to ask questions about ability to consider mitigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence, and lower courts have said that same principle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires voir dire on other topics. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And then the second area Your Honor raises 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

46 

1 

2 

3 

4 

is the equal protection area, and we think even there, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court has not distinguished among different types of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional violations and said we're going to treat 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some violations of the Constitution as particularly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

serious. 

6 

            

What the Court said in those cases, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

think, Your Honor, is that there has to be special care 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken when the government acts based on race, and so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some conduct that wouldn't be unconstitutional at all, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if it were taken based on some other criteria, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional when it's taken based on race. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  The reason I think would be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

the Sixth Amendment says, in all criminal prosecutions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the accused shall enjoy the right to a trial by an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

impartial jury. 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

              

I agree with you that racial comments in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

room can be equivalent to other comments.  But there may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be -- that's what I wanted to know, a prophylactic 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

aspect, that if you want impartial juries in general, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to deal with the problem of racial confidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the work of the jury.  And that's a reason stemming 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the language of the amendment, to treat race 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specially, and we have 20 states that have done so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without the reasons for limitation swamping the process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

Now, that's what I understand is a textural 

   

   

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

47 

argument, and purposive, that would, in fact, allow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional protection of the kind they're asking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

for. 

4 

            

MS. KOVNER:  So I think when considering --

   

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

I think, Your Honor, when considering a prophylactic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

approach to preventing Sixth Amendment violations, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important to consider both the cost of this rule and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other alternative mechanisms that are available, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those are things that the Court has traditionally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered under the Sixth Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

            

So turning to that with respect to race, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think the prophylactic mechanisms that the Court has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relied on are likely to be particularly available in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many cases with regard to race, and to talk about, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first, voir dire and then the in-trial mechanisms that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your Honor mentioned. 

 

 

            

So in voir dire, as Justice Kagan's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions alluded to, there's a -- a well-settled 

   

   

 

 

 

principle, and it's the law in Colorado that you are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to have the opportunity to ask these questions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about race.  And there's also been a lot of study and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinking that's gone into how to effectively detect bias 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with respect to race in particular. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And then Your Honor alludes to mid-trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reporting.  Now, things can be done to strengthen that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

48 

safeguard.  I think Your Honor alluded to some of the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things that can be done about particular instructions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but in general, jurors are instructed that this kind --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that bias, in general, is impermissible.  And they can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be instructed that racial bias, in particular, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impermissible, and even to contact the judge. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

On the cost side of the ledger, Your Honor, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

this Court has always recognized that there's a very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

high danger and a fair trial danger.  If you are trying 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to reconstruct, after the fact, jury deliberations with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a sort of he said/she said about what was said, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that can really undermine confidence in the jury system. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And we think that that risk may be particularly acute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you're talking about a very sensitive allegation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

like that racial bias occurred. 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

And I think we know, as time goes on, that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

racial bias can be expressed in subtle ways, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly after a jury verdict is rendered and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

somebody goes back into the community where a sensitive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue has been debated, and they're trying to recall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what was said, there's the real risk that there will be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these kinds of credibility --

 

 

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So -- so the more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

insidious the evil, the less reason we -- the more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

caution we should have in -- in inquiring of the jury? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

49 

MS. KOVNER:  No.  We just think that the --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  By them? 

  

 

 

MS. KOVNER:  No.  We think that this is a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

            

3 

            

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

really serious issue and that it ought to be addressed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through the kinds of safeguards this Court has always 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied.  But we think that to the extent the Court has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized dangers, they are present here, and so to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take, for instance, the danger of impeding full and fair 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury room deliberations, we think that's a particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

risk when you're talking about this kind of very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegation that contains a very high degree of social 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

opprobrium attached to it. 

 

 

 

13 

            

So, Your Honor, I mean, there may be cases 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

in which race is discussed in the jury room because it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate, because the claim involves racial bias, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because there's allegations surrounding police 

 

 

 

 

misconduct in which race is often discussed.  And that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different from, for example, coin flipping or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intoxication, where there's really never going to be any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason why those things should go on. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

This is really the kind of allegation that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

most likely -- that opening the door to is most likely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to impede full and fair debate in the jury room.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's one of the --

 

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It does strike me, though, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

12 

13

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

that given that one of the rules is that a juror can, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

during deliberations, say something appropriate --

 

 

 

 

 

something inappropriate is happening here, to the extent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there is this chilling effect, and more -- why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't that produce the exact same chilling effect? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. KOVNER:  Yeah.  I mean, I think --

    

   

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, it seems like it's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

such on the margins, what you're saying. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. KOVNER:  I think, you know, for hundreds 

    

 

 

 

 

 

of years courts have treated the mid-trial context as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different.  And I think a reason why is in that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

mid-trial reporting, you're really talking about 

 

 

 

 

 

something that sets off jurors' alarm bells at the time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Once the trial is over, not only do you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other interests kick in, in finality and tampering and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harassment, but there's also just really the risk that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurors regret their decision in the case.  They start to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second-guess what they did, and as a result they start 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to misremember, or they're subject to community 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pressures that aren't present when the trial is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

occurring. 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

 

 

Your Honor, we're not suggesting that this 

 

 

 

 

is not a serious issue, and even one that jurisdictions, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including this Court when it sits as a rulemaking body, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can study and consider.  It's a difficult balance.  But 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

51 

what this Court has generally said with respect to rules 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of evidence is that states have a lot of flexibility 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on -- to adopt different approaches.  And we think this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a case in which the interests that the rule serves 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are fully present, and the safeguards that the rule has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relied on historically are fully present, and so the

2

6 

7 

Court --

 

8 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Like -- like the 

  

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

government of the State of Colorado, the government of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States would make the same argument in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

capital case? 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MS. KOVNER:  We think that capital cases do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

present Eighth Amendment considerations that are not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present here.  The Court has often suggested under the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eighth Amendment different sets of rules apply, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there may be different considerations in that context. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But, Your Honor, we think, to the extent the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court regards the rule as problematic or as one that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deserves further study, the appropriate way to do that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is as a rulemaking body, which is another way in which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court considers and continually exercises oversight 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as to the rules of evidence.  But it shouldn't impose a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new constitutional rule that requires setting aside a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historic structural --

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In the states that allow

Official - Subject to Final Review 

52 

this kind of evidence, is it -- is it all done by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislation, or by rule -- or by a rule of court?  Or 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has it come about by judicial decision? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

MS. KOVNER:  I think it's a mix.  Some of 

    

   

  

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

these jurisdictions are jurisdictions that employ, 

 

 

 

 

 

basically, the Iowa rule, so they let in a lot of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence about what was said in jury deliberations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They just have a broader rule. 

   

 

 

 

            

Some have said, under our State law we think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is an exception that has to exist to the rule.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some of the decisions on which Petitioner relies are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

constitutional decisions. 

 

13

sorry.

room.  So suppose it -- it came out later that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurors at the penalty phase in the capital case said, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't really care what the law is.  We just want to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impose capital punishment, or they flipped a coin. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

Would you -- if there were a special rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

for capital cases.  Would you draw the distinction based

on race? 

 

24 

25 

            

MS. KOVNER:  I -- I don't think so, Your

MR. FISHER:  Thank you.  I'd like to make 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

four points, please. 

 

 

11 

            

First, just to pick up where that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

conversation left off, to the extent my friends on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other side are saying that in a capital case the Eighth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment would become relevant, that's exactly the kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of common-sense structural constitutional argument that 

 

 

 

 

 

we're making and the other side is suggesting improper, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that when you look at the Sixth Amendment right to an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impartial jury, you also consider other elements of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitution, like the Fourteenth Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

Secondly, with respect to the prophylactic 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

measures that the other side propounds, and specifically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voir dire, two points.  First is, the studies they point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to are studies where race is already infused from -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case from the outset.  Cases like Ham v. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

South Carolina, where the defense is all about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

54 

person's race.  And in those settings, questioning of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

voir dire is almost incumbent on deference lawyers and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes has good effect. 

 

 

 

            

But that's not what the question really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before the Court today is.  If they are saying that voir 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dire is a cure-all for this situation, what they are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying is in every single criminal case, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shoplifting, whether it's white-collar crime, whether 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a DUI, any case a defense lawyer is -- is really 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required to interject race into the case from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

outset. 

12 

            

And so as between interjecting race into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

case from the outset, potentially offending jurors, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potentially suggesting race is relevant where it doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exist, and our solution, which is just simply having a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional failsafe for this once-in-a-blue-moon 

 

 

 

 

where you have this grave problem.  We think our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solution actually does a lot less upheaval to the system 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than an opinion from this Court that says voir dire is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the answer here. 

 

 

21 

            

Next, let me say something where we agree 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

with the other side.  I think I heard both counsel for 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other side say this is a balance.  And we agree 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's what the Court's cases dictate and that's what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

606(b) itself strikes as a balance between the interest 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

55 

of justice and the principle of jury secrecy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I would suggest to this Court, though, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you conduct that balance, where we disagree with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other side -- let me use the line from the Solicitor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

General's brief.  They said the Court's duty here is to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choose the lesser of two evils.  Racial bias is never 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the lesser evil.  The Court has never said that racial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bias is a lesser evil than something like the public 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy considerations here.  And I know the Court is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

concerned about line drawing.  It's obvious in -- in a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation like this where you announce a new rule as a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional matter that you're wondering what cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are going to come next. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

            

But I respectfully submit that the Court has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

never refused to remedy intentional race discrimination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the criminal justice system for fear of having to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address other questions down the line.  And if you look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the Court's cases, whether they're the Ham line of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases, whether the Batson line of cases or anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else, the Court will have ample tools and ample time to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide down the road whether other situations are the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same or whether they are different. 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

Our submission here, though, is that race is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

unique, race is a particular poison, and that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

experience of the 20 jurisdictions that have this rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

56 

shows that implementing the rule we're asking will not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

create any significant problems with respect to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State interests or the administrators --

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Mr. Fisher, it's not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

fear of confronting issues down the road.  It's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of understanding the scope of the rule that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are asking us to adopt.  And I'll give you one last 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chance.  You will not tell us today whether your rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies to discrimination on the basis of -- of religion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or gender or sexual orientation or to add another one, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

political affiliation. 

 

12 

            

So if the jurors -- if it came out the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

jurors said this person is a Democrat, send him to jail, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that would be a different result.  You will not tell us 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the same -- whether the rule would apply in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

those situations. 

 

17 

            

MR. FISHER:  I think it's easy to say, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Justice Alito, that categories covered in the Equal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Protection Clause case by rational basis analysis would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not require the rule we're seeking today.  I'm trying to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be forthright with the Court by saying I acknowledge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there will be other hard questions about identity, as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kagan put it.  I'm not representing somebody 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

today that has that case.  And I think the Court would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want full briefing on it. 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

57 

And if I could just return to the --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Maybe you could put the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

            

3 

4 

5 

question a little bit differently, because I understand 

   

   

 

 

 

why you don't want to say, well, it wouldn't apply to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this or it wouldn't apply to that.  But in what ways is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

race unique? 

 

7 

            

MR. FISHER:  Race, this is unique in terms 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

of our history and constitutional structure and in terms 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the more practical considerations of rooting it out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the prophylactic measures we've discussed.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

briefing is filled with citations and examples of why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race is particularly hard to get at through the Tanner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors as compared to even something like other kinds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

of discrimination. 

 

15 

            

And the tiers of scrutiny analysis I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

is a good place for the Court to look, because it's not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we're saying other forms of discrimination are okay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the constitution whereas race discrimination is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

unconstitutional. 

20 

            

We're saying that different tools need to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

available, more searching inquiries need to be done, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it comes to race.  And that's why we think the rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of evidence here gives way in a situation where it might 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not in other cases. 

 

 

 

25 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
