 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
 

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 
3
4  first this morning in Case 11-1025, Clapper v. Amnesty 
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12  Respondents have standing to bring a facial challenge to 
13  the 2008 amendments to the Foreign Intelligence 
14  Surveillance Act.  Those amendments provide authority to 
15
16  foreign persons located abroad for foreign intelligence 
17  purposes. 
18
19  imposed statutory protections designed --
20
21 
 As I read your brief, standing would only 
22
23  arise at the moment the government decided to use the 
24  information against someone in a pending case.  To me, 
25

the executive to conduct surveillance targeted at 

 Along with that grant of authority, Congress 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  General, is there 

anybody who has standing? 

that --

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Several points,
 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- would seem to say
 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Your Honor, under the
 

suggesting there is -- but that if there was a
 

statute, there are two clear examples of situations in 

1
2  Your Honor --
3
4  that the Act -- if there were a violation; I'm not
 
5
6  constitutional violation in the interception, that no
 
7  one could ever stop it until they were charged with a
 
8  crime, essentially.
 
9
10
11  which the individuals would have standing. 
12
 The first is if an aggrieved person, someone 
13  who is a party to a communication, gets notice that the 
14  government intends to introduce information in a 
15
16  standing could include a facial challenge like the one 
17  here. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General Verrilli, can you 
18
19  be specific on who that person would be?  Because, as I 
20
21  lawyers in this case would be charged with any criminal 
22  offense.  It's more probable that their clients would 
23  be; but, according to the government, their clients have 
24  no Fourth Amendment rights because they are people who 
25

proceeding against them.  They have standing.  That 

understand it, it's unlikely that, for example, the 

are noncitizens who acted abroad. 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So the client is somebody 

who is abroad and who acted abroad, and is not a U.S. 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's certainly true. 

 So it's hard for me to envision.  I see the 
1
2  theoretical possibility, but I don't see a real person 
3  who would be subject to a criminal charge who could 
4  raise an objection.
5
6  information were -- if anyone gets notice, including the 
7  client, then the lawyer would know, and the lawyer would 
8  be in a position at that point to act. 
9
10
11  citizen. 
12
13  But, in addition, Your Honor, the statute provides that 
14  -- that electronic communication service providers can 
challenge authorizations under the Act, so you -- there 
15
16  certainly would be standing in that instance. 
17
18
19  service provider would object?
20
21  provider did object to the immediate statutory 
22  predecessor to the 2008 amendments.  And the -- and the 
23  FISA court litigated that constitutional challenge.  So 
24  there's a concrete context there in which it arises. 
25

 There was such a case. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How likely is it that a 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, the service

one, we acknowledge that it may be difficult for a 
plaintiff to do so because an -- a challenge to the 
application gets into classified information pretty 
quickly. 

1
2  unsuccessful. 
3
4  Court found there was no Fourth Amendment violation 
5
6
 But I think the point here, Your Honor, 
7  is -- the key point is this, that the -- in a normal 
8  case, a plaintiff would challenge the application of the 
9  authority to that plaintiff.  In a situation like this 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  difficulty. 
17
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, using what you just 
18  mentioned, suppose -- just let's suppose that the Court 
19  should hold there is standing.  Couldn't the government 
20
21  information is classified, these are state secrets, we 
22  can't -- we can't go forward with the litigation? 
23
24  Of course, there's a procedure that the executive branch 
25

then say as far as the merits of the complaint, this 

 I think what the Respondents have tried to 

do here is to find a theory of the case that avoids that 

would have to go through, but that's a possibility. 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  That is a possibility.

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  General, I don't know 

I just want to make sure that I'm clear. 

 Given that lawyers are unlikely to be the 

 But I don't think we can get to that point, 

1
2  Your Honor, because I do think the key point here is 
3  that the Respondents' claims about this statute depend 
4  on a cascade of speculation.  This statute only grants 
authority.  It doesn't command anything.  And in order 
5
6  for the Respondents to make a claim that they are 
7  injured, in fact, by this statute --
8
9  that you've answered my question.  Perhaps you have, but 
10
11
12  targets of an investigation, if they -- if their 
13  conversations would be intercepted, according to you 
14  they'd never have standing.
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I don't think it's 
15
16  appropriate, Your Honor, to relax the Article III 
17  standing requirement of injury in fact based on the 
18  reality that the specific applications of this statute 
19  may involve classified information.
20
21  we've had cases in the past where it is clear that 
22  nobody would have standing to challenge what is -- what 
23  is brought before this Court. 
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Verrilli, we've had --

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's exactly right, 

Justice Scalia. 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is the test that you 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.  The key point, I 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  That the Court's 

authority cannot be invoked in that circumstance.  And 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And we've said that that 
1
2  just proves that under our system of separated powers, 
3  it is none of our business. 
4
5
6  the mere fact that a specific application requires 
7  getting into classified matters can't change that basic 
8  Article III requirement. 
9
propose that the injury -- I think your brief used the 
10
11  word imminent -- is another way of saying that -- is it 
12  unfair to characterize the government's position as 
13  saying that you're submitting that the injury must be 
14  certain?
15
16  think, is narrower than that, Justice Kennedy. 
17
18  about the government's conduct, not the connection 
19  between the government action and an ultimate effect on 
20
21
22  let's assume for the moment that the lawyer would be --
23  that the lawyer would be injured if his communication 
24  with the client were intercepted, or at least that he 
25

would have standing to prove injury.  Let's assume that 

 This is a case in which the speculation is 

the Plaintiff. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, let's assume --

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 If that is an acceptable premise, assume 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  The government conduct
 

1  for the moment. 
2
3  that it is, are you saying that it has to be certain to 
4  occur?  And another test is there's a reasonable 
likelihood, and then we get in the middle, is it a
 
5
6  substantial likelihood.  You have to say -- you say
 
7  imminent.
 
8
9  being challenged has to either have occurred or be
 
certainly impending.  And here, we have the polar 
10
11 
opposite, Your Honor.  I think it is important to think 
12 
about --
13
14
15
16
 And I think -- I think, if the Court thinks 
17  about it, every single case in which the Court has found 
18  standing, there's never been a dispute about whether the 
19  government was going to act or not; the dispute was only 
20
21  the plaintiff's injury. 
22
23
24  this case the Complainant can never know.  I mean, I 
25

 Here, they're fighting about what --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General Verrilli, but in 

know you emphasize the speculative nature of this claim, 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Certainly impending. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Certainly impending. 

That's the language from this Court's opinions. 

about the connection between the government action and 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it -- you were 

talking -- you wanted to say there's a cascade of 

 I mean, are we to assume that --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, that's not 

1  but it's not speculative if the government being given 
2  this authority by Congress is going to use it.  Isn't 
3  that so? 
4
5
6  speculative, Justice Ginsburg, but what is speculative 
7  is the connection between the grant of authority and a 
8  claim of injury.  I do think it's important --
9
10
11  inferences, I think was your phrase. 
12
13  speculation --
14
in your view these -- all these inference that we're 
15
16  required to go through, if the Respondents' theory is 
17  adopted, you were going to tell us about --
18
19  that.  Thank you, Your Honor, yes.
20
21  about what the intelligence priorities and objectives of 
22  the executive branch are. 
23
24  executive branch officials are going to exercise their 
judgment to translate those priorities into procedures 
25

 Second, they have to speculate about how the 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  There's a cascade of 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You want to tell us that 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I'd like very much to do 

 First, the Respondents have to speculate 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Third, they have to speculate about the 

the lawfulness of those procedures and assessing whether 

FISA court ever -- ever turned down an application. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, but that, Your 

1  and procedures that comply with the statutory targeting 
2  and minimization requirements. 
3
4  independent judgment of an Article III court assessing 
5
6  those procedures comply with the Fourth Amendment. 
7
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there much of a 
8  speculation involved in how -- I think it's only one 
9  time, and it was under the pre-amended statute, that the 
10
11
12  Honor, is, I think, not a fair assessment of the 
13  process.  It's really very much an iterative process in 
14  which there's a dialogue between the executive branch 
and the FISA court in which the court can demand more 
15
16  information, raise objections.  Those get worked out, 
17  and then there's a final order. 
18
19  fact that there's only one rejection that this -- that 
20
21
22  described, once you get through all that, you still have 
23  to speculate about whether the communication that --
24  whether the persons with whom the Respondents are 
communicating are going to be targeted, and that 
25

 So I don't think it's fair to infer from the 

it's a process that isn't rigorous. 

 But, in addition to the speculation I just 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, here is -- I assume 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  It may be a harm, yes. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So the question is 

1  Respondents' communications will get picked up and --
2
3  that it is an injury for an American speaking in America 
4  to have his communication intercepted against his will 
by the American government.  We take that as a harm; is 
5
6  that right? 
7
8
9  how likely is that to occur?
10
11  under this Court's cases, Your Honor, is whether the 
12  government is going to take an action that makes that 
13  certainly impending. 
14
15
16  I mean, you know, nothing is certain.  But I see it's 
17  some degree of what you say -- some people say 
18  certainly, some people say likelihood, etc.  So put that 
19  to the side.
20
21  declaration of Mr. Scott McKay.  Now, Mr. Scott McKay 
22  says he's represented two of the people who are 
23  allegedly part of al Qaeda and committed crimes, and he 
24  has represented them for some time.  One was in 
25

Guantanamo.  Another is charged with various crimes and 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Fine.  That's 

why I say certainly -- it might not be a storm tomorrow. 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, I think the question 

 What I want to know is, we have the 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 In the course of that, he has to phone and 

intercepted some 10,000 telephone calls and 

1  is subject to many, many civil suits. 
2
3  has phoned lots of people in Saudi Arabia, in the 
4  various Arab states, and in the past the U.S. 
5
6  20,000 e-mail communications involving his client. 
7
 So isn't it a fair inference, almost pretty 
8  certain, maybe about as much as the storm, that if the 
9  security agencies are doing their job, they will, in 
fact, intercept further communications involving this 
10
11 
particular individual, the two that he's representing? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Actually, Your Honor --
12
13
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And why doesn't that meet 
14  the test?
15
16  the last speculative inference that needs to be drawn in 
17  order for them to make out their chain of causation, and 
18  it's this:  They have to speculate that whatever 
19  surveillance occurs will occur under this authority, as 
opposed to other forms of lawful authority that they do 
20
21  not challenge. 
 And Mr. McKay, that situation is a very good 
22
23  example of this.  We point out in footnote 11 at page 32 
24  of our brief that Mr. McKay says, yes, my client was 
25

subjected to 10,000 interceptions of phone calls, 20,000 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- I think that gets to 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But why can't we get an 

1  interceptions of e-mails.  Every one of those, it's a 
2  matter of public record, was under the authority of FISA 
3  before it was amended in 2008 --
4
answer to that question?  I mean, I see your point.  I'm 
5
6  interrupting because I -- I see where you're going.  And 
7  it seems to me that, at least, if held in camera, I 
8  can't imagine what security it would violate, whether 
9  the government were to say, if necessary privately to a 
judge, would say, no, we do not intend to use this new 
10
11  authority for this purpose. 
12
13
14  contrary.  And so couldn't we find out whether he has 
15
16  national security? 
17
18  there without establishing that there's a case of 
19  controversy.  And they haven't --
20
21 
22 
23
24  summary judgment now, and the --
25

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, there is if, in fact, 
the government is going to use this statute to continue 
to do some of the 10,000 or 20,000 --

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  But he's just --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Or it could say the 

standing there without jeopardizing any concern of

 And so the only information that's in front 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't see how that 

is pertinent.  What you're saying is they don't have 

1
2  summary judgment based on the declarations that they 
3  submitted.  And the declarations that they submitted 
4  contain the information I described.
5
6  of the Court in making a decision now is information 
7  that that surveillance occurred under another authority 
8  that still exists and could still be applied --
9
10
11  standing to challenge program A because they may also be 
12  injured under program B.  And do you have an example of 
13  a case where we've held that? 
14
15
16  that the argument of the lawyers is that we have a duty 
17  to incur costs to avoid the surveillance, but that duty 
18  is triggered by, according to their expert affidavit --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, there again, 
19
it depends how you phrase their injury.  If you phrase 
20
21  their injury as being subject to surveillance under a 
22  particular statutory provision that they think is 
23  facially invalid, saying that, well, you're not going to 
24  get any relief because you're going to be subject to 
25

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think it's -- I think 
the problem, Mr. Chief Justice, is redressability, in 

surveillance under a different provision, I mean, they 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  But they still have to 
show a concrete application of the authority they're 

say, oh, well, it's one injury to be overheard under 
this statute, it's another injury to be overheard under 
another statute?  Do you know any case where we've --
we've cut the baloney that fine? 

1  may say, well, we may, or we may not, but we still have 
2  the right to cure the injury of being subject to 
3  surveillance under 1881a. 
4
5
6  challenging.  That's what this Court faces --
7
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do -- do we parse injury 
8  that finely?  I mean, the injury, it seems to me, is 
9  being overheard.  Does it -- by the government.  Do we 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  They have to show --
17
18
19  going to be injured by being overheard.  And you're 
20
21  therefore, by preventing the government from overhearing 
22  them under this statute, we're not redressing their 
23  grievance, which is being overheard by the government. 
24
25

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, I don't.  But -- but 

I do think the redressability point is a valid one. 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's precisely what I'm 

saying. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  General Verrilli --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, the thing is they are 

saying that they will be overheard anyway, and, 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, General Verrilli, this 

First, in terms of the expansion of authority, yes, 
that's fair with respect to the authority that existed 
immediately preceding the statute. 

 I actually think -- a bit of context is 

1
2  statute greatly expands the government's surveillance 
3  power.  Nobody denies that.  And so if the question from 
4  these lawyers' perspective is, what chance do I have of 
being overheard, and what precautions do I have to take, 
5
6  this statute makes them think about that question in an 
7  entirely different way, doesn't it? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think, as 
8
9  compared to -- let me make two points about that. 
10
11 
12 
13
14  relevant here -- that what this statute was trying to do 
is reset the initial balance that Congress struck under 
15
16  FISA in 1978, when the large majority of overseas 
17  communications were carried by satellite and, therefore, 
18  not within FISA. 
19
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

baseline position before this statute and the position 
after this statute, these lawyers and other people in 
their situation are going to understand that this is 
just true, that the government is intercepting more 
material, and that they have to take greater precautions 

 And, of course, what --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, but if you take the 

17
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I don't agree with that, 

statute was passed, it seems to me, just from a kind of 

1  in order to keep their conversations confidential, if 
2  that's what they want to do, which lawyers want to do. 
3
 So they're going to take precautions that 
4  they wouldn't have had to take the day before this 
5
6  commonsensical point of view. 
7
8  Justice Kagan.  I think -- this statute does not 
9  regulate them.  It confers authority on the government. 
They take whatever precautions they choose to take based 
10
11 
on their beliefs about how that authority's going to be 
12 
exercised.  That depends on the speculation I described. 
13
 What this Court held in Summers is that you 
14  have to have a concrete application of the authority in 
order to meet the minimum constitutional requirement for 
15
16  Article III standing. 
17
18  same circle we started with, which is the one that 
19  Justice Breyer started with.  He pointed to one person 
under -- who has been surveilled continuously, tens of 
20
21  thousands of interceptions.  Can you really say that the 
22  government's not going to target him under this greater 
23  authority that it sought just for the purpose of 
24  ensuring that it casts a broader net?
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now we're back at the 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think -- I think it is 

18
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 Now, there were these farmers who were
 

 Now, why isn't that exactly what's happening 

1  speculation.  I think you do not have a concrete
 
2  application of this authority against anyone, and
 
3  therefore you cannot meet the basic Article III
 
4  requirement of standing that's set forth in Summers.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I don't see why,

10
11  contaminate our crops or not; we think that there's a 
12  significant risk that it will contaminate our crops. 
13  Because we think that there's that significant risk, we 
14  have to take precautions.

16  in this case?  We now think, says the -- say the

18  conversations will be surveilled, a risk that didn't 
19  exist before.  Because of that significant risk, we have 
20
21  farmers in Monsanto took; therefore, there is standing. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think the difference 
22
23  between this case and Monsanto illustrates our point. 
24  If the plaintiff in Monsanto had come into court and 
said, Congress has enacted a statute that gives the

Monsanto did -- it's not Congress; it's an agency -- but

10
11  the agency issued a rule saying that farmers could go

14  because of that, essentially, delegation of authority, 
the plaintiffs in that case were going to be burdened.

3  theory that allows them to avoid that problem.  But it 
4  is inherently based on speculation, and I --
5
6  speculation.  The government has a statute that says you 
7  can wiretap in the United States organized crime when 
8  life is at stake and you show it to a judge.  Then they 
9  say, that isn't good enough.  We pass a new statute, and

14  statute 400,000 times.
 Now, I'll tell you, when the government gets

7  wiretapping the people who are described here, who are

But in Summers, the distinction between likelihood and 

Monsanto the government tells us:  We knew that the 
governmental act was occurring, and then once we knew 
that, the question was substantial risk. 

1  Honor, that the Court has settled on certainly 
2  impending.  The cases that the -- the government cites 
3  are cases like -- I think that the one that the 
4  government cites, relies on most heavily is Summers. 
5
6  certainly impending was not one that the Court relied on 
7  in -- in that decision.  The Court said that plaintiffs 
8  couldn't meet even the lower standard.  So I think that

16  Meese v. Keene, these are cases in which the Court 
17  didn't look to the certainly impending standard at all. 
18  The question that the Court asked in those cases was: 
19  Is there a substantial risk?  Is there a substantial 
risk that effectively compels the plaintiff to act in 
20
21  the way they are -- they are acting?

23  this distinction in Monsanto.  They say Monsanto is a 
24  case in which the government was actually doing

 MR. JAFFER:  Justice Kennedy, the -- the --

 But aside from that, those cases like 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's not enough, of 

the substantial risk compelled plaintiffs to do 
something immediately. 

1  even, in this case, first of all, we know that the 
2  government is using the statute.  They have acknowledged 
3  that they are using the statute.  So there -- there is a 
4  certainty of government conduct.
5
6  Monsanto and Laidlaw and Meese are not cases that --
7  that actually turned on the fact that the government was 
8  doing something.  They are cases that turned on the fact 
9  that there was a substantial risk of future injury, and

4  believe that their own communications will be monitored 
5

8  it's also that -- that plaintiffs communicate with the 
9  kinds of people the government is likely to -- to

12  into account the fact that a court is going to pass upon 
13  the government's ability to intercept these

17  some sense stands between plaintiffs and the future 
18  injury that they -- that they fear. 
19
20
21
 MR. JAFFER:  I don't think it's that simple. 
22  The -- the -- the court, the FISA court, is tasked with 
23  assessing the reasonableness of targeting and 
24  minimization procedures.  But the statute itself 
25

forecloses the court from imposing the kinds of limits

 MR. JAFFER:  Well, the Court would have 

defining targeting procedures defines them to be
 

1  that plaintiffs think the Fourth Amendment requires.  So 
2  for example, the statute itself in section (g)(4) says 
3  that the government is not required to identify the 
4  facilities to be monitored.  And the statute itself in

say who the particular person or the particular 

statute was to remove those tests, to remove the 
probable cause requirement, and to remove the facility 
of requirement, the requirement that the government 
identify to the court the facilities to be monitored. 
So those are gone.

1  understood it, it's not like in the old statute, where a 
2  target was identified and FISA decided whether there 
3  was -- the court decided whether there was probable 
4  cause.  Under this new statute, the government doesn't

19  which is essentially the surveillance the plaintiffs

of the person's conversation being intercepted, but it's 

1  because they took preventative measures, wouldn't that 
2  undermine completely the -- the "certainly impending" 
3  standard?  You have a person who is in a situation where 
4  there is a certain risk, a certain degree of risk of --
5
6  not certainly impending.  So then the person simply 
7  takes some preventative measures, and acquires standing 
8  that wouldn't otherwise be present. 
9
10
11  Honor, for a couple of different reasons.  The first is 
12  that "fairly traceable," which is the standard that the 
13  Court has used when there is an actual injury, is a 
14  standard that does real work.
 So if plaintiffs, for example, were acting 
15
16  unreasonably in taking the measures they are taking, if 
17  plaintiffs were gratuitously buying flight tickets, they 
18  couldn't create standing out of nothing.  It would have 
19  to be a reasonable reaction to the risk.
20
21  go back to sort of the -- the basic standing --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me, before we go 
22
23  further.  A reasonable reaction to the risk; but it 
24  doesn't have to be a reasonable reaction to a certainly

 MR. JAFFER:  You are right, Justice Scalia. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's his question. 

1
2  It doesn't, on -- on our theory. 
3
4  Doesn't it undermine the certainly impending?
 MR. JAFFER:  And the only point I was trying 
5
6  to make is that if there is a distance between these two 
7  standards, it's a -- it's a pretty narrow distance.  But 
8  the other point I want to make is just that the 
9  reason -- to the extent the Court has imposed a higher 
standard for cases involving only future injury -- and 
10
11 
again, we don't concede that the Court has imposed a 
higher standard, but to the extent it has, it has done 
12 
13 
so because it wants to assure itself that the future 
injury is sufficiently concrete to warrant the Court's 
14 
intervention. 
15
16
17  is assured of concreteness.  The actualness of the 
18  injury makes the case concrete on its own.  And so I 
19  think that the standards do different work.  I don't 
think it's a question of an end-run around the imminent 
20
21  standard.  It's a question of the Court assuring itself 
22  that there is a concrete case before it. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Jaffer, it seems to me

 So, for example, if she is talking to a

about the ways that information might be used against

13
14  me that the concern you're talking about is present in 
every area of practice.  If you're representing someone 
15
16  who is being prosecuted, you don't send an e-mail 
17  saying, you know, the government hasn't yet asked where

 Suppose you have a case where a lawyer says,

18  single case that falls into this category that you're 
19  talking about?
 MR. JAFFER:  No, but I think that that --
20
21  that there's a good reason for that, which is under 
22  Title III people who are monitored get notice.  There is 
23  a notice provision, a general notice provision.  And so

4  no way to check it through a court, it does cause harm, 
these are the most likely people to be harmed and there 
5
6  is very good reason, whatever words we use there, to

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the plaintiffs 

abroad, but in targeting people abroad the government is 
collecting plaintiffs' communications.  So, you know, 
this isn't a situation where plaintiffs are entirely --

1  injured by it, and they're -- they -- they --
2
3  aren't going to be monitored under the statute.  Other 
4  people are, and your concern is collateral, that the 
plaintiffs' discussions might be picked up.  But the
 
5
6  plaintiffs are not going to be monitored as targets.
 
7
 MR. JAFFER:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I
 
8  don't think that's exactly right.  I know that the
 
9  statute says that the government has to target people
 
10
11 
12 
13
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's why I'm 
14  saying under your circumstances -- what you said is the 
government could come in and say:  We're not going to 
15
16  monitor these people.  Under the statute, you can say 
17  that today.  The question is whether or not your 
18  clients' conversations can be picked up in an incidental 
19  way.
20
21  disagreeing with the word "incidental."  It's -- the 
22  whole point of this statute was to allow the government 
23  to collect Americans' international communications. 
24  The -- the executive officials threatened a presidential 
veto when it was proposed that Americans' communications

 MR. JAFFER:  Right.  I -- I guess I'm

1  should be segregated in some way, that in the district 
2  court the government was very upfront about this, that 
3  the statute's whole purpose was to regulate the -- the 
4  surveillance of Americans' international communications.
 So there is a sense in which Americans --
5
6  the surveillance of Americans is incidental, but it's
 
7  a --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't what you just
 
8
9  suggested as a way of resolving this case rather

12

14 
15
16

18 
19 
20
21  something like that, Justice Alito.  You know, 
22  ultimately, the authority that the government has 
23  claimed under this statute is what requires the 
24  plaintiffs to take the measures that they're taking. 
25

bizarre?  Someone who is -- whom the government believes 
to be a top terrorist and a great threat to the country 
can stop the use of this surveillance by hiring an 
American lawyer and then having the American lawyer come 
into court and say -- you know, challenge the 
constitutionality of this, and the way to resolve the 
case would be for the government to go into court and 
say:  Well, we're not going to -- we're not going to 
target this -- this person whom we believe to be a great 
security threat?

 MR. JAFFER:  I -- I didn't mean to suggest 

And I suppose that if all the government were to do at 

46
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. JAFFER:  No, not at all, Justice --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That even if they 

the same way.  What --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  To that point, you're 

promise you they weren't going to intercept you under 
this statute, that you would still take the same 
measures? 

1  this point is to say secretly to a judge, "We're not 
2  actually going to use this against plaintiffs," 
3  plaintiffs would have to take the same measures they're 
4  taking right now.  And they would be injured in exactly 
5
6
7  conceding the government's position that -- on 
8  redressability? 
9
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  injuries flow from the authority that they're -- that 
17  they're claiming under the statute.  And if the 
18  government were to have a secret -- you know, if there 
19  were some sort of secret government memo that said 
20
21  communications won't be picked up, if plaintiffs don't 
22  know about that change to the government's authority, 
23  they're going to have to take the same measures that 
24  they're taking.
25

 MR. JAFFER:  No, no, I wasn't talking about 
the other programs.  I was just saying that plaintiffs' 

plaintiffs will not in fact be surveilled, their 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's on that branch of

 And I guess by that point they might be able 

 MR. JAFFER:  So -- so maybe it's helpful to 

1  your argument, which makes me more nervous than the 
2  other branch.  The other branch, they might say 
3  something like:  We're supposed to minimize risks of 
4  catching in surveillance Americans and this is what we 
do.  And they show that and they say:  We go to the FISA 
5
6  court.  Except in these very rare instances where there 
7  are emergencies, da, da, da. 
8
9  to reduce the risks to this kind of plaintiff to where 
it's the same as virtually anybody else or they might 
10
11 
be -- be showing it's constitutional.  That's where I --
that's why I ask the question.  I'm not certain of where 
12 
13 
I am going. 
14
15
16  challenges.  So you think -- think of a case like 
17  American Book Sellers Association, which we cite on I 
18  think page 55 of our brief, the case in which there's 
19  uncertainty about how the government is going to 
implement the authority.  Nobody knows whether this 
20
21  particular plaintiff is going to be prosecuted.  In 
22  fact, in that case nobody knew whether anybody would be 
23  prosecuted.  But the authority was out there and the 
24  fact that the authority was out there, the government 
hadn't disclaimed it, plaintiffs were required to take 
25

think of the -- the cases involving pre-enforcement 

48
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

Amendment cases. 

 All of those things led the Court to find 

1  immediate measures to conform their behavior to the 
2  statute, and plaintiffs -- some of the injury there 
3  related to the kind of self-censorship that the Court 
4  has always been especially concerned about in First 
5
6
7  that plaintiffs had standing to bring a pre-enforcement 
8  challenge.  And the kind of uncertainty that the 
9  government says is present here, uncertainty about how 
the government will actually implement the statute is 
10
11 
the same kind of uncertainty that is present in every 
12 
single pre-enforcement challenge. 
13
14  from the government's power that you point out to 
conduct some of this surveillance without approval by 
15
16  the FISA court in an emergency situation for 1 year, 
17  leaving that aside, I don't see how the rest of your 
18  challenge or your challenge to the remainder of this 
19  statute can be characterized as a facial challenge, 
because it necessarily assumes that the FISA court will 
20
21  mistakenly say that there has been no Fourth Amendment 
22  violation, doesn't it? 
23
24  Justice Scalia.  Our concern is not -- not that -- that 
25

the FISA court will make mistakes, although it well

1  might.  The concern -- the main concern is that the 
2  reasonableness inquiry that the FISA court engages in is 
3  a narrowly cabined one.  They court can't say this is 
4  unreasonable because you haven't identified the 
5
6  you haven't identified a specific target. 
7
8  unreasonable because you have unreasonably limited us. 
9  Don't you think the FISA court is able to say, what 
10
11 
12
13
14
15
16  could essentially subvert the statute in that way or 
17  find it unconstitutional, but the government would not 
18  be pressing for reauthorization now, and plaintiffs have 
19  to act on the basis of the authority that is delineated 
in this Federal law.  And plaintiffs see that there's a 
20
21  law that is designed to allow the government to mine 
22  Americans' international communications for foreign 
23  intelligence information.  The plaintiffs are people who 
24  report on war zones or they investigate human rights 
abuses in places like Syria and Lebanon and the Yemen 
25

 So -- so -- so the declarations were filed 

 MR. JAFFER:  Yes, Justice Kagan.  Naomi 
1
2  Klein's declaration at page 338A addresses that.  I 
3  believe that Chris Hedges' declaration addresses it too, 
4  although I don't have a page citation for you.  It's 
certainly in the lawyers' affidavits that some third 
5
6  parties are less willing to share information, Sylvia 
7  Royce, 353A.

15
16 
17 
18 
19
the -- the Monsanto point -- point once more.  I mean, I 
20
21  understand the Court's -- that the Court has to struggle 
22  with the distinction between cases that involve only 
23  future injuries and cases that involve present injuries 
24  as well.  I think it's just important to recognize that 
the Court has never found the kinds of present injuries 
25

relatively early.  So to some extent, they are making 
predictions about how third parties will -- will react, 
but I think it's an entirely fair prediction to -- to 
predict that third parties who believe that the 
communications are being surveilled will react in the 
way you just described.  And although it's not in the 
record, we -- we have spoken to our journalist clients 
more recently and they have told us that their 
predictions have actually been realized in some cases. 

 Just to go to -- to -- to address the --

52

 In Monsanto, in Laidlaw, in Meese, in
 

1  that we are pointing to here to be irrelevant to the
 
2  analysis.
 
3
4  Camreta, the Court looked to -- looked to the present
 
injuries as well as to the likelihood of -- of -- of 
5
6  future harm.  And we are not making an argument that we 
7  are entitled to a lower -- lower standing -- to lower 
8  standing requirements or less stringent requirements 
9  than the Court has applied in other cases.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  But in Monsanto, suppose the 
10
11  challenge had been brought by a soybean farmer who said, 
12  "I raise soybeans and people around me raise soybeans, 
13  I'm afraid that they're going to start planting 
14  genetically modified soybeans, but they haven't done it 
up to this point, but, you know, this might be something 
15
16  they will do in the future and if they do that, then I'm 
17  going to have to take precautions." 
18
19  harder case than the one that they've brought.  I mean, 
20
21  when -- when the soybeans had been -- had been planted, 
22  and the Plaintiff would then have an opportunity to come 
23  into court. 
24
25

 And it would be hard to -- to establish, I 
think, a substantial risk in those circumstances where 

 MR. JAFFER:  I think that would be a much 

in part because the Plaintiff would presumably know

conceded that the statute is being used.  It's 

 It's true that we don't know that our

was present in Monsanto and in --

1  the Plaintiff couldn't point to any evidence that --
2  that any action had been taken towards the 
3  implementation of this policy that -- that he feared. 
 But in our case, again, the government has 
4
5
6  conceded -- or it's acknowledged that the statute has 
7  been used to collect Americans' communications. 
8
9  Plaintiffs specifically have been monitored, and we will

 First, Justice Kagan, with respect to the

8  "Some of my sources will decline to share information 
9  with me if they believe that their communications are

13  she said -- what if there were even an affidavit from

journalist because of the FAA and because of my fear

22  under surveillance, foreign terrorists who think they
