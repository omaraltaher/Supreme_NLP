CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 00-1831, United States v. Sandra Craft.


Mr. Jones.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. JONES:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


The question in this case is whether the Federal


tax lien that applies by operation of law to all property


and rights to property of a delinquent taxpayer attaches


to the interest of that taxpayer in a tenancy by the


entirety.  The taxpayer in this case was an attorney who,


for 10 years, failed to file a Federal income tax return


and accumulated a Federal tax obligation of approximately


half a million dollars.


At the time the taxes were assessed and the


notice of tax lien was filed, the taxpayer owned a real


property in a joint tenancy by the entirety with his wife. 


He then conveyed his interest in that property to his wife


for $1, and when his wife then sought to sell the property


the tax lien appeared in the title record.


QUESTION:  Now, tell us about the fraudulent


conveyance proceeding.  Does the fraudulent conveyance

holding, or finding, make no difference one way or the


other?  If it was a fraudulent conveyance the husband has


the property -- you can -- well, if it was a fraudulent


conveyance, you can pursue the property, and if it wasn't,


the lien is still there anyway under your theory.  Is that


the way it works?


MR. JONES:  I think that we would say that the


lien, the question of the validity of the lien is the


first question.  If the lien is valid you don't need to


address the fraudulent conveyance question.  Indeed, we


haven't presented the fraudulent --


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. JONES:  -- conveyance question in this case.


If the lien were not valid, it would still be


possible to go after property in certain circumstances if


there had been a fraudulent conveyance, but on this record


we're not challenging the determination that as a matter


of State law there was not a fraudulent conveyance, except


for this fraudulent enhancement portion that the court


awarded.


QUESTION:  Mr. Jones, as part of the background,


how did it come about that it's only the taxpayer who has


the liability?  Did she file separate returns, or was she


an innocent spouse?


MR. JONES:  In this case, the taxpayer is the

husband.  The husband was an attorney, and he filed no


return, and when -- there's two ways for this issue to


come up.  Either spouse may file either no return, or file


only a separate return.  It's only when they file a joint


return that they are jointly and severally liable for the


tax obligation, so if, as in this case, the taxpayer


simply files no return at all, then the obligation is


exclusively that -- the tax obligation is that of the


nonfiler, in this case the husband.


Indeed, Judge Ryan pointed out in his separate


opinion that the decision of this Court, of the court of


appeals is very amenable to abuse, because on this theory


both spouses can earn income, neither of them can file a


return, or they can both file a separate return, and then


they can put all of their real and personal property in a 


tenancy by the entirety, including stocks and bonds in


States like Michigan and Maryland, and claim a complete


exemption of all of their property from Federal tax


obligations.


Now, in --


QUESTION:  -- some penalties for failing to file


a return?


MR. JONES:  There are some penalties, but the


penalties, like taxes, have to be enforced against the


property of the taxpayer, and if the taxpayer is allowed

to exempt all of its property in this fashion, then


there's literally no way that the taxes can be enforced


through civil procedures.


QUESTION:  What about criminal procedures?  Are


there any criminal procedures for --


MR. JONES:  I --


QUESTION:  -- failure, continued failure to


file --


MR. JONES:  Of course, if you file a return,


then you're not exposing yourself to any criminal


obligations, and if you don't file a return, it would


be -- I'm not familiar with a statute that makes that a


crime by itself.  Now, it may be that it's a crime in


connection with some intent to conceal, but just the fact


that you didn't file -- I'm not -- frankly, I'm not --


even though I come before the Court on tax cases, I'm not


an expert on criminal tax matters, but it's my impression


that that would not by itself be a crime.


Now, the Federal tax --


QUESTION:  We'd better not let the word get out. 


I thought that it was a crime, but I'll check.


(Laughter.)


MR. JONES:  All right, well, I stand --


QUESTION:  We'll keep it just among ourselves.


MR. JONES:  I will defer all questions on title

18 to Justice Kennedy.  I'm simply not --


QUESTION:  Do we know as a matter of fact what


her situation was?  Did she not file also?  Did she file a


separate return?


MR. JONES:  I don't know whether she had any


income of her own.  I don't know whether she was required


to, whether she did file a return -- this case does not


involve this -- the wife's taxes.  It involves the half-


million dollars of taxes of the husband. 


QUESTION:  Yes, I know.  I was just curious how


that came about.


MR. JONES:  I don't believe the record reflects.


Now, the comprehensive text of the Federal tax


lien reaches not only all property of the taxpayer but all


rights to property of the taxpayer, and this Court has


consistently held that this broad text shows a plain


intent to reach every type of interest that a taxpayer


might have in property, and two terms ago in the Drye case


the Court summarized these holdings and said that the


Federal tax lien reaches every species of valuable,


legally protected right or interest of the taxpayer, and


the simple question that we have before us today is


whether a taxpayer who has an interest in a tenancy by the


entirety has any valuable legally protected interest in


the property.

 QUESTION:  Well, of course, isn't the issue


whether the taxpayer has a legal interest in the property? 


Isn't that the issue?


MR. JONES:  That is the underlying issue in this


case.


QUESTION:  And the other side says no, there's


this mythical entity called the marriage, or something


like that, is the owner.


MR. JONES:  Well, it's a real entity.  There is


really a marriage.  It's just that the property interests


are, in fact, owned by the individual spouses, as I can


explain by going through what rights a tenant by the


entirety has under the applicable law in this case, which


is Michigan law.  A --


QUESTION:  But are any of those rights legal


rights owned by the taxpayer.


MR. JONES:  Yes.


QUESTION:  That's the basic question.


MR. JONES:  Yes, and indeed, in fact, the


supreme court in Michigan has so held.


Let me just describe these rights that the


taxpayer has.  The individual owner of the -- each spouse


in a tenancy by the entirety has the right to occupy and


use the premises, has the right, with the consent of the


other spouse, to mortgage or sell it, and under section --

 QUESTION:  Wait, wait.  Strike that one.  I


mean, that's -- the marriage can sell it.  I mean, with


the consent of the other one is just to say --


MR. JONES:  This is --


QUESTION:  -- tenancy by the entirety.  It's the


marriage that sells it.


MR. JONES:  That is exactly the interest that


the taxpayer had in the Rodgers case in a homestead


estate.  He could not sell his properties separately from


that of his spouse.  He could only mortgage or sell it


with the right, with the concurrence of the spouse, and


what the Court held in Rodgers --


QUESTION:  But he had a legal interest in the


property.


MR. JONES:  Yes, he did.


QUESTION:  He did.


MR. JONES:  Yes, and if I might go on, there are


more interests involved.  I mean, even if you wanted to


stop there, we can't stop there, because the taxpayer in


fact has greater interests than the ones we've already


described.


Under section 557.71 of the Michigan Code, which


is quoted at page 41 of the joint appendix and page 3 of


our reply brief, each spouse in -- since 1975 each spouse


in Michigan has had the right to equal portion of the

income from the property, that is, the interest, the


dividends, the rents, to the profits, and is entitled to


half of the proceeds on the sale of the property.  Each


spouse under Michigan law is entitled to half of the


property on divorce, and has a right of survivorship that


gives him the fee simple, absolute --


QUESTION:  Presumably the Government could get a


lien on any of those things if they ever came into being.


MR. JONES:  They are in being, and that's what


the supreme court of Michigan pointed out in Dow v. State. 


The court held that these significant interests in


property possessed by each spouse are property for


purposes of the constitutional Due Process Clause, and


that each spouse must separately be given notice of any


action affecting their significant property interests.


QUESTION:  Given notice by whom?


MR. JONES:  Of any action that might be brought


with respect to the property.  In other words, under the


Due Process Clause you have to have notice and an


opportunity to be heard if there's property affected, and


what the court said is that these significant -- I'm


quoting.  These significant interests in property of each


spouse entitle each of them to separate notice, because


they have separate rights.

 QUESTION:  How did that case come up?  I mean,


was somebody suing the tenants by the entirety, or --


MR. JONES:  My recollection is that it was a


foreclosure-type case.


Now, the pecuniary right of each spouse to half


the income and half of the proceeds on the sale is an


ordinary kind of right to money.  It is a


quintessential --


QUESTION:  May I just interrupt you once more? 


You, in describing the case, said that each of them was


entitled to notice because each of them had a separate


right in the property.  Is that what the State court


said --


MR. JONES:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- or is that your sort of


interpretation?


MR. JONES:  It said that -- the words -- well, I


don't have the text in front of me.  It said the


separate --


QUESTION:  It makes a big difference.  They're


each entitled to notice --


MR. JONES:  Each spouse --


QUESTION:  -- which is -- because each had a


separate right --


MR. JONES:  It says each spouse is entitled to

separate notice --


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. JONES:  -- because they have a significant


interest in the property, and --


QUESTION:  Mr. Jones, you're not asserting  that


the Government's lien gives it any greater right than he


has, so the recitation that you had, you're not saying


that the Government lien means that they could preempt her


right, are you?


MR. JONES:  No.  We're saying that we have those


rights.  In fact, in this case that is the issue.  There


was the sale.  There was a consensual sale of the


property.  Half of the proceeds were placed in escrow. 


Half were given to the wife as her undisputed 50-percent


share, half were placed in escrow pending determination of


the validity of the lien.  That's what this case is.  It's


that --


QUESTION:  Would the case be any different if


that transaction you just referred to hadn't taken place? 


Would the Government's case be weaker?


MR. JONES:  The Government's case would be


significantly different if the sale had not occurred. 


Then we would presumably be waiting to see what happened,


or we would under Rodgers be attempting to bring a


foreclosure case.  We haven't attempted to do that here

because we didn't need to do it and, in fact, we rarely


do, and while I'm on the foreclosure issue, let me point


out that Rodgers held that a joint interest can be


foreclosed notwithstanding that neither spouse by


themselves force the sale of it.


What the Court explained was that Congress


specifically provided in 7403 of the code that the


foreclosure applies to the entire property, and that in


that sale the rights of the innocent spouse are protected


and, indeed, the court, the district court has discretion


not even to order a foreclosure if it so chooses.


QUESTION:  But --


QUESTION:  Well, let's assume you do foreclose


because we find that, indeed, the husband has a property


interest in the tenancy by the entirety, so you foreclose.


Now, I guess some of his interest you've just


pointed out is a right to half of the income from the


property, but surely his most significant interest is that


he is entitled to half of the whole property if the


marriage dissolves, right?


MR. JONES:  Or of it's sold, and he's entitled


to all of it if he's the survivor.


QUESTION:  Right.  These are all contingencies,


okay.  How do you -- you foreclose -- how do we value


these contingencies?

 MR. JONES:  This --


QUESTION:  What do we -- we have people come in


and say how stable the marriage is, or what?


MR. JONES:  This Court discussed that exact,


what the Court called the practical reality in the Rodgers


case, and gave a detailed example that I think took three


or four pages of the Court's opinion in Rodgers,


explaining how you would value the respective interests of


the parties.


Let me also suggest to the Court that there is a


very thorough and thoughtful decision of the district


court in New Jersey in United States v. Jones in 1995 that


discusses the circumstances when discretion would not be


exercised to allow foreclosure of tenancy-by-the-entirety


property, and the Court concluded that there were


circumstances which that case was one, where instead of


foreclosing on the property, the property rights of -- the


United States would simply be put in the position of


holding the right of survivorship of the delinquent


spouse, and in addition, the right of that spouse to half


of the rents would be recognized immediately on behalf of


the United States.


The foreclosure remedy, I've heard cases


describe it as a drastic remedy.  Well, I don't know if


it's drastic, but it's a remedy that doesn't have to be

exercised, and that there are cases that explain


circumstances when it's appropriate in the court's view


not to do so.


QUESTION:  But in your view, you always value


the taxpayer's interest at 50 percent?


MR. JONES:  No.  I think in the Rodgers -- well,


if the property's been sold, yes.  If the property hasn't


been sold, and we're talking about in a foreclosure


context, I believe the Rodgers court goes through the


example of the varying life expectancies of the two


tenants, and which one -- and I believe what the Court in


Rodgers said was that each of them should be treated as if


they have a life estate plus a right of survivorship, and


the Court explains how that could well -- I think in the


facts of Rodgers resulted in only 10 percent of the


proceeds being applied to the husband's interest and 90


percent being retained on behalf of the spouse, but --


QUESTION:  But there must be a foreclosure to


that extent?


MR. JONES:  There -- that was a -- I believe


those were hypothetical facts that the Court discussed in


Rodgers.


QUESTION:  Mr. Jones, during the continuance of


the marriage can either spouse force a sale?


MR. JONES:  No, and that was the point made in

Rodgers also, that in any kind of joint tenancy -- by the


way, I should emphasize --


QUESTION:  But I thought joint -- I may be wrong


in this.  I thought a joint tenancy could be converted


into a common tenancy by the action of one --


MR. JONES:  I misspoke.  It's not in every joint


tenancy.  It is a common feature of joint tenancies that


they can't be forcibly sold by one and, indeed --


QUESTION:  During the continuance of the joint


tenancy.


MR. JONES:  Correct, and that that was the case


in Rodgers --


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. JONES:  -- where the homestead right could


not be --


QUESTION:  But I take it from your earlier


answer that there is, in tenancies by the entirety there


is no such legal means of converting that tenancy into a


tenancy in common which then can either be the subject of


a forced sale or petition, is that correct?


MR. JONES:  I believe that's correct, and I


believe it was also true in Rodgers of the homestead


estate, which is a common -- which is also a common


estate.


In fact, in this Court's opinion in Jacobs in

1939, where the Court said that we were not -- the Federal


tax laws were not bound by the ancient fictions of


tenancies by the entirety, the Court pointed out that a


joint tenancy and a tenancy by the entirety create the


same rights.  The only difference is the fiction of the


marital unit, and the Court held in the Jacobs case, as it


had held 9 years earlier in the Tyler case, that that


feudal fiction or ancient fiction did not bind the tax


provisions, that the tax provisions were to be implied in


light of the actual rights of the tenants and not based


upon the artificial rules of State law, and then in Irvine


and in Drye just two terms ago this Court, in interpreting


the term, property, and rights to property and Federal tax


legislation and in the lien statute said that we look to


the realities of the taxpayer's right, and we're not


struck blind by legal fictions of artificial --


QUESTION:  But the realities of taxpayer rights


depend on State law, don't they?


MR. JONES:  The realities of the taxpayer's


right are drawn from State law, but we're not supposed


to -- I mean, in the words of the Court, let the


artificial rules of State law blind us to the realities of


those rights, and let me give you --


QUESTION:  Well now, what's the difference, do


you think, between the artificial rules and the realities?

 MR. JONES:  Well, this Court has said that

the realities are that the tenants -- I mean, it is a


fiction.  The respondent admits it's a fiction.  Every --


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. JONES:  The word fiction is what is implied

QUESTION:  You say it's a fiction.  What do you


mean by it?


MR. JONES:  What is a fiction is the idea that


neither spouse actually owns an interest in this property. 


That's the fiction.


QUESTION:  So is a corporation a fiction, but we


don't tax the shareholders for income of the corporation. 


It's a fiction acknowledged at law and --


MR. JONES:  It's a legal entity.  It has an


existence.  The marital unit is the fiction.


QUESTION:  So is the marriage --


MR. JONES:  The marriage --


QUESTION:  -- for purposes of the tenancy by the


entirety.


MR. JONES:  The marriage is the fact.  What's


the fiction is that these spouses don't own anything. 


Under State law they do own something.  They own something


significant, as the supreme court of Michigan has said,

and let me give you an example of how courts have been


blinded by this fiction.


The line of cases that respondent relies on


begins with the Eighth Circuit decision of the United


States v. Hutcherson in 1951.  In that case, which started


us down this path, the court made what are now clearly, I


think, two errors under this Court's precedents.  The


first error that the court made was to say that we own --


that this question about what's property or a right to


property is solely a question of State law.


Well, we know that what's a question of State


law is what are the interests created, but whether it's


property or right to property is a question of Federal


law.  The Court made that clear in '56 in Bess, emphasized


it again in National Bank of Commerce, and held it


specifically, what, two terms ago.


Now, the other thing that Hutcherson got wrong


right from the beginning was this idea that you -- that


the fiction of State law is controlling, and I'm -- what


the court said is, the interest of a tenant by the


entirety in the property cannot be subject to the Federal


lien because, in the words of the court, that interest is


like a rainbow in the sky, or like the morning fog rising


across the valley.


Well, once we get past the metaphorical fog,

there is indisputably actual value at the end of this


fictional rainbow.  It is -- these people have pecuniary


rights, the rights to receive money, and in this case the


tenant had a right to receive half the proceeds of the


sale, and the United States is attaching that right to


receive money just like it would any other right to


receive money.


QUESTION:  These are all contingent rights. 


Would the Government attach or foreclose a piece of real


estate that had been bequeathed to the taxpayer's brother


and which would eventually come to the taxpayer,


perhaps --


MR. JONES:  No.


QUESTION:  -- depending upon what contingencies


occurred?


MR. JONES:  And the Court made that point in


Drye.  It made the difference between what is a legally


protected right and what is a -- what was the word you


were using?


QUESTION:  Contingent.


MR. JONES:  No, not a contingency.


QUESTION:  A contingency.


MR. JONES:  It was --


QUESTION:  Expectancy.


MR. JONES:  An expectancy, thank you.  An

expectancy is something that is not a legally protected


right.  The expectancy that was described in Drye was the


hope that the will on which you're a beneficiary won't be


changed before the decedent dies.


You have no right that the decedent won't change


the will.  That's just an expectancy.  But once the


decedent died, the right, the legally protected right that


was at issue in Drye was the irrevocable right to inherit


or to disclaim.


Now, once this tenancy has been created, these


tenants have these vested rights.  Now, their rights may


be contingent in terms of events happening in the future,


but it's nothing more -- nothing is more common than to


say that a contingent right is a property interest.


QUESTION:  Well --


QUESTION:  Certainly the community property


States, the concept of a marital community has some


significance, I think.  It isn't just a rainbow in the


sky.  That doesn't mean that you don't look at what rights


the individual members of the community may have, but what


you're saying is --


MR. JONES:  Well --


QUESTION:  Go ahead.


MR. JONES:  If I might, in a case called United


States v. Mitchell, involving the community property right

of a spouse to disclaim her interest in the income of her


spouse, this Court said that the disclaimer, this


retroactive disclaimer, this fiction of State law would


not be recognized and would not upset the application of


Federal tax principles.


QUESTION:  But it was retroactive.


MR. JONES:  It was a fiction.


QUESTION:  Before the disclaimer occurred


there's no doubt who was entitled to the money.  She was,


and this was more than a fiction.  It was undoing a


property right that the State recognized until the


disclaimer occurred.


MR. JONES:  Well, and indeed the State


recognizes these property rights.  The State says there's


significant interest in property, and it isn't silly just


for me to stand here and say it's a fiction.  It is a


fiction.  This Court has said it's a fiction.  In 1930 --


QUESTION:  Mr. Jones, would you comment on one


aspect of the case that troubles me?  Let's assume -- I


think there are two court of appeals decisions out there


that are squarely on point and against you, and you say


are incorrectly decided.


MR. JONES:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Let's assume they are incorrectly


decided, but they've been the only guidance for the tax

bar for 40 or 50 years, and is there other reliance


interests that the tax bar can say, well, we always


thought that, given those cases that Congress had not


sought to overrule, we have a right to follow them?


MR. JONES:  Well, the tax bar is not a party to


this case, and -- but that's --


QUESTION:  No, but we have to be concerned


about --


MR. JONES:  Okay, well, that's --


QUESTION: 

-- the community's reliance on


decisions that have been given by the Federal courts.


MR. JONES:  The answer -- I believe the answer


to your question is no, that there is no embedded reliance


on this principle because, as we pointed out in our brief,


even in Michigan there is an express caution given by the


State bar to title examiners saying that, in light of the


1975 enactment of this statute that gives each spouse an


equal right to all of the income and profits from the


property, that the State bar advised title examiners that


they could not give an opinion that the interest of an


individual spouse was not subject to the lien.


Moreover, in 1983, I believe it was, this Court


had a discussion about the status of tenancy by the


entirety under the Federal lien, and the majority opinion


in a footnote questioned these older cases, so I do not

think that a title examiner, especially in Michigan, would


be able to say that he had upset settled expectations.


QUESTION:  So this case involves only Michigan,


and if you have States that do not provide that the --


each spouse has an interest in the income, it might be a


different answer.


MR. JONES:  There is, indeed, a narrow basis


that you just described for resolving this case, and it


would be an appropriate way to resolve the case because we


have the fund -- we have here the voluntary -- the sale,


with the proceeds available for distribution, so we don't


have to reach the broader question of whether the


existence of the right of survivorship, which is an


undisputed personal interest, is sufficient for the lien


to attach and, a la Rodgers, be subject to a foreclosure


action.  It would -- and --


QUESTION:  I must say, when you get to the


survivorship, that's there I have real problems with your


case.  I could just -- you answered my earlier


hypothetical by just saying, well, you know, there's a


contingency that the will might be changed.  Well, let's


assume it's not a will.  Let's assume it's an irrevocable


trust, under which you have a contingent future interest. 


Would you really say that the Government can move against


the entire corpus of the trust just because there's a

contingent future interest on the part of a defaulting


taxpayer?


MR. JONES:  The Government's lien attaches to


the interests of the contingent remaindermen, and there


are cases on that very point.  I am not familiar with the


problem I think you're describing which is, well, can you


then foreclose on the trust, and how would we value --


QUESTION:  Well, that's how the statute reads. 


You can assert the lien on any property in which the


taxpayer has an interest.


MR. JONES:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  And you're saying the taxpayer has an


interest --


MR. JONES:  Yes.


QUESTION: 

-- in this trust --


MR. JONES:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- in which he has a future


contingency.


MR. JONES:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  I mean, that's a -- I --


MR. JONES:  That's correct, but also that


section 7403 reserves the right of a district court not to


award foreclosure and, of course, foreclosure requires the


Government to do something.

district judge.  I don't think that that's --


MR. JONES:  Well, the United States, so far as I


know this controversy that you're concerned about has not


been presented in an actual case, so I'm not sure that


it's a -- I mean, it's a theoretical issue that I don't


believe has been confronted, but what has been confronted


is, does the lien attach to contingent remainders, and


that's In re -- well, there's a lot of In re's.  I think


it's Rosenberg's Will is the leading case on this.  We


cited it in a footnote, and it explains that the Federal


tax lien applies to all property and rights to property.


QUESTION:  Well then, how -- do you then value


the contingent remainder?


MR. JONES:  Well, as I was saying, I don't know


of a case where a foreclosure has been sought on a


contingent remainder.  What's probably the more likely


result, because it's the more economical result, is to


wait for the contingency to occur, and that's --


QUESTION:  And the case you're talking about


where a lien was asserted against the contingent


remainder, what was it asserted against, after the


remainder had no longer been contingent?


MR. JONES:  I would -- I'm -- to be honest, I


would be guessing, but my guess is --


QUESTION:  Okay.  I mean, that's a different

question.


MR. JONES:  Well, the --


QUESTION:  I want a case in which, on the basis


that the taxpayer had an interest --


MR. JONES:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- had a purely contingent interest


in some corpus.  The Federal Government was enabled to


assert a lien against the entire corpus.  That seems to me


extravagant.


MR. JONES:  Well, as you use the word


contingency, that would include Rodgers, because that was


a case where there was -- a right of survivorship was the


valued interest, but there's also the Bank One case,


Spendthrift Trust, the right of a person to obtain income


from a Spendthrift Trust is subject to the Federal lien. 


Any kind of right, legally protected, valuable interest


has been subjected to the Federal lien, and what the --


this case reduces to is the idea that simply by, that even


though they've, the State recognizes that there are


valuable, legally protected interests in each spouse, that


by calling it a -- a something else, that the lien


wouldn't apply, and that's exactly what the Court


indicated in Drye shouldn't happen, that the Court


indicated that the mere fact that the State doesn't


characterize this valuable, legally protected right as

property doesn't prevent the Federal lien from attaching.


I would like to reserve my time for rebuttal.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Jones.


Mr. Sutton, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. SUTTON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


There are some serious misunderstandings about


the meaning of Michigan law which go to the heart of the


proper resolution of this case under Federal law.  First


of all, the Government has relied very heavily on a 1975


Michigan statute that says, spouses in a tenancy by the


entirety have equal rights to rent and income and to


profits.  That's section 1 of the statute that I just


quoted.


If you look at page 209 of that statute in the


Sixth Circuit appendix, regrettably not in your appendix,


you'll see that the second section of that statute says


that only applies to tenancies by the entirety created


after 1975.  This tenancy was created in 1972.  That


statute is utterly irrelevant.  It in all events was


designed primarily just to deal with what happens when the


tenancy ends, that is, when there's a divorce, just to


make sure that both spouses have a right to the property.

 A second misunderstanding, the Government says


that the rights to proceeds, once you have proceeds as a


spouse, that somehow that means the tenancy is over and


the creditors, Federal, State, city, private, can get at


it.  That's wrong.  Under Michigan law, Muskegon Lumber,


1953, Michigan supreme court case, says that it continues


as a tenancy in the entirety.  Why?  Because most people


sell their house to buy another.  You wouldn't destroy


it --


QUESTION:  Well, we're not used to resolving


questions of State law here.  If you say the State law of


Michigan is one thing and the Government says the State


law of Michigan is the other, it's difficult for us to go


in and referee the thing.  What is the strongest Michigan


case for your point of view?


MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, 1885, Vinton v. Beamer,


going forward to Sanford, going to Budwit v. Herr -- those


are, you know, separated by 20 or 30 years each -- every


single one of them makes clear that with respect to the


specific belonging-to language in this statute there is no


interest that belongs to one spouse or another.  They're


indivisible interests.  There's a unity of title and,


critically, if that unity of title is broken, Michigan law


says under Budwit v. Herr, a Michigan supreme court


decision, the tenancy is destroyed.

 QUESTION:  And you say the 1975 statute does not


affect this case at all?


MR. SUTTON:  It's irrelevant, Your Honor.  By


its terms it only applies to tenancies that are created


after 1975.  That's section 2.  It's in the act.  That's


not legislative history.  That's in the act.


QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, how does it differ from


other cases where under State law a predator can't touch


the thing, like a Spendthrift Trust, or like what was


involved in Drye?  Even though not a single predator in


that State could touch that inheritance, the Federal


taxing authorities could, so there are many situations


where the property is exempt from reach, even where the


State doesn't call it property, calls it something else,


but the elements of what the person had leads the Federal


authorities to say this is the property of so-and-so, as


in the Spendthrift Trust, as in the case of the


disclaiming heir in Drye, so why is this any different?


MR. SUTTON:  This is not a disclaimer or


exemption case for this basic reason.  We're not relying


on the results under Michigan law.  We're relying on the


rationale under Michigan law for the exemption.  The


rationale under Michigan law is that neither spouse owns


an independent interest in any respect.  Not even the


survivorship right under Sanford is considered an

independent interest.


QUESTION:  Why was that different from a State


law that said Mr. Drye never had anything, we assume under


our State's law that he predeceased his mother?


MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, under Arkansas law in


Drye, the opinion notes that he did have a right to


alienate that interest once his wife died.  That's exactly


what -- that was the point of the decision.  For 9 months,


he had a right of control over the property and it may be


helpful -- I want to make sure I'm answering your


question -- to think about these interests in present


terms and future terms, and if you talk about present


interest, I think the way Drye talks about it is, you have


to have a present interest of pecuniary value over which


the taxpayer has exclusive dominion.  That is not true in


a tenancy by the entirety.  The closest you can come to


finding something over which the individual taxpayer might


have dominion of control are the future interests, the


right to proceeds, the right -- survivorship rights if you


outlive your spouse.


QUESTION:  Could the Congress with ease enact a


statutory amendment to make tenants by the entirety


subject to liens?


MR. SUTTON:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  I would


submit that that's one of the strongest points supporting

Mrs. Craft's position.  For 136 years --


QUESTION:  Well, I mean, if you were a Senator


from Michigan wouldn't you say, well, you're taxing


property that doesn't belong to the taxpayer, this is


improper as a matter of law?


MR. SUTTON:  That's exactly what Tyler


recognized, the 1936 or so U.S. Supreme Court decision


that yes, these are fictions under State law but, under


the Supremacy Clause, the Federal Government is entitled


to disregard them if it wishes and, notably in the estate


tax setting, that's an estate tax case, the Court -- in


that law, Congress specifically said tenancies by the


entirety are covered by the estate tax.  Indeed, page 502


of Tyler says, but for the specification of tenancies by


the entirety by terms, the estate tax would not cover


those interests.


QUESTION:  Well, our --


MR. SUTTON:  That's our case.  That's this case.


QUESTION:  Our universe here is that the State


defines what's property and the Federal Government defines


what property can be liened.


MR. SUTTON:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  That doesn't quite work, because one


of the sticks in the property definition is the right to


be liened, and so we're compromising that dichotomy even

by stating it, and it seems to me that all the Government


is doing here is saying, we're saying what property can be


liened, we're entitled to define that one stick in the


bundle.


MR. SUTTON:  I'm not relying, Your Honor, on


what's lienable and what's not.  Well, I am in terms of


the common law background.  That's highly relevant that in


1866 no one would have thought this was a lienable


property interest, but when it comes to the present


Michigan law, I'm not relying on whether it's lienable


under Michigan law.  I'm relying on why that's true, the


rationale for why it's not lienable.


You can't lien -- maybe this is the better way


to put it.  You can't lien an innocent property owner's


property.  If everything they're saying is true about this


somehow belonging to Don Craft, it is most assuredly also


true that it belonged to Sandy Craft, and Justice


Ginsburg, she did file her tax returns, independent tax


returns.  She paid her taxes, and there's no more right


for the Federal Government to put that lien on your


property or mine, that it was --


QUESTION:  Well, but if you're right about that,


Mr. Sutton, then your statement that Congress could easily


amend the statute to collect in this situation probably


isn't correct.

 MR. SUTTON:  Well, Your Honor, I did not mean to


say -- I did say easily, and I misspoke, and I'm glad to


have an opportunity to correct.


I think it would be very difficult, because of


the fact that under Michigan law the property ownership


interest might create a situation where the minute you


foreclosed, great, you got $100,000 for Don's interest in


the property.  Every dollar they took belongs to Sandy, so


it's -- it is a difficult area to regulate.  It would be


a -- and -- but that's again exactly why, in gift tax,


estate tax, fair debt collection -- that's the Federal


fraudulent conveyance law, bankruptcy, every one of these


areas not only mentions the tenancy specifically, but it


then goes on to do what Justice Kennedy and Mr. Chief


Justice Rehnquist's questions indicate.  You've got to be


very specific about how in the world you value these


interests, and what you decide to do once you've decided


to regulate them.


QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, is it true that any


conventional property interest in Michigan can be held in


the entirety form?


MR. SUTTON:  No, Your Honor.  Personal


property -- it does not apply to personal property.  The


only exceptions are proceeds from real estate, the example


I gave when you sell the house.

MR. SUTTON:  No, Your Honor.  No.

estate?  Is it your position that before this statute was


passed even the income from the real estate was held --


MR. SUTTON:  Absolutely, and that's --


QUESTION:  -- in tenancy by the entirety?


MR. SUTTON:  Let me give you -- S&B Trust, it's


one of the cases we've cited, says that very point, and


that makes sense.  It's still property that they -- it


came from their joint marital asset, and they use it


together.


property?


I want to go --


QUESTION:  How does it differ from community


MR. SUTTON:  Community property has several


differences.  It's much more like a joint tenancy.  First


of all, you can petition, which incidentally is exactly


what the effect of this statute is, to by law petition


their interests.  Secondly, you have shares in the


property, and this is exactly like Rodgers and National

Bank of Commerce.  There were divisible shares that could


be levied.


QUESTION:  I thought the community property is


owned by the community, which is a separate entity.


MR. SUTTON:  No, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Community property is not owned by a


community which is a separate entity?


MR. SUTTON:  No.  It really works a lot like the


homestead.  I want to be clear here. It's true that the --


in one sense the home in a community property State or a


homestead State is still one where they both have


interests as to all the property, so in that respect


you're right, they still have joint interests.  But the


critical legal distinction respecting the 19th Century all


the way to this century is that in one setting you had


divisible shares, and that's why one spouse in a home


State setting, community property setting, could


unilaterally incumber or destroy the tenancy.


QUESTION:  I'm not sure you can generalize as to


community property.  I think the law varied in -- among --


between the community property States.  Some would say one


thing, some would say the other.


MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, you're right, and if


I --

says that community property can be severed only with the


consent of both spouses in the event of divorce, or in the


event of death of one of the spouses.  It's a book called


Real Property, by Bernhardt and Burkhardt.


MR. SUTTON:  Well --


QUESTION:  Again, I don't know that that's


authoritative, or maybe we made a mistake, but it


certainly was my impression that community property is


owned by a community, which is a different legal entity,


and I also thought that community property couldn't be


separate without the consent of the spouse.


MR. SUTTON:  Well, that -- Your Honor --


QUESTION:  Is that wrong?


MR. SUTTON:  -- if -- let's assume for the sake


of argument, and I'm not -- let's assume it's true, you


said it's true, that community property States are just


like tenancy-in-the-entirety States.  That's fine by us.


QUESTION:  Well, I know, but all it means is --


MR. SUTTON:  The exact same argument applies.


QUESTION:  -- that if you're right, that in


probably a third or more of the country, suddenly the IRS


can't assert any liens, and it's a little tough to believe


that Congress would have thought that that's what it was


doing with this statute.


MR. SUTTON:  Oh, Your Honor, I respectfully

disagree.  In the very -- the backyard of Congress they


are saying tenancies by the entirety are exempt.  I mean,


in the District of Columbia, which Congress has sovereign


prerogatives over, they've said from the beginning that we


favor these marital community property interests over


those of creditors.


QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton --


QUESTION:  Yes, that may be, but why -- I mean,


here, a lot of property in this country is owned by


communities, i.e., the husband and wife together, and I


imagine that people are quite free to take their real


property in the form of tenancy by the entirety.


All right, now here the property interest is


definite.  There's no doubt that the husband is entitled


to a lot of money, and there's nothing imprecise about it,


nor is there really anything speculative about it, unless


you go and divide it into a present and future.  All those


divisions you've made are purely legal ways of looking at


what in reality is an absolutely precise and valuable


property interest owned by the husband.


All right, now why should I accept an


interpretation that's going to exempt vast amounts of


property from this statute --


MR. SUTTON:  A couple of thoughts, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  -- under those circumstances?

 MR. SUTTON:  This is not a community property


case, and I think it would be dangerous for me to --


QUESTION:  But I'd like to know what the


implications are --


MR. SUTTON:  If --


QUESTION:  -- because it's one thing if we're


deciding a case -- yes.


MR. SUTTON:  If you find, in each of the States


that you're concerned about, the interests are defined


just as they are in Michigan, which is to say, it's an


indivisible interest, no shares, it follows just from what


you've said in Rodgers and National Bank of Commerce that


you can't lien the property, and what you've got to do is


wait for a survivorship interest, wait for a sale,


destruction of the tenancy.


But if there's a problem here, Your Honor,


Congress has known about it.  This has been true for 136


years.


QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, how many States are there


that have tenancies by the entireties?


MR. SUTTON:  14 that have them in the


traditional way we're talking about, where it's an


indivisibility of title, plus the District of Columbia.


QUESTION:  And some of them, at least according


to a case that both of you cited, do provide tenancy.

Tenancies by the entirety can hold business assets,


personal property, even money may be held in some States,


so if your theory holds, then a couple could insulate


everything that they have simply by holding it all --


MR. SUTTON:  Well, to the extent Congress is


worried about that, it's surprising in 1954 that they


didn't amend the statutes, even more surprising --


QUESTION:  Well, didn't this Court comment on


that in the Rodgers decision by saying that the fact that


Congress didn't do something -- you can't infer much from


not doing, according to this Court.  Maybe the Senate


rejected the clarification that the House sought, not


because it disagreed with it, but more likely because it


found it superfluous.


MR. SUTTON:  The 1954 history is relevant, I


would think all would agree, when it comes to the notion


that somehow this is a great tax-avoidance problem. 


Congress at a minimum was told about this issue and


decided not specifically to do anything about it.  Whether


the law was changed or not --


QUESTION:  And this Court commented on it, that


maybe Congress didn't do anything because it thought that


the -- this --


MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, by 1966 -- I mean --


well, by the present, we've got seven courts of appeals.

Every court of appeal that's looked at the issue has said


the tax lien does not apply when just one spouse has a tax


debt.  In 1990, critically --


QUESTION:  In this particular case, wasn't the


Sixth Circuit saying, well, maybe there are good arguments


on both sides, but we've got that old precedent that we


have to follow.  Wasn't that the background of this case?


MR. SUTTON:  I'm not sure what the Sixth Circuit


had in mind, but it certainly followed its precedent,


didn't think Drye, Irvine had changed the law


necessarily --


QUESTION:  Well, it couldn't have thought about


Drye the first time around, because Drye wasn't there.


MR. SUTTON:  No, but the second time it did.


QUESTION:  They had already made the decision. 


Then there was a big discussion about law of the case and


law of the circuit, so I don't think that they ever had


this case with Drye squarely in front of them, because


they decided the basic case without Drye and later they


were relying on law of the case, law --


MR. SUTTON:  Well, I certainly don't know why


each court of appeals has done what it did, including the


Sixth Circuit, but the fact is, they've all done the same


thing.


I think it's also notable to the extent there's

a tax avoidance concern lurking here, why is it in 1990,


when Congress passed the Fair Debt Collection Act --


that's the Federal fraudulent conveyance statute -- why


did it specifically exempt tenancy by the entirety


property?  Under that law today you could do exactly what


happened in this case and the Federal Government would


have nothing to say about it.


QUESTION:  I suppose, if you follow the -- your


rationale to its furthest extent in a State such as the


one Justice Ginsburg referred to in which business assets


can be held in tenancy by the entirety, a husband and wife


could hold a -- have a closely held corporation by the


entirety and, on your theory, they wouldn't even be liable


for income tax because it would be the entirety alone that


would be liable.  Is that the --


MR. SUTTON:  No.  No, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  -- fair consequence of what you're


saying?


MR. SUTTON:  Under section 61, which is the


provision of the Internal Revenue Code that taxes


property, income from tenancy by the entirety property is


still taxed.  It's never been a --


QUESTION:  No, but the income goes into a bank


account held by the -- held in entirety form.  If they're


careful enough, so that they set up their corporation,

their savings account, their checking account,


everything's held in entirety form, there wouldn't be any


individual taxpayers under your theory.


MR. SUTTON:  Well, I'm not going to be in a


position to cite any cases for this point, the point that


I'm going to make, so you're going to want to check me on


it, but I don't think there's any doubt that when it comes


to income from tenancies-by-the-entirety property, the


case law, the code, the regulations make it clear that


they're still -- you're still taxable.  It's just a


question of --


QUESTION:  Well, I don't think there's any


doubt, either, but I think the fact that there isn't any


serious doubt about it is, at least so far as the States


that Justice Ginsburg's example referred to, there also is


an inconsistency between the fact that we have no doubt,


as you say, about taxability and the consequences of your


theory.


MR. SUTTON:  Well,it's a  -- they're very


different concepts and maybe it's important, particularly


in light of Justice Breyer's comment about this just


seeming to be a fiction, there's a real function behind


this concept, and the function is that, while the tenancy


is premised on this nice notion of two hearts beating as


one, the fact is that doesn't always happen, and the whole

point of the tenancy and the indivisibility of title is


that it precludes one spouse unilaterally from destroying


or otherwise incumbering the tenancy.


Keep in mind, that's exactly what happened in


this case.


QUESTION:  Well, but the --


QUESTION:  Then in your mind the critical factor


is the factor that creditors under State law can't get a


hold of it.


MR. SUTTON:  No, Your Honor.  If it's


indivisibly owned, that means that every lien on Don's


interest was a lien on Sandy's interest, and Sandy paid


her taxes.  If there's one first principle of lien law,


it's that --


QUESTION:  Okay.  Then you're saying it's the


theory of the thing.


MR. SUTTON:  It's --


QUESTION:  Okay.  If it's the theory of the


thing --


MR. SUTTON:  It's a theory that has a fact --


QUESTION:  If it's the theory of the thing,


primarily, plus the fact -- all right.  If it's the theory


of it, why --

same theory exist with community property?  Doesn't the


same theory exist with joint tenancies?  For all I know,


the same theory exists when people said, you don't own any


land, you just hold it from the king, and you have feudal


obligations unless you pass along the seasons.  I mean,


that's -- if we're going on the theory of the thing --


MR. SUTTON:  I really hope I can clarify this


because I do think it cuts the heart of this case.  Most


States that don't have tenancies by the entirety do have


joint tenancy, so that really is the key comparison, and


as to those States, when you have a joint tenancy, first


of all they are divisible interests.


If they're divisible interests, that means one


spouse unilaterally can incumber and in some instances


sell that right, whether it's a future right, the right of


survivorship, or a present right with respect to some


interest in the property, so that's the whole point.  The


whole point is, in those States people have decided to


marry, buy property together, but yet from the beginning


one spouse unilaterally could destroy or incumber the


property.


In a tenancy by the entirety, at the outset,


every decision you make regarding that property has to be


made with the consent of your spouse.


QUESTION:  Well, is the question of taxability

at bottom a question of Federal law, do you suppose?


MR. SUTTON:  I would submit, Your Honor, that


when it comes to the tax lien statute the Court has said


several times that Congress did not define the words,


property, rights to property belonging to.  We look first


to State law --


QUESTION:  But is it a question of Federal law,


and as a policy matter we generally look to State law? 


But isn't that itself a question of Federal law, the


extent to which we're going to look to State law?


MR. SUTTON:  Well, Your Honor, I had thought


that you take the State law's property interests as you


find them in the 50 or 51 jurisdictions, depending on how


you want to look at it, and then, depending how the


States --


QUESTION:  But for tax purposes, I'm just


wondering if at bottom it isn't, in fact, a question of


Federal law.


MR. SUTTON:  It is a question of Federal law


what the, quote, consequences of those State law


definitions are, but let me give you, I think, a good


indication of this, and it relates to a hard issue raised


by Justice Ginsburg.  What about tenancy by the entirety


where it was a joint bank account, which is clearly a much


harder case, not presented here.  Here, we're talking


46

about the marital home.


But in National Bank of Rodgers, which was about


a joint tenancy, the Court said in a 5-4 decision that you


could levy on one person's joint bank account.  Why was


that?  Because under State law, the taxpayer, or he had a


right to all of the money in the account unilaterally,


whenever he wanted it, and if he misused it, that was


simply to be a fight among the other joint tenants.


Justice Blackmun in writing that decision made


it crystal clear that that case turned on the fact that


under State law the taxpayer had a unilateral right to


take all the proceeds.  If that State law had said


differently, that the only way you can take out the


proceeds is with the consent of the spouse, there's --


QUESTION:  Which case are we talking about now?


MR. SUTTON:  National Bank of Commerce, 1985,


joint bank account.  If that State law had said, the only


way you can take out the money in the bank account is with


the consent of the other, the Court, by the terms of its


decision, would not have allowed that levy, and remember,


the levy and lien statutes have the exact same language,


which, you know, in order to lien something you've got to


be able to levy it, generally speaking.


So I don't -- that proves to me -- I hope this


answers your question, Justice O'Connor -- that these

definitions of State law do matter.  They are controlling


when it comes to the consequences, and I hope I've showed,


when it comes to --


QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, I think that there was


considerable attention in the Drye case to exactly what it


was you look to State law for.  You look to State law to


find out what the person had.  Whether that was


characterized as property or not was a Federal law


question, and Drye could not have been clearer that you


look to see what sticks the State law gives.


MR. SUTTON:  But Your Honor, what have I said


that makes you think I'm disagreeing with that?


QUESTION:  Well, I thought you said that whether


it's property is determined by State law.


MR. SUTTON:  I'm simply saying the interests in


the property are determined by State law.


QUESTION:  What the taxpayer had is determined


by State law.


MR. SUTTON:  Exactly.


QUESTION:  But not the label that we put on it.


MR. SUTTON:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  For Federal tax purposes. 


MR. SUTTON:  Absolutely, and I'm sorry if I left


that ambiguous.  I mean, let's talk about this in terms of


the classic --

 QUESTION:  Your point there is right there. 


Your point is, I take it, that in this case State law


defines the property such that it belongs to both parties


and, indeed, it is not possible under State law without


the death, divorce, or consent of one of the parties for


anyone to get a hold of a penny of the -- of that


interest.


MR. SUTTON:  Absolutely, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  That's your point --


MR. SUTTON:  To use the sticks --


QUESTION:  -- that both of those things have to


be true, the theory and the practice.


MR. SUTTON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  All right.


MR. SUTTON:  To use the sticks in the bundle


analogy, every interest under State law in Michigan


regarding this tenancy, each stick has to be exercised two


by two, not one by one, but every one of them is two by


two, husband and wife, and certainly not three by three,


which is what the Federal Government is saying here.


QUESTION:  But it is for the Federal Government


to determine to what property the lien extends.


MR. SUTTON:  I couldn't agree more, Your Honor.


I mean, not -- I wouldn't say the executive branch.  I


mean, in the 1971 Benson decision they admitted that the

lien does not cover tenancy by the entirety.  If you look


at that 1971 decision, they admitted in that case it


doesn't cover it, so this is not an administrative


deference situation at all, but the Federal Government,


through Congress and the President, does have a right to


extend it.  I will admit, it's not going to be easy, and


if we could go back to thinking about --


QUESTION:  Their point to the contrary is


basically, you're right, or assuming you're right, it's


still definite enough to get at, and you really violate


State law policy there only if you sell the property, you


see, but as long as -- and, indeed, if they sell it on


their own, that's their problem.  You'll get the proceeds. 


If they don't sell it on their own, you know, the


community -- if they don't sell it on their own, then it


becomes a question of how the judge will enforce the lien,


and there your clients or the equivalent would be free to


go in and say, don't force me to sell the property, et


cetera.


MR. SUTTON:  I hope I'm responding to your


question.  I think what I hear you saying is that boy,


this is just a lien, they're just placeholders, it doesn't


mean they'll necessarily foreclose, and therefore Sandy's


interests really aren't being hurt.  I would submit that's


wrong.  Sandy Craft --

 QUESTION:  You say Sandy.  She's noted as the


respondent as Sandra.


MR. SUTTON:  Excuse me, Your Honor.  I'll say


Mrs. Craft, to be even more careful.  Excuse me.


But in this particular case, the lien does have


an impact on their ability collectively to make decisions


about the property.  Let's say the month after the lien


attached, they decided, we need to borrow against the


house to have enough money to pay for our kids' college


education, because the roof has collapsed.  They can't do


that.


Prior to the lien, she had a right to make a


decision not with the Federal Government about how to use


this property, but with her husband, and a classic tenet


of lien law is you get no more lien rights than the debtor


had, and you've got a situation here where they're 1)


trying to act as a spouse, but 2) dictating how this


property ought to be used, when that was a decision that


under Michigan law only the two spouses could make


together.


I want to go back to a point that I went over a


little bit too quickly.  The consequence --


QUESTION:  I'd just like to ask you one question


about Michigan law in origin, because you said this goes


back to 1866, so it was probably before the Married

Women's Property Act, so -- at least in some States it


was, so whatever rights there were to control and make


decisions, they were all in the husband at that time.


MR. SUTTON:  Most of the Married Women's


Property Acts, almost all of them were passed before 1866,


so first of all that defect, I would call it, in the old


tenancy simply was no longer true, and even in some States


where that continued, it was still this, I guess it's jure


uxoris concept, that it wasn't the husband as an


individual having an opportunity to do this, it was the


husband acting on behalf of the wife, but that just isn't


true under Michigan law.  They still have these equal


interests in the property, as proved by the fact of what


happens on a divorce.


The point I glossed over and I wanted to make


sure was understood, the issue here is not just whether


the lien attaches to the tenancy, I would submit that


under Michigan law, if a lien does attach, it destroys the


tenancy, so we have a situation where a unilateral act of


one spouse has destroyed the tenancy by operation of law


under Michigan.


It becomes a tenancy in common that destroys the


right of survivorship, and that also means because there


are now divisible interests in the property that one


spouse, unilaterally again, can incumber the property and

expose the marital home to these debts of just one spouse,


so this is not just a modest question then.


QUESTION:  But --


QUESTION:  I thought, Mr. Sutton, this is a


question of what the Federal taxing authority can do. 


Everything that you've been speaking about is something


that Michigan can say, no creditor of these people --


MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, I agree with you,


Michigan could change the law, though I think at that


point the rationale and the effect would line up.


QUESTION:  I don't think there's any question


that Michigan law, just as Arkansas law, continues to say,


creditors, you can't get at this disclaimed property, same


thing Michigan can say.  The only thing that Michigan


can't control if this decision should go the other way is


what the Federal taxing authorities can do, not one thing


about any other creditor under Michigan law.


MR. SUTTON:  The problem for people like the


Crafts is that they've already said it. In Budwit v. Herr


they say, the minute you destroy the unity of ownership


you destroy the tenancy, so I --


QUESTION:  Isn't the concern that the tenancy


not be destroyed, in effect as a result of a consensual


act by one of the spouses, an alienation by a spouse


alone --

 MR. SUTTON:  The nonconsensual act, right.


QUESTION:  -- the incurring of debt by one


spouse alone as a consensual act, i.e., going on a


spending spree?


But here, the consensual act of the spouse has


nothing to do with it.  It's not a consensual act of the


spouse that the spouse has to pay income act --


MR. SUTTON:  Oh, but Your Honor, it is.


QUESTION:  -- and therefore it seems to me


outside the rationale that you're proposing for the


tenancy.


MR. SUTTON:  I respectfully disagree, Your


Honor.  It's exactly the rationale.  There's no difference


from Mr. Craft unilaterally trying to incumber the


property with his own loan, using the property as a


mortgage to back it up.


QUESTION:  Sure it is.  He goes out and says, I


want a loan to buy a Cadillac.  That's certainly a fair


concern of the State in protecting the wife.  That concern


doesn't extend to a situation in which the tax law of the


United States says, you're going to pay tax on your income


whether you like it or not.


MR. SUTTON:  But Your Honor, it's a unilateral


act, number 1, by the spouse, and number 2, it is a lot


like a loan.

 QUESTION:  What's a unilateral act, earning the


money?


MR. SUTTON:  It is a lot like a loan, Your


Honor.  If you need $50,000 a month to support some bad


habit, you can get it by borrowing from a bank or not


paying your taxes.  It has the exact same effect when it


comes to the unilateral conduct of one spouse undermining


the marital property.  But again --


QUESTION:  And then, if Congress said this


explicitly, the same thing would follow, everything that


you said.  Congress would then be destroying --


MR. SUTTON:  They could do what they did in the


estate tax, which is regulate it specifically.  I would


submit, it is not an easy process.


QUESTION:  I thought that the -- oh.


MR. SUTTON:  Why doesn't Mrs. Craft have a


takings argument the minute this lien attaches for the


entire value of her property?  Why is that not the case? 


It's not obvious to me.


QUESTION:  Just as Mr. Drye didn't when his


State law said --


MR. SUTTON:  But there was only one taxpayer in


Drye.  You didn't allow a lien -- excuse me.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Sutton.


MR. SUTTON:  Thank you, Your Honor.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Jones, you have 3 minutes


remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. JONES:  Thank you.  I have only a couple of


points.  The first one is that the tenancy involved in


this case was destroyed when it was transferred from the


husband to the spouse.  That's one.  That's the first


instance when it was destroyed, and secondly it was


destroyed when the wife then sold it to a third party.


What we have are proceeds that are not subject


to a tenancy by the entirety.  We have proceeds that


are -- to which the former tenants are each entitled to 50


percent.  The right, their right to have 50 percent of the


proceeds is confirmed by 577.71 of the Michigan Code,


which was enacted in 1975, but it preexisted that as we


pointed out in the cases that we've cited in our reply


brief.


I will say that the suggestion that this statute


that gives each spouse an equal right in the property only


applies to tenancies created after 1975 is a new


contention.  It's not addressed in the briefs.  It catches


us by surprise, but I will point out that the Dow case --


QUESTION:  It shouldn't be a surprise if it's in


the statute you're quoting to us.

 MR. JONES:  What I will -- what is in the


statute that I --


QUESTION:  Is it in the statute?


MR. JONES:  What I have in my possession is a


copy that says that the effective date is 1975, and I do


know that in Dow v. State, decided by the supreme court of


Michigan in 1976, they applied that statute to a tenancy


that had been created prior to 1965.  This statute that


was enacted in 1975 reflects a policy of, I suspect, every


State in the modern era to recognize the equal rights of


the spouses and the tenants in the property, and not to


respect --


QUESTION:  Suppose it didn't.  I mean, is it


your -- are you conceding, then, that the Government


cannot assert a lien on a real tenancy by the entirety?


MR. JONES:  No, not at all.  I'm saying that we


have such a lien in this case, both from the right of


survivorship, if we ever had to get there, but more


importantly because we have a lien in the right to receive


proceeds.  This statute that was enacted in '75 does not


directly address the proceeds issue.  The proceeds right


preexisted the statute.  What the statute addressed was


the equal right to income during the existence of the


tenancy by the entirety, and the equal right to control


the management.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Jones, can I ask you one


question?  I hate to take up your reply time.  In your


view, will the decision in this case control in community


property States, raising the same question?


MR. JONES:  Well, I think the principles that


you apply will, of course, control, and --


QUESTION:  Yes, but --


MR. JONES:  And whether a decision in this case


addressed principles that would extend or apply in that


situation as well as this, I can't say.  I --


QUESTION:  Can -- do they -- in a community


property State, can one spouse force division over -- to


an unwilling spouse?


MR. JONES:  Under State law there are


limitations, but those State law limitations have already


been held to be ineffective against Federal tax


provisions.


QUESTION:  But the community property is subject


to the debts incurred during the marriage?


MR. JONES:  That's correct and, again, in the


Mitchell case the Court held that State law fictions about


the relative rights in community property States are no 


more binding on the Federal tax collector than in other


contexts.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Jones.
