CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 01-757, Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. v.


Hurley Henson.


Mr. Alsobrook.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY B. ALSOBROOK, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


In Kikkonen v. Guardian Life, this Court


hypothesized the very situation that we have before you


this morning because here we have a nationwide class


action settlement where the court specifically by judgment


retained jurisdiction to manage the settlement as well as


enforce it.  A critical part of that settlement was the


dismissal of this case.  However, when class counsel went


to dismiss the case, as the Eleventh Circuit pointed out


and as the district court pointed out, his efforts were


thwarted and the case was not dismissed.


QUESTION:  Mr. Alsobrook, I see you've changed


the question presented from the time in your certiorari


petition to your opening brief.  And the question


presented, when we granted, referred to 28 U.S.C., section


1441, and now you have dropped your reference to that.

Does that mean you're abandoning reliance on 1441 or


simply broadening the question? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  No, sir.  We -- we're saying


that under 1441 that because the district court retained


jurisdiction, that that was original jurisdiction to


remove the matter, and that actually, Your Honor, when we


removed this, they -- the majority of circuit courts of


appeals, namely the second, sixth, seventh, and eighth,


had said that the proper vehicle to remove this was the


All Writs Act.  And that is what we are claiming today, as


well as 28 U.S.C. 1367 ancillary jurisdiction, and we have


set that out in our brief. 


QUESTION:  But you have no right to remove under


1441 because there wasn't complete diversity in the


Louisiana suit.  Isn't that right? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  That is correct. 


QUESTION:  So you can't rely on 1441 and that's


conceded.


MR. ALSOBROOK:  We -- we can -- our reliance on


1441 was based on the fact that the Alabama court retained


original jurisdiction and --


QUESTION:  But that's not -- nothing in 41 rests


on that.  It has to be a case that would qualify for


original jurisdiction, and you don't have that.


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Yes, Your Honor, but we -- we

construed that as being a venue rather than a -- a --


because the Alabama court had original jurisdiction.


And certainly under 1651 --


QUESTION:  What did you construe as being venue?


MR. ALSOBROOK:  The -- the fact that we had to


take it to a Federal court in the district where the State


court suit lay, and then it was immediately transferred to


the -- to the Alabama court. 


QUESTION:  Yes, you -- you can't remove a case


to a Federal court outside of the district in which the


State court sat, is my understanding. 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  That's right, Your Honor.


We took -- we took our road map from Agent


Orange Product Liability.  There they had a Texas --


QUESTION:  Who is they? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  There, there was a --


QUESTION:  What court are you talking about?


MR. ALSOBROOK:  We're talking about the Second


Circuit. 	 And --


QUESTION:  Initially the Eastern District of New


York, Judge Weinstein's --


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- order, which was in no way based


on 1441. 	 It was based on 1651.


MR. ALSOBROOK:  But, Your Honor, also in that

case was the case of Ryan, and in Ryan, it was brought by


to class members in the State court in Texas.  And it was


removed to the Federal court in Texas and then transferred


to the Eastern District of New York.  And that was our


road map for getting this case to -- back to Alabama.


QUESTION:  But that was all done under the All


Writs Act or what they thought was the authority granted


by 1651.


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Yes, and we also, Your Honor --


in our removal petition, we pled the All Writs Act, as


well as ancillary jurisdiction under 1367.


QUESTION:  Well, what is your theory under the


All Writs Act?  Is your theory that removal is itself --


comes under the All Writs Act? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  We contend that -- that in order


for the Court --


QUESTION:  Can't you answer the question yes or


no?


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Yes.


QUESTION:  I thought the All Writs Act required


the existence of some sort of a common law writ like


certiorari or prohibition or injunction or something like


that.  There -- there never was a common law writ of


removal. 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  That is correct, Your Honor.

 But the jurisprudence, particularly the Agent


Orange case --


QUESTION:  Well, but can you cite any of our


cases that support you in this respect? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Well, I can cite the New York


Telephone case where the Court said that -- that removal


was -- not removal, but a writ under the All Writs Act was


-- was proper to avoid the frustration of judgment, and


that was -- that was certainly the situation here.


QUESTION:  But -- but that was a different --


that was an existing writ.  Here -- here you're saying, in


effect, that removal is -- is itself a writ.  And I simply


don't see how the cases support you there.


MR. ALSOBROOK:  I agree with that, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Do you agree that the All Writs Act


is not a source of original jurisdiction? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Yes, ma'am.  Yes, Your Honor, by


the --


QUESTION:  Why -- why then didn't you try to get


an injunction in the district court in Alabama?


MR. ALSOBROOK:  There were two reasons, Justice


O'Connor.  First is that an injunction would not dismiss


the case.  An injunction would enjoin the -- the State


court suit from going forward. 


QUESTION:  Yes.

 MR. ALSOBROOK:  And we would have had -- our


client would have had to carry this as a liability on


their books ad infinitum. 


QUESTION:  Well, couldn't the injunction have


ordered the party to dismiss the case?


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Yes, they did -- they could,


Your Honor, and --


QUESTION:  But then why -- why wouldn't that be


sufficient? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  I suppose it would have been.


QUESTION:  But if that's so, then why don't --


why are we trying to read into 1441 language that isn't


there and read requirements out of 1651, requirements that


are there, when there was another way, totally consistent


with the words, the statute, everything else, that you


could have achieved any legitimate objective that you had?


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Well, Justice Breyer, at the


time that we did this, as I said earlier, there was -- the


majority of Federal circuit courts said that the proper


vehicle was to remove the case and get it before the court


where -- that had issued the judgment.  Today with the


number of class action settlements that are going on,


there must be some kind of way by which a Federal court


who issues a judgment can enforce that judgment across


State lines.

 QUESTION:  There is.  Isn't that just in your


answer to Justice O'Connor and Justice Kennedy?  You


provided the way. 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  The -- the only loose end, it seems


to me, that -- that you have left, after your answers to


Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, is the problem you say your


client would have in carrying liability on the books until


the second action was somehow finally terminated.  But


isn't the answer to that that once you had gotten either


the injunction or simply the -- the order to the parties


under the retained jurisdiction, you then could have gone


into court in the second suit and said, they cannot


prosecute the suit?  It has been enjoined.  Therefore,


please dismiss it.  Wouldn't you have gotten your


dismissal and wouldn't that have taken the -- the


liability off the book? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  I don't know, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I guess why wouldn't that


have been the appropriate course? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  I -- I presume that the State


court under those circumstances would dismiss it, but we


don't know that as a matter of fact.


QUESTION:  I -- I was thinking about different


writs, and you've researched this more thoroughly than I,

I suspect.  I thought the closest thing here was a writ of


certiorari.  This is like a writ of certiorari, but a writ


of certiorari is from a superior court to an inferior


court.  And I -- I don't think that's the way we treat


State courts and Federal courts. 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  That is correct, Your Honor. 


And another reason --


QUESTION:  And -- and -- which -- and so that


the absence of that kind of -- of writ indicates to me


that the safer course, the more prudent course is to rely


on the standard equitable remedies such as injunction that


we've been discussing. 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  That is correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Except that a lot of other lawyers


had -- had relied on the course that you relied on.


MR. ALSOBROOK:  That's correct, and a lot of --


QUESTION:  You were following what had been a


successful course in the past. 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  And not only that, a lot of


judges. 


QUESTION:  Well, to be sure. 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  And so there were a plethora of


district court cases that allowed the removal under the


All Writs Act and took jurisdiction where they had


jurisdiction originally under the cases of NAACP, under

the Agent Orange case, and the Sixth and Seventh Circuit


cases. 


QUESTION:  Were there any cases under the


relitigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act that


used that device, the antisuit injunction, to accomplish


the same thing? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Well, Your Honor, no.  The Tenth


Circuit had ruled that the -- that the All Writs Act could


not be used in this -- in the method that we used it.  We


are not unmindful of Rivet v. Regions, but we -- our


situation there -- our situation in this case is much


different --


QUESTION:  But that was -- that was a question


of fighting it out in the State court, and it's not the


antisuit injunction that we're discussing now.  Rivet said


it's an -- preclusion is an affirmative defense.  You can


raise it in the State court that prior Federal litigation


precludes this case. 


The other way to go is to ask the court that


entered the judgment, the class action judgment, the


nationwide class action, to enjoin the party who was


supposed to have settled the claim from proceeding in the


-- in the original case when part of the bargain was to


dismiss it.  So I -- I'm just curious why you didn't


attempt that route.

 MR. ALSOBROOK:  We didn't attempt that, Your


Honor, because the majority of the circuits at the time


approved the All Writs Act as the vehicle with which to


remove the case and to get it back before the district


court. 


Additionally, we felt that it -- State courts


have cases removed all the time to Federal court.  And we


thought it would be less onerous to the State court judge


to have it removed rather than being enjoined by a Federal


court.


QUESTION:  I don't understand that because right


-- built right into the removal provision is a command


that the State court shall proceed no further.  So the


removal petition acts as -- as a -- an injunction against


the State court proceeding further. 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Well, the removal petition --


actually the court loses jurisdiction of it at that time


because they -- it -- it is removed to -- to the Federal


court.  And there again, Justice Ginsburg, the -- we felt


that it was less onerous and there was some jurisprudence


or some dicta and some legal writing that indicated that


it would be less onerous to the State court judge to have


it removed rather than have it enjoined.


QUESTION:  May I ask this question?  Looking at


the language of the All Writs Act, which authorizes all

courts established by act of Congress to issue writs


necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective


jurisdictions and so forth. 


Now, in this case, you removed from the Federal


-- to the Federal court in Louisiana in order to protect


the jurisdiction of the Federal court in Alabama.


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Yes, sir. 


QUESTION:  How do you square that with the


language, respective jurisdictions? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Well, Your Honor, there again we


had to rely on Agent Orange.


QUESTION:  You don't rely on the statute,


though.


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Well, we relied on the statute


because it says in the aid of their respective


jurisdiction, and --


QUESTION:  Don't you think that refers to the


court to which removal would take -- would occur?  And


here it's the Louisiana Federal court, not the Alabama


Federal court.


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Yes, sir, and we -- it was our


position that there -- there respective jurisdiction


related to the Alabama court.  That is our position. 


QUESTION:  Even though you removed to the


Louisiana court.

 MR. ALSOBROOK:  We had to, Your Honor.  That --


under 1441, we had no alternative but to remove it.  We


couldn't have removed it from the Louisiana court to the


Alabama court because 1441 by venue says that it has to go


to the Federal district court in the -- of the district


where the case lies. 


QUESTION:  But 1441 wasn't available to you.  So


as long as something new is being created in -- under


1651, why not say that -- that the court that has


jurisdiction over the class action can issue orders to


stop inconsistent litigation? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  That could be done under the


Anti-Injunction Act, Your Honor.  There's no doubt about


that.  And as -- as --


QUESTION:  But do -- as far as -- you're


creating a removal that doesn't exist by statute.  So not


-- why not go all the way and say, under the All Writs


Act, we can remove to the -- from the Louisiana State


court to the Alabama court?  Why touch base with 1441 when


1441 is inapplicable? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Because 14 -- we didn't know of


any other vehicle that would allow us to remove it from


Louisiana to Alabama.  Even the All Writs Act would not


allow us to remove it across State lines or even out of


the district.  Certainly if this case had been brought in

Mobile, then we wouldn't be here today because the -- the


court in Mobile would have authority to -- to remove it to


that district.  But it was brought -- brought across State


lines.  And again, we followed the road map that had been


set out for us in Agent Orange.


QUESTION:  But you still have problems even if


it were to the Middle District of Alabama, because you


don't have complete diversity in the Louisiana action. 


Therefore, 1441 doesn't apply.  You would still have to


use your All Writs Act theory even if the case were


pending -- if the Federal and State court were in the same


State.


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Well, Your Honor, we feel that


-- that under -- under the hypothet set out in Kikkonen


that the Alabama court would have had jurisdiction to take


that case.


QUESTION:  Mr. Alsobrook, what is -- what is


this writ called?  I mean, Lyndon Johnson is -- is once


supposed to have asked somebody in the Justice Department


to get him a writ of fixitatis. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  What -- what is this writ called?  A


writ of removal? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  This could be a -- well, there


is no writ for this, Judge -- Justice.  There isn't any

writ for this. 


QUESTION:  Well -- well, then how can you do it


under the All Writs Act? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Because in other cases, the All


Writs Act has been used to -- to remove cases to avoid a


State court case from thwarting a Federal judgment.


QUESTION:  Certiorari I guess is the closest. 


Historically you could have sent certiorari -- a court to


any other court and to any administrative agency.  I guess


that would be the closest historically.  Would it?


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Well, I think Justice Kennedy


brought that up and --


QUESTION:  Yes.  As we've come to limit it, it's


-- it's higher to lower, but if you go back into history,


it wasn't, I don't think.  I mean, has it come down to


saying, look, you were in a situation where you thought


that the signer of the stipulation was flat out violating


it, and you didn't know what to do, so you read the


precedent, and there was precedent that suggested, under


the lower court precedent, that this was the right thing


to do.  So you did it. 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Yes, sir. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  Now, if you turn out to be


wrong, what should we do next, assuming you're right about


the stipulation?  They just flat-out wouldn't follow it.

And -- and suppose you were wrong about the route.  Have


you any suggestion for us as to what to do?  Do we -- I


guess we'd have to dismiss -- order this case dismissed


without prejudice to your going to the Alabama court and


-- and asking them to enjoin?  Or what is your suggestion


about what we should do --


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- if you're right on the merits of


this thing? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  If we're right on the merits,


Your Honor, what I suggest you should do is reverse the


Eleventh Circuit. 


QUESTION:  I don't mean the merits of the


procedural issue.  Suppose that you're wrong about that,


hypothetically, but you're right about your basic


instinct, that they signed a piece of paper saying, we


promise to dismiss this case in the State court and then


they didn't.  They just didn't do it.  That was your view


of this.  Right? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Yes, sir. 


QUESTION:  All right.  So have you any


suggestion for us about how we might help you achieve that


ultimate objective, and by us, I don't mean this Court


particularly.  I mean the law.  The law should provide a

 MR. ALSOBROOK:  I would -- the alternative I


would suggest is to remand the matter to the Federal


district court in Mobile with instructions for them to


file an injunction or a contempt proceeding against the


party --


QUESTION:  But that would be up to you to -- I


mean, the court doesn't initiate an injunction.  You'd


have to ask for it.  And I assume you would be free to do


it.  If all this Court would decide, if it decided against


you, was that the All Writs Act is not available for this


purpose, that would leave you as though you had never


pursued that route and you could pursue another. 


There's something curious about this case, and


maybe you can -- you can help me understand it.  When the


plaintiff's class counsel in Price went into the Louisiana


court and said, Louisiana court, drop that case, dismiss


that case, the defense counsel wasn't there. 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  No. 


QUESTION:  Why not? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Your Honor, this is not in the


record but I was that counsel, and I had talked with the


class counsel days before, and he assured me that he would


take care of it and there would be no problem.  We didn't


anticipate this happening because the language of the


stipulation of settlement, which the respondent signed,

was so specific that we couldn't imagine that the State


court judge would not dismiss it on the motion of class


counsel.


QUESTION:  So you were relying on plaintiff's


counsel --


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Yes, ma'am. 


QUESTION:  -- to do -- to do that job for you


and felt you didn't need to appear in the State court. 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  He actually told us we didn't


have to appear, that he would take care of it.


QUESTION:  Mr. Alsobrook, if we disagree with


you and reverse the -- and affirm the Eleventh Circuit, we


would be affirming a decision that says in its conclusion,


we accordingly vacate the district court's order


dismissing Henson and remand with instructions for the


court to remand Henson to Louisiana State court.


We do not, however -- this is part of what it


said -- we do not, however, imply that the district court


may not by injunction force Henson's dismissal.  So, you


know, we wouldn't have to say that -- that our decision


here was without prejudice.  The decision of the Eleventh


Circuit was said to be without prejudice.  So you -- you'd


be able to, as far as the Eleventh Circuit opinion is


concerned, get -- get the injunction. 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Yes, sir, but the --

 QUESTION:  I wonder why it wasn't -- wasn't more


efficient for you to seek the injunction instead of coming


up here.


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Well --


QUESTION:  I guess -- I guess --


MR. ALSOBROOK:  -- Justice Scalia --


QUESTION:  -- your answer is better to have two


bites at the apple than one.  Right? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Yes, sir.  And --


QUESTION:  Even if you lose here, you can then


seek the injunction. 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  And also because the majority of


the circuits have approved the procedures that we followed


in this case.  You have the Second Circuit; you have the


Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth.  And --


QUESTION:  Well, what was the reasoning of those


circuits? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  The reasoning of those circuits


were that they had retained jurisdiction to enforce their


judgments.  For example, if you take NAACP II -- rather,


NAACP I, the court remanded the case to the circuit court. 


NAACP II, the court said that because they had retained


jurisdiction in an order, that they could go forward under


the All Writs Act. 


QUESTION:  And what -- did they specify what

kind of a writ it was they were talking about? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  No, sir. 


QUESTION:  I should think that might have made


you a little hesitant to rely.


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Well --


QUESTION:  It's a good defense to a malpractice


action. 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Well, we had to rely on what the


courts were telling us, Your Honor -- I mean, Mr. Chief


Justice. 


QUESTION:  Were those cases in which there were


two -- two different districts involved? 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  The Agent Orange case, there


were two different districts, yes. 


QUESTION:  But all of them were not, were they?


MR. ALSOBROOK:  No. 


QUESTION:  Weren't some of them -- yes.


It seems to me it's quite different if you're


remanding to the court where the problem arose than


remanding to a different court.


MR. ALSOBROOK:  That's right. 


QUESTION:  Yes.  Or removing, rather.


MR. ALSOBROOK:  That's right. 


QUESTION:  Do you wish to save the --

 QUESTION:  -- remainder of your time for

MR. ALSOBROOK:  Thank you. 


QUESTION:  Very well. 


Mr. Bederman.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BEDERMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. BEDERMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The All Writs Act may not be relied upon to


remove an otherwise unremovable case.  It is Congress's


province to define the limits of removal, and chief of


these is the requirement of original jurisdiction in


Federal court. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Bederman, I just asked your --


your friend to -- to explain why he was up here.  Why are


you up here?  Because even if you win, the case will --


you know, don't you think that an injunction will issue?


MR. BEDERMAN:  Very likely Mr. Alsobrook will


apply, as the Eleventh Circuit invited them to, for an


injunction.  Such an injunction could proceed because


under this Court's decision in Parsons Steel, the State


court has yet to issue a conclusive ruling about


preclusive effect.  And therefore, they're at liberty to. 


We are, by no means, conceding the -- the substantive

merits of the injunction motion whether they would have a


substantial likelihood of success on the merits, but we


would certainly agree that they have the ability to file


an injunction immediately. 


QUESTION:  Why -- why -- okay.  What -- what is


at issue on the merits? 


MR. BEDERMAN:  The issue on the merits would be


presumably the proper construction of the settlement


agreement --


QUESTION:  Of the settlement agreement? 


MR. BEDERMAN:  That's right.  And, of course,


whether an injunction, narrowly tailored to the parties,


would, as -- as the Justices have already indicated, be


properly addressed to the parties to order dismissal of


the case. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  So you -- you would -- you


would contest the injunction just as you're --


MR. BEDERMAN:  We would contest the merits of


the injunction.  We would not context the ability of them


to file for the --


QUESTION:  You can say in a sentence -- as I


read this, it says, class counsel hereby stipulates that


the related case, including any and all claims, will be


dismissed.  And then it defines related case to refer to


Hurley Henson by number in the State of Louisiana.

 MR. BEDERMAN:  That's right, Justice Breyer.


QUESTION:  So I'm just curious what the defense


would be. 


MR. BEDERMAN:  The only defense that -- that I


could imagine is the ambiguity in that provision, as you


were reading, at 38a of the joint appendix, that the


concern about whether including any and all claims,


including without any limitation any claims defined


herein.  And what has not been made clear is that there


were subsequent amendments to the stipulation, which made


clear that certain classes of claims were excluded.


QUESTION:  Well, I guess that isn't before us


here --


QUESTION:  It's not before us. 


QUESTION:  -- is it? 


MR. BEDERMAN:  Certainly not, Justice O'Connor. 


What's before this Court is what is the proper procedural


mechanism to be used here. 


QUESTION:  And several circuits have allowed the


All Writs Act to be used in this fashion, do you think? 


MR. BEDERMAN:  In this fashion?  Yes, Justice


O'Connor.  That clearly this is what I would characterize


as a newfangled procedural device that was launched by the


Second Circuit after the Yonkers and Agent Orange cases;


that it has developed, as I think Mr. Alsobrook fairly


24

characterizes, a momentum of its own in the court of


appeals.


QUESTION:  In the Yonkers case, the United


States Government urged the court to take that position,


didn't it?  So it wasn't something newfangled that the


court dreamed up on its own when it was the Department of


Justice urging it. 


MR. BEDERMAN:  That is true, but my recollection


of -- of the procedural background with the Yonkers case


was that there was some concern about how Judge Sand


drafted the consent decree in that case.  He -- as was


later acknowledged, Judge Sand had been perhaps misled by


certain representations made by the Archdiocese of New


York and therefore he did not include a provision that


would allow for a subsequent injunction or -- or a


retention of jurisdiction.  That may have led the court in


that circumstance to invoke All Writs Act. 


But there, again, the complete alternative was


an injunction that could have issued in these New York


land use proceedings that were pending in State court.  So


even in Yonkers, which presents, I think, analytically a


very different context here, not a preclusion case, not a


case that turns on the construction of an earlier Federal


court judgment or settlement, there was the availability


of injunctive relief.  In that case, the Second Circuit

bypassed that -- that reasoning and went straight towards


an All Writs Act basis --


QUESTION:  But you said you would defend against


injunctive relief on the ground that the settlement was


narrower than --


MR. BEDERMAN:  We would defend essentially on


the merits, is that an injunction should not issue because


our construction of -- of the settlement is --


QUESTION:  Well, why didn't you seek that


construction from the court that issued -- that -- that


entered the settlement?  Why go to another Federal court?


Louisiana doesn't know anything about this case -- instead


of saying, Alabama Federal District Judge, please clarify


the scope of the settlement so that we can either go on


with our case or know that we can't? 


MR. BEDERMAN:  We believe that the proper course


is -- in view of the precise enumeration of the -- of the


case in State court, that the proper course was to amend


the petition and seek a resolution.


Mr. Henson and his counsel could have very well


initiated an entirely new case and evaded the terms of --


of the settlement in that fashion.  They agreed and


decided that the proper course, the more forthright course


was to seek leave to amend the petition to make clear that


certain claims were dropped by virtue of the earlier

settlement, but there were remaining claims in play.  And


it was believed that this was the most forthright approach


to -- to use here. 


I would credit, Justice Ginsburg, that it may


have been equally appropriate to go back to the Federal


court, seek a declaratory judgment or some kind of


decision in that fashion.  But I believe that this course


was certainly honest and forthright on the part of counsel


below. 


I -- I hardly think it may be necessary to


indicate that the All Writs Act does not confer


jurisdiction under 1441, as was already made clear in


certainly the questioning and certainly in view of


petitioners' discussion.  Original jurisdiction has always


been required and has been upheld in countless cases.  And


moreover, the All Writs Act textually demands that Federal


courts issue writs, quote, "in aid of their respective


jurisdiction." 


Petitioners' argument essentially would read out


"respective" from that provision in the All Writs Act in


section 1651.  Clearly the All Writs Act does not


independently grant original jurisdiction, and this has


been consistently upheld by this Court for nearly 200


years from the McIntire decision in 1813 to as recently as


Clinton v. Goldsmith in 1999.

 Moreover, issuance of writs under the All Writs


Act is certainly conditioned by the statutory requirement


that such be necessary or appropriate.  And as this Court


indicated in Pennsylvania Bureau of Corrections, this is


essentially a threshold requirement for invocation of the


All Writs Act.  And in the Goldsmith case, as recently as


3 or 4 years ago, this Court made clear that the All Writs


Act can't be used as a form of cure-all to -- to fix what


would otherwise be the availability of other statutory


mechanisms which are not otherwise complied with.


QUESTION:  What would be wrong with the Eleventh


Circuit saying in substance it's the same thing?  What


we're trying to do is to stop this litigation from going


forward in Louisiana.  So even though the defendants used


the wrong device, we'll treat it as though it had been in


application for an antisuit injunction?. 


MR. BEDERMAN:  Well, if -- if, of course, the


Eleventh Circuit had construed petitioners' filings in


that way and -- and had indicated that injunction was the


proper mode and essentially substituted, as they -- as


they seem to invite in their closing lines of their


decision, I think that would be appropriate.  But there is


certainly a difference in form and in content between a


removal and a narrowly tailored injunction, and I think


the Eleventh Circuit was correct.

 And other courts of appeals that have so held


have indicated that there are profound federalism concerns


that are implicated in allowing essentially a common law


writ of removal to be used to evade what is Congress's


role in dictating the mechanism for removal and -- and


patrolling the boundary and the balance of authority


between State courts and Federal courts in this country.


There is, as -- as the Court indicated, no such


thing as a -- as a common law writ of removal.  There was


no analogy in English common law at the time of the


founding.  The -- a writ of certiorari, as Justice Breyer


indicated, would have been -- could have been potentially


directed, I would agree, to -- to courts.  But in no


circumstance was there analogy in English common law for


the court of one sovereign to remove cases from -- from


another sovereign.  And unless we delve into a kind of


obscurantist legal history, I think that would be clear. 


But there was, in fact, no analogy for that.  And in


truth, there's no such thing as a writ of removal --


QUESTION:  Administrative agencies.


MR. BEDERMAN:  I presume that in English common


law, to the extent that administrative agencies existed,


the ones I'm aware of, of course, were quite inchoate. 


It's potential that you --


QUESTION:  Sewer commissioners, I think is --

 MR. BEDERMAN:  That's right.  Or -- or sanitary


commissions in London.  One might imagine that. 


But again, at issue here is -- is removal, which


this Court has always indicated is a creature of statute


because of the profound federalism concerns. 


And essentially what -- what petitioners would


have this Court do is allow, by use of the All Writs Act


or analogous theories of ancillary enforcement


jurisdiction, to achieve what is otherwise unavailable by


statute.  And as this Court clearly said in the


Pennsylvania Bureau of Corrections case, although the All


Writs Act empowers Federal courts to fashion extraordinary


remedies when the need arises, it does not authorize them


to issue ad hoc writs whenever compliance with statutory


procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate. 


If I can say just a word or two about ancillary


enforcement jurisdiction, to the extent to which


petitioners appear to be relying on it.  This Court has


said very clearly in both Kikkonen, where the Court


indicated that ancillary enforcement jurisdiction may be


used in view of what courts require to perform their


functions, and in Peacock, where the Court made very clear


that ancillary enforcement jurisdiction is a creature of


necessity, there can be no showing of necessity here by


virtue of the availability of alternate mechanisms,

whether in the form of an injunction properly issued


against the parties and consistent with the relitigation


exception under the Anti-Injunction Act, or even,


preferably, recourse to State courts to properly rule on


the preclusive effect of earlier Federal court judgments


and settlements, as this Court made clear.


QUESTION:  What about contempt?  I suppose you


could have been -- your client could have been held in


contempt in that court, couldn't it?  I mean, assuming


you're wrong -- that he's right --


MR. BEDERMAN:  In the -- in the Federal court. 


And of course, obviously sanctions were imposed below by


the Federal district court, and that's, of course, not --


no longer at issue before this Court, but that court has


that power.


So certainly there are a variety of mechanisms


to ensure compliance with -- with court orders.  It is not


respondent's submission to suggest that we take an


important tool out of the toolbox of Federal courts in


order to maintain the dignity and the enforcement of their


judgments.  But --


QUESTION:  A number of courts that have allowed


the 1651 All Writs removal have said that they thought


that that was less offensive.  That was more faithful to


the federalism concern, that -- that issuing an antisuit

injunction was more offensive to the State than this


removal device. 


MR. BEDERMAN:  I would respectfully disagree


with that characterization.  The assumption seems to be


that the injunction would somehow issue to the State


court, and as of course we all know, that would never be


the case.  That truly would be offensive.  The -- the


injunction would issue to the parties, however, with


instructions to -- to dismiss or an even maybe even more


narrowly tailored instrument.


QUESTION:  Well, it may be that a particular


remedy in a particular situation might be less offensive


to federalism, but that's a concern that should be


addressed by Congress, isn't it --


MR. BEDERMAN:  Absolutely. 


QUESTION:  -- in view of this statute?


MR. BEDERMAN:  Absolutely.  It is -- if Congress


wishes to address the availability of removal in this


class action context -- and there is pending legislation


today to that effect -- Congress is free to do so. 


QUESTION:  And -- and if Congress wants to be


more offensive, it presumably can. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. BEDERMAN:  I wouldn't speak to the


propensity of Congress in those circumstances, but they

could also amend the Anti-Injunction Act to also change

Mr. Alsobrook, you have 7 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY B. ALSOBROOK, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Excuse me.  Mr. Chief Justice,


and may it please the Court:


I think Justice Breyer was correct when he


pointed out that the stipulation that was entered into is


really not ambiguous.  The Eleventh --


QUESTION:  That's not -- I don't think that's


before us, Mr. Alsobrook. 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  All right. 


QUESTION:  I mean, I don't think whether or not


you might be entitled to an injunction, should you seek


one, is -- is presented by the -- your question. 


MR. ALSOBROOK:  Yes, sir. 


Well, Your Honor, I would say that at the time


that we removed this also we relied on NAACP II, and there


the Court said that if there are two alternatives that --


and they also pointed out a footnote 3 in the Kikkonen


33 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

case which said that an injunction could be issued where


there are two alternatives that -- that you can choose


between one or the other, and that the -- the 


Anti-Injunction Act does not preclude the remedy under the


All Writs Act.


So we realize that the Court is not a


legislative body and that it has been brought out here


that Congress is the one that can -- can dictate the


jurisdictional bounds of Federal courts.  But by the same


token, Your Honor, we have a great number of class action


settlements that are pending in this country that have


been already consummated in this country, and we face a


situation where the settling party who has settled a


national class action must have some kind of remedy to


stop suits in State courts that attempt to thwart that


class action settlement.  And so we would ask the Court to


consider that in its -- in its deliberations. 


If there any further questions? 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Alsobrook.
