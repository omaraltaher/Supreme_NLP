CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 00-1406, Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Mario


Echazabal.


Mr. Shapiro.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. SHAPIRO:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


According to the National Institutes of Health,


hepatitis C kills 8,000 to 10,000 people in this country


every year, and it's the largest cause of liver


transplants.  This is a progressive disease, which in many


cases goes without any symptoms for a period of time, but


in a large percentage of cases, it results in cirrhosis


and liver failure.  The disease in this instance was


chronic, active, and severe, according to the standards of


the NIH. 


Now, NIOSH's Occupational Health Guidelines also


confirm that the chemicals in this factory were liver


toxins.  The ordinary worker can withstand that exposure,


which is consistent with OSHA standards.  But the


Government's guidelines say again and again that employees


should receive medical tests before beginning work to look

out for special vulnerability.  NIOSH's statement about


phenol, one of the 12 chemicals here, is typical, and I


quote from the guideline.  Liver damage may occur. 


Persons with a history of abnormalities of the liver would


be expected to be at increased risk from exposure. 


Now, none of this matters according to the Ninth


Circuit because injury to self is beyond the employer's


legitimate concern.  But we believe that the plain


language of the statute and its structure tell a


completely different story.


The defense provision in the statute, which is


section 12113(a), first speaks in general terms. 


QUESTION:  Where do we find that, Mr. Shapiro?


MR. SHAPIRO:  That is found on page 59a of the


petition appendix. 


QUESTION:  59a?


MR. SHAPIRO:  59a, Your Honor, yes.


QUESTION:  Actually it's 58a, 1211(a), at the


bottom --


MR. SHAPIRO:  It begins on 58a, but the


pertinent provision, 12113(a), is right there on 59a.


QUESTION:  You first referred to the general


rule.  That's what I thought. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  And the general provision says it


is permissible to use qualification standards and tests

that are job-related and consistent with business


necessity.  This is generic language and it does not


exclude injury to self.  After this general provision, the


statute --


QUESTION:  Which one is the general provision?


MR. SHAPIRO:  The -- the first part is 12113(a),


which states:  in general.  That's the general defense


provision. 


And right after it comes a particular example in


subpart (b), which refers to risks to other individuals. 


And that, of course, is just an example that fits within


the general rule here, and we know it's just an example


because Congress said that permissible standards may


include such a test.  This is obviously not an exhaustive


description.


QUESTION:  And why isn't it an exhaustive


description at least of that category, of the category of


direct threat to health or safety?  I can see that the


words, may include, may include this and it may include


that, but when the -- when the Congress is describing


direct threat and it has only the health of other


individuals, why for that part isn't it self-contained?  I


mean, you say it has a plain meaning.  It would have been


much plainer if Congress had said:  of the individual or


others, if that's what it meant.

MR. SHAPIRO:  We think the -- the phrase, may


include, is illustrative of matters that might fit into


the general description that comes just before and that


injury to -- to other persons and injury to self are --


are both matters that fit within the general description


of business necessity, public safety --


QUESTION:  Well, there's some legislative


history that suggests that indeed it wasn't intended to


allow review of danger or risk to the employee himself.


MR. SHAPIRO:  We found several instances that we


cite in our brief where Congress was talking about injury


to -- to the individual himself.  So, again, it's not an


exclusive reference.  And I think if you look at the


structure of the statute, Justice O'Connor, it again helps


to answer this question. 


QUESTION:  It's -- surely it's exclusive to some


extent.  I mean, Mr. Shapiro, you certainly wouldn't argue


that a qualification could include a requirement that the


-- that the individual not pose an indirect threat to the


health or safety of other individuals. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  That might be an inference from


that language --


QUESTION:  Right.  So --


MR. SHAPIRO:  -- that that would be inconsistent


with the express language.

QUESTION:  Right.  So, I guess the question is


how strong is the exclusionary inference --


MR. SHAPIRO:  We think it's -- it's particularly


weak because the -- the provision that comes right before


this provision that deals with discrimination makes it


clear that the employer may use medical examinations and


may make an offer of employment contingent on the results


of those medical examinations.  That's in the


discrimination section. 


QUESTION:  Where -- where is that now?  What are


you --


MR. SHAPIRO:  That is in section 12112(d), which


is quoted in our reply brief at page 7.


QUESTION:  Where do we find that?  Reply brief?


MR. SHAPIRO:  At reply brief page 7.  It says


the employer may require a medical examination and may


condition an offer of employment on the results of that


examination.  Again, the focus is perfectly general in


scope.  The exam is lawful if it is job-related and


consistent with business need.


Now, we don't think it's necessary to resort to


legislative history in this case, but there is a


conference report here that stated that this act does not


intend to override any -- any -- legitimate medical


standards or requirements established by employers for

safety-sensitive positions. 


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Shapiro, as I go through


this statute, under your theory of the case, beginning on


page 58a, 12118, do you concede, for purposes of the


statutory analysis, that the employee here was a qualified


individual? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  We -- we deny that he was a


qualified individual.  We make two arguments:  one, that


-- that we have a business necessity not to hire somebody


who would be killed in this particular job, but also that


he's not qualified.


QUESTION:  So, as -- as you see the case, could


we dispose of the case by reading just 1211 -- 121118 and


end it right there --


MR. SHAPIRO:  Absolutely. 


QUESTION:  -- and find what we're talking about


in defenses just does not bear on our determination one


way or the other?  Obviously, you look at the whole


context of the statute to make sure that what you're doing


is consistent -- consistent with it.


MR. SHAPIRO:  I -- I would agree with that, and


we --


QUESTION:  It's hard to say he's not qualified


when he worked there for the other contractor in the same


circumstances for 20 years or so.

MR. SHAPIRO:  The qualification standard focuses


on whether he can perform the job on an ongoing basis in


the near term.  And -- and if the person would become


seriously ill or die in the near term, that person can't


carry out the job functions. 


QUESTION:  But 12113 specifically deals with


qualification standards.  I mean, don't you think that the


qualification standards portion has to be read in pari


materia with the -- with the -- with the provision


defining a qualified individual?  I mean, it seems to me


the two are addressing exactly the same thing. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  There is linguistic overlap and


there is practical overlap.  A person who is not qualified


is a person --


QUESTION:  I mean, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't


say that -- that a person is not a qualified individual if


he would pose an indirect threat to the health or safety


of others, would you?  Because that's clearly excluded. 


You cannot use that as a qualification standard.  I -- I


just don't think it's an easy way out.  I just -- it is in


another section, but I think that other section has to be


read to -- to be corresponding to the qualification


standards. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Our view is that there's overlap


between qualification and business necessity.

QUESTION:  Are we ultimately --


MR. SHAPIRO:  But they're not coextensive. 


QUESTION:  Are we ultimately asking the


10


question, is he qualified?


MR. SHAPIRO:  That's the first question.  The


second question is, if he is qualified, because, as


Justice O'Connor said, he can do the job in the short run,


which we don't think he can, then the question is whether


we have a business need to retain him.


QUESTION:  Well, but let me -- when we go


through the whole statute, including 121113, do you


ultimately say we come to the conclusion that after


reading the whole statute, he is not qualified, as that


term is used in 8?


MR. SHAPIRO:  That's our principal submission. 


Our backup --


QUESTION:  Now, you don't even rely on the EEOC


regulation?  At least you're not arguing from that.


MR. SHAPIRO:  We -- we -- it's one of our -- we


have several arguments in the alternative, yes.


QUESTION:  The regulation specifically says the


individual -- the threat to the individual can be


considered.


MR. SHAPIRO:  We believe we -- we can win the


case on that ground.

QUESTION:  But the Ninth Circuit thought that


went beyond the clear terms of the statute.


MR. SHAPIRO:  Yes, and we think that that


regulation is perfectly consistent with -- with the


general defense provision, and we believe we can win the


case under that regulation and, indeed, that it's entitled


to Chevron deference because this agency had legislative


rulemaking power to issue that standard.


QUESTION:  But then you give the -- then you


give the agency no deference at all when the agency says,


yes, of course, he's a qualified individual.  He can do


the job.  He's done it and he hasn't dropped dead for


those 20 years.  But so you say don't give the EEOC any


respect on -- on the qualified individual, but give them


Chevron deference on the 12113. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  We --


QUESTION:  So, it's kind of when you like what


the agency says, you respect it, and when you don't like


it, you don't respect it. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, I would note that the -- the


agency in its cert stage amicus brief said that the


qualification issue is whether the individual can perform


the job in the near term.  And we agree with that.  But we


say this person cannot do that because --

said -- they have spelled it out what their position is in


their brief, and they said, in no uncertain terms, this is


a qualified individual. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  But you'll -- you'll note --


QUESTION:  That's just in the brief, though. 


They didn't issue a rule to that effect, did they? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Absolutely.  That's just a


brief --


QUESTION:  And we're -- we're not paying any


attention to what they say in briefs, are we? 


(Laughter.) 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, they say -- they say helpful


things in the brief too.  They note that firemen and --


and airline pilots and others that would succumb to an


illness while they're conducting their jobs in the near


term are disqualified.  They're not qualified to do the


job.  And the reason is that safety considerations are


paramount there, they say. 


Well, they're paramount in this refinery too. 


There were five physicians here who said this individual


was at imminent risk of death --


QUESTION:  Just out of curiosity, why does he


want to kill himself? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  It's an old story, Your Honor. 


Some people do not listen to their doctors.  I won't

speculate on --


QUESTION:  All right.  You say -- I mean -- the


reason I ask that question is I suspect in any real case,


since people don't really want to kill themselves, there's


an argument about how risky it is.


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, if you read the cases that


we've cited, it's amazing how frequently people with --


QUESTION:  In all those other cases, it seemed


to me -- in all the cases that you cited --


MR. SHAPIRO:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- there was a different issue at


stake, and that in part was whether he could do the job.


And here, perhaps unrealistically we are assuming, for the


sake of this case, that he can do the job perfectly well.


MR. SHAPIRO:  We -- we don't assume that.


QUESTION:  All right.  You don't.  But suppose


-- I don't know.  I thought the issue is presented in the


context where we're forced to make that assumption.  I


don't think anyone denies that if he can't do the job with


reasonable accommodation, you have the right not to hire


him.  I don't know that anyone denies that one. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  We say he -- he is like the steel


worker with vertigo who can fall --

QUESTION:  Fine.  If that's correct -- does


anyone doubt that proposition of law? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  I hope not.


QUESTION:  No, all right.  So, this becomes


serious as a matter of law only if we assume that he can


do the job.  And I just wonder under those circumstances


whether in any real case the issue isn't an argument about


how risky it is, and if that's so, my question would be,


why doesn't this statute try to leave that matter up to


him?  If he does the job for you okay, that's your


business.  And if he wants to run greater risks than you


think he should, that's his business. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  This statute rejects that thesis


in the medical examination provisions, recognizing that


the employer has a stake in this issue.  There are many


legitimate interests that the employer has.


QUESTION:  Is it the case that it would violate


the Occupational Safety and Health Act for Chevron to hire


this person under those circumstances?  Do we know that?


MR. SHAPIRO:  Arguably it would, Your Honor,


because this is a known hazard.


QUESTION:  Does that have to be considered then


in the balance of qualification?  And the court below, I


guess, didn't resolve that. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  It should -- it should factor into

the business necessity evaluation because we do have a


business necessity to avoid violating State law and


Federal law.  And here there --


QUESTION:  What section of the OSHA would you


point to on that? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  I would point to the general


duty --


QUESTION:  And is it -- is it in the material


before us? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Oh, I -- I see we -- we didn't put


it in our appendix, but it's the general duty provision of


the OSHA statute cited in our opening brief and our reply


brief.  And what it says is that if you've recognized a


hazard, you cannot send the employee into the jaws of that


hazard.


QUESTION:  Where -- where is the text of that


that you're reading now?


MR. SHAPIRO:  It's the general duty clause --


QUESTION:  Maybe you can supply it later rather


than take your time now --


MR. SHAPIRO:  Yes.  We'll supply it for you.


QUESTION:  -- because we would be interested. 


QUESTION:  You were -- you were about to say why


the -- the employer has an interest other than the mere


charitable one in not letting an employee kill himself.

MR. SHAPIRO:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  What -- what is -- what are the


interests? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  There are several --


QUESTION:  Other than not violating OSHA. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  -- several interests.  There --


there is Federal law compliance.  There is State law


compliance.  There is State tort law liability that we're


concerned about.

QUESTION:  Suppose the Federal statute said this


is -- this preempts any inconsistent duty, that the


employer is not liable for compliance with this statute.


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, we would hope that


preemption would work that way, but preemption issues in


the States court often do not. 


QUESTION:  Let's assume -- let's assume it does. 


Is there still a business necessity?


MR. SHAPIRO:  Oh, yes, there still is.


QUESTION:  And what is that? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  That's -- that's preservation of


employment relations, avoidance of adverse publicity, and

-- and fear of criminal responsibility.  There have been


many criminal prosecutions, and courts never -- never hold


that -- that general criminal laws are -- are preempted by


Federal safety legislation.  So, I don't think that's --


that's any defense in that situation. 


There are -- in all well-run businesses today,


the model of the business is safety is our business.  For


100 years in this country, the industrial policy has been


safety comes first.  So, this is per se a legitimate


business interest in this context. 


Now, our -- our friend's argument to the


contrary, interestingly, is an exact replay of the


argument that was made to the EEOC back in 1991 when the


agency adopted its rules.  The argument was made then that


if you refer to risk to self, it's going to encourage


paternalism and encourage negative stereotypes.  But the


agency rejected that argument, explaining it was


inconsistent with the purpose of the statute and was


inconsistent with a long line of cases under the


Rehabilitation Act.  And the agency's judgment here, we


believe, is entitled to Chevron deference. 


QUESTION:  Wasn't that the argument that was


made in Johnson's Control that this is unsafe the -- the


-- allowing a woman of child-bearing capacity to work --


was it -- what was the toxic substance --

MR. SHAPIRO:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- that -- that the same kind of


evidence that you have about how dangerous it was, it's as


dangerous to the woman, dangerous to the fetus?


MR. SHAPIRO:  That was evaluated under a


different legal standard, the BOFQ standard, which is much


more stringent.  This Court has said the business


necessity standard is more flexible and -- and permissive. 


And that was a case where the Government said there was no


serious risk, and all you had to do is take a simple


precaution and the lead would not injure the -- the


fetuses of -- of the woman.  And there was discrimination


between the sexes, which was the real thrust of the


Court's decision, and there's nothing like that here. 


QUESTION:  But I thought the BFOQ goes together


with an explicit sex --


MR. SHAPIRO:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- what do they call it?  Disparate


treatment. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Exactly. 


QUESTION:  And that here -- and the business


necessity goes with neutral rule disparate effect.  Are


you saying that's what we have here? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Business necessity applies to any


screening test or medical examination or qualification

standard that the employer uses.  And this was something


that the business community fought hard for in Congress to


get this flexible test.  It's repeated three or four times


in -- in title I of the statute, and -- and to disregard


it here we think defeats the very basis of this


legislation. 


I see I've used a great deal of my time.  I


wonder if I might reserve the balance of the time for


rebuttal. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Shapiro. 


Ms. Blatt, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MS. BLATT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


If I could first address just how the statute


works with respect to whether an individual is qualified. 


It proceeds in two basic steps.  The plaintiff has the


burden of proof to show that he can perform the essential


fundamental job tasks of the job and that he satisfies the


employer's other qualification standards. 


Now, if a particular qualification standard


screens out someone because he is disabled, then the


burden shifts to the employer to justify that standard as

job-related and consistent with business necessity.  And


what -- the EEOC's regulatory threat to self regulation is


one example of a subset of a valid standard that is job-


related and consistent with business necessity.


The statute recognizes that a valid


qualification standard may include a safety requirement


that an individual not pose a safety threat to others in


the work place.  The EEOC has reasonably concluded that a


parallel defense is available if the individual would pose


a significant safety threat to himself. 


QUESTION:  I -- I have one question.  I guess


it's a -- maybe a soft variety of the expressio/exclusio


argument.  But the theory of Chevron deference is that the


-- that the Congress basically left a blank place to be


filled in in whatever way the agency think is best.  Why


would Congress have wanted to leave, as it were, a hiatus


on the question of individual safety when it specifically


attended to safety of others?  It just seems like an odd


thing to leave up to the agency when it was that close to


the subject in -- in what it did require.


MS. BLATT:  Well, the context is very important


here.  What the direct threat to others -- the statutory


threat to others defense -- is is a codification of this


Court's decision in Arline, and that arose in the context


of a teacher with a contagious disease that posed a direct

threat to others.  But Congress expressly anticipated that


other types of safety threats would be addressed by the


more general business necessity.  Congress simply didn't


address safety threats to self or safety threats to others


in the public and not necessarily the work place.


QUESTION:  Perhaps Congress thought like Justice


Breyer, that it's quite implausible that anybody would


want to kill himself.  Right?  I mean, it -- it is not


something that leaps to mind, that you -- you have to stop


somebody from taking a job that's going to kill him,


whereas stop somebody from taking a job in which he's


going to hurt somebody else, that's something you would


worry about.


MS. BLATT:  The threat to self context can come


up where an employee wants to either, A, assume the risk


or, B, there's a disagreement about whether that risk in


fact exists. 


Now, the question is, is when an employer can


prove, meet a burden of showing a documented and


scientific basis for finding a significant risk of


substantial harm, the employer has legitimate interests in


refraining from injuring or killing its workers.  The mere


fact that the employee consents to that risk cannot trump


the employer's interests, no more than it could if the


employees agreed to assume the risk of working in an

environment with a person with tuberculosis.  In both


cases, the employer has legitimate interests. 


Now, at the same time, the legislative history


shows that Congress was concerned about employment


decisions based on stereotype or group-based predictions


and unfounded fears about disabled people posing safety


threats.  And what the regulations do is carefully balance


the employer's legitimate interest with the rights of


disabled persons to be free of these prejudicial decisions 


by requiring an individualized determination that looks at


the person's actual medical condition and recognizes that


disabilities pose varying levels of side effects and


limitations or safety threats and requires an objective


determination based on --


QUESTION:  Well, they have a physician's exam


and report.  Is that enough? 


MS. BLATT:  The regulations require it to be


based on objective or other medical examination.


QUESTION:  Well, so this --


MS. BLATT:  And that may -- well may be.


QUESTION:  So, is that enough in -- in the view


of the Government? 


MS. BLATT:  In the view of the Government, if


the medical opinion is reasonable, then that's enough.


Now, in -- in this case --

QUESTION:  But you take the position in the


brief that perhaps it isn't.  I was curious about that.


MS. BLATT:  The position that the EEOC argued to


the Ninth Circuit, which the Ninth Circuit did not address


and would be available on remand, was that there was a


factual dispute that summary judgment should not be


entered on whether there was a reasonable determination. 


But employers are entitled to rely on the reasonable


medical judgments that reflect available current --


current medical knowledge. 


QUESTION:  Can I ask you a question about the


reg?  Because normally you should, of course, defer to the


agency's regs.  I understand that.  But this particular


reg is surprising the way it's written; that is, it


doesn't say there are a lot of qualification standards. 


One of them is a direct threat to individuals, contagious


disease problem.  Another one is the suicidal employee. 


Rather it has the definition of the word, direct threat,


and that's where it sticks the word self.  And it appears


then to be talking about a definition in the statute,


direct threat to others.  And it defines direct threat to


others as direct threat to self and others.  Now, if what


it's doing is explaining the words, direct threat to


others, I don't see how you can define the words, direct


threat to others, to deal with a completely different kind

of problem involving direct threat to self.


MS. BLATT:  With all due respect, Justice


Breyer, what the -- what the agency did -- and it's on


page 60a of the petition -- is said that a valid


qualification standard includes a requirement that there


not be a direct threat to the individual.  And then it


separately defined direct threat in terms of the way


direct threat was defined by Congress. 


QUESTION:  And you left out three things.  It


says, direct threat to the health and safety of the


individual or others.  See 1630.2(r) defining direct


threat, which refers you back to the reg in which what


they seem to be doing is defining the words, direct


threat.


MS. BLATT:  But what -- what the agency did, as


a matter of administrative convenience in protecting the


rights of disabled persons, is that in -- in crafting a


regulatory threat to self defense, it wanted to ensure


that the same protections would be given to workers and


that there had to be a showing of a significant risk of


substantial harm.  At the same time, this was beneficial


to employers.  So they wouldn't be confused by two


different standards, it would be the same standard. 


The agency could have accomplished the same


result had it said, well, we want this direct threat to


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

25 

others that follows the statute and as far as threats to


self were concerned, it could have just avoided using the


word, direct threat, and said, don't adopt a qualification


standard unless it screens out significant safety risks


that cause substantial harm.  So, the mere fact -- it was


administrative convenience to -- to have a parallel


defense and using the terminology of direct threat. 


QUESTION:  May I ask you, Ms. Blatt?  Do you


think -- does the Government think that it was proper for


the district court to enter summary judgment in the case?


MS. BLATT:  Yes, on the -- the EEOC argued that


the summary judgment on -- on direct threat with respect


to petitioner's argument.  And that would be available for


the Ninth Circuit to consider on remand if this Court


upheld the -- the regulation. 


QUESTION:  Is the district court saying that


those two other doctors don't count because they weren't


before -- I thought you had just said, in response to an


earlier question, that that would be open if the -- on


remand, the question of whether this person was in fact a


risk to himself because, as I understand it, there were


two witnesses that said he -- he was not.


MS. BLATT:  Petitioner is arguing that its


medical -- physicians advised that there was -- that there


was a direct threat here.  And what respondent argued in

response to that on summary judgment is that those


decisions weren't reasonable.  And we just think the


parties have a genuine fact dispute about --


QUESTION:  But the district judge said they


didn't.  The district judge said, I reject those two


witnesses.  They come too late.  Goodbye.  Summary


judgment.  So --


MS. BLATT:  It's -- but what's relevant is not


that the opinions were submitted late, it's whether at the


time -- the -- the relevant inquiries at the time the


employment decision is made, but you can still ignore what


the medical literature says and make an unreasonable


decision.


QUESTION:  So, you think -- you're saying the


district court erred as to that extent in saying summary


judgment, no trial.  This person is a danger to himself.


MS. BLATT:  The United States hasn't


independently briefed it, but that is what the EEOC argued


to the Ninth Circuit.  And it does turn on complicated


medical questions that would be appropriately addressed by


the Ninth Circuit on remand.  What -- what we think this


Court should do is hold that respondent was a qualified


individual, but the employer is entitled to show that he's


not qualified because it has a valid qualification


standard that --

QUESTION:  But do you have a position on the


question whether, as a matter of law, the defendant has


sustained the burden of proof that it was a reasonable


medical decision? 


MS. BLATT:  The EEOC argued below no.


QUESTION:  I'm not asking what the EEO argued


below.  I'm asking what is the Government's position on


that issue. 


MS. BLATT:  I don't know what the United States'


position on that is, but we don't have any reason to


disagree with the EEOC.  We just haven't independently


looked at it.  But the EEOC certainly makes a reasonable


argument that there was a factual dispute on it and


summary judgment was inappropriate. 


QUESTION:  Was inappropriate. 


MS. BLATT:  Inappropriate, right, that there was


a genuine fact dispute about whether the direct threat


test was met here, and we think the Ninth Circuit should


be able to -- to address that in the first instance. 


QUESTION:  Address whether -- whether that


argument is true or not. 


MS. BLATT:  Right, that because there is a valid


regulation that the EEOC promulgated and it's entitled to


deference, it should be upheld, and there's just a


question about whether it was met in this particular case.

QUESTION:  Ms. Blatt, I -- I find it peculiar to


say he was a qualified individual but he didn't meet the


employer's qualification standards.  I mean, what is a


qualified individual except one who can do what the


employer's standard says has to be done? 


MS. BLATT:  May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MS. BLATT:  It's just -- if I could give you the


example of the airline pilot with a contagious disease. 


He's qualified to fly the plane, but he may, nonetheless,


pose an unacceptable safety risk, and that's a valid


qualification standard to -- to not hire him.  It's just a


question of burden of proof basically, Justice --

Mr. Bagenstos, we'll hear from you.  Am I


pronouncing your name correctly? 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL R. BAGENSTOS


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Yes, Your Honor.


Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


The exclusion of individuals with disabilities


from jobs for their own protection was a principal target


of the Americans with Disabilities Act, but the threat to


self defense proposed by Chevron here would provide

29 

affirmative legal authorization for precisely that sort of


conduct. 


For three principal reasons, we think it clear


that Congress did not authorize such a threat to self


defense, the first simply being the statutory text and


particularly the change from the EEOC's prior regulations


under the Rehabilitation Act which specifically included a


threat to self disqualification to the ADA's direct threat


provision which is limited to threats to others. 


The second being the consistent jurisprudence


under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a statute


that provided a significant model for Title I of the ADA,


that also responds in significant measure to a problem of


paternalistic discrimination and --


QUESTION:  Just tell us, if you would, why the


employee would want to take a job where the doctor says


it's going to kill you? 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I -- I think that --


QUESTION:  These toxins will cause your early


death.  Now, why does the employee want that job? 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I think there aren't


really employees who want to do that.


I think Justice Breyer and Justice Scalia's


points made in the first half of the argument are well


taken.  When Congress was looking at this issue, it wasn't

thinking about the largely fanciful case where the


employee -- where the employee wants to -- wants to go


into a suicidal situation, but was thinking about the run


of cases where, you know, there -- there's a small risk,


there's an overstatement of the risk, there's some dispute


about the risk.  The -- and then the question is who


decides. 


QUESTION:  And what is it here? 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  And -- and here I think it's


clear there's a dispute about the nature of the risk.  I


think it's also clear if you look to what -- even the --


even the testimony of Chevron's doctors is here.  It's a


small risk.  Right?  So -- so, when the -- when the


doctors are asked what is the probability that this is


going to happen, they can't put a number on it.  Dr. Tang


closest he -- who is the -- who is the most credentialed


doctor for Chevron's side of the case, the closest he can


come is he says, well, something like 1 percent.  This is


at page 88 of the joint appendix.  So, what we're really


saying here is that, you know, people get injured in this


work place from time to time.  Maybe there's a 1 percent


incremental risk.  Even if you accept Chevron's


argument --


QUESTION:  May I interrupt you just for a


moment?  Perhaps you're right on the facts of this case,

but the legal rule that you're contending for seems it


would apply even if the risk was 99 percent and 2 weeks


from today. 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  I think that -- I think that is


correct, Your Honor.  And -- and my response to Justice


O'Connor was I think it's appropriate in crafting a rule


for Congress to think that the 99 percent death 2 weeks


from today cases aren't really going to arise, that the


run of cases are going to be like this. 


QUESTION:  How sure can you be about that? 


There are people who smoke when they know the risk is very


clear.  There are people who will take serious risks


because they need to earn money to support a family, and


they often will do things their doctors tell them not to


do.  But you say they have an absolute right to take


whatever the risk is. 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I -- I think they have --


they have the same right as people who don't have


disabilities.  A very important point is that the question


is -- the question here is -- I'm sorry, Your Honor. 


Would you like to --


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I want to also get your


view on that because there's another aspect of the case


that I'm puzzled by.  Mr. Shapiro at the beginning said


that everybody else in the plant is safe under the OSHA

standards and so that only this person is at risk.  Is --


do you agree with that, or is there also risk to everybody


else in the plant? 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I -- I think that the


testimony of -- of the two experts on our side of the case


-- this is why I say it's disputed.  The testimony of the


two experts on our side of the case is to the effect that


if there is a risk for Mr. Echazabal, there is a risk for


everyone else in the plant. 


But the real issue is not whether the employer


can take steps to make its work place safe.  The real


issue is whether the employer or the employee gets to make


the decision whether --


QUESTION:  Is it conceivable that someone would


not be disabled but still be in a position where the -- he


would propose a risk to himself similar to this? 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  I -- I -- of course, it's


possible.  That's absolutely right.  And we don't have


any --


QUESTION:  Surely the employer can say no in


that situation.


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I think -- I think what


the employer can do -- the employer can certainly do


whatever it wants with respect to people who don't have


disabilities as defined in the statute, at least as far as

the ADA is concerned. 


But again, the -- the question here is we have


an individual who is excluded precisely because the


employer believed that his disability rendered him unsafe. 


And the question is who gets to decide whether this job is


too unsafe.  Is it the employer?  Is it the employee?  We


believe that -- that Congress firmly left that decision in


the hands of the employee.


QUESTION:  But the reason you make -- I think


the reason you make that argument is essentially the --


the paternalism theory.  Congress rejected paternalism. 


But isn't what Congress rejected a combination of


paternalism and stereotype?  It rejected the kind of


Johnson Controls situation which would say all women are


at risk.  Here you can call it paternalism if you want to,


but at least the -- the medical claim is that there is a


determination of risk specific to this individual.  And


can we say that Congress rejected the employer's authority


to take that into consideration?  No stereotype. 


Specific. 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  I think -- I think we can say


that.  I think we can -- we can say that because of the


reference to over-protective rules and the statutory


findings.  We can say that because of Congress' lopping


off of the threat to self disqualification that had

point.

from the Government was that the -- the reason the


regulation mentioned threats to others is that there was


-- there was case law on the point, and there's -- there


really isn't comparable case law on threats to


individuals.  So that one way to read what Congress did


was to say it wanted to preserve the law -- the case law


that there was and leave the rest open.  What do you --


what do you say to that argument? 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I think -- I think that --


that I may misconstrue their argument, but -- but


certainly -- certainly as to the state of the


Rehabilitation Act law at the time the ADA was adopted,


there was a specific regulation by the EEOC.  It's quoted


in the petition's -- petition appendix at page 61, right,


that specifically said a person is qualified only if he


can perform the essential functions of the position in


question without endangering the health or -- and safety


of the individual and others.

Congress in 42 U.S.C. 12201(a) adopted by


reference the Rehabilitation Act regulations, at least as


a floor for protection under the ADA.  This is one


instance where Congress actually departed from what the


prior Rehabilitation Act regulations did.  We think that


-- that has particular significance, particularly in light


of the consistent drum beat not just in the statutory


findings, not just in the legislative history at the


hearing stage, at the committee report stage, at the floor


stage, but also consistently in Title VII law, this --


this distinction between -- between excluding people based


on risk they pose to others and excluding people based on


risk they pose to themselves. 


QUESTION:  Well, isn't there some room, though,


for the argument that it -- there may be a business


necessity not to hire somebody who's going to be killed as


a result?  You do have OSHA standards.  You do have


workmen's comp premiums that get jacked up if some


employee is injured on the job or made ill because of the


job.  You have probably labor relations problems as a


result of having somebody put at risk on the job.  There


-- there are arguments there for a business necessity


defense.


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I think -- I think there


may be arguments there.  I think that they -- I think that

they're misplaced as a justification across the board for


a threat to self defense as the EEOC has adopted. 


Worker's compensation premiums --


QUESTION:  Maybe but notwithstanding the


regulation, just looking at the provisions of the act as


applied in this case, how do we deal with that business


necessity argument? 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I think I'd say two things


about that.  First, I think that -- I think that the


decision that Congress made in 12113(b), the direct threat


provision, to say specifically this is -- this is a


defense that is limited to significant risks, because


that's how it defines direct threat, and risks to others,


I think that -- that in and of itself suggests that


Congress has foreclosed a business necessity defense for


anything -- anything relating to safety risk that falls


outside the terms of it, just as Congress couldn't -- just


as an employer could not say, as Justice Scalia suggested,


well, we're excluding this person because of an indirect


threat, but there's a business necessity for it.


QUESTION:  Well, I thought Justice O'Connor's


question was somewhat broader.  Obviously, we understand


your statutory position.  But the -- the point of her


question at least, as -- as I began to consider it, was


whether or not in this society, it's -- it's wrong to say

that an employer should care about its employees. 

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Certainly --


QUESTION:  It seems to me that that's a very,


very important policy to further, and your position wants


an employer to take a position that could be completely


barbarous.  You have an employee who has severe mobility


problems near dangerous machines where he could be maimed,


and you say that that's just irrelevant.  I think that's a


-- an argument that's very demeaning to a society that


wants to encourage good conduct on -- on the part of its


employers.


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I think that this Court


confronted basically the same argument in the Johnson


Controls case, that the employer said -- the employer


said, look, we have a moral interest in the safety of our


employees.


QUESTION:  But wasn't that a case involving a


broad category of all women of child-bearing age whether


or not you were dealing with a specific individual who had


been told by the doctor you better not do this.  That was


a broad categorical rule.  Here we're dealing with an


individual and individual circumstances.  Does that make a


difference, do you think?  I mean, I would think Johnson


is a -- a very sound concept as applied to broad


categories, but I'm not sure it covers this case.

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I -- I mean, two points


with respect to that.  One is I think that it's clear that


as -- as the employment discrimination law moves from


Title VII which deals with large groups to -- to


disability, which as -- as this Court's definition of


disability decisions indicate, is a very individualized


kind of a concept.  Right?  I mean, two people who have


the same medical diagnosis, one may have a disability, one


may not, this Court has repeatedly emphasized. 


Necessarily the kind of intentional discrimination we're


talking about is going to be intentional discrimination


against a person because of his particular disability as


opposed to because of some broader group membership. 


I -- I would suggest that there -- there is


exclusion on the basis of some kind of group membership


even in a case like this.  Anyone with chronic hepatitis C


would be excluded by -- by what Chevron --


QUESTION:  But once -- once you eliminate the


stereotyping as, you know, Justice Souter was -- was


inquiring about, I don't see why Congress would be so


adamant about paternalism for the handicapped but not


adamant about paternalism for everybody else.  I mean, if


-- if I don't have a handicap, I have some disability that


-- that does not qualify as a handicap, and I want to -- I


want to work in -- in a particular job, and it's

dangerous, and under OSHA rules I don't have any right to


say, paternalistic State, get out of here.  I'm willing to


accept the risk.  You can't do it.  Why -- why is Congress


only worried about paternalism for the handicapped? 


Once you eliminate the stereotyping, you have


individual determination that this person is -- is going


to be harmed.  Why does Congress say, if it's a disabled


person, he can kill himself, but if it's not a disabled


person, oh, no, you can let him kill yourself?  Why would


Congress want to make that distinction? 


MR. BAGENSTOS: 

Well, I think two -- two


points.  One is if it's a disabled person, he still has to


be subject to the same OSHA rules as everyone else. 


But two, why is Congress concerned about


paternalistic discrimination?  I mean, I -- I think a


significant part of it is the concern that over the run of


cases, there's -- when an employer looks at an individual


with a disability and the risk posed by that individual to


himself, history has shown -- and there's ample evidence


of this in the -- in the legislative record -- history has


shown that -- that there is likely to be an over-emphasis,


an over-determination that there is in fact a risk. 


The --

MR. BAGENSTOS:  By doctor -- by doctors, company


doctors, as occurs -- as occurred --


QUESTION:  You're against even the most extreme


case, which this may not be.  I mean, that's hard to see


that. 


I -- I -- but I'm particularly curious.  What


about the reg?  What about the reg?  I mean, there it is. 


I take it your clients in this instance don't like the


reg, but more often than not, the EEOC regs are quite


favorable to disabled people.  So -- so, how can we say,


well in this case we're paying no attention to the reg,


but in some other case you'll be back here arguing we


ought to pay a lot of attention to the reg.  So, what's


your response to that? 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I don't think it's a


question of -- of whose ox is gored.  Right?  I mean, I


think why this reg --


QUESTION:  Well, explain why it isn't. 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Right.  And why this reg doesn't


-- ought not to get deference, it seems to me, is because


what the EEOC is basically doing is sneaking back into its


regulation a piece of the Rehabilitation Act regulation


that was cut out by Congress. 


QUESTION:  You tell me how I write this sentence


in the paragraph that says the reg doesn't matter?  I say,

write that. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  What is it I'm supposed to say about


that? 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I -- I think that


deference doesn't apply when Congress has explicitly --


QUESTION:  If it's clear, that's right, but I


find it pretty hard to say it's clear when you start


talking about extreme cases.  I mean, maybe this isn't one


of them, but you have the carpenter who's -- you know.  I


mean, you know, we can make them up.  I think they're very


hypothetical.  I doubt very much they really exist, but


you're asking for a rule that encompasses those


hypothetical, far-out cases, and there I see the reg. 


What am I supposed to do? 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  So, two -- two points about the


extreme cases, I mean, if that's what we're focusing on. 


The first point, as -- as Your Honor acknowledges, far-


out probably don't exist.  When Congress writes a rule, it


doesn't write a rule for the extreme cases.  It writes a


rule for the run of cases.  So, it wouldn't be crazy to --


to read Congress -- what Congress said as not --

think the subject matter of the potentially suicidal

worker has nothing whatsoever to do with the problem of


contagious diseases.  And so, I find it very hard to say


that in writing about contagious diseases, they were


saying anything whatsoever about suicides. 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I think that -- I think


that one of the -- one of the changes that the ADA makes


in the direct threat provision is broadening that from


contagious diseases to all other kinds of risks, number


one. 


QUESTION:  You tell me about the reg. 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Right, right.  So, number two,


about -- about the reg, it seems to me that in some of the


extreme cases, a lot of them, maybe all of them, the


person will fail on the qualified individual standard.  A


person who's going to die by -- simply by walking on the


job, simply is unable to perform essential functions --


QUESTION:  You're not telling me about the reg. 


I want to know how to avoid -- from your point of view,


you want me to avoid the fact that I owe deference to a


reg of the agency.  So, I want to know.  I know the normal


rule is I owe that deference.  So, what's special about


this in respect to that? 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I -- I think that the


question -- the question is, as I said, whether Congress


has spoken to the matter with respect to whether an

employer can exclude an individual based on risk to self,


and we say that Congress has spoken to that matter in


12113(b), the direct threat provision. 


QUESTION:  Sure, but the -- the question is how


plainly.  And -- and here's the problem that I have, just


as a technical matter, without even getting to the


suicidal patient. 


You make a very good argument about the contrast


between what Congress wrote in the old EEOC regs.  As


against the force of that argument, you've got the text of


the statute that refers to the qualifications, including


threats to others.  So, in the -- you know, the very


breath that they're giving your -- an example, they're


saying, and there can be all kinds of other things too.


It may very well be -- I don't know.  It may


very well be that, as Justice Ginsburg suggested earlier,


they were talking about other kinds of examples on other


subjects.  But I don't know.  It's not clear to me, and


that's the point at which Chevron deference becomes


crucial.  How can I say it is so plain that Congress was


excluding a -- a Chevron treatment? 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Okay.  Two points, one textual,


one contextual.  The textual point, directly on -- on this


provision, I think goes back to what Justice Scalia said


in the first half of the argument which is just because it

begins with may include, doesn't mean that everything that


follows it -- everything that follows it doesn't place any


limitations on everything that precedes may include. 


Congress said, you know, qualification standards may


include a direct threat to others --


QUESTION:  Absolutely, but I don't know how to


draw the line.  That's my problem. 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  And -- and I think the


contextual point helps answer that with the -- the


consistent statements both in the statutory findings and


in this provision, the change from the -- from the


Rehabilitation Act regs, and consistently in the


legislative history, including that specifically referring


to this particular provision saying the reason why we cut


this language out basically is in order to say that


paternalistic determinations, determinations by employers


for the safety of employees, for the safety of the


particular excluded employees, should not be permitted to


justify --


QUESTION:  Okay.  But that gets back to the


point that several have raised and that is paternalism


combined with stereotype, yes, I understand.  That's out. 


Johnson Controls is out. 


But paternalism alone?  Particularly where, as


Justice Scalia has said, paternalism for the -- for the

non-disabled is -- is alive and well in OSHA.  That's --


that's not so easy for -- for me to follow. 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Paternalism for everybody, the


non-disabled, as well as the disabled --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  -- taken as a whole -- I -- I


agree is taken kind of as part of the OSHA. 


I -- I think that it's certainly, as -- as I


meant to say in response to Justice Scalia's question,


there certainly is a concern for stereotyping here.  The


question is whether Congress meant to permit -- or meant


to require employees to have to prove stereotyping in each


case.  That is -- that is, Congress could have made a


class-based decision that most of the time when we have an


exclusion of an individual with a disability because of a


conclusion that his disability makes him unsafe, that --


that is likely to be informed by some degree of


stereotyping or the -- the incentives that -- that


employers' doctors have to exclude people rather than hire


them and take the steps necessary to protect them as the


American Public Health Association makes clear in its


brief.  So, stereotyping is --


QUESTION:  So, that may -- that may simply get


us down to a very important point but not a point here,


and that is, the -- a sufficiency of evidence point or a

-- or a sufficient specificity of evidence point.  And


that's -- that's not what we've got.


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, the problem -- right.  I


think that's right.  I think Congress then has two


choices.  Do you require plaintiffs to prove in every case


that there is stereotyping in addition to paternalism?  Or


do you presume essentially paternalism entails


stereotyping when it's paternalistic discrimination?  It's


not paternalism at large, not paternalism visited on all


employees.  And I think that Congress, given the history


recounted over and over in -- in the hearings, was


entitled to say that we're just going to make a -- a broad


class of --


QUESTION:  Did it say that?  That's the question


we're all interested in.  It certainly was entitled to


say, but I don't believe you can point to any particular


place where it specifically says that. 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I think that -- I think


that the closest is that just as the direct threat


provision excludes an indirect threat as a basis for --


for excluding someone, so too does the threat to others


language there exclude threats to self. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but you -- you have to push


beyond the analogy from direct threat to indirect threat


to -- to get that far out.

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I -- I don't -- I don't


know that you have to push beyond the analogy.  I mean,


it's -- I would -- I would say, with respect, it seemed --


it seems like it's precisely parallel statutory language.


There are two limitations in the 12113(b) direct


threat provision.  One is direct threat defined as


significant risk, and the other is risk to others.  It


seems like if you're going to override either of those


limitations under the guise of the general 12113(a)


qualification standards defense, then any purpose Congress


had for including those limitations in that direct threat


provision is -- is going to be rendered meaningless. 


And so -- so, I think that's the concern there. 


And this is not -- this is not a concern that's -- that's


unique to the ADA.  It's a concern that this Court


approached under Title VII. 


I think the important answer that -- I'd like to


get back to Justice Kennedy's point before -- is that this


is not a statute, even under our reading, that prevents


employers from taking steps, taking lots of steps, to


protect their employees.  It just eliminates one thing


they might do, and that is simply exclude an employee who,


because of a disability, is determined to -- to pose an


undue risk.

hypothetical that I -- I can't -- haven't quite been able


to think through?  Assume that the -- that an employee has


to be able to lift at least 200 pounds in order to be safe


in a particular assignment.  And one employee can't lift


200 pounds because he's just not any stronger than a lot


of other people, and another employee can't do it because


he's disabled.  Could they fire -- could they deny the


employment of the disabled person in that hypo?


MR. BAGENSTOS:  I think that that would be a


neutral qualification standard.  That's the paradigm case


of a neutral qualification standard.  That is what


12113(a) is about.  Asking everybody --


QUESTION:  So, if the -- if Standard Oil had a

case, then it's no longer neutral.  Then what they're


doing is engaging in intentional discrimination against


that person because of his condition.  If, on the other


hand, what they say is we require everybody to lift 200


pounds, we don't care if the reason you can't lift 200


pounds is because --


QUESTION:  Well, then you're discriminating


against people with hernias probably. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Well, it -- it would certainly screen


out people with hernias, and -- and therefore would prima


facie violate the screening out provision of -- of the


statute unless there were a business necessity


justification.  This is precisely the context in which


there would be a business necessity justification under


the statute where -- where an employer says we require


everybody to satisfy the standard.  We don't care.  We


don't even ask what's the reason why you can't lift.  We


give you 200 pounds and say, lift if for us, and if you


can't do it --

everybody to have a prognosis of living for at least 2


years on the job?

that, I mean, I think -- I think that that would be


something -- that would be something that goes a lot


closer to a qualification standard that is neutral.  Now,


the concern in that case is, number one, is it really


neutral?  That is, is it the case that they say only to


people with disabilities, people with medical conditions


that constitute disabilities, we think that you fail this


test. 


QUESTION:  No, but I'm talking about just across


the board.  One of the things that we require, regardless


of what you're condition is, is we want -- we want your


life expectancy to be at least 2 years. 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  I think that they could do that


if they could justify it as job-related and consistent


with business necessity, which might be very difficult. 


The business justification I suppose would be we don't


want turnover in employment, but there's a lot of turnover


for a lot --


QUESTION:  No age discrimination problem here? 


(Laughter.) 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  There might well be an age


discrimination problem there.  Disparate effects, you


know, depending on whether disparate effect is recognized


under that statute. 


But -- but under -- as far as the ADA is

concerned, certainly it's the case that they would be able


to assert a business justification, but I think it would


be difficult in that case to actually prove the business


justification because it's only -- if it's only people who


are going to die in 2 years, however we predict that, who


are excluded from employment and not people who are going


to take a better job, not people who are going to leave


because they fall in love and move to a different city or


leave to take care of a sick parent -- I mean, there are


thousands of reasons why job turnover occurs.  If they


single out something that screens out people with


disabilities, that's obviously very different. 


But the crucial point, it seems -- it seems to


me, is that in this case what we have and in the class of


cases on which the legal question presented addresses --


what we have is a choice effectively of who's going to


decide whether a job is too risky for a particular


individual in a context where there are general rules like


OSHA that are complied with. 


QUESTION:  Well, let the doctor decide.


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I think that the


individual will certainly -- will certainly follow the


dictates of his own doctor in most cases.  And when the


individual doesn't, I mean, there are obviously cases


where people --

QUESTION:  I'm afraid you haven't thought about


the Christian Scientists in this -- in this community.


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Right.  Well, I mean, I think --


I think that raises obviously distinct issues. 


But -- but yes, I think that -- people will


obviously consult with their doctors.  I mean, what's --


what's notable here is that Chevron purported to consult


with Echazabal's doctor, didn't really give him all the


information, didn't get it, didn't ask him whether there


was a significant risk, but never put the doctor in


contact with Echazabal, just purported to have --


QUESTION:  Well, that goes to the issue on


remand if there is one.


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Right, no --


QUESTION:  It's not the legal --


MR. BAGENSTOS:  I -- I agree with that.  I -- I


agree with that really does go --


QUESTION:  But if we're focusing on our concern


about extreme cases, of which this may not be one, have


you thought of a form of words that might cabin those off


if they ever occur, which would give some meaning to the


reg? 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  I --


QUESTION:  And what's the form of words?


MR. BAGENSTOS:  I don't know that I can give any

meaning to the reg that's --


QUESTION:  If you can -- if you apply it, you


could think of an extreme case where the person is -- you


know, the suicidal worker, I'm going to die with my boots


on and I hope tomorrow.  I mean, there may be such people,


and -- and okay.  So, that's what maybe this reg is about. 


I don't know.  It doesn't say it isn't.  And -- and what's


the form of words that would cabin off those cases? 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I think that the cabining


would have to be external to the regulation.  I think it's


-- I think it's -- to -- to say --


QUESTION:  Well, give me the form of words,


however you want to do it. 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Okay.  And I think that the


cabining is threefold.  Number one, an employer can


exclude someone who is not a qualified individual with a


disability, which many people who pose such an extreme


present risk themselves will be.  Number two, an employer


can apply neutral qualification standards that are job-


related and consistent with business necessity.  And


number three, if we have someone who really is bent on


committing suicide by employment, there are State law


commitment remedies available for such people, people who


can't --

MR. BAGENSTOS:  And no --


QUESTION:  I mean, that's -- that's extreme.  I


mean, people may want to die with their boots on.  There


are a lot of things that move people.  Some don't believe


it, et cetera.  So, is there a serious form of words that


you could say, well, if it's really one of those cases, it


might be a -- a situation that falls within the reg?  And


you're telling me the answer to that question is no. 


There is no form of words. 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  I -- I think outside of the


situation -- the first two situations that I spoke of


where the person isn't qualified or where the person is


excluded under a neutral job-related and consistent with


business necessity qualification standard, that I would


suspect excludes everybody except what we've now described


as the really extreme cases. 


QUESTION:  In order to avoid paternalism, we're


going to tell employers they can just commit their


employees. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I think the crucial point


is that, I mean, there are due process limitations on


commitment which there are not for employers.  And that's


the crucial point, Justice Kennedy.  If -- if we say that


employers get to decide willy-nilly this is too unsafe,

that's -- that's a very different kind of a process.  Of


course, commitment is only in a very extreme circumstance,


and we have procedures to make sure that independent


decision makers make those decisions with full knowledge


of the facts not employers here and then forcing --


forcing employees to come to court and fight for 6 years


to prove that they really weren't a risk to themselves.


And -- and that we think is the reason why Congress


excluded the -- excluded the notion that an employer could


make the decision instead of the employee as to what is


too unsafe. 


And we would then submit that the court of


appeals judgment should be affirmed. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Bagenstos. 


Mr. Shapiro, you have 2 minutes remaining. 


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. SHAPIRO:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


Justice Stewart's opinion for the Court in the


Dothard case contained an excellent rebuttal to the


argument we've just heard.  He stated that safety is not


romantic paternalism.  Safety is a basic business


necessity in this country.  That's the culmination of 100


years of industrial policy. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Shapiro, I thought that was

safety of others because didn't Dothard make the


distinction between the -- the risk to the individual


woman, which was up to her?  What Dothard said is, this


prison is a jungle.  By her presence, she is endangering


everyone else in the place.  There are going to be riots.


So, I think Dothard doesn't work for you at all.


MR. SHAPIRO:  Oh, we think it does.  The Court


discussed both kinds of danger, danger to the individual


and danger to other people.  And this Court twice has said


in Dothard -- in Beezer -- the Beezer case later -- that


safety is a paradigm business necessity.  And indeed, it


-- it is the paradigm, safe and efficient operations of


business. 


And this is not a statute that cut out risks to


self.  This is a statute that included risks to self in


the business necessity defense.  That's generic language


that encompasses it.  And there was a long line of cases


that Congress meant to adopt under the Rehab Act.  They


didn't disapprove those cases.  In fact, business


necessity is repeated four different times in the statute,


and it's applied specifically to medical examinations of


the individual employee.  Congress wasn't talking about


general tests.  It was talking about examinations like the


one given to Mr. Echazabal.


Now, this Court has held that under the business

necessity defense, it will not substitute its judgment for


the employer's judgment.  All that is needed is a


reasonable relationship to a legitimate business


objective.  There certainly is a legitimate business


objective here in saving this individual's life and


promoting safety in the plant. 


Was the judgment a reasonable one?  We had four


opinions from experienced physicians.  We spoke with Mr.


Echazabal's own physician. We told him, did you realize


this man would be exposed to liver toxins, and he said,


no, that should not be done.  Someone with hepatitis C


can't even have a drink of alcohol, much less liver


toxins. 


Shapiro.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.
