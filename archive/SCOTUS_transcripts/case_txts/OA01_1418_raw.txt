CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


first this morning in Number 01-1418, A. Elliott Archer


versus Arlene L. Warner.


Mr. Goldblatt. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG GOLDBLATT


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


An individual debtor at the end of a bankruptcy


case will typically receive a discharge of that debtor's


pre-bankruptcy debts.  That discharge, however, is subject


to a number of statutory exceptions, each exception


reflecting a congressional judgment that a particular 

category of debt be paid notwithstanding the prior


bankruptcy.  Those exceptions include not only debts for


money obtained by fraud, debts for injuries caused by


drunk driving, and amounts due for alimony and child


support.


With respect to the fraud exception at issue


here, under the Bankruptcy Code and this Court's cases, a


debt is nondischargeable in bankruptcy if the creditor can


establish that the underlying debt arises out of an act of


fraud.  The question presented in this case is whether a

debt that would otherwise be nondischargeable for that


reason becomes dischargeable if the parties enter into a


settlement agreement that resolves the amount of the debt.


The court of appeals said that a settlement did


have that effect, emphasizing that the effect of a


settlement was to trade a fraud claim for a contract


action that would be discharged in bankruptcy.


QUESTION:  Is it your understanding that if the


Fourth Circuit were correct and were to be affirmed in


this case, that its rule would be the generally prevailing


rule in all of the States, or would certain States differ


on whether or not there was, in effect, a novation when


there was a settlement agreement?  Would we have to go


State-by-State?


MR. GOLDBLATT:  No, Your Honor.  The question of


dischargeability is a question of Federal law.  That is


how each of the courts of appeals that have addressed the


question has treated it.  Indeed, this Court, in Grogan


versus Garner, has emphasized that the construction of


section 523(a) of the Bankruptcy Code is a question of


Federal law.


QUESTION:  Well, my -- my question, perhaps, was


not as clear as it ought to have been.  The Fourth Circuit


placed substantial reliance on the fact that this was a


novation under State law, that there was a new debt

created superseding the old, et cetera, and my question is


whether or not -- if we affirm its judgment, that we will


find in almost every other State a settlement is also a


novation, or will the rule vary from State to State, and


if it does vary from State to State, will the Fourth


Circuit rule from this particular State be the majority


rule or minority?


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Your Honor, the court of appeals


did, indeed, say that the -- the settlement effected a


novation.  That is a common rule.  I'm unaware of any


jurisdiction in which that -- that wouldn't be the


principle.  The question, nevertheless, before this Court


is the effect as a matter of Federal bankruptcy law of


that settlement.


QUESTION: 


I'm -- I'm well aware of that, but 

what I'm just asking is -- this case came from South


Carolina, was it?


MR. GOLDBLATT:  From North Carolina, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Oh, from North Carolina.


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Is the North Carolina rule about


novations and settlements the majority rule for most of


the States?  In most States, would this be called a


novation?


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Yes, Your Honor.  I'm unaware of

any jurisdiction in which a settlement doesn't effect


novation.  When the parties to a dispute settle that


dispute, it is commonly the case that -- indeed, in every


jurisdiction of which I'm aware, following that


settlement, the -- the creditor or the plaintiff is unable


to bring a new lawsuit for fraud.  Rather, the party is


left to enforce the -- the settlement.


QUESTION:  Mr. Goldblatt, I take it you're


saying, yeah, a novation is fine with you.  No longer do


they have the original claim.  They have substituted for


it, what the claim is, the amount of the settlement. 


The -- what was it, immediate payment of X dollars?  Was


it 2,000?


MR. GOLDBLATT:  It was an immediate payment of


$200,000 and a promissory note for $100,000. 

QUESTION:  And that's -- that's what they --


they say is the basis of their claim in bankruptcy.  They


think -- they know they can't go back to the original


claim.  To that extent, it's a novation.  That's not


disputed.  But there is one element of the background of


this case perhaps you can clarify for me.  It's odd that


Leonard Warner stipulated that this was a nondischargeable


debt, but his wife, who's in the bankruptcy with him, says


yes, it is dischargeable.  What is the effect of the


stipulation by Leonard Warner that this debt is

nondischargeable?


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Your Honor, Leonard Warner


stipulates that the debt is nondischargeable as to him. 


With respect to Mrs. Warner, it would remain our burden in


bankruptcy to show that -- that there is an act of fraud


that is properly attributable to her, either because she


committed it herself or by some principle of agency that


it is nondischargeable because of her, so I -- I don't


believe that the -- the stipulation by its terms is -- is


dispositive on the question of whether it is


nondischargeable as -- as to her.


QUESTION:  But does that mean that -- let's say


the Fourth Circuit is affirmed, that you could still,


post-bankruptcy, go after Mr. Warner because he stipulated


that the debt as to him was nondischargeable? 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  I -- I believe that -- that's a


final and unappealable order at this point, and yes,


that's right, of course.  Petitioners assert that they


have the right as a matter of Federal bankruptcy law also


to continue to recover on this debt as against


Mrs. Warner, who also is an obligor on the promissory


note.


On the essential point that, Justice Ginsburg,


you were making with respect to the holding below, the


description you offered is -- is exactly right.  It is

true that there is a novation.  It is true that the


underlying claim of fraud has been released, but just --


that was equally true in this Court's decision in Brown


versus Felsen.


In Brown, the parties to a State court


litigation resolved that litigation by agreeing to the


entry of a consent judgment.  It was as equally true


there, as it is here, that the parties who had been --


whose litigation had ended in the consent judgment were


barred, in that case by the preclusive effect of the


consent judgment, here by the binding effect of the


settlement, from bringing a new suit claiming fraud.  All


they could do was enforce the consent judgment.


Nevertheless, this Court held in a unanimous


opinion in Brown versus Felsen that in bankruptcy, the 

creditor nevertheless had the right to seek to establish


that the underlying debt arises out of an act of fraud,


and the -- the reason this Court --


QUESTION:  Well, of course, there it wasn't just


the underlying debt.  It was trying to find out what the


judgment actually decided.  They were -- they were able to


go beyond the terms of the judgment to determine what the


judgment actually resolved.  I'm not quite sure it's


exactly parallel --


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Well, yes, Justice Stevens,

that's right, and here what -- what petitioners seek to do


is go behind the settlement agreement --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. GOLDBLATT:  -- and see what the settlement


actually resolved.


QUESTION:  Supposing the settlement -- they had


gone along with the settlement, and then they came up with


a -- a third proposal where the debtor said, I'm not sure


I'm going to be able to meet my obligations, but I've got


another proposal, we'll go in the joint venture to do


something else and we'll release the contract claim and


substitute a third, could you go -- still continue to go


behind to find out what the original source of the debt


was?


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Yes. 


Yes, Your Honor. 

QUESTION:  So even if, say, they had five or six


different transactions, each of which purported to be a


complete substitute for the deal they had just been unable


to -- you can always go -- say, Well, the whole thing


started because you cheated me out of something?


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Well -- well, for each


particular debt that one asserts is nondischargeable, the


creditor bears the burden of proving in bankruptcy that


that debt arises out of an act of fraud.


QUESTION:  Directly or indirectly out of.

 MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's right, but nevertheless,


under Brown versus Felsen, that is the creditor's --


QUESTION:  Suppose I have an indebtedness.  I'm


running a business and I have one indebtedness, and in


order to cover the payments for that indebtedness, I incur


a second indebtedness which I otherwise would not have


incurred, is that traceable to fraud?


MR. GOLDBLATT:  If the original indebtedness


arises out of an act of fraud, Justice Scalia, then --


then yes, it is all debt --


QUESTION:  Anything that happens later is --


that -- that wouldn't have happened but for the original


indebtedness is, within the terms of the Bankruptcy Act,


traceable to the fraud?


MR. GOLDBLATT: 


Justice Scalia, we -- we 

certainly acknowledge that there must be some principle


of, say, proximate causation.


QUESTION:  Exactly, and that's all we're talking


about here, isn't -- isn't it?  How -- how -- you know,


how far down the line do we carry traceable to, and does a


novation end the traceability, but you -- you have to


acknowledge it has to end somewhere.


MR. GOLDBLATT:  There certainly is a principle


of proximate causation.  You -- you need to show that


there is a direct connection between the act of fraud --

 QUESTION:  Wait, but what about -- I mean, this


doesn't make too much sense to me.  You say, A owes B


$100,000 because of a fraud that A committed against B, so


they settle it, and they say, our settlement arrangement


is the following.  We enter into a new business called


Macy's Department Store, and many years later there's


another debt between the partners arising out of buying


furniture for Macy's that has nothing to do with fraud,


and now you're saying that that debt's going to be never


dischargeable because the cause of Macy's was the fraud?


MR. GOLDBLATT:  No, Justice Breyer, I'm not


suggesting that there is never a point in which the


causation becomes too tenuous that you can't prove that


the debt that one is contending is --


QUESTION:  No, I -- absolutely.  Macy's would


never have been created but for the debt, no doubt about


that.


MR. GOLDBLATT:  But not -- not only is -- is the


principle of --


QUESTION:  They never would have had this


furniture argument but for the debt.


QUESTION:  Well, you're talking not just about


cause, but about proximate cause.


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Exactly.  It's not just a


question of but-for causation, but as in common law,

proximate causation.


QUESTION:  And what does that mean, proximate


cause, then?  What's the difference between this case and


Macy's? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Your Honor, here, all that


happened is that the -- the form of the debt changed.  The


parties entered into a settlement agreement in which they


changed the debt from an unliquidated cause of action for


fraud into a liquidated promissory note.


QUESTION:  In -- in connection with that, one


side said to the other, I don't care whether this has come


out of fraud or not.  Regardless of whether it came out of


fraud, I'm going to give you this money, and we'll be


quits.  Why isn't that enough to terminate the proximity,


because the averment of both parties is, never mind fraud, 

it doesn't have anything to do with fraud, we're going to


settle this.  Whether there was fraud or whether there


wasn't fraud, you get the money.


MR. GOLDBLATT:  That -- that's right, Your


Honor, and all a creditor seeks to do in showing a debt as


nondischargeable is seeks to enforce the debtor's promise


to pay the amount of money given in that settlement.


QUESTION:  That's true, but -- but here it


was -- there was no acknowledgement of the fraud.  It was


given with the averment that this debt does not hinge upon

fraud.  This debt is just to settle this controversy


between us whether there was fraud or whether there wasn't


fraud.


MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's --


QUESTION:  Why isn't that enough to terminate


the proximity necessary for -- for nondischargeability in


bankruptcy?


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Just a couple of -- of answers. 


First, it -- it doesn't terminate the proximity any more


than the consent judgment in Brown versus Felsen might


have terminated the proximity in that case.  It's, of


course, true that a -- a consent judgment operates as a --


extinguishes the prior cause of action and the claims


merge into the consent judgment.


Nevertheless, this Court said in Brown versus 

Felsen that notwithstanding the preclusive effect of that


judgment, a creditor has the right in bankruptcy to


establish that the debt is traceable to fraud, and what it


said is --


QUESTION:  But doesn't a consent judgment


always, at -- always hinge upon the existence of a cause


of action?


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Presumably yes, Your Honor,


and --


QUESTION:  Whereas a settlement doesn't.

 MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's right, and unless the


creditor can prove in bankruptcy that the debt that's now


reflected in -- in the settlement agreement is traceable


to an act of fraud, the creditor will lose the


nondischargeability action, and the only question is


whether the creditor should have the opportunity to


establish in bankruptcy that there is, in fact, an act of


fraud that -- that is reflected in and resolved by the


consent judgment.


The consent judgment that says expressly -- it


doesn't say there's no fraud.  It says that this is a


compromise of disputed claims, and in exchange for the


release, what the creditor got was a clear carve-out from


that release for the right to enforce the $100,000 of debt


that's reflected in the promissory note. 

QUESTION:  It doesn't say there's no fraud, but


it does say that this indebtedness has nothing to do with


whether or not there was fraud.  Whether or not there was


fraud --


MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's right.  The settlement --


QUESTION:  -- this indebtedness exists.  It


seems to me it severs the connection between the fraud and


the indebtedness.


MR. GOLDBLATT:  But it is completely silent on


the question of whether fraud had occurred, just as the

consent judgment in Brown v. Felsen was completely silent


on the question whether that debt arose out of contract or


fraud.  In Brown, this Court said that the creditor has


the opportunity to look behind the fraud -- to look behind


the settlement to determine whether or not it was for


fraud, and there -- there's no difference here.


Your Honor --


QUESTION:  Would there be -- would there be a


difference if the settlement had expressly said, we


stipulate that there was no fraud leading to the creation


of the debt of -- for which this in effect is a -- a


novation?


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Justice Souter --


QUESTION:  Would that make a difference?


MR. GOLDBLATT: 


Justice Souter, that would be a 

much harder case for reasons we set out in -- in our


briefs.  We contend as a matter of bankruptcy policy there


are reasons why such an agreement shouldn't be enforced,


but that would certainly be a much more difficult case


than this one.


QUESTION:  But your argument here is we don't


really have to get to bankruptcy policy.  There simply has


not been an agreement which eliminates the fraudulent


character of the debt.  Is that basically it?


MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's -- that's exactly right,

Justice Souter.


The way this works in bankruptcy is that when


the debtor files for bankruptcy with this promissory note


outstanding for a hundred-and-some-thousand dollars, the


creditor comes into bankruptcy and files a proof of claim


saying, I have a claim of a hundred-and-some- thousand


dollars, and I'm entitled to my pro rata distribution on


that hundred-and-some-thousand dollars.  The proof of


claim is on page 82 of the joint appendix.


No one's contending that the release bars the


creditor from seeking recovery on the amount of that debt. 


The only question is whether they can receive recovery in


the full amount of the debt by showing it's


nondischargeable, or whether they're limited to simply the


cents on the dollar that the claim will pay in bankruptcy, 

because the text of the Bankruptcy Code makes clear that


the form of the debt doesn't matter, that a debt -- that


under section 523, a debt can take any number of


different -- under -- I'm sorry.


Under section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code, any


debt, the code says, is nondischargeable if it's traceable


to an act of fraud, and the code defines debt very broadly


to include debts that are liquidated, unliquidated,


reduced to judgment, et cetera.  It's quite clear the form


of the debt doesn't matter, unless --

 QUESTION:  But the traceability does, and that's


what we're talking about here, how traceable is traceable.


MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's right, Justice Scalia,


and with respect to that question there is -- there is no


difference between a consent judgment that is a final


adjudication of the claims between the parties and a


settlement agreement, both of which are equally


preclusive, and both of which are equally silent on the


question of whether fraud occurred.


Unless the Court has further questions, I'll


reserve the balance of my time.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Goldblatt.


Ms. Blatt, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


MS. BLATT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


When a creditor settles a fraud claim without


resolving the disputed issue of fraud, the creditor has


the right to enforce the settlement debt for the full


amount in bankruptcy by filing a proof of claim and by


establishing fraud in response to the defense of


dischargeability.  That conclusion is confirmed by Brown,


which held that a creditor who settles a fraud claim by

consent judgment may establish fraud in response to a


bankruptcy --


QUESTION:  But the real inquiry in Brown, as I


read it, is can we go behind a judgment to see what was


actually determined by the judgment.  It wasn't any


emphasis on the settlement aspect of it, as I read the


opinion.


MS. BLATT:  Right.


QUESTION:  And I guess the holding is, yes, you


may go behind a judgment to see what was decided, and that


seems to me a little different from going behind a


settlement.


QUESTION:  Well, didn't Brown decide two


separate issues?


MS. BLATT: 


The Court in Brown did two things. 

The Court -- the question of fraud was not litigated in


Brown because the case was settled, and the Court


mentioned in its last footnote that there would be a


different situation if the question of fraud was actually


litigated.


The question before the bankruptcy court in


Brown is whether the money owed under that consent


judgment was money obtained by fraud.  So, too, the exact


same question is relevant here.


QUESTION:  It didn't look to what the Court had

decided, but what the claim was about, but here we have


something in addition.  There is a judicial order.  There


was a complaint filed, and it was dismissed as part of the


settlement.  That complaint in the court action was


dismissed with prejudice.  What effect should that have?


MS. BLATT:  Not -- a dismissal with prejudice


following a settlement.  As this Court stated in Lawlor


versus National Screen Service, it's cited in the reply


brief at page 9, is that it has -- does not have


preclusive effect on the disputed issue unless the


judgment is accompanied by specific findings on the


disputed issue, and that's the classic requirement for


issue preclusion or collateral estoppel, that the matter


be actually litigated.


QUESTION: 


We're not talking issue preclusion, 

just -- just as far as whether it suffices to terminate


the traceability.  That -- that isn't necessarily


coextensive with -- with whether there was issue


preclusion.


MS. BLATT:  No, the -- the dismissal with


prejudice doesn't impair the creditor's right to walk into


court and sue to enforce the settlement debt, including


the right to try to get the full amount of the settlement


debt in bankruptcy, and on this issue of traceability,


it -- it is not only identical to Brown, but the code by

its express terms disclaims any distinction between a


liquidated debt and an unliquidated debt.  The settlement


in Brown and the settlement here converts an unliquidated


fraud claim into a liquidated claim to collect on the


settlement debt.


QUESTION:  May I -- would you just clear up one


thing for me?  Say the fraud claim was for $300,000 and


the contract was -- the novation was $200,000, in the


bankruptcy court do you contend they can get the full 300


or just the 200?


MS. BLATT:  No.  Under -- under -- he would


be -- the -- the creditor would be bound by the settlement


agreement under principles of State law that the amount of


his debt would only be the $200,000.


QUESTION: 


It seems like a strange result, 

doesn't it?


QUESTION:  I don't understand that.


QUESTION:  Why shouldn't he get the full amount?


QUESTION:  You conduct this big inquiry and find


out that the guy's been defrauded of $300, and then that


the settlement agreement really covers up a fraud and you


say, Well, but you know, a deal's a deal.  Even though you


defrauded him of it and the whole thing's traceable to


fraud, we're only going to give you $200,000.  That's very


strange.

 MS. BLATT:  I'm sorry, are you talking about the


settlement agreement itself was procured by fraud?


QUESTION:  No, no, no, no.  No, the settlement


agreement was just an arm's-length agreement, but if you


find that, in fact, the debt underlying that -- that


agreement was fraudulently obtained, having gone through


all the trouble of determining that fact, why don't you


make the guy cough up all the money that he got by fraud?


MS. BLATT:  The Court -- the Court addressed


this very issue in Brown.  The creditor there did not get


a fraud judgment for exemplary damages and special --


special damages under State law.  He was limited to, in


bankruptcy, of just seeking this settlement debt, and what


the bankruptcy code does is, it gives the creditor a


statutory right to render that settlement debt 

nondischargeable if fraud can be -- can be shown.


You don't -- and there's another way of looking


at it, too.  The Court --


QUESTION:  But -- but what's the policy reason


behind that.  I mean, if -- if what we're concerned about


is vindicating the Federal policy that the -- the


Bankruptcy Code protects only honest debtors and not


dishonest debtors, why not give them the whole $300,000? 


I mean, I -- I know Brown didn't do that, but why didn't


it do that?

 MS. BLATT:  The Court in Grogan -- it's because


of two issues, Justice Kennedy.  Under State -- State law


determines the amount of the debt that is owed, and


there's just no question, at least I don't think that the


creditor could make an argument that he's owed any more


than $300,000.  He can't relitigate and try to get up to


$600,000.  That's just governed by State law.


QUESTION:  Well, the Fourth Circuit -- the


Fourth Circuit says State law says that this is a


novation, too, so -- and you're -- you don't want us to be


bound by that interpretation of State law.


MS. BLATT:  The -- again, this Court in Grogan


versus Carter said that State law determines the amount of


the debt, and I just don't think the creditor would have a


good faith argument that he could go beyond the settlement 

agreement, but on the question of nondischargeability,


what the creditor is trying to do is collect the entire


amount of the debt by -- by showing fraud, and we think


applying Brown --


QUESTION:  What their main argument, I think, on


the other side is, you get a debt, that's what it is, a


debt for money obtained by fraud, and this is not a debt


for money obtained by fraud, this is a debt for money owed


under a settlement agreement.


Now, the virtue of that is, it's a bright line,

and what we're saying, I think, in the negative -- the


negative of it is that if you depart from that, well


there's no end to it.  You have a settlement agreement,


and no matter how long you go into the future, whatever it


is, that -- whatever it says you're supposed to do in that


settlement agreement, it is.  Use the words proximate


cause, use whatever they want, but it is a debt.  Where it


comes from is the fraud.


That's where the source of the debt is, no


matter what it says in that settlement agreement, and


there's just no stopping place, no way to look into it, no


attenuation forever, et cetera, so that's what I'd like


you to here address.


MS. BLATT:  Well, this Court already crossed


that bridge in Brown.


QUESTION:  Well, all right, so then maybe Brown


was wrong.


MS. BLATT:  But the second point is that --


QUESTION:  Maybe it was wrong.


MS. BLATT:  Whatever the limits of the


traceability point, which this Court addressed in a


separate decision, Cohen versus de la Cruz, which dealt


with the traceability aspects --


QUESTION:  There is no traceability.  There's


never a problem.  Underlying this was the fraud.  Whatever

it says in that settlement agreement is based on fraud.


MS. BLATT:  The code itself says that any


enforceable obligation, whether or not it's liquidated or


unliquidated or appears in a judgment, if you can prove


that there has been a fraudulent acquisition of money, the


resulting debt is nondischargeable, and that is --


QUESTION:  Ms. Blatt, what is your -- what is


the Government's position if the parties had expressly


dealt with it in the settlement agreement?


MS. BLATT:  We think the right would be subject


to waiver.  We don't think -- we don't see anything in the


code that would be --


QUESTION:  So you don't agree with petitioner's


counsel that it's a harder case, but wouldn't give it up?


MS. BLATT: 


We think the right can be waived. 

What we do think, though --


QUESTION:  All right, now, the language in this


particular settlement agreement gave up claims arising out


of or relating to the matter of the State court


litigation.  Was that not a waiver of this claim?


MS. BLATT:  No, it certainly wasn't a waiver of


the right to collect on the debt, and in fact there's an


express preservation of not only the right to collect all


the obligations under the promissory note, but to collect


the amounts under the settlement agreement, and we think

to apply a contrary rule, the rule that the court below


applied, would be unsound for three reasons.


It would force creditors and parties trying to


settle a case to start negotiating over bankruptcy


contingencies that are purely hypothetical, may never


happen, and are entirely extraneous to the settlement. 


The rule adopted by Brown also, our second point, is that


it reflects the common sense and ordinary understanding


that settlements preserve the creditor's right to enforce


the settlement agreement and the statutory right to prove


fraud to render the debt enforceable, notwithstanding


bankruptcy, and that has been the premise of hundreds, if


not thousands of settlement agreements entered into by the


Government that do not refer to bankruptcy contingencies.


Third, to hold that those settlement agreements 

waive the creditor's rights in bankruptcy would render


debts dischargeable even where the debtor committed fraud,


and that result would undermine congressional policy to


favor the rights of innocent victims of fraud over the


perpetrators of fraud.


QUESTION:  But you do agree that some fraud


claims could be waived as far as the dischargeability,


because you wrote the rights settlement agreement.


MS. BLATT:  Yes, if there was an affirmative


manifestation of an intent.

 QUESTION:  Why isn't that inconsistent with the


statutory policy, just as this case would be?


MS. BLATT:  Because there is a background


presumption, Justice Stevens, that rights are subject to


waiver, and so if there's an intentional relinquishment of


a Federal statutory right, then a court can give that


effect, but not only is there silence on that issue in


this case, there is an express reservation of the right to


enforce the settlement agreement, and --


QUESTION:  To enforce the settlement agreement.


MS. BLATT:  Yes, and that includes --


QUESTION:  But that's not a reservation of the


right to sue for fraud.


MS. BLATT:  They're not suing for fraud. 


They're suing to collect on the settlement agreement for 

the full amount in bankruptcy.  By asking the bankruptcy


court, not only by filing the proof of claim, but to


render the debt survivable and enforceable in bankruptcy. 


It's no different than the settlement judgment in -- in


Brown.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Blatt.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. AYER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:


I would like to make four points this morning. 


The first one, to pick up on what Justice O'Connor said, I


think there's a fundamental misconception in the question


as it's presented and as it was described by Mr. Goldblatt


this morning, and this conception is that what we're


dealing with here is a categorical rule that says that


whenever you have a settlement, because it's a contract,


it bars any further pursuit of a nondischarge claim.


That is completely inconsistent with the


holdings of the court below, all of which looked


specifically at the language of the release and concluded


that what had specifically been released was the right to


pursue the claim under 523.


Second --


QUESTION:  This would have been a release in


State court proceedings?


MR. AYER:  Correct, Your Honor, and -- and that


leads to the second point, which is that what is at issue


here really is the interpretation of the language, the


specific language --


QUESTION:  There's no language about 523, which


you just said --


MR. AYER:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION: 

-- this is a standard settlement.

It's a compromise.  Neither side is admitting anything. 


One side is not admitting fraud, and the other side isn't


saying we've proved fraud.  It's just a zero on there.


MR. AYER:  Well, Your Honor, I think what you


said in terms of the language is certainly correct. 


I think the important issue is that this is a settlement


and, indeed, there is also a -- a voluntary dismissal with


prejudice in a State court case.  I would submit the


proper analysis of that is to interpret the settlement


under State law and then ask the question, is there some


problem with Federal bankruptcy law that requires you to


somehow override what's been agreed to or what's been done


in State court.


QUESTION:  But isn't -- isn't the problem with


approaching it that way -- I -- at least, I think the 

problem with approaching it that way is that there is no


State law analog to the issue that is being raised here. 


In other words, under -- under State law, there was a


fraud claim, there was a settlement of the fraud claim,


but there is no issue under State law about bankruptcy,


and that is strictly a -- a Federal policy --


MR. AYER:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- and I don't know how we get --


we -- we look to State law to find out whether there is


doubt or not, but I don't know why State law should be a

source of an answer to this Federal question, which is


peculiarly Federal.


MR. AYER:  Well, I -- I don't think, Your Honor,


that it is the final answer, but it seems to me it's


entirely possible for parties in a State court proceeding


to enter into a settlement that says, and we hereby


specifically release our 523 claim, and had that been --


QUESTION:  They -- they might be able to -- I


mean, I'll assume for the sake of argument that they might


be able to do that, but in -- in that case, the -- the


issue here would be resolved, on -- on your theory,


certainly, by the express agreement with the parties, and


they didn't do that, so we've got a case in which they


didn't agree on the issue expressly, and I don't see why


State law, which doesn't have the issue, is a good place 

to look for the answer.


MR. AYER:  Well, I think -- I guess my point,


Your Honor, is that the question of whether they expressly


agreed to it becomes a question of interpretation, and I


would like to get to arguing that they did, in fact,


expressly agree to it.  The first --


QUESTION:  Well, didn't Brown versus Felsen


suggest some discouragement to the idea of anticipatory


litigation in State courts of issues that would arise in


bankruptcy court?

 MR. AYER:  I -- I think Brown versus Felsen


certainly expressed the view that they didn't want to


encourage people to have to affirmatively determine fraud


in State court when it had been, in fact, been -- been --


the issue of nondischargeability had been put into the


bankruptcy court, but nothing in Brown versus Felsen in


any way qualifies the proposition that parties can, in a


State court proceeding, resolve, for example, by trial an


issue of fraud that would be preclusive under collateral


estoppel.


QUESTION:  You say it doesn't qualify the


proposition.  It doesn't address the proposition.


MR. AYER:  Correct.


QUESTION:  Suppose --


MR. AYER: 


But it does, Your Honor, address it 

in the sense, and then Grogan confirms that collateral


estoppel does apply, so that if you have a State


proceeding --


QUESTION:  There's -- there's no collateral


estoppel here.  That argument absolutely dumbfounded me,


frankly, because for collateral estoppel, issue


preclusion, you must have raised, actually litigated,


there must be a court determination of the issue, and that


determination must be essential to the judgment.  You


don't have any actual litigation here, so I don't know how

you can --


MR. AYER:  Your Honor, under this Court's


Matsushita decision, it is perfectly clear that in order


to determine whether there's issue preclusion, you have to


look at the State law in the State where the judgment is


entered, and -- and the State law, as we indicate in our


brief, in North Carolina is that if you have a voluntary


dismissal with prejudice under the Miller Building case,


under the Barnes case, that voluntary dismissal with


prejudice resolves the issues that were put in issue --


QUESTION:  The only decision that you cite from


the North Carolina Supreme Court says, we go down the line


with what is the standard understanding of issue


preclusion, actually litigated, decided, and essential to


the judgment.


MR. AYER:  Your Honor, I --


QUESTION:  That's what the North Carolina


Supreme Court said.


MR. AYER:  I disagree, Your Honor.  The -- the


Thomas McInnis case that you're referring to is a case


where what actually happened with regard to the issue of


whether prejudgment interest was available was that a


husband, in litigating that issue, in fact, failed to


timely raise it, and when he failed to timely raise it,


the wife was subsequently collaterally estopped from

pursuing it.


There's one sentence in the Thomas McInnis case


that says, we apply the usual principles of collateral


estoppel.  There are multiple cases, Your Honor, in North


Carolina that are entirely clear that the rule is that if


you have a voluntary dismissal with prejudice, that


voluntary dismissal is determinative as though the matter,


and this of -- almost a quote, as though --


QUESTION:  Well, that would certainly run


entirely against the stream, and it would run against the


Restatement of Judgments, which you cite, and that says


you must manifest -- yes, parties can make a stipulation


finding.  They can do it in a consent judgment just as


they can in the settlement, but they have to make that


manifest.


MR. AYER:  Right.


QUESTION:  The court does not infer that an


issue that was never litigated was, in fact, decided.


MR. AYER:  I guess what -- what I would like to


suggest to -- to the Court is that what we do have here is


a settlement of a State court litigation followed by a


voluntary dismissal with prejudice, that the effect of


that, of those acts, including the language, because


that's what the courts here -- all three of these courts


focus specifically on the precise language, and they

concluded that that language was a waiver.  I would submit


that was --


QUESTION:  Well, if they concluded that it's a


waiver of claim, and we don't have any -- I presume no one


has a problem with that.  The question is whether there


is -- is a waiver on the disputed fact issue, and -- and


my -- my question to you is, you -- you refer to the


myriad State law cases that hold in your favor.  Is it


clear that those are cases on issue preclusion --


MR. AYER:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  -- as opposed to claim preclusion --


MR. AYER:  Yes, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  -- or res judicata?


MR. AYER:  The -- the Miller Building case and


the Barnes case, both of those cases involved collateral 

estoppel.  It was invoked by a new party, and it was


clearly based upon the fact that the -- that the matter


had been -- in one case, it was a voluntary stipulation


with prejudice.  The other was a voluntary --


QUESTION:  Well, was it a stipulation that --


that expressly addressed the -- the fact issue?


MR. AYER:  I don't believe you can tell from the


opinion, and that's not, certainly, what they rely on. 


The principle that is stated in those cases in a -- in a


categorical way, and I can -- I can read it to the Court,

is that -- let's see.


QUESTION:  May I read you the language from


McInnis, which is the North Carolina Supreme Court?  It


was not just simply a statement that, we recognize issue


preclusion in its traditional guise.  It was, issue


preclusion does not apply unless, quote, the prior suit


resulted in a judgment on the merits, identical issues are


involved, the issue was actually litigated, the issue was


actually determined.


Now, you're asking us to reject that as the law


of the -- North Carolina.


MR. AYER:  Well, I -- I think, Your Honor, there


are -- there are many Federal court cases that recognize


that a matter which is not actually litigated in the sense


that it went to trial and was determined after a trial or 

a fact-finding.  If the parties intend for a settlement


agreement to be preclusive, and that is incorporated into


a judgment, that will have collateral estoppel effect, and


that's what happened --


QUESTION:  Well, are you relying on -- I thought


you were relying on North Carolina law.


MR. AYER:  We are.  I'm simply trying to point


out that the notion that there is some sweeping,


overarching general law that says it always must be


actually litigated, that that, in fact, is not correct.

 QUESTION:  No, I -- no, no, we made it plain,


and I don't think there's any question here that the


parties can stipulate, and the stipulation will have --


will have the same effect as a finding, but, as the


Restatement of Judgments points out, that must be made


manifest.  You don't imply it from words that don't say,


and we stipulate that this claim is going to be


dischargeable in bankruptcy.


MR. AYER:  Well, what -- let me suggest to the


Court a -- a way in which this was clear.  First of all,


I -- I do really want to emphasize that -- that all three


of the opinions of the court below, none of them adopt


this sort of categorical, it's a contract, therefore the


right is waived approach.  That is not the issue in any of


these cases. 


They all look at the specific language, and 

they reason to the conclusion.


The -- the court of appeals, for example,


specifically said that, quote, a --


QUESTION:  Where are you quoting from, Mr. Ayer? 


What page?


MR. AYER:  Let's see, here.  Page 10a of the --


of the appendix.


QUESTION:  Thank you.


MR. AYER:  The petition appendix.


They said, in invoking the novation concept,

it's necessary --


QUESTION:  Whereabouts on the page are you?


MR. AYER:  It's actually -- I'm sorry, Your


Honor, it's -- it's 9a.  If you look at the end of the


first paragraph, under the novation theory, courts need


only address -- wait a minute.  I'm sorry, the top of the


page on 9a.  When following the novation theory, the terms


of the settlement should be examined to determine whether


the nondischargeability claims were released.


The rest of that page is an examination of the


terms, and if you look over onto the next page, 10a, they


quote the West case, which says, a promissory note does


not discharge the underlying obligation unless the parties


expressly release and substitute the new.  That is what


these cases are all about, all three of them, and the 

question of whether the settlement released the claim is a


question, I would submit, in the first instance -- not in


the last instance, but in the first instance, it's a


question of State law, and --


QUESTION:  I think there's no dispute that the


settlement released the claim.  There's no dispute that


there was a novation here.  There's no dispute that they


no longer have the original fraud claim.  They have a


claim only on the promissory note that they got as a


result of the settlement, so it -- they're -- they're not

claiming, oh, we can go back to the day we filed our fraud


complaint.  They're saying, we have a debt here, a


promissory note, and that is the sum total of what we can


claim.


MR. AYER:  Right, but Your Honor, the -- the


holding of all the courts below went beyond what Your


Honor is saying.


QUESTION:  The words that you read --


MR. AYER:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- are simply supportive of that --


MR. AYER:  -- let me -- let me --


QUESTION:  -- but you can't -- you can't get


anything more than the amount of the promissory note that


results from the settlement.


MR. AYER: 


Well, let me refer the Court, for 

example, to 35a of the petition appendix, where it is


stated that, quote, by including in the release future


claims --


QUESTION:  What -- what is this from, this is


the opinion of the bankruptcy court?


MR. AYER:  This is the opinion of the bankruptcy


court.  I'm just trying to -- this was the consistent


analysis in all of these courts.  By including in the


release future claims, the court concludes that the


plaintiffs effectively released and extinguished the

dischargeability claim which they now seek to assert.


QUESTION:  Well, that's a new, different issue


than we granted, isn't it?  I mean, that's -- the


question, I take it, is, we're assuming there is a


novation, there is a settlement, and fine, and that


settlement says, I promise to pay $200,000, so it's a


debt.  It's a debt for money, and the question is, is it a


debt for money obtained by actual fraud?


MR. AYER:  Well --


QUESTION:  If so, how do we characterize that


debt?


MR. AYER:  I --


QUESTION:  You're saying it was, but it was


released.  I -- I don't see that we reach that.


MR. AYER: 


Well, whether -- whether this is a 

different issue than you granted, I guess -- I -- I agree


that the question as it was presented in the petition --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. AYER:  -- is most easily read as this broad,


blanket rule.  That is not --


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I would assume that the


text and the wording here that you're relying on, and the


rule of the State about a novation and so forth, are --


are prevalent, not universal, but are -- are the standard


form of -- of settlement and release in almost every

State, and apparently the novation rule is standard as


well, so the -- the result that you're asking us to reach


is that this also forecloses any Federal characterization


of this as being a debt incurred by fraud, and -- and


that's a very sweeping statement, and a very sweeping


rule.


MR. AYER:  Well, I -- I think -- I think there


is -- I think the ultimate question, and the last question


and the fourth question I'm hoping to get to, and I will


get to now, is the question of, if -- if you agree with me


for purposes of argument that initially, you look to see


what the State settlement does and, indeed, here also what


the effect under State law of the voluntary discharge with


prejudice is -- voluntary dismissal with prejudice is,


and -- and you see, as these courts below held, that the 

effect is, in fact, to give up the right, then the


question is, is there something about Federal bankruptcy


law or policy that prevents parties from voluntarily


agreeing to do that?


QUESTION:  May I go back just one step?  Suppose


this settlement had been entered as a consent judgment,


just as was the case in Brown against Felsen, what then?


MR. AYER:  I think it would depend, Your Honor,


what was in the consent judgment.


QUESTION:  Nothing.  The Court just enters --

there's -- the parties' settlement is incorporated in the


consent judgment.


MR. AYER:  I -- I think it would become a


question of whether, under the laws of the place where the


consent judgment is entered, the fact that there's a


settlement that is somehow appended to that order, if it's


appended, whether that becomes limiting or defining of the


terms of what's agreed to.


If all you have -- I would agree with this.  If


all you have --


QUESTION:  Wasn't -- in -- in Brown against


Felsen, there wasn't -- the settlement was not on the


record?


MR. AYER:  There's -- there's no discussion,


Your Honor. 


In fact, what's pretty clear in Brown versus 

Felsen, and the critical difference between Brown and this


case is that there was no -- there was no kind of any


release of a fraud claim.  You simply had the settlement,


and the -- the creditor got paid, and -- and nobody had


yet proven affirmatively that there was fraud.


What this Court said is, on those facts, you get


to come in and prove fraud.


QUESTION:  Okay, so you're -- you're then


conceding the following, is that right, that if, in fact,


I owe you $300,000 because I cheated you by fraud, we then

enter into a settlement which might be approved by the


court, assume it is, and what that settlement says is, in


light of what you claim I did to you, cheat you through


fraud, I promise to pay $200,000, and you are conceding if


that's all there is to the case, that that is


nondischargeable?


MR. AYER:  I -- I am at least conceding that


there's no waiver of the right to argue --


QUESTION:  Well, I want to know on my -- the


facts I just gave you --


MR. AYER:  Well, it -- it --


QUESTION:  -- in your opinion --


MR. AYER:  Your --


QUESTION:  -- is that 200,000 debt


nondischargeable?


MR. AYER:  If it amounts to a clear concession


that there was fraud, yes.


QUESTION:  No.  What I'm saying is, you have the


facts I gave you.


MR. AYER:  Okay.


QUESTION:  Remember what they were.


MR. AYER:  In consideration of --


QUESTION:  You said it was $300,000 obtained by


fraud.  I said, I will settle that by entering into this


piece of paper which says, I promise to pay 200.

proving fraud, although you would --

negatives in your statement.

yes or no?

(Laughter.)


MR. AYER:  It is not clear from the hypothetical


that it is nondischargeable, but it is certainly not --


you have the opportunity to come into bankruptcy court and


prove fraud.  Your -- your hypothetical does not establish


fraud.


QUESTION:  Oh, okay, but you're saying you have


an opportunity --


MR. AYER:  Yes.

MR. AYER:  In the respect --

MR. AYER:  In the respect that our case included


language which was interpreted by all three of these


courts as a release -- under State law as a release of the


right to go to bankruptcy court and pursue --


QUESTION:  Fine, and the reason that's in the


question presented is?


QUESTION:  Yes, it isn't in the question


presented, that's what I thought.


MR. AYER:  The reason it's in the question


presented is because it's --it is the holding of the case 

below.


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. AYER:  The case below doesn't --


QUESTION:  -- the -- the question presented,


Mr. Ayer, is whether a debt that would otherwise be


nondischargeable becomes dischargeable if the parties


enter a settlement agreement under which the amount of the


debt is -- it literally doesn't say anything about fraud


or collateral estoppel.


MR. AYER:  That's correct, Your Honor.  I guess

what I would say is that that question is --


QUESTION:  You're answering the question.  You


just want to answer it, maybe, right?


MR. AYER:  Well, that's right.  The answer is


maybe, and it depends --


QUESTION:  Sometimes yes, sometimes no.


MR. AYER:  -- and what it depends upon is, has


there been a basis on which to conclude that that right


has been given up, and the answer is that no such basis


arises simply because there's a settlement contract.  We


do not claim that, and neither did any of the courts


below.  There -- there's nobody here in this courtroom or


in this case who says, that's the rule of law.  That you


can say it's not the rule of law and everybody will agree


with you, but that's not the issue in the case. 

QUESTION:  Okay, taking your terms, everybody, I


guess, agrees that if the settlement agreement said, we


agree, the two parties, that there was no fraud involved


in the creation of the debt which this agreement settles,


that that would, in fact, be preclusive, that they could


not, in fact, prove fraud and -- and nondischargeability. 


Why is the settlement here like the settlement I just


described, because that, as I understand it, is your


argument.  There's no legal difference between the


settlement we've got here, which says nothing about fraud,

and the settlement that I described in which fraud is


expressly addressed.  Why are the two alike?


MR. AYER:  Well, one reason why, and this --


this gets back to my point that I think you have to take a


State court settlement under State law first to understand


it, this -- this settlement, among the other language of


releases which we've talked about, also includes language


that commits to filing a voluntary dismissal with


prejudice.


Now, as I've indicated, in order --


QUESTION:  Well, isn't -- isn't that what any


neither party settlement does?


MR. AYER:  Well, it may or may not, Your Honor,


but in this case in North Carolina, under North Carolina


law, under Miller Building and Barnes, when you file a 

voluntary dismissal with prejudice, it is as though the


matter were litigated to a conclusion and the plaintiff


lost, and --


QUESTION:  I thought that --


QUESTION:  So far as --


QUESTION:  I thought that was true, certainly


true as far as claim preclusion goes.


MR. AYER:  Right.  It's --


QUESTION:  It's claim-precluded, but you


constantly mixed up --

QUESTION:  -- claim preclusion and issue


preclusion --


MR. AYER:  Well, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  -- and yes, a voluntary dismissal


with prejudice is preclusive of that claim.  You can never


bring that claim again, but it resolves no issues.


MR. AYER:  Well, Your -- Your Honor, that --


that is the law in many places.  That is not the law in


North Carolina, and I simply -- I know this Court doesn't


spend its time deciding State law issues, but --


QUESTION:  I haven't seen a single North


Carolina Supreme Court decision that so holds, that a


voluntary -- I thought that North Carolina rules, by the


way, were based on the Federal rules with respect to the 

voluntary dismissal rule.  Isn't that so?


MR. AYER:  I -- I think the rules are somewhat


similar.  I've not studied them to know how precisely


parallel they are.


QUESTION:  And -- and the voluntary dismissal is


claim-preclusive but not issue-preclusive?


MR. AYER:  Well, let me -- let me just quote,


because I -- I've found it -- the language in Miller


Building and Barnes is that a voluntary dismissal with


prejudice, quote, precludes subsequent litigation to the

same extent as if the action had been prosecuted to a


final adjudication adverse to the plaintiff.


QUESTION:  All right, Mr. Ayer, let's assume


that that particular reason isn't necessarily going to


persuade all of us here.  Do you have another reason to


say that the agreement, the settlement here should be


treated in law by this Court under the Bankruptcy Code


just like a settlement that expressly says there wasn't


any fraud?  Do you have any other reason?


MR. AYER:  I think the language of the release


is quite clear.  The language of the release talks about


releasing any and all rights, including future rights.


QUESTION:  Well, but it's a question of Federal


law as to whether that includes a nondischargeability


claim. 


I mean, that's what we're here to talk about, and 

I think that's --


MR. AYER:  Well, let me --


QUESTION:  -- that's going to be the same in


every State, which is what I've asked.  The very first


question we asked, or I asked, was whether or not this was


a rule depends on the -- the vagaries of the law of North


Carolina or not.


MR. AYER:  Well -- and let me suggest, Your


Honor, that -- that in order --


QUESTION:  And I would -- I would have to agree

with what Justice -- Justice Ginsburg seems to be


indicating, that this -- that what you're saying is that


there's issue preclusion as to an issue that's never been


litigated.


MR. AYER:  Well, and the parties --


QUESTION:  That's astounding.


MR. AYER:  But I think we know under Arizona v.


California and other decisions that parties can do that if


they in -- if they indicate an intention to do it, and the


question is, have they done that here.


Let me --


QUESTION:  Can I ask -- this -- this puzzles me. 


Is it, indeed, a question of Federal law whether a


contract which -- which gives up all future rights in


connection with this claim includes -- whether -- whether 

the contract includes the right to claim


nondischargeability?


MR. AYER:  No, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Is -- is that a Federal question or a


State question?


MR. AYER:  I think -- I believe it's not, and I


really feel --


QUESTION:  What do you -- you think it's a


question of State law?


MR. AYER:  I believe it's a question of State

law.


QUESTION:  It's a question of Federal law what


the consequence --


MR. AYER:  Correct.


QUESTION:  -- of that State contract is.


MR. AYER:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. AYER:  And let me address, if I could, what


I view as the logical way to think about this.  Once you


have a State contract that is given meaning under State


law, the question is, is that somehow to be modified or


overridden in light of Federal bankruptcy policy, and what


we have here, on the other side, I think, are two


different views.


We have one view of the petitioners that it can 

never be done, there's no way, bankruptcy policy won't


allow it, and the other view of the Government is that,


well, you can do it if it's clear enough, and then you get


into nice questions of what, I guess, our Federal common


law --


QUESTION:  Your view, Mr. Ayer, would simply


encourage anticipatory litigation of issues that might


arise in bankruptcy, which I think Brown suggests is not a


good idea.


MR. AYER:  Your Honor, I think all -- all our

approach does is allow parties to enter into settlements


to be given what effect they have.


QUESTION:  Well, but, I -- I think here, too,


probably there's general agreement.  If in so many words


you say in the State court settlement, I waive my right to


claim nondischargeability in bankruptcy, probably


everybody would say, or a majority would say yes, but you


don't have that here.


MR. AYER:  Well, what it -- I mean, I guess the


next question would be, what else might be adequate, and


do you really want to develop a -- a body of Federal law. 


Let me, if I could, just point to the arguments on the


other side why this should be treated as essentially a


Federal override of State law interpretive principles is


based first upon citation of a number of express 

provisions of the Bankruptcy Code which have nothing to do


with the subject and, I think, prove the opposite point.


There's a whole section on debtor reaffirmations


which set up detailed procedures that the bankruptcy court


enforces to make sure that debtors don't get taken


advantage of, and they are specific, and they're clear,


and the bankruptcy court follows them.  That's an occasion


for the bankruptcy court to get involved.


There's the idea that the automatic stay cannot


be voluntarily given up.  Again, that's the product of

specific language that creates an automatic stay to


protect the debtor and has 18 itemized exceptions,


specific language.  There -- they invoke the preference


provisions which let, of course, the bankruptcy court go


back into transactions that occur prior to bankruptcy, and


look at them on very specific terms set forth in section


547.  They talk about the fraudulent conveyance section


does the same thing in a slightly different way, but there


are no such provisions whatsoever with regard to waivers


of section 523 claims.  Section 523 claims are something


that the creditor loses if he does not affirmatively file


within 60 days of the first meeting of creditors.  There


are no protections with regard to that in the code, and


if -- if something isn't filed, they disappear.


Indeed, the whole idea that creditors are --

that -- that the issues with regard to nondischargeability


under (a)(2), (a)(4), (a)(6), and (a)(15), are made a


matter of exclusive Federal jurisdiction, the reason for


that, and your case and Brown talk specifically about


that, was because creditors were abusing the process by


pursuing them.  This is not a protection for creditors. 


This is a -- a way of making sure creditors don't come in


after bankruptcy and basically put the screws to -- to


debtors who have gotten a discharge.


What language there is -- and we talk about this

in both the briefs, I think specific language runs counter


to this.  We talked in the briefs about (a)(11) and


(a)(19), which specifically mention settlements, and I


would submit the better interpretation of that language is


to say, in those instances where the language specifically


says that any settlement may give rise to a


nondischargeable claim, is to allow the bankruptcy court


to go back in and look at those facts even if the right to


a nondischarge -- right to pursue nondischarge was given


away.


I think the bottom line is that the arguments on


the other side relate to a series -- they don't relate to


any language of the code, other than the much overbroad


idea that it -- that it's any debt, and of course that


doesn't mean that a party can't be foreclosed from 

litigating the 523 claim because he's already lost it in


State court, so any doesn't mean absolutely every.


The policies that are invoked are, first, the


honest but unfortunate debtor policy, but nobody here,


I think, seriously suggests that a party can't give the


thing away, give the right away if they want to, and so


I think -- give the right to pursue the 523 action away by


clear enough language.  That seems to be the -- the


petitioner I think disagrees with me, but other than that,


I think the better view is that they can, and I don't

think this Court in any of its cases has ever suggested 


that the honest but unfortunate debtor policy forecloses


relying on prior resolutions under State law.  Collateral


estoppel certainly applies, and we think settlement


language that's clear ought to apply.


They claim that allowing this is some sort of a


trap for the unwary.  It would be a trap if the rule were


this categorical rule that says, boy, you enter into a


settlement contract, you lose your 523 claim.  That's not


the issue in the case.  The issue is, does the language


here support the -- the idea that the -- the right to


pursue the 523 claim has been given up, and to hold


parties to the State law effect of releases that they sign


is no trap for the unwary.  That's how we do litigation in


this country every day.


QUESTION:  Mr. Ayer, may I ask you this


question:  You started out telling us you were going to


make four points.  I know what one, two, and four are, but


I'm just curious as to what three was.


MR. AYER:  Three was the State law point.  I --


I guess -- three was the point that when you look at State


law here, the reading of -- the fair reading of State law


does, indeed, support the State law rulings of all three


of the courts below, and point four, of course, is that


there's no reason in Federal law to go back and say no, we

have to second-guess that.


QUESTION:  I -- I suppose after this case, no


matter which way it goes, you can have an Archer clause


in -- in the settlement agreement.  I -- I've never seen a


settlement agreement in which the parties agree that it's


going to be nondischargeable.  As a matter of common


course, do these clauses appear in contracts, or --


MR. AYER:  I'm not aware of it, Your Honor. 


They certainly can if they want to.


QUESTION:  I know they can.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Ayer.


MR. AYER:  Thank you, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Mr. Goldblatt, you have 4 minutes


remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG GOLDBLATT 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Okay.  Thank you.  I only have


four points.  First, with respect to the State law


question of preclusion, we say in our reply brief on pages


7 and 8 that that issue had been waived.  I don't want to


belabor that point, but I -- I will point out that the


brief respondent filed in the court of appeals, which


is -- which is, of course, in the record here, states


State law correctly.  There, on page 29 in the court of


appeals respondent said, there is no issue of collateral

estoppel in this case because there have never been any


evidentiary findings.


We submit that's a correct statement of State


law.  None of the North Carolina cases cited by respondent


involved a case in which a settlement agreement is given


preclusive effect.


Second, with respect to the language of this


particular release, it would certainly present a harder


case if you had a situation which the release said, we


give up all of our rights in bankruptcy, and in the event


you file for bankruptcy, we will not make any effort to


collect on the debt.  This release is quite far from that,


and expressly preserves the right at all points to recover


on the amount that was promised in the promissory note,


and this Court's opinion in Brown makes clear as a matter 

of Federal law that what a nondischargeability action is


is simply an action to enforce the obligations that were


promised as part of the settlement.


Finally, the question of the form of the debt,


and whether the form of the debt drove the decision below,


there -- the court of appeals certainly does say -- and


this is in the joint appendix at page 8 -- I'm sorry,


page 9a, footnote 8.  It explains quite clearly that a


basis for its decision is the notion that the creditor was


substituting the tort claim, the fraud claim for a


55

contract claim and rests its decision on that basis.


The consequence of that decision would be that


from the creditor's perspective, if a creditor has an


unliquidated claim, and this applies not only to claims


for fraud but, say, an injury caused by drunk-driving, any


of the categories of nondischargeability, if you have an


unliquidated claim and they file for bankruptcy, you can


contend its nondischargeable.


If, on the other hand, you've litigated all the


way to judgment, under Brown you can say in bankruptcy,


even if the judgment doesn't say what it's for, that


that's nondischargeable.  It would create an anomalous


situation in which the middle category, cases that are


resolved in settlement agreements that don't resolve the


question of liability, the rights in bankruptcy to show 

nondischargeability is given up, and because the code


makes clear that the form of the debt is irrelevant to


persons of dischargeability, and because this Court's


decision in Brown versus Felsen is essentially


indistinguishable from this case, we submit the decision


below should be reversed.


QUESTION:  It's rather unfortunate,


Mr. Goldblatt, that there's nobody in the room to defend


the position that I understood was taken by the question


presented, namely that a novation -- a novation is all you


56 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

need.  I think that's, at least, an arguable position,


but -- but nobody -- nobody seems to want to --


MR. GOLDBLATT:  We agree that -- that --


QUESTION:  -- discuss the issue on -- on which


we took the case.


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Your Honor, we -- we agree, as


we say in our reply brief, that the principal basis of the


decision below has been abandoned by respondent here, and


we believe it's been abandoned because it can't be squared


with this Court's decision in Brown versus Felsen, which


holds squarely to the contrary.


QUESTION:  Thank --


QUESTION:  What about the (a)(11) and (a) -- the


19, the express provisions for nondischargeability?


MR. GOLDBLATT: 


Your Honor, what Congress was 

doing in -- in sections (a)(11) -- I -- I see my time


has -- has run out, but what Congress was doing in (a)(11)


and (a)(19) was giving preclusive effect --


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you,


Mr. Goldblatt.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
