 Mr. Goldstein. 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, thank you 

 Today's undercard is an immigration case. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

1
2
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 
3
4  first this morning in Case 11-702, Moncrieffe v. Holder.
5
6
7
8
9  very much.  May it please the Court:
10
11  Adrian Moncrieffe was convicted of possession with 
12  intent to distribute marijuana, under Georgia law, the 
13  question in the case is whether he was thereby convicted 
14  of a controlled substances offense, which is a 
15
16  illicit trafficking in drugs, which would mean that the 
17  Attorney General has no discretion to cancel his 
18  removal. 
19
20
21  a Federal felony, but it's also undisputed that the 
22  Georgia statute regularly involves prosecutions that 
23  would be Federal misdemeanors.  So --
24
25

 Now, everyone agrees that, under the Georgia 
statute, there is going to be some conduct that would be 

deportable offense, but also an aggravated felony of 

word, "regularly."  Do you have statistics on that? 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me.  You use that 

3
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  They were not.  We do not --

prosecutions of marijuana cases in the United States. 

 In the State system, the most recent 

750,000 prosecutions in the States for marijuana 
offenses. 

1  Were they provided in the briefs? 
2
3  we attempted very hard to collect them.  This is the 
4  information I can give you about Federal and State 
5
6
7  available data -- it was published by the Department of 
8  Justice in 2006, but we have no reason to believe that 
9  it's changed materially -- in 2006, there were roughly 
10
11 
12
 By contrast, in the Federal system, we have 
13  data from 2010.  And we have two different kinds of data 
14  here that's a little bit more granular, and that is, for 
15
16  provision, there were 6,200 cases. 
17
18  the provision we say you ought to look at here -- and 
19  844 -- which is the possession provision -- combined, 
20
21
22  there is a massive amount of activity in the States 
23  doing things that show that this -- and this case is 
24  perfectly commonplace, we think.  It's consistent with 
the other cases that we've seen published by the BIA. 
25

prosecutions under 841(b)(1), which is the trafficking 

there were only 93 prosecutions in 2010. 

 And what we think that illustrates is that 

 For prosecutions under 841(b)(4) -- which is

didn't hear. 

 The Georgia statute, which just refers to 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yeah.  I apologize.  Yes, 

 Adrian Moncrieffe possessed --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's -- it's a massive 

1
2
3  amount of conduct that -- that the statute contemplates? 
4  The statutory scheme -- I just didn't hear.  I just 
5
6
7  Justice Kennedy, that's right. 
8
9  possession with intent to distribute, contemplates both 
social sharing of marijuana -- this case, for example, 
10
11 
1.3 grams of marijuana, which is less than --
12
13  Goldstein, when you say, "this case," is there any proof 
14  in the record that there was a small amount and no -- no 
15
16
17  although this is -- we believe the case is proceeding 
18  under the categorical approach, the answer to your 
19  question is yes.
20
21  going to be at the back of the blue brief, where we have 
22  the chemist's report, so page 19.  This is from the --
23  the record in the immigration proceedings. 
24
25

 And on page 19 of the appendix to our blue 

brief -- we just agreed because there was so little 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When you -- now, Mr. 

remuneration? 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, 

 So let me take you to two places.  One is 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Now, on the question of no remuneration, 

than 1 ounce --

what I have to offer you is the Georgia statute --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  I don't 

1  record material, that we wouldn't have a joint appendix 
2  in the case.  We just published it at the end of our 
3  brief -- it says, "Material weight less than 1 ounce. 
4  Approximate weight is 1.3 grams."
 And for those of us who've been fortunate 
5
6  enough not to experience the drug laws a lot, that's 
7  less than half the weight of this penny.  So it's -- I 
8  think everybody agrees, a small amount. 
9
10
11
12  understand. 
13
14
15
16
17
18  "Approximate weight is 1" -- 1 -- oh, I see, 1.3 grams. 
19
20
21
22  and I should just step back and explain, the reason 
23  we're talking about this is that the Federal misdemeanor 
24  provision, 841(b)(4), says that it's not a felony, and 
25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sorry. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Material weight says less 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- parentheses, 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yeah.  1.3 grams.  1.3. 

That's -- that's very, very, very, very little. 

 So then, on the question of remuneration --

thus, it wouldn't be an aggravated felony, if it's a 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 Now, there isn't record evidence about no 

 And he was not charged with and he was not 

I'll just read it.  "It is unlawful for any person to 
possess, have under his control, manufacture, deliver, 
distribute, dispense, administer, purchase, sell" --
sell -- "or possess with intent to distribute 
marijuana."

1  small amount and no remuneration.  And Justice Ginsburg 
2  asked about the -- what's in the record about that. 
3
4  remuneration, but there is one significant fact.  And to 
know that fact, you have to look at the Georgia statute, 
5
6  which is also at the end of our brief.  It's on page 9 
7  of our appendix. 
 This is the statute he was prosecuted under. 
8
9  It's the second provision, Section 16-13-30(j)(1).  And 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  convicted of selling.  And so we think that should 
17  negative any indication -- any implication that he might 
18  have gotten remuneration for this. 
19
20
21  guilty.  And in his allocution, he had admitted to not a 
22  smaller amount or to remuneration.  Would -- would an 
23  immigration judge, under the argument you're making 
24  today, have to ignore that allocution?  Or would he be 
25

able to apply the modified approach and find this 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You -- we are discussing 

the categorical approach, but let's assume he had pled 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Under our rule, the plea 

conviction, but that evidence would still come in.  It 
would be highly relevant.  It's the basis that this 
Court explained in Carachuri-Rosendo, that the 
immigration judge would deny cancellation of removal. 
Right?

1  gentleman an aggravated felon? 
2
3  colloquy is irrelevant, but we would win under a rule in 
4  which it was relevant.
 So, to start with the former, we say that 
5
6  the categorical rule applies.  There's no -- the only 
7  reason that you would look at the modified categorical 
8  approach here is to know that it was a possession with 
9  intent to distribute conviction, rather than a sale 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  The Attorney General would exercise his discretion in 
17  such a case.  Now --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the issue with 
18
19  this case.  None of these immigrants are being let out 
20
21  removal.  The only issue is whether --
22
23  felons.  We --
24
25

automatically.  They are still felons subject to 

 That factor would still be highly relevant. 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Oh, this -- you said still 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well -- they're --
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  But that's exactly right. 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- they're still subject 

 They say our position is underinclusive 

because the Georgia statute does include conduct that 

1
2  to removal --
3
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right. 
4
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- either way.
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  So -- you know, lawyers 
5
6  often try and avoid the strength of the other side's 
7  case.  And so let me just confront what I think is a big 
8  argument of theirs. 
9
10
11  would be a felony.  You just gave an example of it. 
12
 But our point is that our underinclusivity 
13  is a problem, but it's not a big problem, it's not as 
14  big as their problem, because, as this Court explained 
in Carachuri-Rosendo, the offense still is removable, 
15
16  and the Attorney General will just deny cancellation of 
17  removal. 
18
19  practical problem is that their rule is overinclusive. 
It treats, as felonies, some convictions that should be 
20
21  misdemeanors. 
22
23  something I really don't understand in these cases 
24  because the other cases, our precedent's been around a 
25

long time, so I would have guessed that, under that 

 Now, the reason they have a much bigger 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I -- I see that.  There's

 So you'd pick up the phone, and you'd phone, 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- who work with the 

1  precedent in these other statutes, the obvious thing to 
2  do -- the obvious puzzle here is not the Federal 
3  statute, it's the State statute, what is this thing he 
4  was convicted of about?
5
6  at random, four U.S. attorneys -- not U.S. attorneys, 
7  but four State attorneys --
8
9
statute in Georgia, and say, now, look, the indictment 
10
11  here says possession with intent to distribute, and I 
12  can show from the documents that it's a tiny amount. 
13  Now, is it your policy, if he was selling it, to charge 
14  under the sell?  Is it your policy if he's not selling 
it to charge under intent to distribute?  Is it totally 
15
16  random whether you say sell or intent to distribute? 
17  What's your policy?  Okay? 
18
19  idea whether what you're saying is right.  Now, you 
20
21  do it.  And then we'd have some actual facts about 
22  whether this charge -- really, it corresponds to the 
23  misdemeanor or the felony in the Federal statute. 
24
25

could do that, but they could do it, too.  Anyone could 

 Then we get some answers.  Then we'd have an 

 So why -- I'm not -- I mean, that isn't a 

brain -- that isn't -- doesn't require -- it's not

Official 

fact that this isn't a possession with intent to 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You don't have to say, 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right.  We -- I think --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And the kind of statute 

1  rocket science, okay?  So why has no one done it? 
2
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Because I don't think 
3  anybody would believe me if I went to an immigration 
4  judge and I said, judge, I promise, I promise that the 
5
6  distribute case means that there are never cases in --
7
8  "never."  The question is what kind of a statute is this 
9  State statute?
10
11
12  that it is, is a statute that is used to prosecute 
13  people --
14
15
16  they don't sell. 
17
18
19  that felon intends to distribute --
20
21
22  really picked up by the district attorneys. 
 And if it's not, then they may be right, 
23
24  because -- because then intent to distribute may well 
25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- with small amounts when 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  If your version of what 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  The distinction there is

 So my other question --
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yeah.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- which is the only other 

1  sell stuff. 
2
3  Court's cases to suggest that we call the State 
4  attorneys.  We have read the Court's cases to engage in 
ordinary statutory construction, and sell means sell --
5
6
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Okay.  You didn't. 
7  In any words, nobody did it. 
8
9
10
11  one I really have, aside from making that suggestion. 
12  But here, what happened to this person? 
13
14
15
16  probation?  Which would be evidence in your favor, I 
17  think. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 
18
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But was he, or wasn't he?
19
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 
20
21
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  If he was, what 
22  it says in this provision is that the Court may without 
23  entering a judgment of guilt.  So there was no judgment 
24  of guilt.
25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  He was -- was he sentenced 

under 16-13-2(a)?  That is, was he sentenced to

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure.  Because the

7
8
9  was convicted of anything?
10
11  government's position is -- and the Eleventh Circuit has 
12  agreed with it -- and just to -- just to make sure 
13  everyone is on the same page, and that is, the Federal 
14  statute is triggered by a conviction.
15
16  as a matter of State law, he was not even convicted 
17  because he got first offender treatment here, which is a 
18  point in our favor.  It does show that it was a small 
19  and non-serious offense.
20
21  definition of convicted that's independent of the State 
22  definition of convicted. 
23
24  not before us today.
25

 Justice Breyer has just made the point that, 

 The reason is that there is a Federal 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And that question's 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's exactly right. 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1
2  the reason we don't look at the particular facts and 
3  particular case and don't depose four district 
4  attorneys, is that the Court has adopted a categorical 
approach precisely to avoid that type of inquiry in --
5
6  whatever it is, 750,000 cases? 
7
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  That's correct.  And 
8  it's an even stronger point in our favor because worse 
9  than interviewing four district attorneys is having a 
fact-bound inquiry into every one of these immigration 
10
11 
cases.  Remember --
12
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, I'm sorry. 
13  We don't need that because we've adopted a categorical 
14  approach.
15
16
17  the elements and conviction in -- Georgia, right? 
18
19
20
21  those elements.  And under our categorical approach, 
22  that's the end of the inquiry. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That is one way of looking 
23
24  at it.  We disagree, for reasons I'll explain.  I will 
25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yeah. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  841(b)(1)(D) lists 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Conviction in 

Georgia under their provision satisfies -- has each of

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Well, isn't

Official 

 Remember, that they do not argue that you 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They want to do that 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, they want to do it in --

in every single case at the beginning. 

 So I can just make clear everybody's 

the reason is that, if you apply the categorical 

1  defend that position anymore. 
2
3  can just look at the conviction.  They want to have the 
4  fact-bound inquiry into every one of these cases.  And 
5
6  approach to --
7
8  at the tail end, right? 
9
10
11
12  position.  There really --
13
14
15
16  every --
17
18  beginning.  So I'll --

21
22  beginning of the immigration proceedings. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right. 
23
24
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  So let me --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Before you get on --
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Again, I didn't hear. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sorry.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  They want to do it in 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, in the middle -- at the 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  At the -- at the beginning 

of the State prosecution? 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  In every case at the 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  So let me explain. 

position is that it is presumptively, but only 
presumptively, an aggravated felony.  And in every 
single immigration proceeding, when you have a case like 
this, the noncitizen can come forward with fact-found 
evidence, not limited to the record of conviction --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Goldstein, it's 

1  I didn't understand that to be their position at all.  I 
2  mean, I suppose we -- I certainly will ask them because 
3  they're probably better able to articulate their 
4  position, but --
5
6
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Go ahead. 
7
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  So our position is it is a 
8  controlled substances offense, and you take account of 
9  the seriousness of the offense in cancellation.  Their 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's correct. 
21
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So what the Government is 
22
23  suggesting is as close to the Federal statute as you can 
24  get.
25

because they are trying to mirror the Federal statute, 
which makes the small amount and no remuneration, makes 
that like an affirmative defense.  The burden is on the 
defendant to show those two things, to get out from 
under the main statute. 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, let me just say first, 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

was talking about the underinclusiveness as the first 

 Their second one is they want to draw an 

the conviction is all the facts that you had in a 
Federal criminal prosecution, and then you would have a 
burden on the defendant to -- to prove that he was 
subject to the misdemeanor. 

1  I do want to make -- just want to focus on what the 
2  parties' positions are.  And they do have this 
3  fact-found inquiry in every one, so I do want to turn to 
4  what I think is probably their second best argument.  I 
5
6  one. 
7
8  analogy between this and what would happen in a criminal 
9  case.  So they say, take the conviction and imagine that 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
 We have several points about that.  The 
first is this is not a Federal criminal prosecution. 
15
16  The Federal statute involved is the Immigration and 
17  Naturalization Act, and it tells you that you are 
18  supposed to look at the conviction itself and determine 
19  whether it corresponds to a Federal felony.
20
21  it's exactly the argument that was rejected in 
22  Carachuri-Rosendo.  And let me talk about why --
23
24  case involved, in -- in order to hold for the 
25

government, you would have to go outside the record of 

 This further proceeding doesn't exist, and 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said Carachuri.  That

1  the State conviction.  You'd have to add something that 
2  wasn't in the State conviction. 
 And it's the same thing here.  To get to 
3
4  where you want to go, you have to add something that 
5
6
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, we disagree.  What the 
7  Court said in -- I agree with the beginning of how you 
8  characterize the Carachuri case.  What the Court said is 
9  we don't go beyond the -- the conviction itself.
 We -- And it's true that, in that case, the 
10
11  government wanted to go beyond the record to go up.  But 
12  here, what they're saying is that you should go beyond 
13  the record to figure out if you should go down.  And 
14  what the Court said is, no, you look at the conviction

strength of that point.  But our --

1  of.  So here, he was convicted of possession with intent 
2  to distribute.  The other side's argument is, well, if I 
3  had just possession with intent to distribute, that 
4  would be a Federal felony.  So we acknowledge the 
5
6
7  Or is he convicted of violating Georgia Code 16-13, 
8  whatever it is? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  As I was -- I mentioned very 
9
briefly to Justice Sotomayor, when you have a divisible 
10
11  statute like this, that includes possession with intent 
12  to distribute, sell, possess, all of those things, you 
13  use the modified categorical approach to figure out 
14  which one applies.
15
16  possession with intent to distribute, and that's common 
17  ground between the parties.  It's not the whole statute. 
18  It's just the --
19
assuming he was convicted of that, as you suggest, you 
20
21  have an underinclusiveness problem.  The Government has 
22  an overinclusiveness problem.

2  and people with much more major offenses --
3
4
5
6  they've tried to cure their overinclusiveness problem. 
7  And they have done it by sticking on -- and -- you know, 
8  one can ask where this comes from in the statute --
9
10
11  sticking on something that attempts to address their 
12  overinclusiveness problem, so that people who are really 
13  misdemeanants get classified as misdemeanants, and 
14  people who are really aggravated felons get classified 
15
16
17  underinclusiveness problem.  So why shouldn't we go with 
18  their problem, which at least attempts to solve this 
19  problem?
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, two reasons.  First, 
20
21  they don't have a real solution; and, second, Congress 
22  solved our problem. 
 And this is what Carachuri-Rosendo says, and 
23
24  that is when you have an underinclusiveness problem just 
25

that way. 

 And you have no similar cure for your 

like ours, the statute fixes it because the statute

1  treats the conviction as a controlled substances

12  deny cancellation of removal to anybody who commits 
13  these kinds of offenses?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We -- it's an interesting 
question that I have puzzled about at length.  I think 
15
16  the answer is no for a very particular reason, however, 
17  and that is the Attorney General has no such categorical

 Under these State convictions in which the

4  irrelevant, it's going to be extremely difficult for 
5

7  commonplace, from looking at the case law, for the

12
 MR. SHAH:  I think it's a very different 
13  question.  If you put the burden on the government to 
14  show that, in fact, no remuneration was involved, the 
government would have to meet its burden in a criminal 
15
16  case to show beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no 
17  remuneration at all.  That is going to change the result 
18  in a large number of cases where there is a relative --

 MR. SHAH:  Well, Your Honor, what Carachuri 

recidivism factor, an aggravating factor.  When you are 

punishable as a felony, it's natural to look at the 
aggravating factor. 

1  what constitutes a misdemeanor or a felony under Federal 
2  law, we have to look at both. 
3
4  involved was something very different.  It involved a 
5
6  talking about an aggravating factor, Apprendi

8  an element because it raises the statutory maximum.  And 
9  so when you are trying to decide whether something is 
10
11 
12
 The other thing I would say about Carachuri 
13  is that it's easily distinguishable on the grounds that 
14  Justice Ginsburg raised.  It -- the government's 
argument in Carachuri was much more difficult.  The 
15
16  government was trying to rely on a recidivism factor 
17  that was not part of the predicate conviction.  And it 
18  was trying to rely on that factor to elevate what was 
19  otherwise a misdemeanor under both State and Federal law

22  all the elements that are required for a Federal felony 
23  under the CSA, namely possession of marijuana and a

approach to the categorical part of the inquiry is -- is 
the right approach and not Petitioner's approach.  The 
first is --

3  immigration judge that he can, should, or should not --
4

8  there are two ways, Your Honor, that -- two different

14  misdemeanor still has the same three elements.
15
16
17  between it being a misdemeanor or a felony? 
 MR. SHAH:  Right.  I think here -- here are 
18
19  the two ways you get there.  First is by looking at how 
this Court has consistently formulated the categorical 
20
21  inquiry.  Starting with Taylor, pre-Apprendi case, 
22  compare the elements of the predicate offense to the 
23  those of the generic offense.

the more recent cases, Lopez and not -- still the same

Nijhawan. 

 There, it had a different aggravating 

1  inquiry, focusing on the elements of the predicate and
 
2  the elements of the generic.
 
3
4  Justice Sotomayor, if there is still some uncertainty as
 
to when you have mitigating factors, like in this case, 
5
6  and the question is, well, does the predicate conviction 
7  have to affirmatively negate those narrow mitigating 
8  criteria, then this Court can look, if it wants to go to 
9  first principles, look at this Court's decision in 
10
11
12  felony, certain fraud and deceit offenses which resulted 
13  in a $10,000 loss to the victim.  What the Court said, 
14  look, fraud and deceit, those are clearly elements, we 
are going to apply the categorical approach to -- to 
15
16  figure out whether those elements are satisfied.  But 
17  the $10,000 loss factor, we're not sure.  We're not sure 
18  whether the predicate offense has to affirmatively 
19  establish it or not.
20
21  of the 50 States.  It looked at the 50 States.  And it 
22  turns out that, in a vast majority of those States, the 
23  predicate conviction will never establish that $10,000 
24  loss factor.  And so you're going to have a vastly

 And so what the Court did is it did a survey 

underinclusive aggravated felony.

 And that's something that Congress -- that 

manner. 

 I submit that's exactly what you have here 

in a clear majority of the States, the predicate 
conviction will not establish that there is remuneration 
or more than a small amount. 
 Congress cannot --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Shah, I think the

3  Congress would not have intended its aggravated felony 
4  provision to apply in such a limited and haphazard 
5
6
7  on pages 26 to 30 of our brief.  And Petitioner does not 
8  take issue with a single one of the statutes that we 
9  cite.  And we go through all 50 of them.  We show that, 
10
11

problem with your main argument is that it leads you to 
15
16  a result that you don't want to accept because your main 
17  argument is all we've done in our past cases -- and I 
18  can argue with this, but your argument is all we've done 
19  is compare the elements.

22  we also admit evidence of -- of the case-specific nature

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I don't think we really have 
10

14  that Carachuri actually says we don't just look to

17  that you're arguing for. 
18
19  have to look at this particular aggravated felony, which 
20
21  felonies in the INA. 
 If you look at the aggravated felony in the

24  that -- that is the one about document fraud crimes, it 
25

 MR. SHAH:  Okay. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- because it seems to me 

says the alien -- then, if the alien then shows that 

 MR. SHAH:  Again, Your Honor, I think you 

I think is structured similar to other aggravated 

50
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And the whole 

point -- the whole point is that there is no similar 
provision in the statute at issue in this case, right? 
 MR. SHAH:  I think the point is that there 

1  that document fraud crime was perpetrated in order to 
2  help a family member, then no more aggravated felony. 
3
 How does the alien make that showing?  He 
4  comes into immigration court -- after it's already been 
established that you have the predicate document fraud 
5
6  felony, he comes into immigration court.  He has to 
7  bring forth evidence on his own that shows that it 
8  satisfied this familial exception to that document fraud 
9  aggravated felony.  I think the --
10
11 
12 
13
14  is a similar provision.  In the -- the INA here 
incorporates the CSA to define the aggravated felony. 
15
16  The CSA says it's a felony if you have possession plus 
17  intent to distribute, unless the defendant shows -- and 
18  this is how it has been interpreted by every court of 
19  appeals that has interpreted the CSA -- unless the 
defendant shows it was only a small amount for no 
20
21  remuneration. 
 That is an identical formulation to some of 
22
23  the other aggravated felonies in the provision.  And how 
24  those other aggravated felony provisions have been 
25

interpreted is to allow the alien to come into 

51
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I don't think that that is 

 Congress has the -- the social sharing 

predicate conviction to affirmatively negate it.
 

quite right, Mr. Shah, because if you read this statute, 
what it most looks like is that Congress is simply 
classifying two different kinds of conduct. 

1  immigration court to show the exception. 
2
 We are not aware of a single court decision 
3  that has ever interpreted any similar provision in any 
4  of the other aggravated felony provision to require the 
5
6
 And that's exactly what Petitioner's main
 
7  submission is, that this predicate conviction has to
 
8  affirmatively negate the possibility of a narrow
 
9  mitigating exception.  That is --
10
11 
12 
13 
14
conduct, and that's in one section.  And the everything 
15
16  else, the more dangerous conduct, is in another section. 
17
 And so it's not something where it's like, 
18  oh, you're trying to get them to negate a specific -- a 
19  point.  Congress has created two separate sections, 
20
21  And that's the -- the real way to understand this 
22  statute. 
 And then the categorical approach suggests, 
23
24  well, in that case, we accept the underinclusion, rather 
25

two -- and one is a felony, and one is a misdemeanor. 

than the overinclusion. 

52
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. SHAH:  Well, Your Honor, I disagree with 

the -- that the government, in order to get to the 

1
2  that characterization of that statute.  Every court of 
3  appeals that has considered this statute has rejected 
4  the argument that we have two separate offenses and that 
5
6  higher offense, the -- the default felony provision, 
7  that the government would have to treat as elements 
8  the -- the mitigating criteria of remuneration and small 
9  amount.  Every court of appeals has rejected that.
 If this statute were drawn as you suggest, 
10
11  and it were elements of a crime, that is, you had two 
12  separate offenses, one is possession with intent to 
13  distribute a small amount for no remuneration, or it 
14  could just say possession with intent to distribute 
marijuana, if that was one distinct offense that was a 
15
16  misdemeanor, and then Congress created a second offense 
17  that says, in cases where there is more than a small 
18  amount, in which there is remuneration, then you get a 
19  five-year maximum instead of a one-year maximum, that is 
effectively making, as an element, the government to 
20
21  disprove both the possibility of no remuneration and 
22  more than a small amount. 
23
24  at issue, I would agree with you, Petitioner would 
prevail under the categorical approach.  That's not

1  the -- that's not the statutory scheme here. 
2
3  they agree that every court of appeals that has 
4  interpreted this has interpreted it as one offense and 
that those mitigating criteria are just that, they are 
5
6  mitigating exceptions and not offense elements. 
7
8  Honor, is that --
9
10
11  I mean, why should we -- why should we accept that 
12  labeling, rather than, look, what Congress did here was 
13  to say that certain kinds of offenses are felonies 
14  deserving of grave punishment, and other kinds of 
offenses are misdemeanors deserving of less than a year 
15
16  in prison, and -- and we see those -- those categories 
17  of conduct differently. 
18
19  had -- had said two separate offenses, then the 
20
21  wins, I guess I just don't get what in this statute 
22  suggests something different from that.

knows that these labels actually have big consequences.

2
 MR. SHAH:  Well, I think what Congress had 
3  in mind is that those mitigating criteria would not be 
4  treated as elements.
5
6  question, how do we know?  Well, we can look at what --
7  the inquiry that the Court did in Nijhawan.  It would 
8  not be -- it would not be consistent with Congressional 
9  intent to assume that Congress intended that this

12 
13 
14
15
16  particular piece of the aggravated felony description to 
17  be subject to the categorical approach or not?  That is, 
18  did it require the predicate conviction to establish or 
19  negate it?  And the right way to look at that is to look 
20
21
 And here, we know that, in a clear majority 
22  of States, they do not require remuneration, they do not 
23  require more than a small amount.  You will never get an 
24  aggravated felony conviction out of a majority of 
25

States.  Congress could not have intended that result. 

 That is what Nijhawan was about.  It was 

trying to figure out, did Congress intend this 

at the State of the State laws.

to litigate it.  But what we do know is that Congress

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, I told

1  statute comes up with an answer that Congress couldn't 
2  possibly have intended by treating all these 
3  misdemeanants as aggravated felons. 
4
'nother proceeding that isn't in the statute.  Another 
5
6  solution is just to recognize their reading is wrong. 
7  If it produces this ridiculous result that Congress 
8  couldn't have intended, and our reading is perfectly 
9  sensible and not only do you have the solution of the 
10
11  suggestion of the Attorney General's ability to issue an 
12  order, Justice Sotomayor's solution of being able to 
13  look at the plea allocution, questions that aren't 
14  presented here, but lots of ways of addressing any 
15
16
17  just to add this procedure that --
18
19  "punishable," I think.
20
21  word --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So you're thinking, under 
22
23  Georgia law, this is punishable as a felony only if it 
24  wasn't a small amount used for personal use, you see, 
25

 MR. SHAH:  Well, "punishable" is a good 

adverse consequences of our rule. 

 What in statutory construction allows us 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But it's the word

 Now, their solution is to add a whole

62
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 It's not punishable as an 841 felony, unless 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  But I don't think 

add this other proceeding. 

 When they say -- what they do with 

we've construed.  That's what I thought they were doing. 

1
2  those two things are absent, and therefore, they have 
3  the hearing to find out.  And the word "punishable" 
4  doesn't appear in the statutes, the other ones that 
5
6
7  that's actually what they're doing because Mr. Shah did 
8  not deny Justice Kagan's questions about, yeah, it would 
9  produce this ridiculous result, and so we're going to 
10
11
12  punishable is they say look at only the elements of the 
13  Federal offense.  And that's how they say that any 
14  Georgia conviction, even though, Justice Ginsburg, lots 
of these convictions will just be equivalents to Federal 
15
16  misdemeanors because they are the equivalent of --
17  because they involve possession with intent to 
18  distribute, those are the only elements of the offense, 
19  then they're all punishable as felonies, even if they 
20
21
 So I don't think punishable helps them.  And 
22  they don't seem to argue on the basis of punishable.  So 
23  my base point to you is that why, in choosing between 
24  these two readings, we have strengths, they have 
25

strengths.  Their argument starts from the proposition 

would be a misdemeanor. 

63
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And, Mr. Chief Justice, they did start out 

the statute that doesn't appear in the statute. 

 The last point that I want to address is 

1  that theirs produces a result that Congress couldn't 
2  have intended. 
3
4  with the hardcore position.  I can give you the example. 
It's our case.  Remember, even though this is 1.3 grams, 
5
6  even though he was not convicted of selling, they 
7  ordered him mandatorily deportable without an inquiry 
8  into the underlying facts.  They recognize that can't be 
9  right.  And so they are trying to tack something on to 
10
11
12  actually a very small one.  And that's about 
13  Justice Thomas' dissent in the Lopez case on whether you 
14  should look to the State definition of whether this is a 
15
16  government cites it in a footnote in their brief. 
17
18  not relying on the Lopez dissent.  It invokes Lopez 
19  repeatedly in the Federal courts.  And so this is a 
situation in which the Court's decision in Lopez should 
20
21  take hold as a matter of statutory -- stare decisis, and 
22  what matters here is the Federal treatment of it. 
23
24  conviction is a felony or a misdemeanor under Federal 
25

felony or instead, the Federal one, because the 

 And we would only say that the government is

 The -- the arguments that my friend ended 

proceedings, these other intermediate proceedings about 
determining the facts of the offense in Federal 
sentencing?  It gets vastly more complicated. 

1  categorical rule says is that the State conviction 
2  doesn't necessarily establish it's a Federal offense, 
3  the Federal felony here, and therefore, you don't treat 
4  it that way.
5
6  with -- ended with about, hey, this is going to be 
7  applied in Federal sentencing and lots of other 
8  contexts, makes it worse, not better.  How in the world 
9  are we going to have these others Castro-Rodriguez
