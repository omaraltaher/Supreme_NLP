CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

this  morning  in  Case  14­915,  Friedrichs  v.  The 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California  Teachers  Association,  et  al. 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Carvin. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MICHAEL  A.  CARVIN 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Every  year,  Petitioners  are  required  to 

 

 

 

 

 

provide  significant  support  to  a  group  that  advocates  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

ideological  viewpoint  which  they  oppose  and  do  not  wish 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  subsidize.  Abood's  authorization  of  this  clear  First 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  violation  should  be  overturned,  both  to  end 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  ongoing  deprivation  of  basic  speech  and  association 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights,  and  to  restore  consistency  and  predictability  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court's  First  Amendment  jurisprudence. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Carvin,  is  it 

  

 

 

 

 

permissible,  in  your  view,  to  allow  the  union  to  be  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusive  representative  so  that  nobody  else  is  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bargaining  table? 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Yes,  that's  fine  with  us.  Our 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

objection,  of  course,  is  being  forced  to  subsidize  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusive  representative.

The  fact  that  they  are  exclusive 

 

 

 

 

 

representative  impinges  on  my  clients  because  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disables  them  from  individually  negotiating  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school  board,  but  that  is  justified  by  the  need  for  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusive  representative. 

 

            

And  that  is  why,  indeed,  requiring  agency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees  in  the  collective  bargaining  context  is  less 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justified  than,  for  example,  requiring  agency  fees  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

support  union  lobby. 

 

 

            

In  the  ­­ in  collective  bargaining  context, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  are  required  to  free  ride  on  the  union  because  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  the  exclusive  representative  and  we  don't  have  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own  vehicle.  So  the  free­rider  justification  is  far 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

weaker  in  the  collective  bargaining  context  than  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  union  lobbying  context. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Mr.  Carvin,  is  ­­ is  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay  to  force  somebody  to  contribute  to  a  cause  that  he 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  believe  in? 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  I  wouldn't  think,  Your  Honor, 

    

 

 

 

 

that  you  could  force  Republicans  to  give  contributions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Yes.  That's  ­­ that's  what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

I'm  thinking.  Could  you  enact  a  law?  Let's  say  the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

national  political  parties  are  in  trouble  so  they  enact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  law  that  says  all  ­­ all  members  of  the  Republican 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party,  if  you  want  to  be  a  member  you  have  to  contribute

so  much  money. 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  CARVIN:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Is  that  okay? 

  

 

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  No,  it's  not,  and  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  bedrock  principle,  as  Harris  made  clear,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  whether  or  not  you  vividly  oppose  what  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  ­­

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Right. 

  

 

MR.  CARVIN:  ­­ it's  because  you  don't  wish 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  subsidize  it. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Exactly.  So  I  don't  know 

   

  

  

 

 

why  you're  putting  so  much  emphasis  on  the  fact  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  ­­ your  clients  oppose.  It  really  wouldn't  matter, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  it? 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  No.  And  I  don't  ­­ I  did  want 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

to  point  out  that  that's  the  reason  that  they've  brought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  lawsuit.  But  ­­ but  no,  you're  a  thousand  percent

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  ­­ and  because? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  Because  the  First  Amendment 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

doesn't  apply  to  private  employers,  and  because  in  Beck 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  established  the  rules  for  agency  shops  based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  statute  without  any  First  Amendment  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  think  that's  correct  as 

    

 

 

 

 

a  basic  distinction.  It  is  true,  though,  assuming  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  a  State  statute  which  allows  an  agency  shop  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ a  closed  shop,  that  that  is  State  participation  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  very  kind  of  coerced  membership  and  coerced  speech 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you're  objecting  to. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Well,  I  don't,  in  candor,  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  that  would  create  State  action  under  the  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modern  jurisprudence,  such  as  Moose  Lodge,  where  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

turns  on  who  is  making  the  decision  that  is  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objected  to.  In  your  hypothetical  it  would  be  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  employer. 

 

            

But  that  aside,  as  the  Court  made  clear  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Harris,  even  if  it  did  reach  First  Amendment,  there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ there's  a  serious  difference  between  a  grudging 

   

   

 

 

 

 

authorization  or  the  government  permitting  private 

 

 

 

 

 

employers  to  engage  in  agency  shops  and  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself  affirmatively  imposing  them  on  its  own  public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees.

Justice  Kennedy  that,  in  the  private  sector,  this  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  all  right,  you  can  have  an  agency  shop.  How 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  under  the  Railway  Labor  Act? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Well,  as  you  know  from  Street, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can  have  agency  shops  but  the  agency  fees  can  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  to  things  that  are  germane  to  collective  bargaining. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  other  words,  they  impose  the  Abood  rule  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  sector  as  a  matter  of  statutory  interpretation, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and  nothing  the  Court  says  about  ­­

MR.  CARVIN:  Not  at  all,  Your  Honor.  We  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  are  strictly  limiting  ourselves  to  public  employees

greater  constraints  under  the  First  Amendment  that

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  one  of  the  points  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  public  employee  cases  generally,  Mr.  Carvin,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially  to  ensure  that  when  the  government  acts  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  employer,  that  the  government  be  put  in  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  as  a  private  employer;  in  other  words,  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

various  constraints  that  would  constrain  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  it's  acting  as  sovereign  fall  away  and  a  different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  lesser  set  of  constraints  apply  that  are  meant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially  to  ensure  that  the  government  doesn't  use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  position  as  leverage  over  things  it  oughtn't  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able  to  control,  but  that  the  government  can  do  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  that  a  private  employer  can. 

   

 

 

 

            

And  so  why  doesn't  this  fall  within  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

category  of  things?  In  other  words,  you've  just  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  employer  can  decide  to  do  this.  That's  not  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  problem.  So  too  with  the  government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

employer. 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  For  two  reasons,  Justice  Kagan. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

First,  I  must  respectfully  disagree 
 

   

 

 

with  the  premise. 

 

 

None  of  the  Court's  First  Amendment 
 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisprudence  quite 

 

says  public  employers  have  the  same 
 

 

 

 

 

 

rights  as  private 

 

 

employers. 

            

Private  employers  under 
 

 

 

the  Constitution  can 

 

 

discriminate  on  the  basis  of  political  affiliation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  can  even  discriminate  on  the  basis  of  sexual

orientation.  But  nobody  thinks  that  public  employers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

can  do  that. 

 

 

            

Plus  which,  even  under  Pickering,  for 

 

 

 

 

 

example,  the  deferential  review  you're  referring  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposes  greater  constraints  on  public  employers  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  employers.  Bargaining  ­­

  

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  As  I  said,  Mr.  Carvin  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  Sorry. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  there's  a  lesser  set  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

constraints.  And  ­­ and  the  lesser  set  is  basically  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

draw  a  line  and  to  ensure  that  the  government  doesn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  its  position  as  employer  to  do  things  it  oughtn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

properly  to  do. 

 

 

            

But  the  ­­ the  government,  when  it's  acting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  an  employer  with  respect  to  its  employee  workforce, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  ought  to  be  able  to  do  the  same  things  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  employer  can. 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  The  Court's 

  

 

 

government­as­employer  speech  and  First  Amendment  draw  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  distinction  between  restricting  employee  speech, 

 

 

 

 

 

like  under  the  Pickering  line  of  cases  where  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deferential  review,  and  circumstances  such  as  this  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  do  leverage  the  employment  relationship  to  coerce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  employee  to  subsidize  or  associate  with  an  outside 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

group.

That's  obviously  ­­

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  How  is  that  different  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  ­­ for  example,  Rutan  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

subject  to  strict  scrutiny  because  they  are  leveraging 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  employment  relationship  to  force  you  to  associate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  a  political  party. 

   

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  that  sounds  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  Similarly  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ like  you're  drawing  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

distinction  between  restricting  speech  and  subsidizing 

 

 

 

 

 

speech.  And  I  had  always  thought  that  these  were  two 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sides  of  the  same  coin,  that  compelled  speech  is  ­­ is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  less  and  no  greater  an  offense  than  compelled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

silence. 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Yes.  Certainly  in  terms  of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Petitioners'  rights.  But  Your  Honor,  the  scrutiny  given 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  speech  being  subsided  doesn't  dictate  the  level 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  ­­ of  speech  scrutiny  given  to  the  compulsion  speech. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

For  example,  the  ­­ you  can  stop  unions  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making  political  contributions  under  the  case  law,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  hardly  suggests  you  can  compel  a  nonmember  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsidize  the  union's  contributions. 

 

 

 

            

You  can  stop  public  employees  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hatch  Act  from  engaging  in  basic  political 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participation,  but  that  hardly  suggests  that  you  could

require  a  nonmember  to  subsidize  political  activity. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

So  there's  always  been  a  clear  distinction 

   

 

 

 

 

in  the  case  law  between  those  two  things  precisely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  subsidization  is  an  entirely  different 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement  than  restricting  employee  speech. 

 

 

 

 

            

Restricting  employee  speech  is  an  inherent 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  employment  relationship.  The  employer  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  able  to  restrict  the  employees'  speech,  as  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  frequently  noted,  or  you  couldn't  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

workplace.  Plus  which  we  give  deferential  review 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because  we  don't  want  the  Federal  judiciary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

micromanaging  the  literally  hundreds  of  thousands  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personnel  decisions  that  public  employers  make  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day. 

            

Neither  of  those  concerns  is  present  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  a  categorical  rule  that  requires  one  set  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees  to  subsidize  an  outside  advocacy  group  like  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political  party  or  like  a  union,  and  that's  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  not  involving  the  Federal  judiciary  in  personnel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions.  And  it's  certainly  not  an  inherent  part  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  employment  relationship.  It  is,  to  use  your  phrase, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leveraging  the  employment  relationship  to  require 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that  the  State  couldn't  require  directly. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  why  are  we 

  

 

 

 

 

treating  the  government  differently  than  a  private

employer? 

            

You  just  earlier  said,  and  I  think  our  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  cases  are  replete  with  the  point  that  as  employer, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  can  already  restrict  speech  which  is,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  a  higher  problem  than  subsidization. 

   

 

 

 

            

We've  already  permitted  subsidization  of  bar 

 

 

 

 

 

associations,  of  government  programs.  We've  permitted 

  

 

 

 

 

assessments  on  a  lot  of  different  levels,  so  why  can't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government,  as  employer,  create  a  State  entity? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Because  this  union  under  California  law  is  a  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

entity. 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  No. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Oh  ­­

  

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  I'm  sorry. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ I  ­­ I  beg  to  differ. 

   

   

  

 

 

 

Hold  on,  Mr.  Carvin.  I'll  get  you  the  section. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Sure. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It  says,  "When 

  

 

 

 

recognized  as  the  exclusive  bargaining  representative,  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

union  assumes  an  official  position  in  the  operational 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structure  of  a  school." 

   

 

            

So  it  seems  to  me  that  ­­ and  California 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tells  the  union  what  topics  it  can  negotiate  on,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires  them  to  do  training,  and  in  the  end  it  accepts

of  employment  at  its  own  will,  meaning  the  State  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creating  the  union  as  part  of  the  employment  training 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  other  responsibilities. 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Justice  Sotomayor,  I  think  it's 

   

  

 

 

 

important  to  draw  a  distinction  between  having  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

official  position  ­­ they  certainly  do.  They  are  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusive  representative  of  the  employees  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting  that  they  are  somehow  State  actors. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  they  were  State  actors,  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature  could  tell  the  unions  not  to  advocate  pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raises.  It  could  tell  them  not  to  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Oh,  in  fact,  it  might  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

able  to  do  that. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  I  don't  ­­

    

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  If  it  ­­ it  tells  them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  can  ­­ they  give  ­­ the  State  legislature  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  them  the  right  to  do  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  what  would  take  away 

  

 

 

 

 

 

from  their  right  to  say,  no,  you  can't  bargain  on  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  topics? 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  The  First  Amendment.  In  other 

  

  

 

 

 

 

words,  the  ­­ the  scope  of  collective  bargaining  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously  something  the  State  can  dictate.  It  could

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Absolutely. 

  

 

MR.  CARVIN:  Well  ­­ well,  then,  that's  my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

point.  But  of  course  if  the  ­­ if  they  were  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officials  subordinate  to  the  State  legislature,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  legislature  could  tell  them,  don't  advocate  pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raises,  don't  advocate  this  for  health  and  benefit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  they  wouldn't  say, 

  

 

 

 

 

don't  advocate  this  with  respect  to  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature,  but  they  could  say  that's  not  going  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  subject  of  discussion  at  the  bargaining  table. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Those  are  two  different  things  altogether. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Well,  again,  we  need  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

distinguish  between  collective  bargaining  and  lobbying. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly. 

  

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Exactly.  And  ­­ and  here's  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

point:  They  couldn't  ­­ collective  bargaining  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

unique,  because  it  requires  public  officials  to  meet  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negotiate  in  good  faith  and  mediate  any  impasses  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unions.  None  of  that  exists  in  lobbying,  for  example. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  legislators  could  close  their  door  whenever  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want.

that's  a  chargeable  expense. 

   

 

            

my  ­­

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Yes,  under  Lehnert.  And  on 

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  ­­ so  collective 

  

 

 

 

 

bargaining  in  ­­ in  this  instance  subsumes  ­­ includes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  wide­ranging  effort  on  the  part  of  the  union  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  public  relations  campaign  in  favor  of  principles 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  some  of  its  members  ­­ that  some  teachers  strongly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

object  to. 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Exactly,  Your  Honor.  And  my 

  

  

 

 

 

 

point  in  response  to  Justice  Sotomayor  would  be  if  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  really  State  officials  subject  to  subordination  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  legislature,  the  State  legislature  could  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  like  they  could  say  to  their  own  employees,  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

run  public  relations  campaigns  adverse  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government.  And  the  key  point  is,  I  think  they  say  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  abandon  ­­ you  can  ban  collective  bargaining,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can't  ban  lobbying. 

 

 

 

            

But  it's  important  to  focus  on  why  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so.  The  reason  that  is  so  is  because  we  are  imposing  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligation  on  public  officials  in  collective  bargaining, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  exists  nowhere  else,  to  negotiate  in  good  faith 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  union.  But  they  couldn't  tell  the  union  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advocate  to  the  school  board,  pay  raises,  and  things

like  that.  They  can  simply  revoke  collective  bargaining 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  saying,  just  like  the  State  legislature,  the  school 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

board  doesn't  have  to  listen. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  If  we  ­­

  

 

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  So  the  distinction  is  between 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  public  officials  have  to  meet  and  negotiate  on,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  doesn't  translate  into  any  ability  to  tell  the

with  that. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  In  terms  of  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  ­­ the  Respondents  will  agreed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  the  teachers  can 

  

 

 

 

 

lobby.  There's  nothing  wrong  with  the  teachers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

speaking. 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  And  that's  the  whole  point. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

The  teachers  can  lobby.  They  can  go  to  the  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature. 

            

union  can. 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Uh­huh.  Just  like  the 

  

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Just  like  the  union  can. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  yet,  they  can't  be  forced  to  subsidize

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  what  does  your

collective  bargaining,  they  can't  negotiate.  So  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

free­rider  rationale  is  much  weaker  in  the  collective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bargaining  context,  because  the  teachers'  right  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negotiate  with  the  public  officials  that  the  union  is

even  though  in  lobbying,  they  can  engage  in  their  own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lobbying,  but  we  don't  allow  agency  fees  for  lobbying. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Carvin,  you  come  here, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  course,  with  a  heavy  burden.  That's  always  true  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  where  somebody  asks  us  to  overrule  a  decision.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  to  be  particularly  true  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  is  a  case  in  which  there  are  tens  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thousands  of  contracts  with  these  provisions.  Those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

contracts  affect  millions  of  employees,  maybe  as  high  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  million  employees. 

 

 

            

So  what  special  justification  are  you 

 

 

 

 

 

offering  here? 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  There  are  two  special 

  

 

 

 

 

justifications,  Justice  Kagan.  The  first  one  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  ­­ Abood  erroneously  denies  a  fundamental  right. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

It  doesn't  expand  a  fundamental  right.  And  as  the  Court

MR.  CARVIN:  The  second  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Excuse  me. 

  

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  You  say  this  a  lot  in  your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

your  ­­

 

            

            

            

            

briefs.  But  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  guess  I  found  it  hard  to 

   

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

understand  that  the  idea  that  every  time  we  deny  a  claim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  right,  whether  it's  the  First  Amendment  or  the  Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  or  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  that  that  denial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  claim  would  not  have  any  stare  decisis  effect.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  we  do  that  constantly.  We  do  that  tens  of  times 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  year. 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  But  ­­ but  you  are  asking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  ­­ if  the  Court  concludes  that  Abood  was  erroneous, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  special  justification  is  there? 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yes.  And  your  answer  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

essentially  you  don't  need  a  special  justification  if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  initial  decision  improperly  denied  a  claim  of  right. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  guess  I'm  saying  that  I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

find  that  an  extremely  difficult  concept  to  understand. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  would  take  away  stare  decisis  effect  from  numerous  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  just  hundreds,  thousands  of  our  decisions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  But  Justice  Kagan,  with 

  

 

 

 

 

respect,  I  think  the  proof  is  in  the  pudding.  The  Court

decisis. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  you  think  all  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth  Amendment  cases,  in  your  opinion,  are  correct.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  you  know,  the  police  can  go  search  a  car,  the  good 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

faith  rule  in  respect  to  admission  of  evidence  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seized  unlawfully  under  the  Fourth  Amendment.  I  read  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot  of  criticism  of  those  things  in  the  paper.  And  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  to  me  you  could  get  people  who  are  judges,  who  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  here,  who  thought  that  the  Fourth  Amendment  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  extended  and,  in  fact,  there  should  be  no  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  gives  police  any  special  authority  to  search  a  car. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CARVIN:  That  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  There  should  be  no  rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  stops  any  incidents  from  coming  in.  I  mean,  there 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  dozens  of  cases  where  this  Court  has  denied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  rights.  And  you're  saying  all  those  cases 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  now  free  of  any  stare  decisis  inhibition. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

unions? 

            

Is  that  the  point,  or  is  it  just  labor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  No,  no.  Your  Honor,  in  fact, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Fourth  Amendment  is  not  a  hypothetical.  That  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  Gant  involved.  And  Gant  is  the  one  that  I  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quoting  when  it  says  the  right  to  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treatment  outweighs  the  reliance  interests  of  stare

But  if  I  could  move  to  my  second  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  wait.  Well,  what 

  

  

 

 

 

decisis. 

            

            

about  the  Eighth  Amendment?  That's  a  good  one.  There's 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

an  individual  right,  some  think,  perhaps,  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capital  punishment.  The  Court  has  consistently  ruled 

  

 

 

 

 

 

against  it.  So  I  guess  if  that's  ever  considered  again, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  your  view,  the  Court  would  give  no  weight  to  stare 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisis. 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  If  the  Court  was  convinced  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

capital  punishment  was  clearly  outlawed  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution,  I  think  it  would  be  very  strange  to  tell 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  who  were  being  executed  in  the  future  that  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though  this  is  an  unconstitutional  execution,  we  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bound  by  our  erroneous  prior  decisions. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  Mr.  Carvin,  let's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

let's  ­­ let's  assume  that  stare  decisis  is  an  important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consideration  for  the  Court.  Let's  assume  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Sure. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  What  about  the  answer  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan's  questions  about  the  many  contracts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps  thousands  of  contracts?  Would  they  suddenly  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

endangered?  Would  they  all  be  void?  Could  you  address 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that? 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  There  is  no  reliance  interest.

These  contracts  will  operate  precisely  the  same,  the  day 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  Abood  is  overruled,  as  they  would  before. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

then? 

            

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  what  would  happen 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  Sorry. 

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  would  happen  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

employee  who  said  now  Abood  is  off  the  books? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  I  want  back  the  agency 

    

 

 

 

 

fee  that  I  was  compelled  to  pay.  That  was  an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional  exaction.  So  all  of  the  people  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

paid  these  fees  against  their  will  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

back? 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  When  you  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  ­­ have  a  right  to  get  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  No.  No  more  than  anybody  had 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  right  to  get  recompensed  under  Citizens  United  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  commercial  speech  cases,  once  you  relied  those  First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  speeches  doctrine  there.  As  I  understand  it, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  Court's  analysis  prescribes  prospectively.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

all  we're  asking  is  for  prospective  relief.  It  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  retroactively. 

 

            

And  to  get  to  the  point,  all  of  the  benefits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remain  precisely  the  same.  They  ­­ simply,  the  union's

unwilling  agency  fee. 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  Mr.  Carvin  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  Do  you  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ remember,  one,  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

assuming  that  these  provisions  are  completely  severable, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  I  imagine  depends  on  the  contract. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

But  number  two,  even  suppose  that  they  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

severable,  these  provisions  are  bargained  for  benefits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  contracts  would  read  differently.  The  unions  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  gotten  different  things  if  that  provision  had  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  there. 

 

            

So  you're  essentially  saying  that  the  exact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  contract  should  go  forward,  notwithstanding  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  union  has  given  up  things,  or  has  not  gotten  things, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  agency  fee  provision  is  in  the  contract. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  No.  Again,  I  must  respectfully 

   

  

  

 

 

disagree  with  the  factual  matter.  The  union  did  not  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  and  say  we  would  have  asked  for  a  10  percent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

increase,  but  now  we're  going  to  sell  out  our  members' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights  to  a  9  percent  increase  so  we  can  line  our  own 

     

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pockets  with  agency  fees  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  The  unions  have  ­­

order  to  perform  their  collective  responsibilities  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

collective  bargaining  responsibilities.  They  asked  for 

  

 

 

 

 

this  way  and  not  for  other  possible  ways  of  achieving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adequate  funding.  And  you  would  be  essentially 

  

 

 

 

 

 

stripping  them  of  this  way,  and  not  giving  them  anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  replace  that  with. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Well  again,  they  didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

negotiate  with  the  employer  for  funding  because  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  get  any  funding  from  the  employer;  they  get  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  their  members.  So  no  position  they  took  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collective  bargaining  is  at  all  affected  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely  separate  issue  of  how  they  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Ah,  but  that's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

question,  isn't  it?  Would  it  be  illegal  for  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government,  as  employer  or  government,  to  fund  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

union? 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  That's  a  ­­ I  thought  about 

   

   

  

 

 

that,  Justice  Sotomayor.  It's  a  very  tricky  question. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

Under  Johanns,  for  example,  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

can  engage  in  a  lot  of  speech  that  it  can't  compel 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens  to  engage  in.  The  government,  for  example,  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsidize  Planned  Parenthood,  but  it  couldn't  require 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens  to  subsidize  Planned  Parenthood.  So  in  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense,  yes,  the  government  would  have  far  greater 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leeway.

That  said  ­­

 

 

            

            

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  if  the  union  had  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

way,  or  something  to  negotiate,  which  was  right  now,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

union  participates  in  the  grievance  procedure  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pays  certain  expenses  for  that,  it  could  have  said  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  employer,  we're  no  longer  getting  enough  money  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  exclusive  representative  of  every  employee  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ so  now  we  want  you  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fund  certain  things. 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That  could  very  well 

  

 

 

 

 

have  been  part  of  the  negotiation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Not  in  California,  for  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reasons.  One  is  the  State  statute  requires  agency  fees. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  employer  couldn't  have  done  anything  with  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency  fees.  That's  all  decided  by  statute. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  No.  You're  ­­ you're 

  

  

 

 

 

assuming  ­­

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Prior  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  not  assuming  the 

  

 

 

 

 

state  of  the  law  as  it  exists  now.  I'm  assuming  that  we

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right?  California's 

  

  

 

 

going  to  have  to  respond  somehow.  It's  now  breaching 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  agreement  it  had  with  the  union. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CARVIN:  It's  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  They're  going  to  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

come  to  some  sort  of  accommodation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  Right.  And  they  would  excise 

  

  

 

 

the  agency  fees  part  of  the  contract. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Even  if  they  did,  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  then  decide  to  fund  the  union? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Oh.  But  that's  a  separate 

   

  

  

 

 

question. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  If  ­­ if  they  wanted  to  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ahead  and  fund  the  union,  as  I  said,  they've  got  some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion  to  do  it.  I  think  the  one  area  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  doesn't  have  the  power  to  subsidize  speech  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  it's  engaged  ­­ subsidizing  political  speech  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

viewpoint­discriminatory  way. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Let's  ­­ let's  take  that

MR.  CARVIN:  Oh,  okay.  Then  I'm  maybe  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

understanding  it.  If  ­­ if  the  union  is  ­­ could  they

but  of  course  no  State  ­­

they  assess  ­­ why  can't  they  assess  all  of  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees  a  tax  for  that  contribution? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Right.  And  that  was  the  point 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  was  trying  to  get  to,  which  is  agency  fees  don't  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  to  collective  bargaining.  As  we  know,  they  also  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  political  activity.  And  I  don't  think  the  government 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

could  fund  political  activity  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

viewpoint­discriminatory  way.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Is  there  any  history  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

American  labor  management  relations,  at  least  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back,  I  don't  know  what,  75,  80  years  of  employers 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paying  for  unions?  I  thought  the  union  movement  was 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  this  long  ago. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Your  ­­ your  recollection  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

history  is  correct.  And  of  course,  currently  no

Under  the  NLRA,  it's  a  felony  for  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

employer  to  give  the  unions  money  because  it  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

influence  the  unions,  and  contrary  to  the  entire

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Is  it  a  bargainable 

   

  

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  Excuse  me  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Is  it  a  bargainable 

   

  

 

 

subject?  I  mean,  it's  a  political  subject.  I  suppose 

    

    

   

 

 

you  can  enact  a  statute  that  says  the  government  will 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fund  you,  but  is  ­­ is  it  bargainable?  Is  it  one  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  items  that  the  union  can  bargain  for? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  It  doesn't  exist,  it's  never 

  

 

 

 

 

 

existed  in  American  society,  and  there's  no  way  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  employer,  particularly  because  agency  fees  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  statute,  could  all  of  a  sudden  say,  sure,

giving  money  to  unions,  because  they've  always  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

funded  through  voluntary  contributions. 

 

 

 

            

If  they  did  become  recipients  of  Federal  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  funds,  that  would  impose  all  kinds  of  restrictions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  their  speech  and  other  activities  that  the  unions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumably  would  never  have  asked  for  wholly  apart  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  funding  shortfall. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  have  a  different  ­­

    

   

 

 

somewhat  different  subject,  but  it  ­­ and  I  don't  know 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  to  get  you  to  focus  on  this  exactly.  Because  I  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  there  are  good  arguments  on  your  side,  and  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  good  arguments  on  the  other  side. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

When  you  go  into  this,  it  was,  in  my  view,  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  compromise  40  years  ago.  But  it  was  40  years 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ago.  It  was  40  years  ago.  I  mean,  maybe  Marbury  v. 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Madison  was  wrong.  There  are  people  who  argue  certain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspects  were. 

 

            

And  the  concerns  I  ­­ I  have  in  terms  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

workability  are  not  so  much  the  details.  I  guess 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  would  work  out  in  the  labor  area.  It  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  affect  the  bar.  It  would  certainly  affect  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

integrated  bar.  It  would  certainly  affect  at  least 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

student  fees  at  universities.  It  would  require 

  

 

 

 

 

 

overruling  a  host  of  other  cases,  I  think,  at  least  two 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  three  that  I  can  find,  and  that's  quite  a  big  deal.

MR.  CARVIN:  It  certainly  is. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  so  ­­ so  what  is  it,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

your  mind,  that  you  can  say  from  the  point  of  view  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court's  role  in  this  society  in  that  if,  of  course, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  can  overrule  a  compromise  that  was  worked  out  over  40 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years  and  has  lasted  reasonably  well  ­­ not  perfectly. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  guess  people  could  overrule  our  decisions  just  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

easily.  I've  had  a  few  dissents.  In  those  dissents  I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  I'm  right  and  the  others  are  wrong,  and  then  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  wrong  and  they're  right.  All  right?  There  are  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot  of  people  who  think  that.  Do  you  see  where  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going? 

            

I'd  like  you  to  talk  for  a  minute,  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  a  matter  of  considerable  concern  to  me,  even  when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  on  the  other  side  of  something. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Justice  Breyer  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  you  ­­ you  start

of  us  as  a  kind  of  stability  in  ­­ in  a  world  that  is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tough  because  it  changes  a  lot. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  And  I  think  you  put  your  finger 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

on  precisely  the  same  question.  I  think  the  principal 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  to  overrule  Abood  is  that  all  of  the  rationales 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offered  in  support  of  Abood's  result  directly  conflict

Abood,  you  ­­ you  don't  do  what  you're  saying,  you  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  the  opposite. 

 

 

            

If  I  could  walk  through  the  list  for  you: 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  standard  of  review,  the  ­­ the  new  rationale  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Abood  is  it's  subject  to  deferential  government  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer  review.  It's  contrary  to  Harris,  it's  contrary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  Knox,  it's  contrary  to  Abood  itself,  which  is  huge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pickering  analysis. 

 

            

The  notion  that  the  union's  duty  somehow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justifies  agency  fees  because  they've  got  a  duty  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

represent  nonmembers,  which  we've  chatted  about,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes  from  the  dissenting  opinion  in  Lehnert.  So  you'd 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  overturn  Lehnert,  which  characterizes  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  as  turning  the  Court's  principles  on  its  head 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  is  wholly  unworkable  in  the  name  of  preserving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  precedent. 

 

            

The  notion  that  collective  bargaining 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  involve  matters  of  public  concern,  which  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  offered  up,  that's  contrary  to  Harris,  Abood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself,  which  said  it  was,  Pickering,  which  involved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basic  issues  of  school  finances,  so  you  would  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strike  all  of  those  down. 

 

 

 

 

            

Respondents'  radical  arguments  that  it's  not

commercial  speech  doctrine  is  contrary,  not  only  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Abood,  every  Abood  case,  and  the  Harris  dissenting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion  because  ­­

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Carvin  ­­

  

 

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  ­­ because  everyone  recognizes 

  

 

 

 

 

there's  some  First  Amendment  protection. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  mean,  it  seems  to  me  ­­ I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess  we  have  one  disagreement,  which  is  how  well  Abood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fits  with  all  of  our  other  employee  speech  cases, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  I  think  Abood  fits  pretty  well.  It  didn't  cite 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pickering,  but  it  essentially  had  the  exact  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerns  as  Pickering,  which  was  the  employer's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest,  the  ­­ the  government's  interest  as  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer,  and  how  that  related  to  an  employee's  speech 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  and  ­­ and  basically  arguing  for  a  ­­ a  balancing 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

test. 

            

So  ­­ so  really  what  your  argument  comes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down  to  is  two  very  recent  cases,  which  is  Harris  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Knox.  And  there  you  might  say  that  Harris  and  Knox  gave 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indications  that  the  Court  was  not  friendly  to  Abood. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  those  were  two  extremely  recent  cases,  and  they  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both  cases  that  actually  were  decided  within  the  Abood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

framework. 

            

In  the  Harris  case,  the  parties  came  here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  explicitly  asked  us  to  overrule  that  case.  Almost

all  the  briefing  was  about  overruling  that  case,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  decided  not  to  overrule  that  case  and  instead  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  ­­ that  the  employees  there  were  ­­ were  simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  public  employees  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  taking  two  extremely  recent  cases,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admittedly  expressed  some  frustration  with  Abood,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  specifically  decided  not  to  overrule  Abood,  I  mean, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  seems  like  it's  ­­ it's  nothing  of  the  kind  that  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

usually  say  when  we  usually  say  that  a  precedent  has  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  overturned  because  it's  come  into  conflict  with  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entire  body  of  case  law. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Again,  I  must  respectfully 

   

  

 

 

disagree.  I  think  the  classic  justification  for  stare 

    

 

 

 

 

 

decisis  overturning  the  case  is  that  subsequent  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  undermined  the  reasoning  and  principles  there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  we  can  certainly  agree  that  Harris 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  Knox  certainly  undermined  the  doctrinal 

 

 

 

 

 

underpinnings  of  Abood.  The  fact  that  they're  really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

recent  as  opposed  to  not  so  recent  doesn't  change  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  Abood  has  been  overwritten. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Citizens  United  pointed  to  two  differing 

 

 

 

 

 

lines  of  cases  in  the  First  Amendment  area  as  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principal  rationale  for  overturning  Austin.  The  Hudgens 

  

 

 

 

 

 

v.  NLRB  case.  In  Logan  Valley,  it  upheld  something.  In

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  I  ­­ I  ­­

   

   

  

 

MR.  CARVIN:  This  doesn't  ­­ this  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'll  accept  that.  Let  me 

  

  

 

 

 

 

accept  that  what  you  can  do  is  you  can  go  through  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  good  at  it,  and  so  is  the  other  side.  You  know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  go  through  the  cases  and  you  draw  the  line  here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there,  and  the  other  place.  And  I'm  trying  to  abstract 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  that  in  a  very  basic  way  for  this  reason.

should  have  been  overruled  because  it  was  basic,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  a  right  to  treat  people  equally,  and  there  were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

millions  of  people  who  were  not.  Now,  you  see  the  level 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  abstraction  I'm  working  at? 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  if  I  put  that  same  level  of  abstraction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  I  see  the  following:  You  will  go  out  this  door, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  you  will  buy  hundreds  of  things,  if  not  thousands, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  money  will  go  from  your  pocket  into  the  hands  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people,  including  many  government  people,  who  will  spend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  on  things  you  disagree  with.  I  don't  see  anything 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too  basic  in  the  lines  you're  drawing  there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  second  thing  is,  what  you  said  was  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it's  true  ­­ employees  can  say  what  they  want. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're  talking  about  six  people  in  a  room  bargaining

about  wages,  hours,  and  working  conditions.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

pretty  far  removed  from  the  heart  of  the  First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment,  and  pretty  close  to  ordinary  physical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity  carried  on  through  words.  Regulation,  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

like. 

            

So  I  can't  find  a  basic  principle  that's 

   

   

 

 

 

there  that's  erroneous  as  in  these  major  cases  that  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  overruled.  And  if  you  have  a  response  to  that,  I'd 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  to  hear  it. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Sure.  As  to  requiring  people 

  

  

 

 

 

 

to  give  money  to  ­­ which  they  don't  wish  to  give, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Thomas  Jefferson  said  that  was  sinful  and  tyrannical. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

James  Madison  famously  said,  requiring  three  pence  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  thing.  So  ­­ so  it's  not  at  all  something  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've  invented. 

 

            

For  example,  you  couldn't  require,  as  Rutan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes  crystal  clear,  people  to  give  money  to  a  political 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

organization.  Because  money  is  not  money  when  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

supporting  speech;  it  is  ­­ it  is  association  with  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advocacy  organization.  And  the  compelled  association  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

something  that  this  Court  has  consistently  condemned  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basic  to  the  ­­ Abood  itself  said  it's  contrary  to  the

it  ­­ it  was  something  that  Justice  Breyer  said;  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  respond  directly  to  it.  He  said  if  Abood  falls, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  so  do  our  decisions  in  Keller  on  mandatory  bar 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

association,  on  student  activities  fee. 

 

 

 

 

            

Do  you  ­­ you  agree  that  that  would  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequence  of  your  theory? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Well,  no.  In  fact,  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

hypothetical  was  completely  eliminated  by  Harris,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  it  quite  clear  that  neither  Keller  nor  Southworth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  in  any  jeopardy,  because  the  rationale  of  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  was  significantly  different  than  the  rationale  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Abood. 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Those  cases  ­­

  

 

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  Keller  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ start  with  Abood,  Mr. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Carvin.  Those  cases  say  Abood  is  the  framework,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  cases  decide  the  questions  that  they  decided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically  within  that  framework. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  A  lot  of  cases  cite  cases,  but 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  is  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  It's  not  a  cite.  It's  a  ­­

   

   

  

  

 

 

this  is  the  way  we  look  at  mandatory  fee  cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Again,  I  must  respectfully 

   

  

 

 

disagree.  They  do  have  that  in  common  at  that  level  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generality,  but  there's  a  key  distinction,  as  ­­ as

Harris,  itself,  pointed  out,  between  giving  money  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bar  association,  and  giving  money  to  a  union. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  key  thing  is  that  the  bar  association  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  nonspeech  restriction.  It's  like  what  the  Court  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Glickman  commercial  speech  context.  The  initial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

association  has  nothing  to  do  with  speech.  There,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  regulating  lawyers,  not  advocating  on  behalf  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyers. 

            

            

And  if  those  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Bar  associations  do  things 

  

 

 

 

 

all  the  time  that  lawyers  disagree  with.  They  engage  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  kinds  of  litigation  and  not  other  kinds  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation.  They  take  public  policy  positions  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

certain  issues  and  not  other  issues. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  I  ­­ I  think  it  would  be  impossible 

   

   

 

 

 

 

to  make  a  distinction  along  that  score. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Keller  struck  down  those  kinds 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  activities  by  bar  associations,  taking  positions  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  jurisdiction,  taking  position  on  gun  control. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  said  they  could  only  spend  money  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Do  you  think  bar

germane  to  lawyer  ethics  or  service,  then,  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition,  it's  a  violation  of  Keller.  So  I  sure  hope 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  bars  are  not  violating  the  clear  pronouncements  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court. 

 

            

The  ­­ Keller  only  upheld  expenditures  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  a  necessary  incident  to  their  principle  role  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulating  lawyer  ethics  and  legal  behavior.  All  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  things  that  were  law­related  were  struck  down  in

associations  that  you're  compelled  to  join  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

condition  of  your  practice  do  not  get  into  those  things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Oh,  absolutely.  If  ­­ if  they

Could  you  address  briefly  the  opt­in/opt­out 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement,  an  issue  which,  I  take  it,  is  in  the  case,

And  my  short  answer  ­­ and  I  am  running 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  of  time  ­­ is,  if  this  regime  is  upheld,  that  means 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tomorrow  the  State  of  California  could  say  every  public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  contributes  1  percent  to  the  governor's 

   

 

 

 

 

reelection  campaign  unless  they  affirmatively  opt  out  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  so. 

 

            

No  one  thinks,  realistically,  that's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

voluntary  decision  to  give  money.  There's  only  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  behind  that  kind  of  requirement,  which  is  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inflate  the  governor's  political  war  chest,  just  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  only  purpose  behind  this  is  to,  through  inadvertence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  neglect,  inflate  the  union's  war  chest  by  people  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  have  not  made  a  voluntary  decision  to  do  so. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Unless  there  are  further  questions,  I'd  like

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  EDWARD  C.  DUMONT 

 

 

 

 

 

    

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT  ATTORNEY  GENERAL  OF 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                       

CALIFORNIA 

            

MR.  DUMONT:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

California  understands  the  First  Amendment 

 

 

 

 

interests  that  are  involved  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  State  also  has  critical  interests  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  free  to  manage  the  public  workplace,  much  like  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  employer,  unless  we  are  improperly  leveraging 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  employment  role  to  coerce  or  suppress  citizens' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speech. 

            

So  let  me  try  to  briefly  address  why  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  if  we  are  going  to  have  collective  bargaining  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  public  sector,  mandatory  agency  fees  can  serve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  State  interests  without  unduly  burdening 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens'  speech.

could  I  just  ask  you  a  preliminary  question  that  came  up 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

earlier  in  the  argument? 

 

 

 

            

Do  you  think  that  the  California  Teachers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Association  is  an  agency  of  the  State  of  California?

MR.  DUMONT:  No.  I  think  a  ­­ a  ­­ a  union 

    

   

   

   

  

 

that  becomes  an  exclusive  representative,  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Perry  case,  has  an  official  place  in  the  functioning  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  school  district.  But  it  is  not  ­­ it  does  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

become  an  organ  of  the  State. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that's  actually  a  very  important  point. 

   

 

 

 

 

Precisely  because  of  the  company  union  concern,  what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delicate  about  this,  from  the  State's  point  of  view,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  want  ­­ if  we're  going  to  have  collective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bargaining,  we  need  to  have  a  system  where  there's  one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representative  that  we  can  deal  with,  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representative  has  to  be  both  a  good  partner  for  us, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  our  point  of  view,  but  also  perceived  by  the

Excuse  me. 

 

            

Finish. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No.  Go  ahead. 

  

  

 

 

 

MR.  DUMONT:  Well,  which  is  why  it's  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  that  we  not  fund  it  directly,  and  that  we

to  the  final  legislative  approval  or  ­­ or  board 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approval  stage,  what  kind  of  system  can  we  have, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimately,  that  will  be  a  workable  system,  both  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  employees  who  overwhelmingly  have  shown  they  want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collective  bargaining,  and  for  the  local  managers, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  actual  managers  of  local  governments,  of

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  If  your  employees

that's  been  raised  is  ­­ is  really  insignificant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUMONT:  With  respect,  I  disagree  with 

   

  

 

 

 

that.  Because  many  people  can  want  something  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense  they  view  it  as  very  advantageous  to  themselves, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  if  they  are  given  a  choice,  they  would  prefer  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  it  for  free,  rather  than  to  pay  for  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

This  is  a  classic  collective  action  problem. 

   

 

 

 

 

So  when  we  ­­ so  from  the  employer's  point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  view,  when  we're  going  to  have  collective  bargaining, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  want  one  union  to  deal  with.  We  want  that  union  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deal  with  all  employees.  And  so  we  require  it  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

represent  all  employees  fairly,  whether  they  supported 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  union  or  not.  They  might  have  supported  the  rival 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unions.  They  might  be  in  favor  of  unionism,  but  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supported  a  different  one.  But  once  the  majority  has 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

said  this  is  our  representative,  then  that  is  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

represent  all  employees. 

 

 

            

And  it's  important  then,  from  the  employer's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  of  view,  that  that  representative  be  adequately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

funded  and  stably  funded,  so  that  they  can  work  with  us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  work  with  the  employer  to  reach  actual  progress. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  it's  ­­ it's  almost 

  

 

 

 

 

 

axiomatic.  When  you  are  dealing  with  a  governmental 

   

  

 

 

 

 

agency,  many  critical  points  are  matters  of  public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern.  And  is  it  not  true  that  many  teachers  are  ­­

strongly,  strongly  disagree  with  the  union  position  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

teacher  tenure,  on  merit  pay,  on  merit  promotion,  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

classroom  size? 

 

            

 

And  you  ­­ the  term  is  free  rider.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

union  basically  is  making  these  teachers  compelled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

riders  for  issues  on  which  they  strongly  disagree. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Many  teachers  think  that  they  are  devoted  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  future  of  America,  to  the  future  of  our  young 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people,  and  that  the  union  is  equally  devoted  to  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  that  the  union  is  absolutely  wrong  in  some  of  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

positions.  And  agency  fees  require,  as  I  understand 

   

  

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ correct  me  if  I'm  wrong  ­­ agency  fees  require 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  employees  and  teachers  who  disagree  with  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

positions  must  nevertheless  subsidize  the  union  on  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  points. 

 

            

MR.  DUMONT:  And  let  me  ­­ what  I'd  like  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  is  to  separate  out  the  important  public  policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues,  which  we  do  not  deny  cross­cut  between  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public's  fear  and  the  ­­ the  realm  of  citizens'  speech 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  ­­ the  isolated  collective  bargaining  realm. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  ­­ they  do  cross­cut,  but  that  ­­ that  does  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean  that  the  two  spheres  are  the  same. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  in  the  collective  bargaining  context, 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  employer  needs  is  to  get  one  agreement  with  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

group  of  employees,  which  we  do  by  having  one  union.

It's  a  democratic  process.  The  employees  get  to  pick 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  union.  And  because  it's  a  democratic  process, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

almost  ­­ it's  almost  guaranteed  that  not  everyone  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree  with  all  the  positions  that  are  taken  by  the  union 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  represents  the  majority  of  employees. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

From  the  employer's  point  of  view,  we  need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  get  a  contract,  is  to  have  one  representative  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  speak  with  one  voice  for  all  those  disparate  people. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  I  understand  that  you'll  be  speaking 

   

 

 

 

 

on  ­­ on  delicate  issues.  And  the  important  point  here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  outside  the  context  of  getting  a  contract,  we  do 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  try  to  suppress  at  all  the  wide  or  enriched  variety 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  viewpoints  that  employees  may  have  as  citizens.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  can  express  them  in  the  legislative  realm.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  express  them  at  the  workplace,  just  not  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bargaining  room. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Do  union  ­­ do  unions  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  relations  programs  of  ­­ or  newspaper  articles,

the  unions  actually  make  those  arguments,  and  aren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  chargeable  expenses? 

 

 

            

MR.  DUMONT:  The  union  is  engaged  in  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

variety  of  speech.  Some  of  it  is  chargeable  and  some  of

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  The  problem  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

everything  that  is  collectively  bargained  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  is  within  the  political  sphere,  almost  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition.  Should  the  government  pay  higher  wages  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lesser  wages?  Should  it  promote  teachers  on  the  basis

Is  that  constitutional? 

 

 

MR.  DUMONT:  I  don't  know  the  answer  to  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

question.  I  don't  think  it's  the  question  presented 

    

 

 

 

 

 

here.  It's  not  what  the  union's  here  ­­ it's  not  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  that  they  have  taken  in  this  litigation.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  there  is  a  need  to  adjust  that  line,  which  there

here  is  whether  that  line  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  one  of  the  questions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  whether  the  ­­ whether  Abood  is  workable.  So  I  do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  relevant  to  know  whether  you  think  that  is  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  side  of  the  line  or  the  other. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUMONT:  I  think  there  are  arguments 

    

 

 

 

 

about  why  that  kind  of  thing  could  be  considered  germane 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  bargaining.  But  what  is  most  important  to  the  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  would  not  be  preserving  that  line.  I  don't  want  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concede  it,  but  that  is  not  the  fundamental  point  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  is  fundamental  is  that  we  need  to  be  able  to  run 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  workplaces,  and  that  involves  prescinding  somewhat

MR.  DUMONT:  I'm  sorry.  Any  ­­ any 

  

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  we  have  ­­ I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  sort  out.  We  have,  as  you  know,  three 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondents  here,  and  I'm  trying  to  sort  out  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  position. 

 

            

Is  there  anything  ­­ in  ­­ any  way  in  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  presentation  disagrees  with  the  union's 

 

 

 

 

 

presentation  in  its  ­­ in  its  brief? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUMONT:  I  don't  think  there's 

    

 

 

 

necessarily  any  fundamental  disagreement.  I  think  we 

    

 

 

 

 

would  emphasize  that  our  interests  here  are  not  ­­ are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

primarily  interests  of  employees  in  coming  to  practical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accommodations  here. 

 

            

There  was  a  long  history  in  California  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  '50s  and  1960s  of  labor  unrest.  It  led  to  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commission  that  ­­ that  issued  a  ­­ a  report  that  was

others.  This  issue  of  agency  fees  was  part  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debate  that  went  into  the  legislative  decision  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

early  '70s  to  adopt  this  ­­ this  system,  and  we  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  a  legitimate  legislative  decision. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  General  DuMont,  you  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are  arguing  that  ­­ and  I  sympathize  with  ­­ with  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need  of  the  State  to  have  an  efficient  system  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealing  with  its  employees,  and  I  can  agree  that  dealing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  just  one  union  makes  everybody's  life  easier. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Why  do  you  think  that  the  union  would  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

survive  without  these  ­­ these  fees  charged  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonmembers  of  the  union?  Federal  employee  unions  do  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  not  charge  agency  fees  to  nonmembers,  and  they  seem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  survive;  indeed,  they  prosper.  Why  ­­ why  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California  different? 

 

            

MR.  DUMONT:  The  Federal  situation  is 

  

 

 

 

 

different.  They  have  very  different  scope  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

bargaining.  I  wouldn't  say  that  it's  been  established 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  prosper.  They  have  about  a  30  percent 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

membership  rate. 

 

            

            

And  from  ­­

unions?  How  ­­ how  many  are  members  of  the  union?

I  don't  know  that.  Mr.  Frederick  may  ­­ may  know  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Because  you  ­­ you've 

  

 

 

 

 

pointed  out  the  membership  is  low  in  the  Federal  sector. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  there  is  no  bargaining  about  pay,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUMONT:  There  is  no  bargaining  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

pay;  that's  correct. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  General,  there  was  no 

  

 

 

 

 

fact­finding  below  on  this  assumption,  factual 

 

 

 

 

 

assumption  of  whether  ­­

 

 

 

            

at  all. 

 

            

MR.  DUMONT:  There  has  been  no  fact­finding 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  No  factual  development. 

  

 

 

 

So  there's  a  presumption  in  the  question  posed  which  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  can  survive,  but  we  don't  know  that  factually. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUMONT:  We  don't  know  that  factually. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

The  State  would  prefer  not  to  take  that  risk,  and  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  the  Constitution  requires  us  ­­

You're  the  one  that's  saying  we  need  to  do  this  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise  it  won't  survive.  It  seems  to  me  the  burden 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  ­­ is  on  you  to  suggest  why  that's  so.

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  You  have  a  compelling 

   

  

 

 

MR.  DUMONT:  With  respect,  Your  Honor,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

interest. 

            

don't  believe  that  what  we  need  to  show  is  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

union  would  not  survive  without  this.  From  our  point  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view,  the  question  is  are  we  using  a  technique  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  sector  uses  widely  that  is  reasonable  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  of  view  of  the  employer  and  that  doesn't  impose  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undue  burden. 

 

            

And  let  just  me  say  for  just  a  moment  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  burden  that's  involved  here,  because  I  don't  want  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimize  it,  but  let's  remember  that  there  is  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal  attribution  of  this  speech  here  to  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  employee.  There  is  no  restriction  on  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  employee's  speech  as  a  citizen,  either  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

workplace  or  out  of  the  workplace.  All  this  speech  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

workplace­related,  and  if  it's  not,  then  that's  a  matter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It's  odd  to  say  that  if  X 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  required  to  pay  $500  for  someone  to  espouse  a  belief 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  he  doesn't  share,  that  he  is  now  free  to  go  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  argue  against  it.  That  means  he  has  to  spend 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  $500  so  that  it  balances  out?  That  makes  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense.

is  ­­ to  me,  Your  Honor,  this  case  is  very  much  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Southworth,  because  what  we  have  here  is  something  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  important  to  the  State  to  have  a  system  in  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  are  not  the  speaker,  because  that  would  defeat  the

Southworth  was  to  have  students  speak  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  The  whole  idea  of 

  

 

 

 

 

Southworth  was  a  public  forum. 

   

 

 

            

Are  you  saying  that  the  whole  purpose  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency  fees  is  to  have  an  open  public  forum? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUMONT:  No.  I'm  saying  it's  to  have  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

bargaining  forum,  but  that  it  is  legitimate  when  we  have

representative.  Overruling  Abood  now  would 

  

 

 

 

substantially  disrupt  established  First  Amendment 

 

 

 

 

doctrine  and  labor  management  systems  in  nearly  half  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country. 

            

Let  me  talk  about  what  a  collective 

   

 

 

 

 

bargaining  is,  and  how  the  agreement  is  struck,  and  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  evolves  over  time.  Because  it's  not  simply  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  where  there  might  be  a  severability  provision, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

but  it  is  really  system  of  agreements  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established  over  time,  and  a  body  of  relationships  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

build  up. 

 

            

And  if  you  look  at  the  Joint  Appendix,  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  several  examples  of  collective  bargaining 

 

 

 

 

 

agreements.  They  are  very  long,  detailed  agreements 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  include  a  wide  range  of  services  that  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

negotiated  between  the  union  and  the  government.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  of  these  are  monetary.  Many  of  these  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hot­button  issues,  to  be  sure,  Justice  Kennedy,  but  many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  them  are  also  mundane  issues  about  health  and  welfare 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits,  what  times  teachers  need  to  show  up,  how  long 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  lunch  break  can  be  without  having  to  perform  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duty,  what  the  policies  are  for  transferring  teachers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  and  among  school  districts,  and  these  are  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basic  services  that  require  research,  legal 

 

 

 

 

 

representation,  conferring  and  consulting,  communicating

all  members  of  the  workforce  are  before  the  union 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presents  a  ­­ a  policy  ­­

   

   

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  I  suppose,  if  that's 

   

  

 

 

 

so  convincing,  the  union  can  convince  teachers  to  join 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  union. 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well  ­­ and,  in  fact,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

California,  the  overwhelming  majority  of  the  teachers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  in  the  union,  and  it's  only  a  small  percentage  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  opted  not  to. 

 

 

 

            

But  I  would  go  further,  Justice  Kennedy,  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

saying  that  what  we  are  talking  about  here  are  a  range 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  services  that  they're  providing.  We're  talking  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  service  fee  for  the  State  law  that  provides  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusive  representative  to  be  the  union  when  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voted  for  by  a  majority  of  the  workers. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  here,  this  Court's  cases  have 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguished  between  citizens'  speech,  where  the  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

teacher  who  might  disagree  with  the  union's  position  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

free  to  go  and  speak  publicly  about  that  position,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employment  speech,  where  this  Court's  cases  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraordinarily  deferential  to  the  government  in 

 

 

 

 

 

upholding  restrictions  on  what  speech  employees  may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make.

philosophically,  if  you  use  Pickering  in  this  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  committing  error  of  composition.  You're 

  

 

 

 

 

comparing  a  whole  group  of  persons  who  have  their  views

Pickering  is  just  inapplicable  on  that  ­­ on  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ground. 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well,  Justice  Kennedy,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

think  that  it  is  fair  to  suppose  that  the  government,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deciding  whether  it's  going  to  establish  a  relationship 

   

 

 

 

 

 

with  its  workers  and  were  to  get  input,  is  necessarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  dealt  with  a  cacophony  of  views  unless  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes  up  with  a  reasonable  system  of  management  to  get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  views  collected  and  have  them  represented  by  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusive  representative.  And  that  is  the  basic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

trade­off  that  Abood  recognized. 

 

 

 

            

And  I  would  note  that  because  different 

   

 

 

 

 

States  have  chosen,  based  on  their  history,  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

culture,  their  experiences  with  the  labor  management 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system  in  the  private  sector,  to  come  up  with  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

results. 

            

And  here,  I  would  say  that  Wisconsin  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Michigan,  which  recently  adopted  alterations  to  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  management  sector,  established  this  point. 

 

 

 

 

 

Because  on  the  one  hand,  the  legislature  in  Wisconsin 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided  we're  going  to  do  away  with  public  sector  agency

fees  for  school  teachers  and  for  government  workers,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  going  to  keep  it  for  public  safety  officers, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police  officers,  firefighters,  because  we  determined 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  legislative  interest  in  having  agency  fees. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Why?  The  firefighters  brief  in  this  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

explains  that  many  States  don't  have  safety  regulations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  firefighters.  And  so  a  lot  of  these  regulations  end 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  coming  through  the  collective  bargaining  process, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  firefighters  work  out  negotiated  rules  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish  what  is  a  safe  way  to  fight  a  fire. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  all  of  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  still  survive  if  the  Petitioners  prevail,  unless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  basic  argument  that  if  you  do  away  with  agency's  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency  fees,  the  unions  are  going  to  collapse  and  not  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  position  to  negotiate  those  safety  requirements. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Chief  Justice,  the  necessity 

  

 

 

 

 

standard  has  never  been  the  standard  when  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  operating  as  employer  or  proprietor.  It  has  always 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  a  case  that  you  would  judge  the  agency  ­­ the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  decision  on  the  basis  of  what  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  or  reasonable. 

 

 

            

And  if  you  look  at  it  from  that  standard, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  firefighters  are  saying  here  is  that  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  essential  to  have  agency  fees,  because  they  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using  those  fees  to  benefit  all  of  the  workers  in  the  ­­

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I'm  sorry.  They're 

  

  

 

 

 

getting  additional  equipment  that  the  county  may  not  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able  to  afford? 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  That's  right.  The  union 

  

  

 

 

 

members  and  the  nonmembers  of  the  union  in  the  ­­ in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unit  are  putting  their  money  together  through  the  agency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fee  process  so  that  the  union  is  supplying  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  There's  something  other 

  

 

 

 

than  that.  That  would  be  the  same  as  Justice  Scalia's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  which  raised  an  issue,  and  we  heard  it  before. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  ­­ your  ­­ your  last  colleague  mentioned  this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

California  needs  this  rule  that  it  has, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  wants,  on  the  other  side  of  the  bargaining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

table,  a  coherent  group  of  people  to  negotiate  for  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

workers  on  wages,  hours,  working  conditions,  et  cetera. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  the  Chief  Justice  said,  I  can 

   

 

 

 

 

understand  that  argument  if  the  alternative  is  the  union 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  destroyed,  because  then  there's  nobody.  And  you  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  argument's  a  good  argument  because  they're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  buy  fire  trucks  and  some  other  things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Is  there  anything  else  that  backs  up  that

MR.  FREDERICK:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  think  it's  important,  and 

    

 

 

 

 

argument? 

            

            

I'd  like  you  to  explain  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Yes.  The  flip  side  is  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  briefs  and  the  City  briefs  that  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

submitted  in  this  Court  note  what  happened  when  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency  fee  process  didn't  occur. 

 

 

 

 

            

In  New  York  City,  for  example,  there  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strikes  that  were  occurring  all  of  the  time  until  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency  fee  ­­ fee  system  was  put  into  place,  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enabled  the  City  to  better  deliver  transit  services, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school  services,  and  the  like. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

So  you  have  both  the  positive  story  by  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  ­­ I  don't  understand 

    

   

 

 

that.  I  just  absolutely  don't  understand  it.  Why  ­­

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

why  would  agency  fees  enable  the  city  to  do  things  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  couldn't  do  before? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Because  it  enables  all  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  workers  to  know  they  are  making  a  shared  sacrifice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  purpose  of  working  together  to  establish  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coherent  position  with  their  employer.  That's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  You  say  that,  but  I  ­­ it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  mean  anything  to  me.

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  You  have  a  union 

   

  

 

 

bargaining,  and  the  city  says  no.  And  you're  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  if  there  are  enforced  fees  to  the  union,  the  city

your  argument  cuts  exactly  the  opposite  way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  ­­ the  problem  that's  before  us  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  or  not  individuals  can  be  compelled  to  support 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political  views  that  they  disagree  with.  And  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying,  well,  the  reason  they  should  be  able  to,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  they  do,  then  those  political  views  are  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevail.  They  are  opposed  to  particular  funding. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

That's  why  they  don't  want  to  join  the  ­­ that's  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  don't  want  to  join  the  union,  because  the  union  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pushing  that.  But  you  say  you  should  force  them  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  the  union  will  prevail,  contrary  to  the  objecting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee's  views. 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  No.  What  I'm  saying,  Mr. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Chief  Justice,  is  the  States  can  make  rational  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  judgments  that  for  their  workability  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system,  they  can  have  an  agency­fee  process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Abood  recognized  the  very  Federalism 

 

 

 

 

interests  that  are  at  stake  here,  where  different  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  different  experiences,  and  this  is  an  opportunity

everyone.

position. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Do  you  think  you  can  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  obviously  one  thing  that's  come  up  is  ­­ I  know 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you're  right  on  this  ­­ the  Thaler  law  was  a  mess. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  was  strike  after  strike.  But  what  you  would  like  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show  is  that  that  approach,  compared  to  the  assessment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  wage­,  hour­,  and  working­condition­related  fees, 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  latter  makes  an  improvement  in  the  coherence  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  union's  position,  and  therefore  there  will  be  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  strikes. 

 

            

That's  something  like  that  is  what  you're

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well,  Justice  Breyer,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

guess  the  question  is,  are  you  going  to  decide  a  case  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  constitutional  significance  on  the  basis  of  a

that  point? 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  I  think  that  is  a  one  of

There  are  a  lot  of  assumptions  underlying 

   

 

 

 

 

your  adversary's  position,  whole  set  of  questions:  Can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  union  survive? 

 

 

            

            

Hold  on.  I  have  about  ten  of  them. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Is  it  necessary?  And  your  adversary  says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ or  one  of  my  colleagues  has  said  you  bear  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden. 

            

But  this  is  an  overturning  of  a  decision  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

stare  decisis,  isn't  it? 

 

 

 

            

point  ­­

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  That's  correct.  And  the 

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  what  burden  do  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have,  or  is  it  your  adversary  who  has  to  show  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reliance  interests  that  the  foundation  is  wrong, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

et  cetera? 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  We  submit  that,  given  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

four­decade  history,  they  have  the  burden  to  demonstrate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  way  the  system  has  worked  would  be  unworkable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  it  were  to  be  ­­ if  it  were  to  be  sustained. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  Justice  Kennedy,  back  to  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point.  I  appreciate  that  a  prosecutor's  memo  might  be 

    

   

 

 

 

 

viewed  in  your  eyes  as  workplace  speech  whereas  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

teachers'  position  about  what  size  the  classroom  might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  may  not  seem  the  same  way  as  workplace  speech.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  of  government's  perspective,  I  think  you  have  to

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  no,  Mr.  Frederick  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  You're  again  talking  about 

  

 

 

 

 

a  whole  class  of  persons  whose  speech  has  been  silenced, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  just  one  person. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Big  difference. 

  

 

 

MR.  FREDERICK:  ­­ their  speech  isn't 

  

 

 

 

 

silenced.  They  are  paying  a  service  fee  so  that  a  ­­

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  exclusive  representative  can  negotiate  their  health 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  welfare  benefits,  their  mileage  reimbursement,  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole  set  of  things  that  ­­ voluntary  teacher  transfer

during  the  course  of  the  day. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

These  are  all  relatively  mundane  points. 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  think  you  would  agree  with  me.  And  there's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  in  the  agency  fee  process  that  suppresses  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ability  of  teachers  to  speak  out  publicly,  and  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  process  because  the  law  itself  allows  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merit  pay  to  be  a  subject  of  bargaining  if  a  minority  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  teachers  can  convince  the  majority  that  this  is  a

­­ your  ­­ I  think  you  would  at  least  agree  we're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealing  with  some  sensitive  and  important  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues.  What  is  the  ­­ the  burden  on  the  union  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counter  ­­ weighs  against  those  of  simply  requiring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opt­in  as  opposed  to  opt­out?  At  least  then  you  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ensure  that  people  are  making  a  conscious  decision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  supporting  the  union  before  they're  compelled  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  that. 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  On  the  second  question 

  

 

 

 

 

presented,  we  think  that  the  decision  ought  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirmed  because  Abood  correctly  recognized  that  here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  there  was  basically  no  burden  on  the  person  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted  to  opt  out,  that  that  was  in  itself  a  core 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  what  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

saying,  it's  easy  for  the  person  to  check  a  box  saying  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opt  out.  It's  also  easy  to  check  a  box  saying  opt  in. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  It's  administratively  ­­

  

 

 

 

actually,  in  a  system  where  the  overwhelming  majority  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  we're  talking  about  more  than  90  percent  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  are  paying  the  fees,  even  those  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonchargeable  fees  under  the  Lehnert  line  to  support 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political  activities,  it's  administratively  much  easier 

 

 

 

 

 

to  count  a  smaller  number.

of  their  constitutional  rights  is  such  as  to  rise  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

level  of  compulsion.  Here  we  would  submit  that  where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  one­page  checkbox,  they  can  send  it  in,  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  able  ­­ and  every  Petitioner  on  the  other  side  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

successfully  opted  out  of  paying  those  ­­ that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden  is  on  them  to  show  that  the  government  has  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  unreasonable  choice  as  to  the  kind  of  administrative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scheme  that's  been  established. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  opt­in  is  ­­ opt­out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  always  as  easy  as  you  ­­ as  you  say.  In  one  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  prior  cases,  I  think  that  anybody  who  wanted  to  opt 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  had  to  send  a  certified  letter  within  a  certain 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

period  of  time. 

 

 

            

Now,  suppose  somebody  says  I  don't  want  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

pay  this  year.  I  don't  want  to  ­­ I  ­­ I  never  want  to 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay.  What  is  the  justification  for  saying  that  person 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  opt  out  every  single  year? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well,  let  me  just  say  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  perpetual  opt  out  is  not  an  issue  in  this  case.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ had  it  been  raised,  it  very  well  might  be  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acceptable  way  to  do,  to  say  I  want  to  opt  out  until 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further  notice.  That's  not  been  presented  or  argued 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

If  it  were  to  be  argued,  there  are  reasons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  that  might  be  appropriate.  But  here,  having  an

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  GEN.  DONALD  B.  VERRILLI,  JR. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

        

FOR  THE  UNITED  STATES,  AS  AMICUS  CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

               

SUPPORTING  THE  RESPONDENTS 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

            

Let  me  begin  by  summarizing  the  three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental  reasons  why  Abood  should  be  reaffirmed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First,  in  the  four  decades  that  Abood  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  the  law,  this  Court's  jurisprudence  in  the  area 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  ­­ of  employment  relations,  First  Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisprudence  in  the  area  of  employment  relations  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

converged  with  Abood  in  a  way  that  fortifies  its 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

foundations  and  does  not  erode  them,  because  what  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  have  recognized  is  when  the  government  is  acting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  employer  managing  the  workforce,  it  should  receive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonableness  review  in  order  to  give  it  the  latitude

comparable  to  that  of  a  private  employer  to  manage  its 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

workforce,  and  not  exacting  scrutiny  that  applies  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  is  a  sovereign  regulating  the  citizens. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Second,  in  those  four  decades,  more  than  20 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  have  enacted  and  enforced  laws  that  allow  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  employers  in  those  States  to  have  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

latitude  that  Congress  gave  private  employers  to  decide, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  on  workplace  needs  and  local  conditions,  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency  fee  requirements  will  help  them  achieve  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes  for  which  they  ­­ for  which  they  adopt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collective  bargaining. 

 

            

And  the  reliance  goes  far  deeper  than  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  State  laws  and  the  thousands  of  contracts  affecting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

millions  of  people  that  are  based  on  those  laws.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  States,  the  agency  fee  requirement  has  worked  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way,  woven  its  way  into  the  fabric  of  the  relation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  workers  and  management  and  the  public's  fear. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  those  States,  the  unions  have  taken  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  obligations  as  training  and  the  like,  funded  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency  fees  that  make  the  workplace  more  effective  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

management,  as  well  as  more  effective  for  employees. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  you  were  to  take  those  away,  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  disrupt  those  long­term  relationships  that  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

developed  over  time,  and  the  expectations  that  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

developed  over  time,  and  you're  going  to  replace  them

with  a  different  kind  of  a  situation  in  which  the  union 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  going  to  have  a  different  set  of  incentives,  trying 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ trying  to  ensure  that  the  maximum  number  of  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  willing  to  pay  union  fees. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  way  that  the  unions  are  likely  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

try  to  do  that  is  through  trying  to  convince  employees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  ­­ that  they  need  the  union  because  otherwise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

management  is  going  to  do  them  harm.  And  I  do  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that's  a  significant  problem  here  for  public 

   

 

 

 

 

 

employer  perspective  now,  in  a  time  of  budgetary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

constraints,  when  difficult  decisions  have  to  be  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  cuts  have  to  be  made. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It's  of  great  benefit  to  the  employer,  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  as  employer,  to  have  the  union 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participate  in  those  judgments  so  that  they  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perceived  as  fair  as  the  ­­ by  the  workforce,  and  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  union  then,  in  effect,  vouches  for  management 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  workforce  and  prevents  disruption.  So  I  do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  reliance  interests  go  very  deep  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  the  third  point  I  would  make  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we're  talking  about  overruling  a  precedent  of  40 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

years'  standing.  There  need  to  be  ­­ needs  to  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

showing  of  changed  circumstances,  it  seems  to  me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  with  respect  to  the  question  of  ­­ of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  role  that  agency  fee  ­­ the  role  that  agency  fees

play  in  the  process,  I  think  it  is  quite  important,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  goes  to  a  point  you  raised,  Justice  Scalia.  Abood 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

never  said,  and  no  case  since  Abood  has  ever  said,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency  fees  are  necessary  to  union  survival.  Abood 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  have  said  that,  because  when  Abood  ruled  as  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did,  Taft­Hartley  had  been  on  the  books  for  decades. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  with  respect  to  the  private  sector,  what  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  said  with  respect  to  the  private  sector  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employers  get  to  choose.  Employees  get  to  decide 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  agency  fee  will  help  them  achieve  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

workplace  goals.  And  what  the  Court  said  in  Abood  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  public  employers  ought  to  have  the  same  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choice  to  respond  to  workplace  needs  and  local

justification,  that's  what  I  hear  most  prominently  in

Pickering.

disagree  with  that  as  a  technical  matter.  I  think  Abood 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

did  cite  Pickering.  And  if  one  looks  at  the  briefs  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Abood,  the  parties  on  both  sides  were  arguing  Pickering. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

But  beyond  that,  I  think  ­­

   

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  In  ­­ in  ­­ in  terms 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  that,  but  in  terms  of  the  substantive  analysis,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  really  seriously  be  called  a  Pickering  case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No.  But  I  think  it 

   

  

  

 

 

shares  ­­ what  I  said  at  the  outset,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  I  think  the  key  point:  That  this  Court's  First 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  law  in  the  public  employment  context  has,  over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time,  converged  with  Abood,  in  that  the  cases  generally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  recognized  that  when  government  is  acting  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer,  it  has  interests  that,  if  government  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acting  as  sovereign  regulating  the  citizenry,  wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suffice  to  justify  conditions  on  speech. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  Pickering  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

Pickering  is  the  heart  of  your  argument,  so  I  ­­ I  do 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  ask  you  a  couple  of  questions  about  it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Is  it  different  from  the  situation  here  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

several  respects?  One  was  brought  out.  Pickering  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Pickering  cases  involve  the  termination  or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discipline  of  a  public  employee  after  ­­ a  single 

   

   

 

 

 

 

employee  after  the  employee  has  made  a  statement  that  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  which  the  employer  objects.  This  is  a  prospective

rule  that  applies  to  a  huge  category  of  employees. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  second  is  whether  restrictions  on  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees  can  say  are  the  same  as  compelling  an  employee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  make  a  statement  or  subsidizing  a  statement.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  as  to  the  ­­ as  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  ­­ there  are  circumstances, 

  

 

 

 

 

are  there  not,  in  which  the  Department  of  Justice  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terminate  or  take  an  adverse  employment  action  against  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

DOJ  employee  for  something  that  that  employee  says  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizen  on  a  question  of  public  concern.  That  could  be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

done,  could  it  not? 

 

 

 

            

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Are  there  any  circumstances

that  goes  right  to  the  difference,  right  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  between  government  acting  as  employer, 

 

 

 

 

 

managing  the  workplace,  and  government  acting  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign,  regulating  the  citizenry. 

 

 

 

            

In  the  latter  situation,  what  this  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  would  say  is  that  that  is  not  government  acting  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manage  the  workplace;  that  is  government  leveraging 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  ­­ its  control  over  the  employee,  acting  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign,  affecting  that  person  in  his  role  as  citizen, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  would  get  exacting  scrutiny. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that  ­­ so  that  ­­ I  think  that's  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

key.  We're  not  arguing  that  Abood  applies  of  its  own 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms.  We're  arguing  that  there's  an  insight  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlays  Abood,  and  it  underlays  Garcetti,  and  frankly, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  underlays  the  political  affiliation  cases  as  well. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Because  if  you  look  at  those,  what  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  all  say,  contrary  to  what  my  friends  say,  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  government  can  show  the  political  affiliation  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  requirement  for  the  effective  performance  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  job  in  question,  that  that  affiliation  requirement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  be  upheld.  That,  again,  is  not  exacting  scrutiny; 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  reasonableness.  Every  case  lines  up  along  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

axis.  And  so  ­­ and  I  ­­ I  think  that's  the  key  point 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  Pickering. 

 

            

And  if  I  could,  I  just  want  to  address  a

couple  other  points. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  I  ­­ when  ­­ when  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

when  a  union  is  bargaining  about  a  matter  of  ­­ of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  concern,  you're  saying  that  that's  ­­ that  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  as  commenting  on  a  matter  of  public  concern? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No.  What  I'm  saying  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that  it  occurs  in  the  context  of  the  ­­ the  collective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bargaining  relationship,  which  is  a  ­­ which  is  ­­ it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  be  subject  to  a  different  set  of  constitutional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards.  It  has  to  be;  because,  think  about  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

With  respect  to  collective  bargaining, 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  specialized  channel  of  communication  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

government  sets  up.  The  government  controls  who  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

speak,  when  the  discussion's  going  to  occur,  and  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

topics  can  be  discussed. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  All  of  that  is  true. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Nobody  ­­ nobody  denies  that.  But  the  problem  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  not  the  same  as  a  private  employer,  that  what  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bargained  for  is,  in  all  cases,  a  matter  of  public 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest.  And  that  changes  the  ­­ that  changes  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation  in  a  way  that  ­­ that  may  require  a  change  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  rule.  It's  one  thing  to  provide  it  for  private 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employers.  It's  another  thing  to  provide  it  for  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government,  where  every  matter  bargained  for  is  a  matter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  public  interest.

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  But  I  guess  what  I  would 

   

   

  

 

 

say  about  that,  Justice  Scalia,  what  I  read  this  Court's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  as  saying  in  the  employee  speech  context,  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  petitioning  context,  in  the  political 

 

 

 

 

 

affiliation  context,  is  that  you  ­­ yes,  it's  not  wholly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

free  of  First  Amendment  scrutiny.  But  recognizing  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  interests  as  employer  and  prerogatives  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer,  you  apply  reasonableness  review  and  not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exacting  scrutiny  that  applies  when  government  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulating  as  a  sovereign  regulator. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  guess  ­­ isn't  it  ­­ is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ you  may  know  ­­ the  case  in  which  government  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer  is  most  likely  to  want  to  control  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  says  and  where  he  has  the  right  to  do  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likely  to  be  a  case  that  involves  the  institution's  job, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

i.e.,  the  public  interest. 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yes.  Certainly, 

  

  

 

certainly.  That's  why  ­­ that's  why  I  think  there  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  doubt  in  Garcetti  that  the  speech  was  not  a  matter  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  concern.  And  I  could  have  said  the  same  thing  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Borough  of  Duryea  and  any  number  of  these  courts'  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases. 

            

That's  not  the  ­­ that's  not  the  distinction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  has  drawn.  The  distinction  the  Court  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawn  is  between  government  acting  as  employer  managing

the  workforce,  and  the  government  as  sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulating  the  citizenry. 

 

 

            

And  I  respectfully  submit  that  that  ­­ that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  distinction  applies  with  equal  force  here,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

especially  given  the  stare  decisis  considerations 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  ought  to  govern  this  Court's  decision  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  context  that  that  is  more  than  sufficient  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uphold,  to  reaffirm  Abood.  Because  as  I  said,  what  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  cases  have  recognized  through  all  the  public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer  context  is  the  same  principle  for  which  Abood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stands. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  General,  you  seem  ­­ and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

everybody  seems  to  equate  government  subsidy  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  speech.  Do  you  think  our  cases  give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  subsidy  the  same  analysis  as  they  give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compelled  speech  or  compelled  silence? 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  May  I  answer,  Mr.  Chief 

   

  

 

 

 

Justice? 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Sure. 

  

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  What  I  would  say  about 

   

  

 

 

 

that,  Justice  Sotomayor,  is  that  in  this  context,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsidy  goes  to  the  process  of  contract  formation  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  administration  within  that  collective 

 

 

 

 

bargaining  context  that  I  described  earlier,  that  of

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MICHAEL  CARVIN 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Thank  ­­ thank  you. 

  

 

 

 

 

As  to  the  absence  of  a  factual  record  here, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  important  to  point  out  that  we  gave  them  an  amended 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer  where  they  could  make  any  allegation  they  wanted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  at  page  4  of  their  so­called  opposition,  it  said,  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quote,  "The  unions  do  not  oppose  the  entry  of  a  judgment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  pleadings." 

 

 

            

Why  is  that?  Because  they  certainly  ­­ it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  burden  to  argue,  for  example,  that  agency  fees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  lead  to  the  demise  of  the  union.  But  they  didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  any  such  allegation  in  their  answer.  They  didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  any  such  allegation  in  response  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg's  question,  and  they've  got  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts  and  terms  of  the  union's  fiscal  well­being. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  because  they  can't  make  such  an  allegation  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real  world. 

 

            

How  do  we  know  that?  Twenty­five  states 

  

 

 

 

 

 

prohibit  agency  fees.  Not  one  union.  Read  the  amici. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

See  if  you  can  see  one  example  of  the  union  capitulating

because  of  that.  The  federal  government  doesn't  allow 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency  fees.  And  only  a  third  of  the  members  are  union 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members,  and  yet,  that  ­­ that  union  survives.  Whereas 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  we  have  90  percent  union  membership,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Frederick  said  90  percent  of  the  nonmembers  continue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  contribute.  So  the  notion  that  anything  could  happen 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adversely  here  simply  doesn't  square  with  things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  notion  that  Abood  put  forth  that  there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  Federal  policy  in  favor  of  agency  fees  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely  contrary  to  the  fact.  29  U.S.C.  6  ­­ 164(b) 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

allows  ­­ excuse  me  ­­ prohibits  agency  fees  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  prohibits.  So  it  allows  states  to  prohibit  agency 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees.  Conversely,  it  preempts  states  that  seek  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

require  agency  fees. 

 

 

            

So  the  Federal  policy,  not  only  with  respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  their  own  workforce,  but  to  the  respect  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  workforce,  is  contrary  to  agency  fees. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  response  to  Justice  Kennedy's  question, 

 

 

 

 

 

yes.  There's  a  stark  difference  between  single 

   

  

 

 

 

personnel  decisions  and  group  decisions.  NTEU,  which  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  Pickering  case,  makes  that  quite  clear.  Even  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pickering  context  when  there  was  a  general  rule  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  outside  honorarium,  the  Court  made  it  clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  burden  of  justification  is  much  higher.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't  come  close  to  this  burden  of  justification,

because  they  can't  possibly  show  that  agency  fees  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lead  to  the  end  of  the  union. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  contrary  to  my  brethren,  that's  the  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing  that  matters.  We're  talking  about  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  interest  as  an  employer.  All  they  care 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about,  according  to  Abood,  is  having  one  union  instead 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  two  so  they  only  have  to  speak  to  one  person.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  care  about  how  robust  or  effective  this  union  is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indeed,  if  anything,  they  don't  want  them  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effective,  because  nobody  wants  a  strong  bargaining 

   

 

 

 

 

partner  that's  going  to  drive  up  public  expenditures 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  have  a  ­­

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  what  do  you  do  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  law  enforcement  people  who  submitted  their  brief  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  the  unions  actually  do  training.  They  provide 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

equipment  the  county  can't  afford  with  fees.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  ­­ what  the  ­­ the  General  has  been  saying  is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  to  leave  it  to  each  State  to  decide,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  this  kind  of  agency  fee,  there  are  things  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unions  can  do  that  we  would  choose  not  to  do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CARVIN:  I  am  ­­

    

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  unions  in  California 

  

 

 

 

 

do  teacher  training. 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Exactly,  and  they  do  fire 

  

 

 

 

 

 

training.  They  do  safety  training.  Can  you  think  of

something  that's  more  a  matter  of  public  concern,  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  of  an  ideological  point,  that's  more  important? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  yet  they  dismiss  these  as  somehow  prosaic  issues. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They're  basic  to  our  democracy,  and  that's  why  we  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  absolute  right  not  to  subsidize  it.  No  one's  arguing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  these  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Why?  Why?  If  you're 

  

  

  

 

 

receiving  the  benefits  of  it,  why?  It's  ­­ it's  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit.  You  may  disagree  with  that  judgment  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ but  ­­ and  you  ­­ and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can  speak  about  it  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Because  there's  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ but  why  is  it  hurting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  First  Amendment  right  if  you  can  speak? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  There's  a  great  ongoing  debate 

   

  

 

 

 

about  teacher  training  class  size  in  education  reform 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

today.  The  unions  have  their  right  to  take  their  side 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  that  view.  What  they  don't  have  a  view  ­­ is  a  right 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  demand  that  the  other  side  subsidize  their  views  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  essential  questions  of  ­­ of  basic  public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

importance. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The  case  is  submitted.
