ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM G. UNIKOWSKY 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it please the Court: 

 

 

 

            

Petitioner's brother obtained nearly 

 

 

 

$270,000 in proceeds from the sales of Polar Pure. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner obtained nothing, yet the government seeks to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hold him jointly and severally liable for the entire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount.  That position contradicts the text, structure, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

history, and purpose of Section 853. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The government's position boils down to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory that even though Petitioner did not actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtain this money, he should be deemed to have obtained 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it because his co-conspirator did based on supposed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

background principles of conspiracy law.  But those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

background principles are both inconsistent with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

text of Section 853 and also do not apply on their own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms. 

            

So to begin with our textual argument, I'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like to focus on the structure of Section 853(a) because

Section 853(a) enumerates three categories of property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to criminal forfeiture.  853(a)(1), at issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

here, are proceeds obtained by the illegal activity; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

853(a)(2) addresses the instrumentalities of crime; and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

853(a)(3) addresses the criminal's interest in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal enterprise. 

 

            

So we pointed out in our opening brief that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really joint-and-several liability doesn't make a lot of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

sense as to 853(a)(2) and (a)(3), which supports the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inference that it also doesn't apply to (a)(1).  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's brief states, somewhat surprisingly in my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view, that, in fact, joint-and-several liability for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

co-conspirators applies only as to (a)(1) and does not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply as to (a)(2) and (a)(3).  But that position by the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government really has no textual basis at all so far as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we can discern. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But doesn't it seem that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's some back and forth about what's new and what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

old in the government's theory, is that part of what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changed in the government's theory or not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yeah.  That is one thing 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that's changed.  We quote a Third Circuit case from, I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, two years ago where the government took the exact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposite position and, in fact, persuaded the Third 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit to apply joint-and-several liability under

(a)(2), which is one of the reasons we put this argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

in our brief. 

 

 

            

But the government's change in position, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just cannot reconcile it with the statute at all.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, the government's theory is that (a)(2) and (a)(3) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are somehow tied to ownership whereas (a)(1) is not, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you cannot get that out of the statute.  It just lists 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three categories of property, and if (a)(2) and (a)(3) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are directed to ownership, then so is (a)(1).  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conversely, if the government was faithfully applying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its background principles, it would apply it to all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsections of 853. 

 

 

              

I mean, under the government's theory, if 

 

 

 

 

 

one person obtains something, then they all do under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(1).  Identical reasoning would require that if one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

person, say, uses a car in the conspiracy, they all do 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then there's forfeiture liability for everybody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under (a)(2).  And so I just don't understand the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

distinction that the government has drawn here.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact that the -- the government feels compelled to argue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one thing under (a)(1) and another under (a)(2) and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(3), I think, shows that this is really a form of --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of common law criminal liability that's not required or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not authorized by the text. 

 

 

 

 

              

I just want to say one word about (a)(3) in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

particular, which is about criminal enterprises 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically.  That statute says that a criminal 

   

  

 

 

 

6 

defendant forfeits his interest in, only his interest in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the criminal enterprise, not the value of the enterprise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a whole.  That's a conspiracy-specific forfeiture 

   

   

  

 

statute that requires the person only to forfeit the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest he obtained, which we think is just totally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent with the government's theory than under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(1), which says nothing about conspiracy liability. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's this hidden Pinkerton rule. 

 

 

 

 

            

So another -- another argument we make has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do with the rest of Section 853 as a whole, which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supports our view that really Section 853(a)(1) is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about forfeiture of tainted assets.  And in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's brief, again, they agree with this some --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surprisingly in our view.  They say that yes, Section 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

853(a)(1) only requires a forfeiture of tainted assets, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

which means there is no joint-and-several liability.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the government has essentially admitted here is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that when one person obtains something, in fact, there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is no joint-and-several liability.  Only the tainted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

assets are subject to forfeiture, so only the person who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually obtains it can forfeit it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And, in fact, at the time that Section 853 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was enacted, there was no substitute assets provision,

so at that time, just there was no joint-and-several 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability at all, according to the new theory in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's brief which I haven't heard before. 

   

 

 

 

 

7 

            

So the government's theory is that 

 

 

 

 

 

actually what opens the door to joint-and-several 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability is the separate substitute assets forfeiture 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision in 853(p).  But that just has no basis 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatsoever in the statutory text.  I just ask the Court 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to just read Section 853(p).  What it says is, if based 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on an act or omission of the defendant, property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

described in Section 853(a)(1) is unavailable for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

series of enumerated reasons, then the government can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seek substitute forfeiture.  And I think it's just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

obvious what's that -- that's doing. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What it's saying is that if the defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does something to thwart the forfeiture of the tainted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asset, then the court can go after the defendant's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substitute assets. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I -- I suppose 

   

   

  

 

 

their answer would be that under Pinkerton, when you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about the defendant, you're also talking about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

co-conspirators. 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Your Honor, first of all, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the government doesn't make that argument in their brief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and actually I think it doesn't work.  Because very

frequently, the dissipation of assets will not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attributable to other co-conspirators under Pinkerton. 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

Suppose one person goes to Las Vegas and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gambles away the proceeds of a completed crime.  That 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

would not be in furtherance of the conspiracy.  To the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary, it would just expose the other conspirators to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability, so --

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- what's your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

authority for that proposition? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And under Pinkerton, 

  

 

 

 

 

the -- the need to reach the substitute assets because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of dissipation wouldn't be attributed to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

co-conspirator. 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I think that Pinkerton 

    

 

 

 

itself includes a requirement that attribution requires 

   

 

 

 

 

the act to be in furtherance of the conspiracy, so I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think the Court would have to ask the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but it's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

it -- in furtherance of the conspiracy, we're looking --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the act at issue here is dissipation of tainted assets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the need for substitution.  I don't know that that's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in pursuance of the conspiracy as more as frustrating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the identification of the tainted assets. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, that may be, but I --

I think that when the text of Section 853(p) imposes a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement that specifically because of an act or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

omission of the defendant, and that's what 853(p) says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is a prerequisite to obtain forfeiture against the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant, I think the government either has to show 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that's -- the defendant did something to -- to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause the property to be unavailable, which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government hasn't shown and -- and can't necessarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show in general, or that the act that triggers the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substitute forfeiture, which is the dissipation, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attributable to co-conspirators, which the government 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't think it has to prove and hasn't proved here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I point out on the facts of this case, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no showing of unavailability.  All that happened 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that the government agreed to a plea deal with the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brother in which he would only forfeit a subset of all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the -- the tainted assets.  And so as far as we know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those assets are just in a bank account somewhere.  So 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government hasn't even tried to prove the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements that it claims opened the door to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

joint-and-several liability. 

 

            

So I -- I think that the reason the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

government's theory doesn't work is that it's just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent with these background principles, because 

 

 

 

 

 

we just think that the relevant background principles

are the ones governing, number one, forfeiture, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number two, sentencing, and neither of those background 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

principles attributable in either of those areas support 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

joint-and-several liability. 

 

            

So first as to forfeiture, as I think the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

government agrees, the relevant historical tradition is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in rem forfeiture and there's just no concept of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

joint-and-several liability there. 

 

 

            

question.

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yes.

similar. 

            

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The language is very 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yes.  So --

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if we rule in your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

favor, does that mean we undo the RICO statute as well? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I think there's a pretty 

    

   

 

 

good likelihood of that.  I mean, I admit the language 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

is very similar.  I -- I haven't studied whether there's 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

some other structural difference.  I -- I would guess 

    

   

 

 

 

 

the government would come up with a way to distinguish

this case if it lost this case, but I -- I don't know 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

what that is for sure, but it -- it is true that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language is very similar.  I -- I acknowledge that, Your 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

Honor. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  RICO may be easier to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

prove the joint-and-several concept because RICO is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enterprise as defined. 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  That -- that is true.  So 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

it -- the language in the forfeiture provision is -- is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

similar, but it -- it may be that some background aspect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of RICO or some structural textual argument that doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply here might apply.  But I -- I haven't studied that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

issue specifically, and I'm sure that the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will probably come up with some theory if -- if it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't prevail today. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, how would this work --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

how would your rule work as a practical matter in a drug 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy case or a racketeering case where the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

government can prove that a certain amount of money was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken in by the conspiracy over a period of time and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then it was divide -- presumably, it was divided up in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some way among the members of the conspiracy and -- do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they have to show how much each of them got?  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're not going to do this by check.  It's all going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be by cash.  So how -- how could that work as a

practical matter? 

 

12 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, I think that 

   

  

 

 

Section 853(d) solves at least some of the government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problems in this area, which is this presumption that if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you get money during the conspiracy and there's no other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likely source, it's attributable to the conspiracy.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way that would work in practice is suppose a bunch 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of money comes into a conspiracy, and there's no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific records of how it's distributed, but one day a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspirator buys a yacht or something, or buys a new 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

car. 

            

So the presumption in Section 853(d) allows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the court to presume that the car is tainted.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject -- it's, you know, it's because of the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tainted money, even without a direct proof that a check 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

was given, which I agree will not typically happen. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did the government ever 

  

 

 

 

 

try to invoke (d) here? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  No, Your Honor, there --

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's no record of that at all.  The government's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entire theory in this case has been this pure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

joint-and-several liability, because this conspirator --

 

 

 

 

 

co-conspirator obtained the money, she also obtained the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money.

situation that's similar to what I just -- I just 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

13 

described, where members of the conspiracy have -- have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spent a lot of money.  They've dissipated it in one way 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or another, so they don't have a yacht or some asset 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that can be -- can be identified, but it's clear that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they had -- they had a lot of money and they spent a lot 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of money.  Then what happens? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, I think that, first of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

all, Section 853 has several powerful tools to determine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how much each person obtained.  You can take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

depositions, there's asset freezes, there's a bunch of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

other things. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Oh, come on.  You're going 

  

  

 

 

 

 

to take a, you know, a deposition of somebody, a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mid-level person in a drug -- in a drug enterprise:  How 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

much did you get per week? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, no, but if you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence the person spent money somewhere, you can go to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the place where he allegedly spent the money and try to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure out how much he spent. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Yes, it's true, I can't -- I can't deny that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

there's probably some category of cases where forfeiture 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will be harder under our rule than the government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule, and we think that's just part and parcel of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute that requires forfeiture of tainted property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

except as certain substrate assets are met.  I mean, if 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

you -- if you repeal the obtained element, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government is essentially asking for a judicial repeal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of obtained element, then obviously, in cases where it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hard to prove the obtaining, the government will have an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

easier time winning.  But I just don't think that's the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

way that the Court should construe the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In terms of background principle, so we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already talk about forfeiture, how there's no background 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle of -- of joint-and-several liability in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture.  I think the same is true with sentencing, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the government is essentially saying that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture, which is by statute a component of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence, is joint-and-several in the sense that one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person's payment will decrease another person's payment, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that's just never the way sentencing has worked, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either in criminal sentences or fines. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So we point out that Walter and Daniel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pinkerton, it's true that they were substantively liable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for crimes committed by their co-conspirator, but had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual fines and individual sentences.  And that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

just part of the traditional principle of sentencing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it's tied to an individual's culpability.  So it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't make sense that one person's payment would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reduced based on someone else's plea agreement, because

that's not tied to his own personal culpability. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

So in that sense, joint-and-several 

 

 

 

 

liability is inconsistent with background principles, 

 

 

 

 

 

too.  And I think the overarching point is this really 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't the application of background principles.  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that's the deeper point in this case.  Because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this joint-and-several liability issue has never come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up, ever, in the context of conspiracy law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So what the government is doing is saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it thinks it makes sense as a matter of policy to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply those background principles from very different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contexts to forfeiture law, but altered in different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways.  So there's joint-and-several liability; it 

  

 

 

 

 

applies to some sections but not others, and that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just not the way the Court has read criminal statutes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It does have a number of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

courts -- courts of appeals on its side, doesn't it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  That is certainly true, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the split does favor the government, we agree.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a lot of different ways we point out in our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reply brief where the government's positions in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case actually diverge to some extent from lower courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And in fact, just one very recent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

development I would raise to the Court's attention.  We 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

point out on page 8 of reply brief that the government's

position is -- in this brief is inconsistent with its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position in a pending case in the court of appeals.  So 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

after I filed my reply brief a couple days ago, the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

government actually went ahead and confessed error in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that appeal, even though it's fully briefed and argued, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I believe had won in the district court. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I commend the government for doing that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

I -- I truly believe it acted in the utmost good faith. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And my point is that the fact the government feels 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compelled to confess error days before a Supreme Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument in the court of appeals is in some tension, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my view, with this view that there's this stable body of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law that the Court should just be ratifying.  I think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's just not --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there any -- any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

circuit case on the other side, other than the D.C. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit case? 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  No, Your Honor.  There's a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

district court opinion by Judge Thapar called Solomon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which we quote in our brief, which we think is quite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

persuasive, at least on the reasoning.  But no, there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no other court of appeals decision other than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cano-Flores, which is found in favor of our position. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Is there -- is there any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

indication in the text of 853 that those who framed that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

and adopted it had conspiracy in mind? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I think so, yes.  I mean, 

    

    

 

 

 

Section 853(a)(3) is about criminal enterprises, and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

which is a form of conspiracy.  And that subsection 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

states that you only forfeit your share of the criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enterprise.  So I think that at least as to that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsection, Congress did have at least one form of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy in mind.  And the government agrees that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under that provision, joint-and-several liability does 

 

 

 

 

 

not apply. 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  This is a -- a bit off 

   

   

  

 

 

 

topic, but the statute refers to proceeds that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person obtained directly or indirectly. 

 

 

 

 

            

Do you have a view as to what that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

"indirectly" is doing there and what it encompasses? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yeah.  So, for instance, I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

think this case is a perfect illustration of what it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

encompasses.  So petitioner's brother did not personally 

  

 

 

 

 

 

obtain it.  I think the ownership interest was through 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the corporation that he owned and controlled.  And in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, there's been several court of appeals cases in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which people have held to have indirectly obtained money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it flows to a corporation that ultimately are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

controlling the money.  So that's one example of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

indirectly obtained.

Another example would be if, say, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

petitioner said, well, I want to pay for my -- my son's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

college or my daughter's college education, and someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, okay, well, I'll pay towards that rather than pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to you.  That might be indirectly obtained in the sense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of getting the benefit of the money without actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting it directly. 

 

 

            

So I can't claim to provide a full text on 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

any of -- all the situations in which someone could have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indirectly obtained something, but I think the 

   

 

 

 

 

fundamental distinction in this case is between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indirectly obtaining and just not obtaining it, which we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think is the facts of this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If there are no further questions, I'd like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to reserve my time.

The law treats conspiracy as a partnership 

   

 

 

 

 

in crime, and for that reason it has long been the rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the acts of every member of the conspiracy in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

furtherance of the common plan are attributed to every

other member of the conspiracy.  And that's obviously 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the foundation for the familiar Pinkerton rule of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

substantive criminal liability, that as we explain in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our brief, that same insight, the attribution of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acts of one conspirator to all of the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

co-conspirators, also controls the law's treatment of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspirators in various other contexts. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that, 

  

 

 

 

Pinkerton, it -- it's based on a fiction, right?  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean -- I mean, the defendant may not have been there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when the acts committed; somebody else may have done it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but because he's a conspirator, you treat it as if he 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had done that. 

 

 

            

I'm not sure that that theory works when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're talking about a more focused statute here, where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you tamper only the tainted property.  And I'm not quite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure that that works, because as soon as you engage in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- that fiction, it takes the focus tainted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement away. 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  So I -- I -- I disagree, 

   

   

   

  

 

Mr. Chief Justice.  And I'd like to explain, because I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think this has gotten confused, this broader issue of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tainted versus untainted property and how that maps onto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our view of conspiracy liability.  I think the reply 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief confuses our position on that, and I don't fault 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

my -- my friend for that, but I'd just like to lay out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

our -- our understanding how it works. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Section 853(a)(1) makes the forfeitable 

 

 

 

 

proceeds the tainted property or tainted proceeds the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeitable property.  So if you have two guys who sell 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a bunch of drugs, they do a drug deal and they get a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duffel bag full of cash, the proceeds -- the property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constituting the proceeds that's forfeitable under 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(1) is the duffel bag full of cash.  And if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police catch them on way back home after the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transaction, those specific proceeds are forfeitable. 

 

 

 

 

 

And that's what the government has to seize, and that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's forfeitable under 853(a)(1). 

 

 

 

            

And in that circumstance, I didn't say they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

are both liable for the forfeiture.  The government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't have to prove which of them is responsible for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cash.  But it doesn't make sense to talk about that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in terms of joint-and-several liability, because 

 

 

 

 

 

joint-and-several liability is a concept in law that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

comes into play only when a person is entitled to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recover some sum of money and it can collect that sum 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from anyone. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If -- if they both 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have -- was carrying it, they both have the duffle bag 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and all that, and you say, well, they are both liable

for what's in the duffel bag.  But then one of them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

takes the duffel bag and, you know, buys a car with it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And your theory is the other guy is responsible for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

value of the car. 

 

 

 

            

when --

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Right.  But very often 

  

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And your theory also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is if the other guy, you know, just dropped the person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

off, had nothing to do with getting the duffel bag or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever, the same thing happens.  He's still 

  

 

 

 

 

 

responsible to forfeit the value of the car. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  If it's foreseeable to him, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

yes.  And -- and let me explain why I think that makes 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense.  It's because if you find -- if you're in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation where you still have the duffel bag, you still 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the traceable proceeds, that's what's forfeitable. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If you're not in that situation anymore, if, as is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

usually the case by the time drug defendants or RICO 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants are caught, it's been dissipated, it's been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commingled, it's somehow unavailable, that's the garden 

 

 

 

 

 

 

variety, typical case. 

 

 

            

Everyone agrees that in that circumstance, 

 

 

 

 

 

the government is entitled to recover the value of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeds that have been dissipated.  And there's some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagreement about why that is and how that works, and

I'm -- I'm happy to talk about that.  But I think for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes of the question presented in this case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

everyone agrees that the government is entitled to get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that value of the dissipated proceeds. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So do you have to show one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of these five preconditions in (p)? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  To invoke (p), (p) is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure that allows the government to for -- forfeit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific substitute assets in a defendant's hands, a car 

   

   

 

 

 

 

or a house, something like that.  If the government is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to invoke (p), the government has to show what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one of those five preconditions for (p) has been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  As to one person, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

though, not to the other.  In other words, if we have --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if the chauffeur who drives the -- the kingpin around 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and therefore is going to be a co -- a co-conspirator. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the kingpin does, you know gets the drug money, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decides to buy a Ferrari with it, then sells it.  And he 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has the cash. 

 

 

            

But you can get that cash from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chauffeur.  You don't have to trace it to him somehow. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because he's a co-conspirator in Pinkerton, he is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

considered to have obtained what anybody else had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtained.

MR. FLETCHER:  That's correct.  If you were 

  

  

 

 

 

 

23 

in a situation where the traceable proceeds aren't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

available, then you're in a joint-and-several liability 

   

 

 

 

 

situation --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Listen, I wonder why 

   

  

 

 

 

you call them traceable.  I -- oh, I think your theory 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies even if there -- you don't have to show that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're traceable.  I mean, if you can show they're 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

traceable, he used the drug money to buy the Ferrari, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are you saying that then the co-conspirators, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chauffeur, is not liable for those proceeds? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  If the Ferrari's wouldn't --

  

 

 

 

 

 

if the government has the ability to forfeit the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ferrari still falls under subsection 853(a)(1) it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property -- any proceeds the person obtained directly or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly or indirectly and that property derived from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the proceeds.  If the government can actually show the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duffel bag full of cash was converted into a specific 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

car, and that car's available for the government and can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be forfeited that's subject to forfeit --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but it's odd that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you use P, which would apply to substitute property --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you apply it even though this particular defendant or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the particular person did nothing himself to place the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeds beyond the reach of -- of the court.

MR. FLETCHER:  That's right.  And I think 

   

  

  

 

 

24 

the reason why we would do that when (p) comes into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

play, and I want to get back to an answer to Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kagan's question -- we don't think only way the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government can recover this -- value of dissipated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeds is by invoking P, but when (p) does come into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

play and when the government is seeking to rely on that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it relies on the same principles of attribution that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chief Justice's question suggested earlier, that your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liable as a member of a conspiracy, not only through 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

your co-conspirators act in obtaining the proceeds, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also for any act dissipation of those proceeds. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So in other words you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

saying, the defendant in (p) is the same as the person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in A and both includes co-conspirators as well as the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual defendant or person? 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I think we agree with the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

result.  I just quibbled at the reasoning a little bit. 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

The person described as the defendant before the court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the person for the court, under Pinkerton principles 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though that persons' is responsible for it.  The act of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

co-contributors are attributed to him as a matter of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  And we think that's true under A1, for the act of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtaining property.  We think that's is also true when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his co-conspirators dissipate the property or take other

trails. 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER: Where --

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So what is --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where does it say that?  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean -- I didn't take that point -- you're saying the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word "property"  in A1 is the tainted property. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  And so the defendant 

  

  

 

 

 

 

is liable for the tainted property.  And then (p) gives 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him circumstances where he's liable for other than the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tainted property.  All right. 

  

 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And it doesn't say in A1 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that a person who doesn't have the tainted property is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liable in an equivalent amount.  It doesn't say in (p) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that outside those circumstances the person is liable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for an equivalent amount.  It doesn't say in common law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where you had to proceed against in rem the property, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and there was no way to get the money from a person who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't actually have it because you had to have the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property itself in the proceeding.  So there's no common 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law source.  It doesn't say it in P.  It doesn't say it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in A, and indeed congress, said when they passed this

to anything, we're trying to make it exhaustive.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26 

just where in the statute does it give you the authority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to draw the conclusion that you're drawing? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I think in two ways: 

    

 

 

 

 

Both of them rely on background principles 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of conspiracy liability, but they do so in slightly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different ways.  And so the first one is just to read 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the text of subsection (a) in light of the background 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle of conspiracy liability that informs Pinkerton 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and everything else.  So when it says, a person liable 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to forfeit any property constituting or derived from any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeds the person obtained directly or indirectly. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Here the person didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

obtain it in any odd common English thing until you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying -- that word "obtained" means is property he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't obtain. 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Justice Breyer --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Co-conspirators came and 

  

 

 

 

you say let's look to the common law and the common law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made that argument impossible because if you look to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history of it as I said you had to have the property 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself in an in rem proceeding, so that's why I asked 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the question. 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I -- I understand the 

    

   

 

 

question, but emphasize every single application of the

Pinkerton principle to a substantive crime is atextual 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and would be subject to exactly the same criticism.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a closely related context here, 21 U.S.C. 841(a) 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

27 

makes it unlawful for any person to distribute a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controlled substance, and subsection (b) says any person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who violates subsection (a) can be sentenced.  And yet 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all of the time the term was undisputed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh yeah, that's why I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned the fact -- if -- if you go back into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history. 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- of the forfeiture, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

quite different from that.  The history of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture was you had to have the property itself and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly if we're looking to history and tradition, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history and tradition are the one thing when you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about criminal liability and it seems to me, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is why I asked, quite the opposite.  When you're 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about forfeiture. 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  So the tradition that you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reforming to is a long tradition of civil in rem 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture that this Court has discussed in many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinions, and I think the statute before you today is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very self-conscious departure from that.

ahead --

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Both in terms of making, go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, finish 

  

 

 

 

 

your answer. 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I was just going to say, in 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

two ways both in the terms of what's forfeitable, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeds forfeiture was new in 1970 and criminal and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuant forfeiture was also new when it was enacted in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

RICO statutes. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understand the 

    

 

 

 

idea you argued this is not in rem, but when you -- as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

soon as you say, but we're only after the tainted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property, it kind of sounds like you're in rem under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another label.  In other words, you're sticking with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this piece of property, just as if you were proceeding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in an action against --

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- in rem against 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the property.  So I -- I don't see how you can say it's 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not -- not in rem, but we're only going after the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tainted property. 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I --I understand that tension 

    

 

 

 

 

Chief Justice. 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure. 

  

 

 

MR. FLETCHER:  I think that it's baked into 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

the statute.  The statute describes property that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

29 

forfeitable, and this Court knows from Luis, there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions 853C and E that talk about restraining a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

tainted property before trial.  And I want to talk about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the relation back of the government's title on tainted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property. 

   

But the statute also clear when that tainted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property isn't available, it hasn't been successfully 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrained, the government recover the value of it and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it becomes --

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. --

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  -- in personam liability. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm having trouble with 

  

 

 

 

 

just one component of your argument, many, but one that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the moment, which is the one that led the -- the one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court who's against --

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- on this this issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

was the courier who receives 50 dollars a week or 50 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollars a trip to deliver drugs. 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER: Yes. 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Under your theory that 

  

 

 

 

 

courier who on everyone facts doesn't see more than 50 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollars of whatever the profit is of this drug 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enterprise, that courier is responsible for a million 

   

 

 

 

 

 

dollars, 2 million dollars, 3 million dollars criminal

conspiracy because he took an undisputedly small part. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

Now, assume what logic in -- in rem theory would ever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make a person who's never obtaining that money, those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeds responsible for the larger sum? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Someone --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why should the drug 

  

 

 

 

 

dealer, who in fact got all of the money, minus 50 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollars, why should he be off-the-hook for even a penny 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less than what he put in his pocket because the courier 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened to have a hundred dollars saved? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  So I want to start with the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

courier and explain that the limits of the courier's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability are going to be the scope of the Pinkerton 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle the scope of the conspiracy that he agreed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

join, and the proceeds that were reasonably foreseeable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to him.  And so he can't be held liable for forfeiture 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from -- from proceeds of a drug transaction under our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory unless under Pinkerton, he could be convicted and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sent to jail for the act of carrying out the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transaction.  It -- it doesn't extend an inch further --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

does. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well --

  

 

 

MR. FLETCHER:  -- than Pinkerton liability 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's generally what a 

  

 

 

 

 

courier is responsible for that -- the drug deals he or

31 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  And -- and --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And for those that are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reasonably within the scope of the conspiracy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  And -- and the only point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that I'm making, and I don't think it's disagreeing with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything that Your Honor has said, is just -- that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think it's a great leap to say that once you're in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a conspiracy that has consequences for your liability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one of them is that you can be convicted for the crimes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You'll serve a lot of 

   

 

 

 

 

years in jail. 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  And this is a financial 

   

  

 

 

 

penalty that attaches to drug --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But why does that give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you, assuming you're a victim, the government. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Greater rights against 

  

 

 

 

that one individual as opposed to what forfeiture tends 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to mean against the proceeds of the crime. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're getting a remedy 

   

  

 

 

that's literally unheard of in the background principles 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of forfeiture.

of mostly in the in rem context, but this is in personam 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability that's very different --

 

 

 

 

32 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In what --

 

 

 

 

MR. FLETCHER:  -- from that. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In what other setting 

 

 

 

 

 

other than in RICO and 853?  In what other setting of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law has a similar concept ever existed? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  So, it depends on what you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean by similar concept of law. I --

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Concept where you're 

 

 

 

 

going to be personally liable for something greater than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what you directly obtained. 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  So I think one is the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

restitution context, we point out that the criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants are held jointly and severally liable to pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution to victims, that's now specifically 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized by statute as we explain in our brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Courts of appeals applied the same 

 

 

 

 

 

background principles we're invoking here to reach that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

result even before that. 

 

 

 

              

I also want to emphasize, Justice Sotomayor, 

 

 

 

 

 

that some of your question and some -- I think a lot of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the appeal of Mr. Unikowsky's argument comes from the --

some cases decades, is a scheme in which the only thing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

that a courier or a conspirator is required to forfeit 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

are the proceeds that he actually has or that he somehow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got to enjoy for himself, and that is not the law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's not the -- the statute has not been enacted --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May -- may I, 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr. Fletcher, go back to your saying now this is in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personam no longer in rem, but in -- in personam 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally, it would be a right of contribution.  And I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

take it under your theory, suppose the brother who was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merely the employee of the shop, as the government goes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after that brother for the $269,000, and so the brother 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who owns the store is now off the hook.  The brother 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the government went after would have no right of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contribution.  He would just be stuck with the whole 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing, even though the one who obtained the proceeds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- is -- can -- can go home free if the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decides to make a bargain with that -- with that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant and say we'll forget the forfeiture in your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  You're correct that there's 

  

 

 

 

 

no right of Federal contribution.  I think it's possible 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that someone could seek contribution under State law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm not aware of any case where that's happened, and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I don't know that any State would recognize such a

cause of action. 

 

 

34 

            

But I just want to emphasize I -- I don't 

   

   

   

 

 

 

think that's a anomalous result, because as we point out 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in our brief, the traditional rule was that tort --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tortfeasors who are held jointly and severally liable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not have a right of contribution if they committed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an intentional tort.  And here it's joint-and-several 

  

 

 

 

 

 

liability arising out of a criminal act, knowing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

participation in a criminal conspiracy. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Of course, under your 

  

 

 

 

 

theory, if it worked the other way around, if they went 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after the brother that did get the money and took it, he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would then, under your theory, have a right of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

contribution against the brother who got nothing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's -- that's your theory. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  No.  Our theory is that there 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

isn't -- I'm saying I agree, there isn't a right of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

contribution, that it's joint-and-several liability. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But suppose it's under 

  

 

 

 

 

State law.  Under your theory it would be contribution, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I would assume. 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  If -- if a State law would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

recognize a right to contribution under these 

   

 

 

 

 

circumstances, then the -- the scope of it would be up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to State law.  I suppose someone made to pay the

person who --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If they applied your 

  

 

 

 

 

precedent, the -- the brother who got nothing would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still have to pay half.  That's your -- that's your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory. 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I -- I don't know what 

    

   

 

 

 

principles if -- as I said, I'm not aware of any State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law that has actually recognized this, I'm not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting that they would, I just wanted to complete 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

what source of law might govern the question if it did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exist.  I don't know what principles they would apply. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Fletcher, can I just ask 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you -- and I'm sorry, I'm sure it's -- I'm just not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding it, but if I could just ask you to go 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through the mechanics of this. 

 

 

 

 

            

So there are two co-conspirators.  They come 

  

 

 

 

 

 

away with one bag of money.  Conspirator A takes it, but 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have Conspirator B before you.  He has not taken the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money. 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now, do you first have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

show that Conspirator A's money because -- is that -- do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to show that it's unavailable?  Do you have to

36 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I think we have to show that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's unavailable to the government in that proceeding, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so if --

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  In that proceeding. 

  

 

 

 

MR. FLETCHER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  If they -- if you could go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after Conspirator A, you could find it, he just put it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a bank account, but that's irrelevant.

most of the time people who are -- this comes up in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases where defendants are prosecuted together, and so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the question is if any of them have it, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's going to have it available to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So really you're only saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it has to be unavailable as to Conspirator B.  You do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not have to prove that it's unavailable as to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Conspirator A.  You could know that it's in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Conspirator A's bank account, it doesn't matter.  As 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

long as you can't get it through Conspirator B, you can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go after B for -- for substitute assets. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I think that's right.  Though 

    

  

 

 

 

I want to be candid, I'm not aware of a case that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addresses the question.  You could disagree with me

about that and not disagree with me about what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule ought to be. 

 

 

 

37 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  So then let's --

  

  

 

 

 

 

let's leave that to -- let's bracket that.  Then as to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B, who you do have in front of you, you started by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking a little bit about this -- this (p) section.  Do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to prove that one of these five preconditions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in (p) is satisfied? 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  In order to forfeit 

  

 

 

 

 

substitute property under (p), and -- and -- before you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue, I just want to put on the table that our view 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the government doesn't have to invoke (p).  It can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also obtain a forfeiture money judgment if the directly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeitable property isn't available. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  I'm curious about 

  

  

 

 

 

that, but first let's talk about (b) -- (p). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Sure.  Yes.  If -- if you're 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

trying to forfeit substitute assets under (p), (p) has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements; you have to show that one of five of them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- is satisfied. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And have -- have you shown 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that in this case? 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I believe that we have, yes. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Which one? 

  

 

 

MR. FLETCHER:  I believe that we've shown, I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

38 

think, a number of them.  Cannot be located upon the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise of -- of diligence and has been commingled. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

because --

 

            

And I -- I want -- I just want to emphasize 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And when you say that you've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

shown that, what do you mean? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  What I mean is that in --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

this is the -- the understanding which the case was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigated in district court.  The government came in and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sought a money judgment and there was no mystery about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the rules were.  I want to quote to you from the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's forfeiture memorandum in the district court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It appears as Document Number 107 on the district court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

docket, and this is on page 2 quoting from a Sixth 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit decision. 

 

            

And it says:  "Where the government is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

unable to recover the actual property that is subject to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture, the government can seek a money judgment for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

an amount equal to the value of the property that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutes the proceeds of the drug violation." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, Petitioner could have argued that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prerequisites for seeking a money judgment weren't 

   

 

 

 

 

satisfied, either because we can't get money judgments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and have to go through (p), or if we do have to go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through (p), that we hadn't satisfied those

prerequisites.  We could have made the showing; I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

we could have on these facts, but Petitioner didn't make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those arguments. 

 

            

The only argument that Petitioner made 

 

 

 

 

 

that's relevant to the question presented here is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he couldn't be held jointly and severally liable on a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money judgment.  That's the argument that the district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court adopted --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But in both of these in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your answers, I take it, it happens to say, and we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have -- we're trying B.  And A is around, but we're 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying B who's gotten nothing. 

   

 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Uh-huh.  Yeah. 

  

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, it says you can use 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

853(p) if the property described in subsection (a), as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

result of any act or omission of the defendant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, it wasn't the act or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

omission of the defendant.  It was A who mixed the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

money, who hid it, who went to Mexico, et cetera.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're saying you still can get it from B.  And I guess 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your reasoning is somehow these words, am I right, in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a), "Any property constituted or derived from any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeds the person obtained," okay, you say that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

includes money that his co-conspirator obtained because

of the under --

 

 

 

40 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  If that's so, I just 

   

  

  

 

 

 

want to be sure.  When we get to -- when we get to (e), 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is called protective orders, I suppose on your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory that we have five people in a conspiracy, two, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three are couriers, you know, they were found somewhere 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on a beach and they drove a truck and they have nothing, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or they only each have about a thousand -- no, not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing, but a hundred thousand dollars, and then we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

have A and B, who were the leaders and they have about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 million. 

 

            

So on your theory of protective orders, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue a protective order against all their assets, all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

five, and they can't hire lawyers, a matter which is a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different issue, I understand, they can't hire lawyers. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

They may have to pay, even though the money is way over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there with A and B.  I mean, it does bother me that they 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't even hire lawyers on your theory. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  The -- but I want to be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

emphatic, that's not the result of our theory. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not? 

  

 

 

MR. FLETCHER:  Because, as we explain in our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief on pages 35 and 36, subsection (c) and (e), which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deal with pretrial restraints and relation back are

limited to the property described in subsection (a) --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

MR. FLETCHER:  -- in the hands of either a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular defendant in a nonconspiracy case or when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

41 

you're dealing with conspirators, that is our position 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is specific tainted property. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, suddenly 

  

  

 

 

 

it seems to me we've switched meaning here, because now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're talking about the bag of money.  Now, does the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word "property" -- the bag of money in A, mean the bag 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of money and not the substitute in B's bank account, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which has never seen the light of day in any crime, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't it? 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I think the specific property 

    

 

 

 

 

described in A is the bag full of money. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 

  

 

MR. FLETCHER:  But A in the statute serves 

   

  

 

 

 

 

two functions.  It describes that specific property. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

That property is forfeitable if the government can find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  But if, as is usually the case, the government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't find it, that property fixes the amount of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's entitlement to recover forfeiture --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And you're able to do that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under what statute?  You see, everything until you said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ah, you see the last clauses here, I could follow in a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

42 

statute.  A statute that Congress said this is pretty 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusive. 

            

Now --

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- it's only the things 

  

 

 

 

 

 

following that qualification that I can't find in any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute. 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  So one way that we can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

definitely do that is through the substitute assets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision in Section 853(p).  As we explain, we think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can apply the same principles of attributed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability to a co-conspirator's act of dealing in cash 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

or laundering proceeds or otherwise --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But (p) unfortunately says 

  

 

 

 

 

because of an act or omission --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Of the defendant. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- of the defendant, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

then it adds, if act or omission of the defendant in, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, respect to property described in (a). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, is -- is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

this mysterious bank account which never saw the light 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of day within (a) or isn't it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, it sounds to me, and I'm not -- it does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

honestly sound that way, sometimes you seem to say yes

and sometimes you seem to say no. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Justice Breyer, I -- I 

   

  

 

 

 

43 

apologize if I'm not being clear.  I think our view is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that if the -- the -- let's take it back to the very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simple example where it's a drug deal that's done and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the proceeds are a duffel bag full of cash.  That's the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property described in (a).  That's the property that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeitable under (a).  But if, as is usually the case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that property is gone and not available, the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can recover its value.  One way that it can to do that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is through (p).  Another way that it can do that is, as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my friend mentioned, (p) didn't come into the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

until later, it came in in 1986.  The original statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was enacted in 1984.  And under the original statute, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants made the argument, because the property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

described in (a) are the traceable proceeds, if I've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hidden the proceeds, if I've dissipated them, if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't find them when you convict them, you can't hold me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liable for a forfeiture. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you go over?  Can you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

go over the -- Justice Breyer brought up the question of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel fees.  So let's take our shopkeeping --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

shopkeeper employee.  He says:  Yeah, I have $60,000, 

   

  

  

 

 

 

but if I pay it over to the government I won't have a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cent left to pay my lawyer.

MR. FLETCHER:  So in a pretrial world, the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

44 

government can't stop him from using -- pay -- using his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

funds to pay for a lawyer if those funds are untainted. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 853(e) is the provision that allows pretrial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restraints.  We explained it's the government's position 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that that does not apply to untainted assets. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That was the position of the majority of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts of appeal, but as my friend pointed out, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Circuit had a different rule.  The government 

   

  

 

 

 

 

filed a brief in a case in the Fourth Circuit that took 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a position that was consistent with circuit precedent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but inconsistent with the position we took in our brief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, and we've now withdrawn that and asked Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit to remand. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So in terms of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the -- I don't mean to interrupt, but the substitution 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle doesn't apply with respect to assets that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can seize that are needed for counsel fees? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  The substitution principle 

  

 

 

 

doesn't apply because -- that's -- that's right, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly.  The courts can address the issue, and we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceding that this is the right reading of the statute, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that (p) describes substitute assets, (e) refers only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to property that's described in subsection (a), and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the specific tainted proceeds.

I -- I want to come back, if I could -- to, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kagan, you've asked questions about indirectly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to my friend, and I actually think that's another way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- it's the other way to read the statute to get to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our result, which is that everyone agrees that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute requires the forfeiture of proceeds that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant does not obtain personally, that he obtains 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indirectly. 

            

And some of the examples that my friend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives are, if the proceeds go to a closely-held 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporation or to a lawful partnership or something like 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  And our view -- and this is reflected in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts of appeals' decisions -- is they were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly odd to depart from the traditional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle that one member of a conspiracy is liable for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the acts of the other members of the conspiracy in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context in which the statute invites forfeiture of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeds that a person doesn't obtain personally. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Because the law regards a conspiracy as a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

partnership where all members are partners and act as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each other's agents.  And we don't think it's any great 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leap to say, as the court of appeals have done, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indirectly obtain proceeds when the criminal enterprise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of which you are a part obtains those proceeds, and the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government doesn't have to show how the funds traced

through the conspiracy and who actually ended up with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46 

how much, because you're all fairly regarded as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indirectly obtaining the proceeds that were obtained by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the conspiracy as a whole. 

   

 

 

            

            

The other point I want to make is --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Fletcher, if I could, 

   

  

 

 

 

I'm awfully sorry --

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Oh, no. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- but let's just take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the -- the case where there are these two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspirators and one takes the cash and it's in his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basement.  But the other one is the one before you, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  And let's put aside the extrastatutory money 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgments, since I don't understand really how that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

works, so let's just focus on (p).  All right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, do you -- you said you don't have to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you don't have to show that it's really unavailable. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You just have to show that it's unavailable as to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspirator before you. 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Unavailable to be forfeited 

  

 

 

 

 

in the proceeding before the court.  Yes. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  And then how do you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

show that these (p) conditions have been met as to that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular person?  In other words, he never had the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeds, so which acts could he have taken that

dissipate the proceeds under (p)? 

 

 

 

 

47 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Because the (p) conditions 

  

 

 

 

 

aren't focused so much on the -- on the person; they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focused on rendering the property unavailable.  So the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is --

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But there is nothing --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it begins by saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

act or omission of the defendant. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Correct.  Yes.  But our view 

  

  

  

 

 

 

is that the defendant is accountable for the acts of his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

co-conspirators --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you just said that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other conspirator might not have dissipated them at all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They're sitting in his basement. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  So I think, in that case, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Justice Kagan, I think our view would be we could make 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the showing under (p) that they are unavailable to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government, because in this case, presumably, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government -- the government doesn't know that they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sitting in the other conspirator's basement, because if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government did, they'd be prosecuting that guy and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attempting --

from him. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You have your choice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

48 

of getting the money either from the guy who is holding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it in the basement, or from the other guy.  Right?  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can choose.  It's not -- it's not a precondition for you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recovering from the, whatever it is, the chauffeur, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bag man, to show that the money is not available from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the kingpin. 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  The question is, is it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

available to be forfeited in the -- in the proceeding in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And if it's only a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding against the one guy, you can get the money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from him, even though the money is sitting in a bag in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the kingpin's basement. 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Correct.  Yes. 

  

  

 

But I -- I just -- I want to be clear --

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And even though you can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

show that -- this is why I keep on coming back to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preconditions of (p).  You really can't show a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular act or omission that led to the dissipation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the assets in these particular five ways. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Well, if that's the case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kagan, you might disagree with me about how to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read (p), and if you read (p) that way in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

hypothetical you just described, then that defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have an argument the government couldn't invoke 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(p) as to him. 

 

 

 

49 

            

But I really think a lot of the discussion 

   

   

 

 

 

 

that we've had about how (p) works and how money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgments works are really ancillary.  They inform the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question presented, to be sure, but they are not the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question presented.  The question, as this case has been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigated and as it comes to the Court, there's no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question that the government can get a money judgment. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's no question that it can proceed through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substitute assets if it can invoke (p). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The question is who has liability for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount, and the rule that was reflected in the decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

below and the rule that we think is correct is that when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government is in that decision where the traceable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeds are gone and it's trying to recover the value 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the proceeds, how is that liability allocated amongst 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the conspirators.  And we think, in accordance with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional principles of conspiracy liability, the 

 

 

 

 

 

correct measure is the amount that was foreseeable to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each conspirator. 

 

            

Because the alternative -- and this gets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to the point I made to Justice Sotomayor, or was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

starting to about couriers -- is that you're going to be

sticking people with liability based on the amount of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money that they touched.  It's not just the amount of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money they got to enjoy or spend or ultimately keep; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50 

it's the amount of money they obtained.  And so when a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person sells drugs, he obtains the whole proceeds of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transaction and then passes it along to somebody else, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he can be held liable for that entire amount even though 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he didn't keep all that much of it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's reflected in the Casey case which we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cite in our brief, and also in Judge Boudeen's opinion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Hurley.  And we think a system that instead makes 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture liability depend on the amount that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreseeable to the defendant is a more sensible way to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allocate the monetary penalty in Section 853.

litigated below, the way the government has litigated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case throughout was its theory that Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

853(a)(1), and specifically the word "obtain," was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough to establish joint-and-several liability.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

51 

what the government has said is that it uses the word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"obtained," and that simply means that that imputes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everyone in the conspiracy and that's enough to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish Petitioner's liability for forfeiture of any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount that was not actually forfeited from Petitioner's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brother. 

            

And so we have always taken the position, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistently through that litigation -- throughout this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation, excuse me, that that's the wrong reading of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 853(a)(1).  The correct reading is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"obtained" refers to assets that you actually got.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can't forfeit tainted assets unless you have them, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and so it doesn't apply to untainted assets. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So the government's position in this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is completely different from the positions it took 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

below.  It's essentially conceding that under Section 

  

 

 

 

 

 

853(a)(1) itself, forfeiture is unavailable except as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against the tainted assets.  So the government's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

arguments that it seems to have -- that we waived 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something below is just completely incorrect.  It's just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

abandoned the very theory under which it obtained -- or

under which it prevailed in the Sixth Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52 

            

So then we get to the issues about 853(p) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the money judgments, and I think I heard counsel say 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in his presentation that Section 853(p) does not provide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the exclusive methods for the government to obtain a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture against tainted assets.  I think that's a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

reference to the argument in their brief regarding the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules of criminal procedure, and that there's forfeiture 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money judgments discussed in Rule 32.2, and that is just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly wrong. 

 

            

First, the rule itself -- itself says that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government can only forfeit assets that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available by statute. 

 

 

            

Second of all, the rules enabling that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just obviously prevent the government from -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requiring forfeiture that is not authorized by statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through a rule of criminal procedure.  I think it's 

    

   

 

 

 

 

pretty clear what this rule of criminal procedure is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing, and we cite an Eighth Circuit case that says what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're going to say right now, which is to say it says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it's a procedural mechanism of implementing the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

substitute property provision.  So the government can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

say:  Okay, we're going to forfeit your substitute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

property, whether you spent the money or you hid the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money.  Maybe you don't have money right now, but the

money that is going to come in is going to be property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- substitute property that's forfeitable. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So that is a classic purpose of a rule of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

criminal procedure.  It's a procedural rule to implement 

   

  

 

 

 

 

a statutory entitlement to forfeiture under 853(p).  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not expend the government's ability to obtain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture through this joint-and-several liability 

 

 

 

 

system. 

            

So when one looks at Section 853(p) and sees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the exclusive method of obtaining forfeiture against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

untainted assets, that's the criteria in Section 853(p), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government doesn't meet them.  The government said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the first time in oral argument in this Court that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in it couldn't locate through due diligence and maybe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this was commingled, it never made his arguments in his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs, never made his arguments below, and it also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never even argued it in its oral presentation that it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner themselves -- himself that did those things, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or that his co-conspirator's actions can be attributed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Petitioner for purposes of Section 853(p).  And so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government really has never tried to establish, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot possibly establish on the facts of this case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it can obtain forfeiture under Section 853(p). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And just taking a step back, I think it's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

pretty clear what Section 853(p) is doing.  What that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

54 

doing, and the legislative history confirms this and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

text itself confirms this, is that it's saying that if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you obtain a tainted asset and you thwart the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture, you can't get away with it because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government is going to come after substitute assets.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you -- you collect a million dollars in tainted 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property and you hide it offshore or you spend it in Las 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Vegas or something, that doesn't mean you can get away 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with it.  That's why the statute says because of an act 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the defendant to render unavailable the property that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is described in (a) that's the tainted property, if that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happens the government can seek substitute property. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it seems to me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that just another -- a reiteration of your earlier 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument.  I mean, of the defendant in (a) and of the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant here, but under Pinkerton, the defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

includes the co-conspirators. 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  But I -- again, I push back 

   

   

  

 

 

 

against that because I think that's only true -- the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pinkerton principle itself says that actions are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attributable only in furtherance of the conspiracy, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so I -- I --

   

   

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, what if the 

  

 

 

 

 

dissipation was in furtherance of the conspiracy?  Put

the -- the cases that you're talking about aside. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So, first of all, I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think that the government shows that, but at least that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be some theoretical textual argument, remember, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's focused only on (p) rather than (a), which has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been the government's theory throughout. 

 

 

 

 

              

I would still disagree that 

 

 

 

joint-and-several liability is authorized because I just 

   

 

 

 

 

think there's extremely powerful textual, structural, 

 

 

 

 

 

and historical indications that it's just not authorized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the statute.  For instance, the comparison with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(2) and (a)(3), which the government doesn't respond 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to.  The background principles, which they just don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

work at all.  So -- and I'd like to turn to those.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just don't think Pinkerton has any application in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context of the statute period. 

 

 

 

 

            

The government talks a lot about hornbook 

   

 

 

 

 

law, and hornbook law attributing activities to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

co-conspirators.  But I think it's important to 

   

  

 

 

 

recognize that those old hornbooks would never have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized the principle that the government is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advocating here, because the hornbooks would have talked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about sentencing and though no content -- no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

joint-and-several liability under any circumstances, and 

 

 

 

 

 

those hornbooks would have talked about forfeiture which

was in rem. 

 

 

            

Now, it's true that it's in personam rather 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56 

than in rem now, but there's a -- that -- that's a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural difference in how the money is collected, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is a -- different from saying that there's a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference in what money is collected.  In other words, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the object of the forfeiture is the same, even the way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in which it's collected has changed.  And, in fact, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government confirms this when it -- it actually concedes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that 853(a)(1) only focuses on the tainted property, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly like in the in rem forfeiture regime.  So I --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I --

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I don't know how much 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you can get out of the in rem forfeiture caselaw since 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this isn't in rem.  You couldn't have joint-and-several 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability in an in rem proceeding. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  That is true, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So I -- I -- what's the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

relevance of that? 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  The relevance is that the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the background principle, these ancient principles that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government tries to employ --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, wait.  You have ancient 

  

  

 

 

 

 

principles of -- of in rem.  But this is not in rem. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This was a radical change from what -- what occurred 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

before. 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Right.  But the fact that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

57 

it's in personam versus in rem doesn't change the fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it's the tainted property that's the object of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture, which is, in fact, the government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concession.  It says (a)(1) is an in personam statute. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's part of a criminal judgment.  It's not a separate 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

civil proceeding.  But the thing that's forfeited is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same thing that had always been forfeited, which is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tainted assets.  So I don't think the procedural change 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

affects the structure of our argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought the argument was 

    

 

 

 

 

there simply to say there isn't an old tradition of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting B, who's in the basement, and I -- and I forget 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where they all are at this point.  Getting the courier 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to forfeit his own money which isn't in the bag.  Okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There is an ancient tradition of what they're trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do.  That was the point of the in rem proceeding, wasn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it? 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  That is the exact point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we're making, Justice Breyer. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And Congress said it -- it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not -- we do not intend in their report any significant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expansion of the scope of property subject to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture, or that's your point.

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  That -- that is indeed our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

point, Justice Breyer.  Thank you for articulating it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

better than I did. 

   

 

            

that. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, I'm not -- not saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I -- I think that -- that 

    

   

 

 

 

 

the -- there's a broader point here, which is that, in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal -- in the interpretation of criminal statutes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think the Court should be careful of how it uses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

background principles.  And I think it's one thing to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

say that, for instance, the word "conspire" has always 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meant something and therefore we're going to interpret 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the word "conspire" the same way.  But that is really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not what the government's doing here.  It's -- it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying that in 1984 -- or actually 1986, when Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacted the substitute property provision, the law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changed in this very fundamental way to permit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

joint-and-several liability which had never existed. 

 

 

 

 

 

But, actually, their new joint-and-several liability 

 

 

 

 

 

system is -- is -- is quite different from old 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applications of Pinkerton. 

 

 

            

For instance, it applies only to (a)(1) and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not to (a)(2) and (a)(3), and there's different types of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeitures for everyone in the conspiracy.  For the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the guy who actually obtains it, there's asset freezes

in line with third-party transfers and not for others. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So it seems to me that there's very significant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modifications in the government's rule than the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tradition Pinkerton rule. 

 

 

59 

            

So the government is saying that silently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress enacted -- without saying anything in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, Congress enacted this very new forfeiture 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regime, which is similar in some ways and different in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other ways from Pinkerton has -- as it had traditionally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been applied, and I just don't think the Court reads 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal statutes that way.  That's just a classic form 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

of common law criminal liability.  The government is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying well, here's these concepts from other contexts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's modify them in various ways that the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinks makes sense.  We don't really have to look at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory text because unavailability just makes sense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a criterion, even if Congress never said it, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore we have this system of -- of joint-and-several 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture liability, and the Court just doesn't do that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it reads criminal statutes.  We'd certainly ask the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court to just follow the text literally. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I -- I'd like to focus on two other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments made by my colleague.  One about restitution 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and one about contribution.  So in terms of restitution, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I actually think that the comparison to restitution is

quite a strong argument for us, because that's a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

60 

situation in which joint-and-several liability makes 

 

 

 

 

 

perfect sense and is also authorized by statute.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those are two good reasons that we have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

joint-and-several liability in that context. 

 

 

 

 

            

Joint-and-several liability works in terms 

 

 

 

 

of the purposes of the law when it's compensatory.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other words, money from one person and money from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another person are treated interchangeably because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goal is to compensate a victim and the victim doesn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

care where the money comes from.  And that is the case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in restitution.  That's why it's hardly surprising that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress has enacted a joint-and-several liability 

   

 

 

 

system, while also being careful to say that the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can mitigate the harsh effects of the joint-and-several 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability as applied to a particular defendant, by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

saying well, you don't have to require full 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

joint-and-several liability if it's too harsh. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So that's exactly what one would expect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on the background principles and the text provides 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  And here, Congress did not say that, it used the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word "obtained," but the government seeks to conflict a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much hasher form of joint-and-several liability which I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think is -- is quite incongruous. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I also think that unlike the

compensatory context, we haven't talked much about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes of -- of forfeiture, but they are totally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61 

inconsistent with joint-and-several liability.  The 

  

 

 

 

Court has articulated remedial and punitive purposes for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture, but not -- none -- neither of those two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

types of purposes have anything to do with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

joint-and-several liability.  The remedial purposes of 

  

 

 

 

 

taking the money away from the person who got it are not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supported, whereas we see in this case, the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person who got the money keeps some of the money, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the punitive purposes -- I mean, the goal of punishment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is to retract the person's culpability, that doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen when the amount Petitioner has to pay is tied to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what his brother paid in his plea agreement.  That's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a rational method of assessing culpability. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

On the issue of contribution, so this notion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of State law contribution is an issue that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government doesn't raise in its brief and I'm not aware 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of any precedent or law that would support that.  As far 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as I've been aware, until oral argument in this case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right of contribution isn't available --

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I didn't under --

    

 

 

 

 

understand the argument there was.  I think your friend 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

was just pointing out that if there were an available 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy, it would be under State law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Okay.  Well, then I -- I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

62 

agree with that, that's true.  And I -- I certainly 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

agree with my colleague as well that there's no Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right of -- of contribution at all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think that's quite important.  Counsel 

  

 

 

 

says that actually that doesn't matter because under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common law, you couldn't have contribution in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intentional tort cases anyway.  I think, though, that's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

not persuasive for a number of reasons.  One is that I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think the common law is not so clear and, in fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modern restatements of the common law have an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative rule. 

 

            

Second of all, the common law rule as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied to vicarious forms of liability, which is sort 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of what the government is seeking here, actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't add contribution.  We cite some authority for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that in our brief. 

 

 

 

            

And, finally, in the Paroline case itself, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government itself rejected that argument in its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief and asked that the Court, and the Court said that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the absence of contribution remedy is evidence that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress didn't intend joint-and-several liability in 

 

 

 

 

 

the first place, and we think that argument applies with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

full force in this case.
