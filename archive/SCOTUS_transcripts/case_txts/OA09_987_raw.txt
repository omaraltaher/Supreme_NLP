 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL 

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Thank you, 

12 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

13

 For 13 years, Arizona has permitted private 

14 

citizens to contribute money to private organizations 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

set up by private individuals and has let those 

organizations use that money towards scholarships when 

individuals apply for them.  The Ninth Circuit erred 

first in finding that the taxpayer plaintiffs had 

standing, and second in striking the program down.

 On standing, this lawsuit fails each of the 

three necessary elements.  Regarding injury in fact, the 

key point is this:  Not a cent of the Respondents' money 

goes to fund religion.  If you placed an electronic tag 

to track and monitor each cent that the Respondent 

plaintiffs pay in tax, not a cent, not a fraction of a

cent, would go into any religious school's coffers.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Katyal, their point 

is that this tax money does belong to the State that the 

private individuals are using, because it is money that, 

even by the new amendment, says either you pay it to the 

State or you use it for this purpose, but it's the 

State's money, and it's giving you by its largesse the 

right to redirect it.  That's their argument. 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Right, and -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it would be the 

taxpayers' tax dollars being spent on religion, if they 

could sustain their claim. 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  There are two problems with 

14 

that.  One has to do with injury in fact.  The other has 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

to do with redressability.  With respect to injury in 

fact, our point is, as you track the taxpayers' dollars, 

it doesn't actually fund any religious program, unlike 

the -- unlike Flast and other cases in which this Court 

has considered taxpayer standing for religion.

 Their complaint is not that the government 

is spending money that the taxpayers has been -- money 

that has been extracted and spent of the taxpayers. 

Their complaint is that someone else's money is not 

being extracted and spent enough.  And the relevant 

language in Flast says that for taxpayer standing to 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

occur, that, quote, "his tax money" must be extracted 

and spent, and here that's not occurring. 

 Now, with respect to the other argument, not 

4 

injury in fact, but addressability and causation, our 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13

point is this:  It's speculative as to whether or not 

that chain of events that you spelled out, Justice 

Sotomayor, would actually happen.  As this Court said in 

Cuno, for example, when a tax credit is given, sometimes 

that actually reduces the amount of money the government 

has to spend.  It doesn't increase it.  And so that's 

different than the direct outlay that was at issue in 

Flast. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Then is it constitutional 

14 

if we get a new system?  Here's what the system will be: 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

The taxpayers who are religious will be able to check a 

box, and the check that they send to the IRS -- it's a 

possible system -- what happens is that that check is 

cashed by an official, and the cash is given to the 

local priest to say prayers for the individual who 

contributed the money.  And, in your view, there is no 

21 

one who could challenge that? 

22

23 

24 

25

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Well, let me say two things 

about that.  First is:  That is not all that different, 

Justice Breyer, than what we have today with 501(c)(3) 

deductions.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  The difference is, of 

course, that in the one case it's a deduction, and in 

this case you're paying it 100 percent with money that 

would otherwise go into the coffer.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  That -- that's -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I understand that.  But I'm 

interested in, conceptually, does the Government think 

that there is no one who could challenge that? 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  I don't think that any 

taxpayer could challenge that.  That is, depending on 

the hypothetical, Justice Breyer, I'm not sure if the 

government is specifying which religious organizations 

might be eligible for the check box.  But if the 

government is doing something that is under-inclusive 

and only giving tax credits to one set of religious 

organizations, that's a Texas Monthly problem, where 

this Court -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So, if you go back into 

19 

history, it could have been the case that the -- as long 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

as they were fair to every religion, the first Congress 

could have funded prayers throughout the nation in 

churches for anyone to go and pray, and that would not 

have violated the Establishment Clause, or if it had, 

nobody could have challenged it.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  No, Justice Breyer.  Two

18

things on that.  First is:  We're only talking about 

standing, not the merits.  And with respect to standing, 

if the government funded only religious organizations or 

religious prayer, I do think that other organizations 

would have standing -- not as a taxpayer, because this 

Court has been very careful in Flast and in Hein to say 

there's an extremely narrow exception for taxpayer 

standing, a narrow exception to Frothingham, but other 

organizations would have Texas Monthly standing because 

they're -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General -- counsel, does 

anyone have standing, in your view, to challenge this 

scheme? 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  The way this scheme is set 

up, our answer is no.  And I think that accords with 

this Court's general reluctance to confer taxpayer 

standing in this area. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And if we leave out the 

19 

fine points that you were discussing, isn't the 

20

21 

22 

23

underlying premise of Flast v. Cohen that the 

Establishment Clause will be unenforceable unless we 

recognize taxpayer standing? 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  I -- I don't see that, 

24 

Justice Ginsburg, in Flast.  I think Flast is a very 

25

narrow exception for when someone's dollars are being

11

taken out of their pocket and spent by the government on 

religion, and I don't think that's happening here. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If you're right -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Flast is gone; is that 

right?  Flast is gone.  There is no more -- nothing more 

to Flast, because it just happened that nobody had 

thought of this system at the time of Flast. 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Justice Breyer -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If they had, they could 

have had -- what? 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Justice Breyer, I don't 

12 

think Flast is gone at all. 

13

14

15

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why? 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  -- when there is direct 

government outlays to spend on religion, like Flast.  I 

16 

mean, that -­

17

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but you don't need be, 

because all you have to do to get around it is to create 

what we have here.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Well, I do think that that 

can get around it -- that can get around it in some 

circumstances.  And, again, those who are under-included 

in a government program may have standing, not as a 

taxpayer.

 But, at the end of the day, Justice Breyer, 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

2 

3 

4

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

if that's the result, that's the result for every other 

clause in the Constitution.  Taxpayer standing is the 

most narrow of exceptions, and -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it is -- there is a 

plaintiff -- we have a Bill of Rights, and most 

provisions have plaintiffs who are hurting, whose free 

speech is being suppressed, but this one doesn't have. 

It's in the Constitution like all the others, and I 

thought, to be candid, that that's what the problem was 

10

in Flast v. Cohen, and that's what the Court was 

11 

responding to. 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Well, I don't see that in 

Flast, Justice Ginsburg, but be that as it may, I think 

this Court in Valley Forge was very clear to say that 

if, at the end of the day, you can't find a plaintiff 

with standing, that is not an excuse to relax the -- our 

general requirements of Article III standing. 

 And here, if you granted the plaintiffs 

19 

standing, what you would be granting is, for the first 

20

21 

22 

23

time, a -- a tax credit which is a complaint about 

someone else's money not being spent to a high enough 

level. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So if you are right, General 

24 

Katyal, the Court was without authority to decide Walz, 

25

Nyquist, Hunt, Mueller, Hibbs, this -- this very case, 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

6

just a few years ago?  That the Court was without 

authority to decide any of those cases, but that somehow 

nobody on the Court recognized that fact, nor did the SG 

recognize that fact.  The SG participated, I believe, in 

each of those cases. 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Right.  So let me say two 

7 

things about that. 

8

 First is, I do think it's very much just 

9 

like Frothingham, in which Frothingham had to deal with 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

16

17 

18 

19 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

this exact problem.  The Court had conferred standing in 

taxpayer standing case after taxpayer standing case, and 

then, when it was teed up and presented to the Court as 

a question about Article III standing, the Court said: 

No, we shouldn't have granted taxpayer standing in those 

cases.  So my answer to you is yes. 

 Now, I do think that this Court's decision 

in Hein, I think, reiterated some of the fundamental 

principles and the limits on Flast.  And I think the 

Court -- the plurality made quite clear that it would go 

no further than the facts of Flast. 

 And to grant standing here, you have to 

go -- tremendously depart from what Flast is about:  a 

direct government outlay of funds out of -- taking money 

out of someone's pocket to fund religion.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  But I -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I just want to make sure I 

heard your answer to the -- you said the answer is yes. 

In other words, you agree with Justice Kagan's criticism 

of those cases, and you said, yes, she's right; those 

cases were wrongly decided. 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  They -- they could have 

gone out -- the results may have been the same.  It just 

would have been -- would have been on standing instead 

of the merits.  Mueller, for example, upheld the 

program.  So the bottom-line decision would have been 

the same, but the way in which the Court got there would 

have been so that there was no tax -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you would have said 

14 

there would have been no standing in those cases.

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

21 

22 

23

 GENERAL KATYAL:  No taxpayer standing.  Now, 

there may have been other forms of standing, Texas 

Monthly standing, that could have been alleged to 

challenge those programs, but yes. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it wasn't -- it 

wasn't -- I don't remember whether the Government 

participated in the Winn case when it came up under the 

Tax Injunction Act. 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  We did, and in the first 

24 

footnote -­

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And there wasn't a word 

12

from the Government about lack of standing.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  The first footnote in the 

brief, Justice Ginsburg, acknowledged the fact that 

standing hadn't been pushed or pressed below.  But I 

acknowledge that, particularly in the wake of Hein, 

should another case arise, the Government will -- will 

acknowledge the standing defects and brief them as we 

are here. 

 Our point on redressability is not simply 

that the -- that the tax -- that the cost of the program 

is speculative.  It's also that the relief that the 

plaintiffs are seeking in this case won't redress their 

problem.  That is, if you gave the plaintiffs everything 

they're asking for, the very same religious schools and 

the very same religious STOs would continue to be 

funded.  The very same religious STOs would continue to 

be funded because they would leave in place -- and this 

was my answer to Justice Breyer -- the tax deduction, 

the 501(c)(3) tax deduction.  And so there would still 

be government revenue being spent in favor of these 

religious STOs under their program.  It would just be at 

the level of one-third instead of 100 percent. 

 I don't think that satisfies their problem. 

24 

I don't think James Madison 's remonstrance would be 

25

satisfied if they were -- if Madison were told:  Well, 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company

you're not going to be taxed three pence; you'll be 

taxed one pence.  The principle is what matters, the 

principle of Flast. 

 If I could reserve the balance of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General. 

 Ms. Bickett. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAULA S. BICKETT 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 MS. BICKETT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

 Arizona's tuition tax credit does not 

violate the Establishment Clause, because it's a neutral 

law that results in scholarship programs of private 

choice.  It's neutral because, like the tax deduction 

that the Court upheld in Mueller, it's one of many 

tax-saving devices, including some 26 other credits that 

are available to Arizona taxpayers on a neutral basis. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Bickett, could you

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

puzzling over this scheme.  Could you tell me why 

Arizona adopted this sort of scheme rather than the more 

typical tuition voucher scheme?  In other tuition 

voucher schemes, the State just gives the -- the voucher 

or scholarship or what have you.  This is so much more 

complicated and complex and unusual.  And it just left 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

me wondering why it was chosen, or what the State thinks 

the advantages are of it now? 

 MS. BICKETT:  Yes, Justice Kagan.  One of 

4 

the things that is true in Arizona that was not true in 

5

Ohio is that, under the Arizona Constitution, any direct 

6 

aid to private schools is prohibited. 

7

8 

9 

 The other thing about the tax credit program 

is that it does encourage contributions not only from 

parents but from the community at large.  And this -­

10

this then provides money for low-income students, 

11 

students from low-income families.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does the -- does the 

record show the extent to which there are these 

additional donations that you just referred to? 

 MS. BICKETT:  Your Honor, of course, it was 

at a motion to dismiss phase.  What the record shows is 

that there's some reports that -- studies that have been 

done that show that there have been some children that 

have switched from public schools to private schools as 

a result of the program, that many of the scholarship 

programs are -- in fact, most of the scholarship

programs provide scholarships based on financial need.

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You haven't -- I don't 

think you answered his question.  The question was, is 

there anything in the record that shows whether any of 

the money that's involved here comes not from parents, 

but rather from others who can contribute to the 

program? 

 MS. BICKETT:  Well, what the record shows is 

9 

that there have been -- there's a large amount of 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

16

17 

18 

19

20

contributions.  There is $55 million.  It doesn't -- we 

have Arizona Department of Revenue reports that list the 

number of contributors and who contributes -- or not the 

individuals who contribute.  I -- it doesn't 

specifically line out who the contributors are, whether 

they are parents, or whether they are not parents. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I suppose if some of 

the contributions are considerable, like a million 

dollars, that couldn't be just a parent, right? 

 MS. BICKETT:  You're right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are there contributions of 

21 

that size? 

22

23 

24 

25

 MS. BICKETT:  Again, the record doesn't show 

what the size of the contributions are.  It shows the -­

the number of contributions and the total amount of 

contributions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You could only 

get -- if you give a million dollars, you still only get 

a $500 tax credit, right? 

 MS. BICKETT:  That's correct, Your Honor.

 The -- the programs are programs of private 

choice, because any aid that reaches religious schools 

does so after -- only after at least four levels of 

private decisionmaking.  Arizona sets up the neutral 

rules for the -- this tax credit, and after that, 

private individuals and organizations take over.  Anyone 

can form a school tuition organization, and the increase 

in the number and diversity of school tuition 

organizations over the 13 years that the tax credit has 

been in existence demonstrates, in fact, that -- that 

this is free for everyone to participate in. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Something that worried me 

in Zelman is this, and I might get your answer. 

Probably Arizona spends some billions of dollars on 

public schools, doesn't it?  I don't know what the exact 

amount is. 

 MS. BICKETT:  Yes, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, let's take 30 or 

40 percent of that and spend it through this program on 

religious schools.  Imagine that happens.  At that 

point, people might get into considerable discussion

about what qualifies, when it doesn't qualify, whether 

it's a valid school, or is it just teaching religion, 

and what the rules and regulations are.  How is Arizona 

dealing with this problem?  By saying there are no 

regulations, by saying that we're not -- is there a 

system for dealing with the legitimacy and the 

circumstances under which a particular religion's 

schools qualify for this program?  Who decides and how? 

 MS. BICKETT:  Well, under the tax credit 

program -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 

 MS. BICKETT:  -- the schools have to be 

qualified private schools in order to participate in the 

-- in the tax credit.

regulations and rules.

 MS. BICKETT:  Primarily what it is, is that 

private schools in Arizona satisfy the compulsory 

education law as long as they meet the requirements that 

the public schools have in terms of providing 

qualitatively the subject matter that the public 

schools -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And those standards have 

24 

nothing to do with this program.  They are standards

that any private school, religious or otherwise, must

Arizona? 

 MS. BICKETT:  That is correct, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And when do they teach the 

religious part of their program? 

 MS. BICKETT:  Excuse me? 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, when does a private 

school -- normally the schools -- I mean, I'm not an 

expert, but what you have to do to be a school is a very 

complex thing, and you have all kinds of requirements 

that eat up quite a lot of the day.  And I just wonder 

how the religion part fits in.  Has there turned out to 

be no problem?  When do they -- do they teach religion 

at 6:00 in the morning?  Does it matter if the person's 

qualified?  How does the -- I once had a case on this in 

the First Circuit, and it came out to be surprisingly 

complex, and I just wondered how -- if there turned out 

to be any problem at all in Arizona in this area. 

 MS. BICKETT:  Justice Breyer, the record 

doesn't reflect that, and I am not aware of any problem 

with private schools in Arizona and certainly not that 

have participated in this tax credit program. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose that an STO -­

statute on it, no State statute prohibiting this.  Would 

there be a constitutional violation, a Federal 

constitutional violation?

 MS. BICKETT:  If it was -- if it was a

private institution -­

discriminated person to bring suit, a person who has 

been discriminated against? 

 MS. BICKETT:  As long as there was not a 

Federal law that applied to the organization -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, the hypothetical is no 

Federal statute, no State statute.  It's a pure -- it's 

a State action question, is what I'm asking.

could be attributed to the State, the State's direction, 

21 

then -­

22

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, don't you think a 

strong argument can be made that it can be attributed to 

the State.  The State has all sorts of rules about what 

an STO has to be.  The State provides the mechanism

status so that there could be donations to them.  Do you

MS. BICKETT:  Yes, Your Honor.  The -- the 

Court held that the Department of Revenue could preclude 

the university from having tax-exempt status because 

that -- that violated public policy, and, therefore, 

they were not entitled to 501(c)(3) status.  And so too 

here.  All of these organizations are 501(c)(3) 

organizations, so they would not be able to discriminate 

based on race. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Who would have -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could I try 

Justice Kennedy's question in a slightly different way? 

 I'm assuming that you would agree that if 

this was just a straight tuition voucher program, the 

State could not give tuition vouchers on the basis of 

religion, could not say, if you are a Catholic, you 

don't get these tuition vouchers.  But what the State 

has done here, apparently, is to set up a scheme that 

uses intermediaries that can make exactly that 

distinction, that can say, sorry, if you are a Catholic 

you don't get scholarships out of our STO.

 And the question is, why should the State be 

22
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

able to do that?  If the State can't do it itself in 

providing tuition vouchers, why should the State be able 

to set up a system using intermediaries that exist for 

no other reason than to administer this program that can 

make those distinctions? 

 MS. BICKETT:  Your Honor, the State is not 

making those decisions.  It's private organizations, and 

anyone can set up a school tuition organization.  School 

tuition organizations that support solely secular 

schools are in existence, and there has been no problem 

setting those up.  Five of the top 10 STOs do provide 

scholarships to any -- any school of the parents' 

choosing -­

 MS. BICKETT:  The private market -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  The plaintiffs contend -­

and this is a motion to dismiss, so we have to accept 

their contentions as settled -- that there are STOs that 

make these distinctions that clearly would be 

impermissible if the State administered the program. 

These are not pre-existing charitable organizations. 

They are not pre-existing schools.  They're entities 

that are set up solely for the purpose of administering 

this program, and yet the State is saying it can make

 MS. BICKETT:  Your Honor, if I might correct

that pre-existed the tax credit, and certainly the 

private schools that participated in these for the most

part did exist before this school tuition organization.

 What this program allows private 

organizations to do, it allows parents to get together 

with private schools and form school tuition 

organizations that then -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you -- you said there 

was an STO before this program, but it didn't get the 

benefit of money from taxpayers that would have gone -­

that money went to -- to Arizona, not to the STO before 

this scheme was created. 

 MS. BICKETT:  Before this scheme was 

created, they would have gotten a tax deduction, a 

Federal tax deduction and a State tax deduction, instead 

of a tax credit.  But the difference -- there is not a 

significant difference between a tax credit and a tax 

deduction in terms of constitutionality.  The only 

difference between a tax deduction is that, for purposes 

of a tax deduction, it depends on -- the value of it 

depends on the tax bracket of the taxpayer, whereas a 

tax credit, the value depends -- is -- is equal for all

taxpayers that owe taxes.  And this Court has never made 

a distinction between tax credits, on the one hand, or 

tax exemptions, tax deductions. 

 Under -- under Respondents' theory, any 

money that the government doesn't take in would then be 

the equivalent of State money, and that would then 

undermine 501(c)(3) corporations and all kinds of 

charitable organizations.  What you need to look at 

in -- when Arizona decided to give a tax credit for this 

is it was thinking is this a worthy public purpose to 

not take in certain money that -- that the State would 

normally be entitled to if they give contributions to 

that purpose.  So, it's not a question -- and that -­

that type of purpose has been upheld by this Court in 

Walz, in Hernandez. 

 And there, again -- there is not a basis for 

distinguishing here between what Arizona is doing and 

other 501(c)(3) organizations that have for years been 

able to enjoy the benefits of -- of tax savings, tax 

benefits, and help give scholarships to religious 

21 

organizations.

that State money is being given to the beneficiaries of

a claim about discrimination in the distribution of 

these State funds.  It's not -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But there -- but there is a 

discrimination, I gather.  The -- the school that seems 

to get the most money on the list doesn't appear to be a 

religious school at all.  It's -- it's not even 

discrimination between religion and nonreligion, if you 

think that that is invalid, which I don't.  But it 

doesn't favor religion at all.

benefits in a government benefit program cannot 

constitutionally be given to the beneficiaries of the 

program on the basis of their religion. 

 If a -- if a parent comes to one of these 

religious -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You can't -- you can't have 

a government program that gives out money 

indiscriminately to certain organizations that, say, 

provide hospital services, and it would be 

unconstitutional if that included organizations that 

were religious organizations, as well as organizations 

that were not.  That would be unconstitutional? 

 MR. BENDER:  Let me try to clarify. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you must positively 

disfavor religion? 

 MR. BENDER:  No, you must not.  You must 

give the money to the beneficiaries without taking the 

beneficiaries' religion into account.  Suppose the 

government set up -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How does this take 

-- how does this take the beneficiaries' religion into 

account when the program works perfectly -- in exactly 

the same way if it's a nonreligious school?  They don't 

care whether it's a religious school or not.

 MR. BENDER:  Because the STOs are giving out 

27
 

Alderson Reporting Company

government funds.  The STOs are on the government's 

behalf distributing tax revenues.  Suppose that -­

4 

trying -- I don't think that's my-- I hope that wasn't 

5

6 

7 

8 

9

10

my question.  It's how is it discriminating on the basis 

of religion if the STOs and the government money -- it 

doesn't care whether it goes to a religious school or 

not; it's treated the same? 

 MR. BENDER:  The STO -- most money is given 

out by STOs that do care whether it goes to a religious 

11 

school. 

12

13 

14 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The State money 

going to the STO -- the State doesn't care whether it 

goes to a religious STO or a secular STO.

 MR. BENDER:  That doesn't matter.  If the 

16 

State's grantee cares, that's unconstitutional. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought we've held 

that when you have the decision is made by a private 

entity whether to use the money to go to a religious 

school or a nonreligious school, that that doesn't 

violate the Constitution because the decision is not 

made by the State; it's made by the private recipient. 

 MR. BENDER:  I believe the Court held the 

24 

opposite in Bowen, where the decision to use the money 

25

for religious purposes was made by the grantee, not made

by the government.  The government program in Bowen was 

completely religiously neutral.  Grantees were given 

funds to educate adolescents in sexuality.  The Court 

held -- Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion -­

that, although the program was constitutional on its 

face because -- it wasn't unconstitutional because 

religious organizations could participate as grantees. 

It would be unconstitutional if those organizations 

distributed the benefits of the program on the basis of 

religion. 

 Think about a Head Start program.  Suppose 

the government sets up 50 Head Start programs in a 

particular community.  They're all run by private 

organizations; some religious, some not.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, could we 

16 

get -- just to get back to Bowen for a moment. 

17

18

 MR. BENDER:  Yes. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The entities that 

19 

were distributing the funds could be private or

religious? 

 MR. BENDER:  Same as here, yeah. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The entities are not

State funds were -- as here, they weren't identified as 

religious or not?

 MR. BENDER:  I don't understand.  In Bowen, 

I think the Court held, in the as-applied part of Bowen, 

that if the grantees were to give out the -- their 

services on the basis of religion, that would violate 

the Establishment Clause. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do we know that the schools 

here do that?  There are some religious schools.  Do we 

know that these religious schools do not admit people 

except of a certain religion?

 MR. BENDER:  Well, I think we do know that, 

and the complaint alleges that, but that's not the 

point.  The point is not what the religious schools do; 

the point is what the STOs do.  The STOs are government 

grantees.  They are distributing government funds.  The 

Constitution prohibits organizations that distribute 

government funds as part of a government spending 

program to do it on the basis of religion. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a great leap to say 

19 

that it's government funds, that any money the 

20

21 

22 

23

government doesn't take from me, because it gives me a 

deduction, is government money.  I mean, that's the 

first leap you make. 

 MR. BENDER:  This is money that the 

24 

government takes from people.

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  This money has never been 

30
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

3

in the government's coffers.  The government has 

declined to take this money. 

 MR. BENDER:  But it's money that's raised by 

4 

the State's income tax.  Every tax-credited dollar is a 

5

dollar that has to be paid either to the government as 

6 

income taxes do or to an STO.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well -­

wrong on that point, that you're folding your tent and 

leaving.  There's -- that there's no standing and that 

there's no -- no violation.  But I must say, I have some 

difficulty that any money that the government doesn't 

take from me is still the government's money.

 MR. BENDER:  But it does take it. 

 (Laughter.) 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let me ask you.  If -- if 

you reach a certain age, you can get a -- a card and go 

to certain restaurants, and they give you 10 percent 

credit.  I think it would be rather offensive for the 

21 

cashier to say, "and be careful how you spend my money." 

22

23

 (Laughter. ) 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's the whole 

24 

theory of your case.

With respect, Justice Kennedy, the money that's involved 

in this case is money that is generated by imposition of 

the State's income tax, not by non-imposition of it.  If 

there were no State income tax, there would be no tax 

credit program.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Because they are kind enough 

to give the taxpayer a deduction for certain 

contributions?

 MR. BENDER:  Because when a taxpayer makes a 

charitable deduction, that charitable deduction is made 

from the taxpayer's money.  At the time the taxpayer 

makes that deduction, the taxpayer can do anything he 

wants with that money.

 That's not true of this tax credit.  At the 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8

time this tax credit is taken, the taxpayer owes the 

government, let's say, $5,000 in State income taxes. 

You've got to pay that $5,000.  You can't keep it.  It's 

not your money.  You can't keep it.  It's not that all 

of your money is the government's money; it's that this 

$5,000 that you owe the government as income taxes is 

the government's money. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But why isn't that true of a 

9 

tax deduction also?  And this is a very modest tax 

10

11 

12 

13 

14

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

credit.  The tax deduction that a wealthy person would 

get by making a contribution to a college or university 

that has a religious affiliation is much more valuable 

than this $500 credit. 

 MR. BENDER:  It doesn't turn on whether it's 

valuable or not.  It turns on whether when the taxpayer 

makes the payment the taxpayer is paying the taxpayer's 

own money or money the taxpayer owes to the government. 

When you make a charitable contribution, you're using 

your own money.  That's not money you owe to the 

government.  You don't know how much money you owe to 

21 

the government until you figure out your taxes. 

22

23 

24 

25

 This credit doesn't come into play until you 

figure out your taxes.  And then if you owe the 

government -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  I completely don't 

33
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

understand that.  Somebody does know.  It's December 

31st.  They know -- they figure out how much tax they're 

going to have to pay for that year.  They know exactly. 

They can know exactly what their taxes will be.  And it 

will be X, and if they make a -- a deduction, then it 

6 

will be X minus Y.  What is the difference? 

7

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

 MR. BENDER:  The difference is -- that -- to 

me, the broad difference is that the tax deduction is 

given for charitable contributions.  And I think the 

Court would decide if it faced the question -- I don't 

think it's ever had to -- that it is constitutional for 

the government to support private charity.  And if the 

government is going to support private charity by 

letting you deduct charitable contributions, it can't 

leave religious charities out of that program.  That 

16 

would violate the Establishment Clause. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

 So if you believe that the charitable 

deduction in the Federal income tax is a constitutional 

thing for the government to do, to support private 

charity by picking up part of the tab -- that's true 

when there's a deduction -- then you have to give the 

deduction to people who contribute to religion. 

 So, yes, there is a government support for 

24 

that private charitable contribution, but it's a

charitable contribution.

 The money in this case is not a charitable 

contribution.  Mr. Katyal says that it's not the 

government's money.  Whose money is it?  Is it the 

taxpayer's money who gives the $1,000 contribution?  No. 

If you don't take my word for it, look at what the STOs 

say on their Web sites about this program.  One of them 

says quite frankly:  Hey, you can give charity with 

someone else's money; it's a miracle.  Another one says: 

It won't cost you anything; you can give charity with 

other people's money. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  See, can I ask you -­

 MR. BENDER:  Whose money is it? 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What difference does it make 

14 

what they say on their Web sites?  There's a very 

15

important philosophical point here.  You think that all 

16 

the money belongs to the government -­

17

18

 MR. BENDER:  No. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  -- except to the extent that 

19 

it deigns to allow private people to keep some of it.

20

21

22

23

 MR. BENDER:  I do not. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  It doesn't take it by taxes. 

 MR. BENDER:  No. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  That's what your whole 

24 

argument is based on.

25

 MR. BENDER:  No, it isn't, Justice Alito.

My argument is that if the government imposes an income 

tax, and people owe the government a certain amount of 

money in income taxes due, that -- and the government 

says you don't have to pay it to us; you can pay it to 

an STO -- that that is a payment of government funds. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They don't owe it to the 

government if they have made this contribution.  That's 

the whole point. 

 MR. BENDER:  It's not a contribution.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They don't owe the tax to 

the extent that they have given money to one of these 

institutions.  You -- you say -- you posit at the very 

beginning that you owe a full amount of tax.  That's 

just not true.  You don't owe the tax if you've made the 

$500 contribution. 

 MR. BENDER:  I -- I disagree with that.  I

income tax form, it says:  Here's your income.  Apply 

the tax rate to the income.  Here are your taxes due. 

$5,000.  You may pay that in part by giving $1,000 -- by 

paying $1,000 to an STO.  You are paying your taxes. 

When taxpayers take this $1,000 credit -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the problem; they

 MR. BENDER:  No. 

 (Laughter.) 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So that it's a deduction 

before the line.  This is a major lawsuit? 

 MR. BENDER:  This is a government spending 

program.  Is there any doubt about that?  The money in 

this program is not private charitable contributions. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So you assume that it is 

a -- I see your argument there. 

 Now, in Zelman, the holding, I would 

think -- which I was not in agreement with, but it's now 

law, that a government can have a -- a spending program. 

And what they did was the government spent money in the 

form of vouchers to be given to private individuals to 

use for such education as they wish, that met certain 

standards, including religious schools. 

 So what's the difference between the program 

19 

here and the one that was held constitutional in Zelman?

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. BENDER:  The difference is that, in 

Zelman, the money went to the parents without any 

religious discrimination.  Religion was not involved in 

the distribution of the money to the parents.  The 

parents in Zelman got funds based on their financial 

need and the fact that their children went to school in

Cleveland, which was a failing school district.  And the 

program was to give them -- based on their financial 

need, was to give them a voucher. 

 In giving the parent a voucher, nobody said 

to the parent, what's your religion?  Nobody said to the 

parent, are you going to send your child to a religious 

school?  The Court said, as clearly as it could in 

Zelman, that that would be unconstitutional. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But who here says to the 

parent, who is going to the school, what is your 

11 

religion? 

12

 MR. BENDER:  The STO who gives them the 

13 

scholarship. 

14

15

16

17

 JUSTICE BREYER:  In other words, the STO 

gives a scholarship only to Catholics -­

 MR. BENDER:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- to go to Catholic 

18 

schools, only to Jews to go to Jewish schools? 

19

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. BENDER:  Exactly, exactly.  Most of the 

money -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the government money 

you claim is at issue here is -- is the money that the 

contributor to the STO has failed to give to the 

government when it's the government's money.

 Now, that decision, of whether to give the 

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

6

money to an STO or not, whether to give it to a 

religiously affiliated STO or a nonaffiliated one, that 

is in the hands of a private individual, just as the 

voucher program was.

 MR. BENDER:  That's true. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  There -- there's no 

7 

religious discrimination in that choice. 

8

 MR. BENDER:  Let me -- let me put it to you 

9 

this way, Justice Scalia:  Suppose the government in 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

this case gave the money to the STOs directly itself, 

and the STOs then gave out the scholarships.  Would it 

be constitutional for an STO to say to a parent who 

comes asking for a scholarship, are you Catholic?  If 

you're not, we won't give you a scholarship -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Perhaps not, but you 

16 

have -­

17

18

 MR. BENDER:  What's the difference? 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You have an intervening 

19 

parent or contributor.  And it's that person who is 

20

21 

22 

23

making the decision of whether to give it to a religious 

or nonreligious organization; it isn't the government 

making that decision. 

 MR. BENDER:  No.  It's not a parent, by the 

24 

way.

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that was the same thing

 MR. BENDER:  It's not a parent, by the way, 

in answer to Justice Kennedy's question before.  Parents 

under this program are not allowed to give contributions 

for scholarships for their own children.  The people who 

get the -- who can claim the tax credit, the person that 

gets the scholarship cannot be a dependent of the person 

who gives the contribution. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, suppose they change 

one rule, and the rule that the STOs had was this:  They 

said we will give you tuition if you otherwise qualify 

for your child to go to the school that you wish to go 

to, and if you are Jewish or you are Protestant and you 

want to go to St. Joseph's Catholic School, that's 

absolutely fine; they won't keep you out, and vice 

16 

versa. 

17

 Now, in your opinion, that then would be 

18 

constitutional?

 MR. BENDER:  Yes.  We only challenge -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes?  The answer is yes? 

 MR. BENDER:  Yes.  Yes. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So the only thing you're 

challenging is the rule that they will not -- the STOs 

will not give the scholarship to a Protestant to go to a 

Catholic school.

out a majority of the funds only give the funds to 

parents who will send their child to a religious 

school -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Ah.  Ah, but that's -­

 MR. BENDER:  -- designated by the STO. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But that's -- that's 

different.  You were complaining about is they would -­

St. Joseph's; and -- so now, do I qualify or not?  The

only with the STOs that wouldn't let me send the child.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I just want 

to make sure I understand your complaint.  You just said 

to Justice Breyer that your complaint was that the STOs 

are giving scholarships based on the student's religion.

 MR. BENDER:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I thought another part 

of your complaint was that the STOs were giving just to 

the religious schools. 

 MR. BENDER:  STOs don't give scholarships to 

religious schools.  They give scholarships to parents. 

The parents are awarded the scholarships, not the 

schools. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But to attend that 

14 

school?

complaint is that some of the STOs are requiring that 

the recipient, the recipient child, be of a particular 

religion?

 MR. BENDER:  That, and some of the STOs are 

also requiring that, in order to get the scholarship, 

the parent agree to send the child to a particular 

religious school.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you're saying -- you are 

saying both, is that right, Mr. Bender?  You're saying 

both of those things?

 MR. BENDER:  Both of them, yes. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  Could I ask you:  Is 

there -- do you understand the beneficiaries of this 

program?  Has the State said who the beneficiaries of 

this program are?  Are the beneficiaries of this program 

10

the parents, or are the beneficiaries of this program 

11 

the general taxpayers? 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 MR. BENDER:  The beneficiaries of this 

program are the parents and children.  That's what this 

program is for.  The State set up a program to help 

parents send their children to non-public schools, and 

to do that, they are going to give them scholarships. 

Scholarship money is going to be made available. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So I would assume, then, if 

19 

the beneficiaries of the program are the parents, then 

20

21

22

it's the parents who have to be treated equally -­

 MR. BENDER:  That's right. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- without regard to 

23 

religion.

could, the scholarships have to -- in that case, the 

vouchers -- have to be available to parents on a 

religiously neutral basis.  The scholarships are not 

allowed to be made available to parents according to 

their religion or according to whether they will send 

their child to a religious school, though both of those 

kinds of discrimination are going on here.  I think 

there -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Bender, can I go back 

to your point -- you were making a distinction between 

the taxpayer who makes a charitable donation.  Well, 

that taxpayer has the whole universe to spend it on: 

Buying clothes, on gambling, on this charity, that 

charity.  But your point here is this contributor does 

not have the universe to pick and is free to pick a 

charity.  This one has -- you either give it to the 

government or you give it to the STO.  That's -­

 MR. BENDER:  Exactly.  Right.  Yes.  It's 

19 

not -- it's not the taxpayers' money.  It's confusing 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

because we're talking about two kinds of taxpayers here. 

We're talking about my clients, who are general 

taxpayers, whose money is being used to fund this 

program, and we're talking about the taxpayers who take 

the tax credit.  There are two different kinds of 

taxpayers.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So if Arizona had a statute 

that gave an income tax deduction only to individuals 

who make charitable contributions to educational 

institutions, there would be a problem there, because 

they -- it wasn't a general tax exception for charitable 

6 

contributions? 

7

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13

 MR. BENDER:  No, Justice Alito.  I think it 

would be constitutional if it said that you get a 

deduction for making a charitable contribution to an 

educational organization and that that can include a 

religious educational organization, because if it 

didn't, it would be unconstitutional. 

 You can't set up a program that gives you a 

14 

deduction for giving to educational institutions but not 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

to -- not to a religious organization.  That would be 

unconstitutional.  If you're going to support private 

charity, you have to support religious charity in the 

same way you support nonreligious charity.  But 

if you're going to have somebody -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought your answer to 

Justice Ginsberg was the difference between this and the 

Federal tax deduction for charitable contributions was 

that the Federal tax deduction is available for a broad 

range of charities, whereas this is available only for a 

very narrow range.

 MR. BENDER:  I may have misunderstood her 

question.  I think her question was:  At the time the 

taxpayer makes the charitable contribution that he is 

going to take a deduction for, the taxpayer could do 

anything he wants with that money.  He could take a 

vacation.  He could give it to a charity.  He could -­

he could buy clothes with it.  He could buy food with 

it.  It's a completely open system.  Nobody tells the 

taxpayer what he has to do.

 In this case, when the taxpayer writes that 

check to the STO, the taxpayer can't keep that money, 

can't use it on a vacation, can't use it for buying 

food, has to either pay it to the State or, with the 

State's authorization, pay it to an STO.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The same thing is true of 

charitable deductions.  When you take a charitable 

deduction, you -- you don't have the money anymore.  You 

have given it to a charitable organization. 

 Now, you are allowed to give it to a 

particular religion, a particular church, and there 

21 

seems to be nothing unconstitutional about that, right? 

22

23

 MR. BENDER:  Right.  We -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So what -- what is 

24 

unconstitutional here about the private -- the private 

25

decision to -- to give a benefit to a -- an organization

that only supports particular schools and, indeed, only 

supports people of a particular religion to go to that 

school?  I don't see any difference. 

 MR. BENDER:  There's nothing 

unconstitutional about the taxpayers sending the money 

to an STO.  If STOs did not discriminate on the basis of 

religion in giving that money out, there would be no 

unconstitutionality. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But churches discriminate 

on the basis of religion.  When I take my charitable 

deduction to give it to a particular church, that church 

discriminates on the basis of religion, but that's okay; 

isn't it? 

 MR. BENDER:  If the government said to you, 

you can pay your taxes -- don't pay your taxes to us, 

pay them to a church -- and the church gave its benefits 

only to people of a certain religion, I believe that 

would be unconstitutional. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it's how the government 

puts it, the idea?  So it really is just that line in -­

in the tax form that you are concerned about, and the 

only relief you really need is -- is changing the tax 

form? 

 MR. BENDER:  No, it's the difference between 

charity and paying your taxes.  When you make a 

47
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

charitable contribution, you are making a charitable 

contribution.  It costs you money. 

 In Arizona, if you make a charitable 

4 

contribution of $1,000, it costs you $950 if you're at

the maximum tax rate, because the maximum tax rate is 

5 percent.  In Arizona, if you take this tax credit, it 

costs you nothing.  It's not charity.  Charity is 

something -- you give something of your own, I believe. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Excuse me.  Just to 

follow on Justice Scalia's question, because I want to 

make sure you have the answer:  If this system were set 

up exactly as it is now, but Arizona said contributions 

to STOs are deductible, you'd have no problem? 

 MR. BENDER:  Contributions to STOs are 

deductible from one's income tax? 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

 MR. BENDER:  And, yes.  No, we would not 

18 

have a problem with that. 

19

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the only 

difference is that Arizona set up this system where you 

21 

get a tax credit instead of a tax deduction? 

22

23

 MR. BENDER:  Of course. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And that would be true if 

24 

even if the -- if the top marginal rate was 90 percent?

25

 MR. BENDER:  Yes, it would be true even if 

48

17 

18 

19 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. BENDER:  Yes, because that's still 

charity.  If the top rate is 90 percent, when you give 

that money, it's your money; you can use it for anything 

you want.  And even if you're in the 90 percent bracket, 

you are giving some of your own money.  You are engaging 

in charity.  And the Constitution, I think, permits the 

government to subsidize private charity. 

 And if the government's going to subsidize 

private charity, it can't leave religious charities out. 

So that's the dividing line.  Is the government 

subsidizing private charity?  In this case, the 

government is not subsidizing private charity because it 

49

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If this is -- if this is

of religion?

10

11

 MR. BENDER:  Because it's perfectly okay to 

use government money for non-religiously discriminatory 

purposes.  You can get a tax credit for buying a solar 

water heater.  That's a 100 percent tax credit.  Now, 

that's a somewhat different kind of tax credit, because 

there, when you buy the heater, you get something for 

the money.  It's -- this tax credit is a very strange 

kind of tax credit.  This is a tax credit that is only 

used to pay your taxes.  That's the only function it

has.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm sure you did. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Let's suppose you didn't. 

 MR. BENDER:  Thank you for correcting me. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What's the problem with 

that?  That is to say, suppose that the government gives 

its money to put CAT scans in hospitals.  And it has 

certain beneficiaries, and one group of beneficiaries is 

the Association of Catholic Hospitals, another is the 

Association Of Jewish Hospitals, another is a set of 

totally secular hospitals.  So it gives the tax credits 

to all three.  Now, of course, the Catholic group is 

going to give it to Catholic hospitals and so forth. 

What's wrong with that? 

 MR. BENDER:  I don't get your hypothetical. 

If the government -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What they do is they have 

government money, just like you claim this is, and they 

say we are going to give it to some -- to umbrella 

organizations, like the Association of Catholics, 

Jewish, or secular hospitals, and we expect them to 

distribute it.  And they will, of course, distribute it 

to those who are their members.  And in some cases, 

their members are religious organizations, and in some 

cases, they're not.  Now, what's the difference between 

10

that and what happens here, leaving the student out of 

11 

it? 

12

 MR. BENDER:  It depends on who the 

13 

beneficiaries of the government's program are.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  The beneficiaries of the 

government -- Catholic hospital -- government CAT scan 

program will be Catholic hospitals, because they're the 

ones who belong to the Catholic hospital association. 

Money will also go to the secular hospital association, 

as it goes -- would go to a secular STO here.  So I 

don't see that part.  That's the last prong we're 

21 

talking about. 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. BENDER:  I'm not clear on your program. 

If it's a government program to benefit hospitals, that 

-- the benefits have to go to hospitals on a religiously 

neutral basis.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  The government says -­

that's the difference -- the government says -- it does 

give the money away on a religiously neutral basis.  It 

gives it to hospital associations.  It turns out that 

some of those naturally are supposed to give it to their 

6 

members, all of whom will be religiously affiliated.

 MR. BENDER:  But the hospitals are the 

beneficiaries, Justice Breyer.  That's the difference. 

The beneficiaries here are not the STOs; the 

beneficiaries here are the parents.  The STOs are a 

conduit of government funds to the parents.  The parents 

are the beneficiaries, and the Constitution requires 

that the benefits of a government spending program go to 

the beneficiaries on a religiously neutral basis.  And 

so in Zelman, the beneficiaries were the parents, and 

16 

the vouchers had to go to them -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- I don't 

understand the answer to Justice Breyer's question.  His 

question was, you give it to a hospital equivalent of 

the STO, and then that gives it to hospitals on a 

religiously discriminatory basis.  Why aren't the 

hospitals the beneficiaries of that program, just as you

 MR. BENDER:  Well, if the hospitals are the

government wants to help cancer patients, and so it's 

going to give money to hospitals to help cancer 

patients.  So it gives money to various hospitals under 

Justice Breyer's program.  If one of those hospitals 

says we only treat Catholic cancer patients, that's 

unconstitutional.  That's government funds -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the other issue.  We 

are trying to separate in your argument the issue that 

some of these organizations are religiously affiliated, 

from the argument that, moreover, they will only give 

money to individuals of a particular religion. 

 Now, I understand your argument for the 

latter, but I must say I don't understand your argument 

for the former.  Not if you accept these other -­

haven't made that decision yet.  And they say, well, 

we'll only give you the scholarship if you send your 

child to a Jewish school which teaches people how to 

pray in the way Jewish people pray and has a -- its 

education is Jewish religious education.  That's 

religious discrimination.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL 

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE 

 SUPPORTING PETITIONERS 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Thank you.

 My friend said, I think I have this right, 

"we are talking about my clients whose money is being 

used to fund this program."  That's a nice description 

of Flast.  It is not a description of what's going on 

here.  Flast recognized a special -- well, a special 

solicitude for taxpayers when money is taken out of 

their pocket and used to fund religion against their 

conscience.  Here, even if you accept all of this public 

money discussion that has been happening, not a cent of 

their money is going to fund -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  But in Flast -- I've looked

at it again briefly, and it seemed to use that 

wonderfully precise word "nexus." 

 (Laughter.) 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And you're quite right that 

in Flast that was the case.  But why isn't it -- given 

that it's a nexus in Flast, what was in Flast, why isn't 

it also a nexus where you have this complicated system 

which is designed to make the ordinary taxpayer pay a 

little more in this kind of instance, where what you've 

done is directly subtract from the treasury $5,000 cash 

to turn over, in the view of the plaintiffs, to a purely 

forbidden religious purpose? 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Justice Breyer, two things. 

14 

First, the relevant language of Flast is at page 106. 

15

16 

17 

18

It's not the nexus test; it's the definition of what the 

actual taxpayer standing claim is.  And it requires 

that, quote, "his tax money being extracted was" -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Was that -- was that in 

19 

that instance in Flast?  Does Flast rule out the 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

possibility -­

 GENERAL KATYAL:  And that's the general 

description, Flast says, about how taxpayer standing 

will go forward.  If there's any doubt about that, 

Valley Forge makes that clear because the dissenters 

said exactly what you said, which is, look, let's just

look to economic effects, and that alone will be enough. 

And it's just Property Clause, Tax and Spending Clause, 

it doesn't really matter; it's the bottom line on the 

treasury.  And this Court said no, that isn't the case.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  General Katyal, Flast could 

not have meant that it's your particular dollar.  There 

would be no way to know it's your particular dollar, and 

that would be a silly and fictional thing to say as the 

plurality opinion in Hein makes clear.  What Flast said 

was that taxpayer dollars, not your dollar, but taxpayer 

dollars are going to this activity in the same way that 

it's going to the activity here. 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  I disagree on two levels. 

14 

First is I don't think that's what Flast is.  I think 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

Flast is about that micro-fraction of a cent that is 

coming from your pocket and being used to fund religion. 

And that's what Madison complained about.  It may be 

very small; it may be 3 pence.  But there's a special 

harm of conscience when it's your money, your 

hard-earned money, being used to fund a program directly 

21 

as to which you don't like. 

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Flast talked about a nexus 

in the way that Justice Breyer said.  And here, there's 

a taxpayer challenging a provision of the tax code, 

enacted pursuant to the tax and spending power, that -­

57
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

that grants a tax benefit.  That's as close a nexus as 

you are going to get using the language of Flast. 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Again, I think that doesn't 

4 

deal with the direct injury on the taxpayer, which is 

5

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

the language of Flast.  Even if we -- even if you 

disagree with me, the relief -- the harm here is a lot 

more speculative, just like Cuno, because you have to 

posit, in order for the harm to exist to this taxpayer, 

that tax credits will cost the government money, not 

save it, that his tax burden will go up as opposed to 

someone else's tax burden, a corporation and the like, 

or you have to posit that the government won't cut 

spending in order to make up the shortfall in revenues 

that he says is going to exist.  You're going to have to 

do all of those things, none of which you have to do in 

a Flast situation because it's just a direct outlay of 

funds. 

 If I could just can spend a moment on 

19 

Justice Kennedy's question about State action, which, of 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

course, they didn't advance below as the Ninth Circuit 

said.  I think this Court's precedents are quite clear 

in saying that the fact that the government regulates or 

funds something doesn't transform it into a State actor. 

If it did, then all 501(c)(3)'s would become State 

actors, and that, I think, would be an enormously 

58
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8

damaging precedent for this Court to follow.  Rather, I 

think what Blum says is that it requires the performance 

of a traditional executive prerogative -- traditional 

government prerogative.  And here all the STO is doing 

is just funding -- it's handing out money.  It is doing 

so on a neutral basis.  Anyone can form an STO, and 

anyone can fund one.
