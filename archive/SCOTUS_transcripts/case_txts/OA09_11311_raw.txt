 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 09-11311, Sykes v. United 

States.

 Justice Ginsburg is not on the bench, but 

will participate in the argument through the transcripts 

and -- and the tapes.

 Mr. Marsh.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. MARSH

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MARSH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Armed Career Criminal Act enhances the 

punishment for possession of a firearm or ammunition for 

a person who has three previous convictions for a 

violent felony.  This case involves, as you know, 

vehicular fleeing, which Indiana has divided into five 

categories.  Indiana statute treats vehicular fleeing as 

a continuum of behavior ranging from merely failing to 

stop, on the low end, which is the crime Mr. Sykes was 

convicted of violating, all the way to fleeing which 

results in the death of a police officer, on the high 

end, which in Indiana is a class A felony.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's in between?

MR. MARSH:  The second tier up is what we 

refer to as (b)(1)(B), which is fleeing which either 

causes bodily injury or creates a substantial risk of 

bodily injury.  The next category up is fleeing which 

causes serious bodily injury.  The fourth category is 

fleeing which causes a death.

 This Court recognizes -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So we can assume that the 

conviction here did not involve any risk of bodily 

injury to anybody?

 MR. MARSH:  That's our position, Your Honor. 

When the court considers the conduct encompassed by the 

elements of the offense -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.

 MR. MARSH:  -- then that conduct does not 

involve conduct which creates a risk of bodily injury.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why is that -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm sure you'll do so in 

the course of your argument, but at some point give us 

some examples of violations of -- of this -- this 

statute which from a commonsense standpoint don't 

involve a serious risk.  There was something in the 

brief about, oh, well, the defendant might want to just 

find a safe place to pull over.  I -- I didn't follow 

that because it's an intent crime.  I just don't see how

that would be a violation.  But if at some point in your 

argument you could address those points.

 MR. MARSH:  Well, I'd be happy to respond 

now, Justice Kennedy.  The court -- the case that you 

referred to is the Indiana case of Woodward, from the 

Indiana Court of Appeals, in which the court held that 

exactly that conduct did violate this statute because 

the -- knowingly or intentionally, the mens rea element, 

goes only to fleeing and using a vehicle.  So that was 

one example -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Looking -­

MR. MARSH:  -- of merely failing to stop.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Looking 

-- looking -- I don't mean to interrupt your answer, but 

looking for a safe place to stop violates the statute?

 MR. MARSH:  That was the holding of the 

Indiana Court of Appeals, yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You're supposed to stop 

dead in your tracks and not pull off on the shoulder? 

I 

mean, I don't -- I just don't understand this.  I'll go 

read the case, but -­

MR. MARSH:  Well, the court didn't -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't drive in Indiana. 

I think that's pretty tough.

Your Honor, on where the line is, but -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Maybe that's why -- why 

it's a risk.  You stop in the middle of the road and 

then everybody -­

 MR. MARSH:  That would be more likely to 

create a risk, but the whole -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  How can you say somebody is 

fleeing?  I mean, doesn't fleeing mean you're trying to 

escape the -- the officer?

 MR. MARSH:  Justice Scalia, the holding of 

the Indiana Court of Appeals was in response to a 

position taken by the defendant, sort of along the lines 

of the two lines of questioning, which is surely the 

statute requires something more than merely failing to 

stop, but the Indiana Court of Appeals used precisely 

that language.  It -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  I think the problem with 

your argument is that the prosecution is not under any 

obligation to charge any offense greater than the 

offense for which your client was convicted in a case in 

which there is a very grave risk created by a flight. 

Isn't that true?

 MR. MARSH:  The prosecutor is not under any 

obligation; was that the question, Justice Alito?

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.

 MR. MARSH:  Yes, I think that's -- I think 

that's correct.  The prosecutor -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  So you -- the fact that 

someone is convicted of this offense does not show that 

a broad category of offenses within this crime lack the 

risk that's necessary under the Armed Career Criminal 

Act.

 MR. MARSH:  Well, I suggest that it does, 

Your Honor, because the -- the James case makes clear 

that the court will determine whether the crime creates 

a serious potential risk of physical injury to another 

by looking at the conduct encompassed by the elements of 

the offense.  Now, the fact that some other offense 

maybe could have been charged or was charged, I suggest, 

on the categorical approach is not relevant.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you familiar with the 

case called Hape v. State, Indiana Court of Appeals 

2009?

 MR. MARSH:  Tate versus -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Hape.  H-a-p-e.

 MR. MARSH:  I'm not, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  During a 45 -- and this 

involved the offense at issue here.  During a 45-minute 

high-speed chase, officers shot at the defendant's truck

at least 20 times.  The State's facts showed that the 

defendant drove over 100 miles an hour and at times 

drove into the oncoming traffic lane.

 Do you think that creates a -- a serious 

potential risk of -- of harm?

 MR. MARSH:  Well, those, of course, aren't 

the facts here.  And I would have to know what the 

individual was convicted of, because, of course, under 

the categorical -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  I believe he was convicted 

of the same offense as -- as Mr. Sykes.

 MR. MARSH:  But, of course, under the 

categorical approach established by Taylor and followed 

consistently by this Court since that time, the court 

doesn't look at the facts of the individual case.  The 

court looks at it categorically.  So if the -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  But looking at it 

categorically, I've always thought, means you look to 

see not just what the elements are on paper, but whether 

the elements as -- as used in reality in the State are 

applied to cases that do present -- in general, you 

apply it to cases that do present a serious risk of 

physical injury.  And you'd think the answer is we don't 

know because no one's gone and looked.  You could do it 

through sampling, but no one's gone and looked.  I've

just said that's my view of it.

 The -- the -- so what do we do?  I mean, I 

can deal with a lot of other States, but Arizona has 

exactly the same classification of felony when you use a 

vehicle and when you use a vehicle creating a serious 

risk of physical harm to others.  It's in the same 

provision, same statute, same category.  How do we work 

with that, in your opinion?

 MR. MARSH:  If the -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Are you following what I'm 

doing?  You understand the difference between Arizona 

and 46 other States?

 MR. MARSH:  Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  In the other States, they 

grade it.  But here they don't.

 MR. MARSH:  Right.  Well, Indiana, of 

course, does grade it, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Indiana -- I'm sorry.

 MR. MARSH:  And it is significant that the 

second most serious category is where the conduct does 

present a substantial risk of bodily injury.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And I -- I don't know how 

we could proceed by looking at, you know, whether in 

fact a majority of the cases that come into this first 

relatively harmless category did indeed involve

situations that involved physical risk because, as 

everybody knows, prosecutors plea bargain, and it's 

probably very often the case that the defendant is 

charged only under -- under category 1, where, you know, 

if he went to trial, they'd charge him under 3; isn't 

that so?

"yes."

 MR. MARSH:  But, of course, Your Honor -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, yes.  You want to say 

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MARSH:  Thank you.  Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I still -- look, what 

I'm thinking of -- and I need a little explanation -- we 

look to see in (b), and it says it's a class D felony if 

a vehicle is used.  That's (A) under (1).  Am I right?

 MR. MARSH:  Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Then we look to (B) 

under (1), and it's also a class D felony -- in other 

words, the same -- if a vehicle is operated in a manner 

that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury.

 MR. MARSH:  Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So a prosecutor looking at 

that will say:  Why don't I just charge (A); what's the 

point of charging (B)?

 I mean, it makes no difference apparently.

It's simpler to prove (A).

 MR. MARSH:  Justice Breyer, in 2003, when 

Mr. Sykes was convicted of this offense, what you said 

is exactly right.  Of course, we have no way of knowing 

the motivation of prosecutors generally, let alone in 

this case.  And it wouldn't really matter what it was in 

this case, what it is generally.  But I think it's 

significant that in 2006 the Indiana General Assembly 

amended that statute so now the (B) violation carries 

with it a mandatory jail sentence, 60 days.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I can deal with it more 

easily then, at least I have -- but what's worrying me 

now is what we're supposed to do is:  Is the offense an 

offense that presents a serious risk of physical injury 

to another?

 MR. MARSH:  Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So we're here trying to 

decide whether the (A) one does.

 MR. MARSH:  Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And the answer is I don't 

know, and the reason I don't know is I don't know how 

that offense language of (A) is applied in Indiana.

 MR. MARSH:  If the -­

enhancement of any kind, for convictions that have an 

element of -- of risk of harm to others?

 MR. MARSH:  Your Honor, there are a number 

of habitual sentencing enhancements, one of which 

specifically relates to driving.  I can't say that it is 

based on substantial -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it's possible that 

there is a -- there's a use of the difference between 

the two categories that might not be implicated in this 

case but may lay the foundation for an enhancement 

later?

 MR. MARSH:  Yes.  Now, that's a good point, 

Justice Sotomayor.  The -- the enhancements generally in 

Indiana relate to previous convictions, and so I can't 

say for sure, but it's entirely possible that (B), 

(b)(1)(B), would be a predicate crime for a habitual 

traffic offender, which is what it's called.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In your brief, you take 

issue with the Government's definition of "aggressive," 

but would you give us yours?

 MR. MARSH:  Well, Your Honor -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How would you define it 

and on what basis?

 MR. MARSH:  Your Honor, the best definition 

of "aggressive" that I've seen was in the First Circuit

opinion in the Herrick case, which is cited in our 

brief, which the First Circuit refers to as forceful 

action, especially where intended to dominate or master.

 But on general everyday language, it strikes 

me that when a law enforcement officer wants somebody to 

stop, whether they're in a vehicle or not, the fight or 

flee sort of comes into play.  And the person who 

responds by going toward the police officer and 

resisting in that way, which is the first part of this 

Indiana statute, would be acting in an aggressive way. 

The person who flees is not acting in an aggressive way. 

They're trying to avoid the confrontation.  They're 

trying to get away from the law enforcement.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Marsh, I take it that 

you would agree that (b)(1)(B) is a violent felony 

under -- under ACCA; is that right?

 MR. MARSH:  Your Honor, it may very well be. 

It certainly would satisfy the risk element, similar in 

risk to the -- to the Begay case.  I think it would 

still have to be decided whether it's violent and 

aggressive, but it may very well be.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, if we think that 

(b)(1)(B) is a violent felony under ACCA, and we know 

that (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) can receive the same 

punishment, that they're both classed as a class D

felony, why should we make the distinction between the 

two under ACCA?

 MR. MARSH:  Your Honor, I would suggest 

because the Indiana General Assembly has decided in 

enacting this legislation that some vehicular fleeing 

presents a substantial risk of bodily injury to another 

and some doesn't, and they've drawn this distinction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I presume that if -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But these are not nested 

offenses.  These are not -­

MR. MARSH:  I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  These are not lesser 

included offenses.  Each has an element that the other 

lacks, and both are classed with -- apparently that the 

-- that the State thinks of them as equally severe.  And 

if one is a violent felony under ACCA, there's an 

argument that the other should be treated in the exact 

same way.

 MR. MARSH:  Your Honor, I would suggest that 

the State doesn't treat them as equally severe.  The 

range of punishment for a class D felony, which both of 

those crimes are, is all the way from zero to 3 years in 

prison, and the actual conduct undoubtedly is a factor 

in what the person's ultimate sentence will be.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it may well be that in

deciding whether to accept a plea bargain of being 

guilty of (A) rather than going to trial on (B), if your 

client has two violent felonies already on the book, you 

might take -- take the plea bargain under (A) lest you 

run afoul of the violent felony act.

 MR. MARSH:  Yes, Your Honor, that's, of 

course, entirely possible.  But, again, just as with the 

categorical approach the court cannot take into account 

the motives of prosecutors, I would suggest the motives 

of defendants and defense lawyers can't be taken into 

account, either.  Further, I think it's more important 

that when Indiana enacted this statute, it was not 

thinking of ACCA and predicate crimes, I -- I assume.  I 

don't think the legislature takes those kind of things 

into account.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose the legislature were 

to repeal (b)(1)(B).  Would the offense for which Mr. 

Sykes was convicted then become an ACCA offense?

 MR. MARSH:  Your Honor, I -- that would be a 

question that would have to be decided on the basis of 

whether there's some basis to -- well, first of all, 

determine whether it's violent and aggressive.  And my 

position would remain it's still not violent and 

aggressive.  But even on the second part of the Begay 

approach, this Court has not seen anything that gives

you any basis for knowing what the risk of injury is.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand your 

answer to that question.  I would have thought that your 

answer, if you're insisting on a categorical approach, 

would be "no," that there's nothing in -- in (3) that 

requires any violence at all.  Just fleeing by visible 

or audible means, just -- just flees.  That's all it 

says.

 MR. MARSH:  I'm sorry.  I understood the 

question to be that (A) is repealed and (B) is left in 

place; was that -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, it's the opposite.  If 

the aggravated offense -- you rely on the aggravated 

offense -­

MR. MARSH:  Right.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  -- in large part as a basis 

for your argument.

 MR. MARSH:  Right.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Your argument -- one of your 

main arguments, as I understand it, is that -- what I'll 

call the simple offense doesn't qualify under ACCA 

because cases involving a serious risk of bodily injury 

fall under the aggravated category.  And my question is 

whether a repeal of the aggravated offense would change 

-- would then convert the simple offense from a non-ACCA

offense to an ACCA offense.  Or you could ask it a 

different way.  If State 1 has the simple offense and 

the aggravated offense, State 2 has just the simple 

offense, is the simple offense an ACCA offense in one 

State and not in the other State even though the 

elements are exactly the same?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a good question.

 MR. MARSH:  Your Honor, the equation would 

be different because of the significance of the (B) 

offense.  So that's not exactly our case.  But I will 

adopt Justice Scalia's answer, which I think is exactly 

right.  I -- it still would not be something that's 

violent or aggressive.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But you're -- you're 

answering my question by making a totally different 

argument.  Insofar as you're relying on the aggravated 

offense, the presence of the aggravated offense, I would 

appreciate an answer to it.

 MR. MARSH:  Justice Alito, the -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  In other words, you're 

saying -- maybe I haven't made myself clear.  You're --

Justice Scalia's answer, which you have adopted, is that 

if you look at (A) by itself, forget about the 

aggravated offense completely; it doesn't qualify under 

ACCA.  And that's -- that's one argument.

But your -- your other argument is that (A), 

the simple offense, doesn't qualify because of the 

presence of (B).  And I'm trying to see whether that 

makes sense.

 MR. MARSH:  Yes, Justice Alito, I think it 

breaks down to the two parts of the Begay test.  In 

order to be a violent felony, it has to be similar in 

kind and similar in degree of risk.

 The existence of (B) makes clear that the 

degree of risk for violating (A) is not the same, 

because if you accept the continuum of behavior as 

created by the Indiana General Assembly, the person 

who's convicted of (A) has not created a substantial 

risk of bodily injury.  It's -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, have you done 

or looked at -- not every burglary has a risk of harm to 

another or results in harm to another.  The general 

definition of burglary is entering without permission 

and intent to commit a crime, and generically the crime 

doesn't have to be physical injury to others.

 MR. MARSH:  Right.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yet, ACCA defines 

burglary as a qualifying crime of violence.  It's 

measuring risk, not by the elements of that crime, but 

by something else, by some measure of incidents in which

violence might occur.

 So how is that different than the 

Government's argument here and the question that Justice 

Breyer asked you, which was:  It is true, potentially 

there's some forms of fleeing that might not pose a risk 

of injury, but statistically there's a large number of 

incidents in which violence follows.

 So, how is that different than burglary? 

That's really my question.  What -- it can't be that the 

elements have to pose a risk of injury, because burglary 

doesn't do that.  So, what -- how do we measure it?

 MR. MARSH:  Your Honor, the inquiry, as the 

Court said in James, is whether the conduct encompassed 

by the elements of the offense presents the risk.  And 

that's the -- the determination that the court has to 

consider.

 It's not -- it is not necessary, and I'm not 

contending, that this crime is a violent felony only if 

every conceivable violation of the statute constitutes a 

risk of danger.  That -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if you're not doing 

that, that's my question:  Where do we draw the line?

 MR. MARSH:  You draw it -- I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where do we draw the 

line?

MR. MARSH:  You draw the line -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think that was what 

20

Justice Breyer was trying to ask you earlier, which is: 

When do we say that, as in burglary, that some risk is 

more likely to follow than not in a particular type of 

crime?

 MR. MARSH:  Well, the line is defined by the 

statute:  Serious potential risk of physical injury to 

another.

 Now, how do you make that determination? 

Well, the Court made clear in Chambers that empirical 

data is one way to do it.  There isn't any here because 

of all the empirical data presented by the Government. 

It relates to vehicular fleeing as if there was one 

crime of vehicular fleeing, and most of it is -- is 

calculated based on death or injury, and that, of 

course, is not the category that we have here.  If -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I suppose that if we agreed 

with you that whether it is a violent crime depends upon 

what other prosecutions for fleeing could have been 

brought.  If we agree with you that (1)(A) is negligible 

because there are other bigger ones for which he wasn't 

charged, we could leave open the question of what -­

what happens in a State that has only one crime for 

fleeing, and we would -- then we would have to confront

the question that Justice Sotomayor has asked.

 But if we accept your notion that -- where 

you have a gradation that is adopted by the State, the 

lowest gradation cannot be determined to have a high 

percentage of bodily risk, right?

 MR. MARSH:  Yes, that's correct, Justice 

Scalia.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  My problem is there is 

arguably not here a gradation.

 Suppose it only had (A).  If it only had 

(A), for me -- I'm not saying for you -- this wouldn't 

be a tough case.  That is to say, I can't imagine a 

person running away from a police in a car where there 

isn't a real risk to other people.  He's speeding, you 

know.  I would think -- I don't see how you get away 

from the policeman unless you speed, and there are going 

to be pedestrians.  Who knows?  But I think that was 

pretty -- at least as bad -- at least as much of a risk 

as burglary.  So that would be the end of the case.  It 

would be simple.  At least assume that.

 Now, then, however, suppose we have a State 

which says:  But it's a worse thing to run away and 

create a risk.  In a separate provision.  It's a worse 

thing.  All right?  Then I'd say, huh, now I'm not so 

sure.  Why didn't they charge the worse thing?  This

must be reserved for cases where it isn't.

 So here we have a rather weird situation. 

They're saying it's a different thing but not a worse 

thing.  So now I say:  Well, why didn't they charge --

Huh?  Now I don't know.  I don't know why they didn't 

charge the separate special one.  I don't know what the 

facts are.  I'm puzzled.

 Now, that's your case.  That's where I 

needed the enlightenment.  So, what's the enlightenment?

 MR. MARSH:  Your Honor, it's not a weird 

situation, because the Indiana definition of the crime 

of vehicular fleeing is not one all-encompassing crime. 

It's -- they took the all-encompassing generic vehicular 

fleeing and divided it into five subparts, which I 

suggest makes it much easier to resolve the (b)(1)(A) 

question.

 If there is no other categories, that would 

be Justice Scalia's point, I think, and then it would be 

a much harder question.  And it may very well be that it 

would be considered a violent felony.  For one thing -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  But isn't it still -- isn't 

it still an empirical question?  If we were to look at 

all of the cases that are prosecuted under what I'll 

call the simple offense, we might discover that those 

are all cases in which there is no serious potential

risk of physical injury created because all of the risky 

cases are prosecuted under the aggravated label.

 We might also find that there are still a 

great many cases that involve a serious potential risk 

that are prosecuted under the simple category.  So the 

fact that there's a gradation doesn't allow us to escape 

the empirical issue, does it?

 MR. MARSH:  No, I think you're exactly 

right, Justice Alito.  That would be possible. 

Empirical data could show what you have just suggested. 

Of course, that would be indicating that the Indiana 

General Assembly didn't have any rational basis for 

dividing the two, but the important thing here is -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  I wouldn't say that they 

didn't have a rational basis for dividing it.  It would 

just show a pattern of prosecution and -- and plea 

bargaining.  That's what it would show.

 MR. MARSH:  But the important thing here, 

Your Honor, is there simply is no such data before this 

Court.  There -- there is no empirical data regarding 

(b)(1)(A).

 JUSTICE ALITO:  There never is really 

reliable empirical data, almost never, for any of the 

issues that have to be decided under the -- the 

catch-all, the residual clause, of ACCA.  It has to be

based on basically common sense and experience, doesn't 

it?

 MR. MARSH:  Your Honor, I suggest that 

common sense and experience is not a reliable, 

predictable way of deciding these cases.  You're right, 

there frequently is not empirical data.  If there's not 

either empirical data that demonstrates the danger 

involved or a crime that -- where the danger is pretty 

obvious so that there would be widespread general 

agreement -- common sense is what has led to a lot of 

the conflicts in the circuits, I would suggest.

 May I reserve my time, Your Honor?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. WALL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Just a very quick moment of history, I 

think, provides some useful background, and I'm on 

page 3a of the appendix to the Government's brief. 

Until 1998, subsection (B), which we've been talking 

about, was the only class D felony that involved 

vehicular flight in Indiana law.  In 1998, the Indiana

General Assembly broke out and enacted subsection (A) so 

that in cases of vehicular flight prosecutors would not 

have to prove risk; they would just have to prove that 

defendant used a vehicle.

 Since 1998, I have found 14 cases in the 

Indiana Court of Appeals, one of which is the Hape case 

that Justice Alito cited earlier.  All of them, so far 

as I can tell, proceeded under (A) and not under (B). 

Of those 14 cases, 13 have enough facts to tell what the 

flight was -- of what kind; 10 involved speeding, 

disregarding traffic laws, or striking an officer with a 

vehicle.  Of the other three, only one involved 

non-risky behavior, and even that was not a defendant 

who drove a short distance and then pulled over.  It was

all litigated to conviction and taken up on appeal, and 

the Indiana Court of Appeals addressed various legal 

issues -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that's not 

-- 14 isn't very many.  And I assume the vast majority 

of these cases aren't litigated.

Justice.  The Government's point is that here we have 

extensive data, both empirical and otherwise, that 

indicates that flight as a basic offense is very 

dangerous.  In -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I read your 

brief, and I was -- I read your brief and was surprised 

that when you're -- the list -- one of the things you 

talk about to show that is media reports.  You usually 

have a more concrete basis for -- for speculation than 

media reports.

 MR. WALL:  Mr. Chief Justice, if that is all 

we had put forward, I might agree with you, but we also 

put forward extensive statistical data.

 My point is just that Indiana is typical. 

It's dangerous everywhere else.  It's four times as 

dangerous as arson.  It's more dangerous than household 

burglary.  There's nothing different about Indiana.  If 

one looks through these cases, these flights in Indiana 

are typically quite dangerous.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Suppose you have a State 

that has a separate crime for trespassing, criminal 

trespass.  And you're saying that if -- if you could 

show that a large number of cases that were brought 

under criminal trespass in fact could have been 

prosecuted under burglary, then criminal trespass would

qualify as a -- as a violent felony.  That doesn't seem 

-- that doesn't seem to me right.

 MR. WALL:  Justice Scalia, I thought -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just because prosecutors 

make that choice, that doesn't establish that the 

elements of the crime, which is what we focus on in 

deciding whether it's a violent felony, fill the bill.

 MR. WALL:  That's right.  This Court looks 

at the conduct encompassed by the elements in a typical 

case.  And in a typical case of vehicular flight, what 

we have, according to the data, is someone fleeing 

police at an average of 25 miles an hour over the speed 

limit; someone who is, in a typical case, young, male, 

unlicensed, under the influence of alcohol; and who 

places the lives of other motorists, pedestrians, and 

police in harm's way.

 Your approach to ACCA, Justice Scalia, has 

been to look at the conduct encompassed by the elements 

and ask whether the risk from that conduct is at least 

as great as the -- the least risky enumerated offense. 

And here -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That ignores the in-kind 

requirement of Begay, because you seem to be confusing 

the risk of violence with the in-kind inquiry, and 

that's where I'm trying -- I'd like you to concentrate a

little bit on, which is in burglary the defendant is 

breaking into, generally, a place and going without 

permission, and -- with an intent to commit a crime.

 How is that comparable to merely not 

stopping when a police officer tells you not to stop? 

How is that an in-kind -­

MR. WALL:  Justice Sotomayor, it's 

absolutely true, there are two parts to the test, and 

we've been talking about the first risk.  On the second 

prong, the purposeful, violent, or aggressive character 

of the conduct -- here I think there are three distinct 

things that make it purposeful, violent, and aggressive.

 First, you have the defiance of the 

officer's order, which can cause injury at the scene. 

It has in some Indiana cases, but at least called the 

officer to give chase.

 Second, you have the very real prospect -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What you're doing is 

saying I'm not -- you're not even saying I'm not 

stopping; you're just driving away.

 MR. WALL:  Well, yes, but you are driving -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, how is that 

aggressive -­

MR. WALL:  You're driving away in response 

to an officer's command to stop.  You're calling the 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

29 

officer to give chase.  You're -- you're -- pursuit is 

likely.  And even when there isn't pursuit, these 

offenders drive typically very recklessly, and then 

you've got the confrontation when the officers have 

to -­

of -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's the risk 

MR. WALL:  -- terminate.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That -- that is all the 

risk question, and you're confusing the police actions 

with the defendant's, because you're talking about the 

defendant responding to a police pursuit.  So what -­

what is in the act of the crime that makes it in-kind to 

burglary?

 MR. WALL:  So, let me analogize -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I concentrate on 

burglary because the others don't fit.

 MR. WALL:  No, let me concentrate on 

burglary, then, and analogize it to what this Court said 

in James.  It said the risk of attempted burglary -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  James -- James predated 

Begay.  So you've got -­

MR. WALL:  That's right, but I -- the Court 

has talked about -- even in Chambers, about the risk of 

a violent confrontation with law enforcement officials,

and it's done that under the Begay part of the test. 

And whereas that confrontation is only possible with 

burglary, it's necessary with this crime.  It requires 

that an officer order you to stop and that you flee.

 So that -- that confrontation, which is only 

a possibility with burglary or attempted burglary, is 

elevated to a certainty with this offense.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Wall, wouldn't 

that suggest that if I just ran from a police officer, 

it would be a violent felony under ACCA?

 MR. WALL:  I think it -- it would suggest 

that, Justice Kagan, but I think flight on foot is 

unlikely to satisfy the risk part of the test.  I think 

certainly this case is much easier on the -- the James 

part of this test.  I think the -- the flight in a 

vehicle poses risks, very real risks, to other motorists 

and pedestrians and police that flight on foot doesn't 

pose, although you'd still have the confrontation when 

the flight on foot was terminated.  So I think some of 

the arguments would translate.  You're right.  I think 

there would be more difficult questions, though, on the 

risk prong.  This is a much easier case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do -- do words mean 

nothing?  I mean, we're talking about a violent felony. 

That's what the Federal law requires.  And -- and you

want us to hold that failing to stop when a police 

officer tells you to stop is a violent felony.  That -­

that seems to me a -- a big leap.  I mean, words have 

some meaning, and Congress focused on violent felonies.

 MR. WALL:  Justice Scalia, words do have 

meaning, but the words here are very broad:  "serious 

potential risk of physical injury to others."  And as 

you yourself have recognized in -- in multiple opinions, 

what those words call for is a comparison of risk 

between an offense and ACCA's enumerated crimes.

 This offense, simply put, is more risky. 

It's four times as risky as arson in terms of injuries 

and fatalities.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, one of the -­

MR. WALL:  It's more risky than household 

burglary.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Another word is 

"aggressive" in Begay, and that's where I have a little 

difficulty with your argument.  It seems to me, this is 

the exact opposite of aggressive.  He's running away. 

Certainly, the other option is to turn and confront, and 

he doesn't want to.  There's nothing aggressive about 

running away.

 MR. WALL:  Well, there is, Mr. Chief

typically at high speeds.  So, in Chambers -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's the 

risk of violence, I understand that, and purposeful, 

which I guess everything is.  But those are the three 

words:  "purposeful, violent, and aggressive."  I'll 

give you purposeful, I'll give you violent, but 

aggressive?

 MR. WALL:  Mr. Chief Justice, if you give me 

those two, I think we're home free, because this Court 

said -­

 MR. WALL:  -- in Chambers -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think you're 

two-thirds of the way home free.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. WALL:  I'll take it, and let's work on 

the last third.  So the -- what this Court said in 

Chambers is not all attempts to evade authorities are of 

the same stripe.  So, it contrasted escape from prison 

with failure to report.  Failure to report, you could do 

at home on your couch; you could just fail to show up. 

And the Court said:  Look, that's passive; it's a crime 

of inaction.

 This is not that.  It's not sitting at home 

on one's couch.  This is quintessentially a crime of

action.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There's a 

difference.  The opposite of passive is active.  It's 

not aggressive.

 MR. WALL:  Well, but -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This is active. 

He's running away, but -­

MR. WALL:  I think -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What's the 

aggression?

 MR. WALL:  But it's very -- it's hard to see 

what the difference would be between this and escape 

from custody.  And this Court clearly indicated in -- in 

Chambers that escape from custody was different from 

failure to report under the statute in front of it.  And 

I think this is as dangerous, maybe even more dangerous 

than escape from custody.

 If the Court were going to say that all 

running away could not be aggressive within the meaning 

of that word for Begay purposes, so too escape from a 

maximum security Federal prison, which in some sense is 

just running away, but it is extremely aggressive, and 

it's extremely risky to others.

speeding or drag racing qualifies under your

understanding of the test?

 MR. WALL:  Justice Kagan, that's a difficult 

question.  I don't know that I've seen any attempt to 

fit that offense in under the ACCA.  I think that drag 

racing, where you're talking about speeds of 150, 160, 

170 miles an hour, might qualify, but I haven't seen any 

cases like that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about speeding, just 

-- you know, you're going 15 miles over the speed limit?

 MR. WALL:  I -- again, I -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that a violent felony?

 MR. WALL:  Justice Scalia, I think then we'd 

have a serious question about the first part of the 

analysis and the -- the risk test.  I mean, 10, 15 miles 

over -- I mean, speeding as a generic offense is likely 

to -- I mean, it encompasses categorically all speeding 

offenses, many of which are, you know, not that -- not 

likely to pose a serious risk to others.  So I -- I -­

we'd have to look at the -- the data.  What we do have 

here is data that says this offense is four times as 

risky as the enumerated offense of arson.  So I -- I -­

speeding would be a difficult case.  So far as I know, 

we -- the Government's never tried to make the case.

basic offense.  Now, whether in a Begay-type sense you 

might have some recidivism enhancement under State law 

that would get you there, I don't know.  But I -- again, 

I haven't seen any case that involved that.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Am I right about -- when 

you replied to Justice Scalia, I thought that he had 

said that we were dealing with a statute, and you seemed 

to agree, that said it is a crime to flee a policeman 

after being ordered to stop.  But I thought we were 

dealing with a statute that says it is a crime to flee a 

policeman after being ordered to stop, in a vehicle.

 MR. WALL:  That's right.  That's right. 

That's the offense here.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And so you're -- okay.

 MR. WALL:  It's the vehicular flight 

offense.  And one -- you know, I will take one issue 

with -- with -- you know, what my friend on the other 

side has said, which is (A) and (B) are not tiered. 

They're not greater and lesser offenses under State law.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Wall, suppose they 

were.  I understand your point that they're not, and you 

might be right about that.  But let's suppose that they 

were.  Let's suppose you had a three-tier set-up.  One 

was simple flight; one was flight that causes risk of 

injury; one that is a flight that causes injury.  And

let's even say that the simple flight -- no, let's -­

let's call them all felonies but different classes of 

felonies.

 What would happen in that case?  Would you 

still be here saying that the simple flight felony is a 

violent crime?

 MR. WALL:  Yes.  It's a tougher case, but we 

would be here saying that, because when you're looking 

at an offense categorically -- for instance, arson -­

you've got to look at all fires, all intentionally set 

fires, the ones that don't hurt anybody, the ones that 

do, and the ones that kill people, even though the fires 

that kill people will be prosecutable in most 

jurisdictions as a greater offense, like felony murder. 

And so when you're looking at it categorically, you've 

got to look at all of the conduct in that category, even 

conduct that may be prosecutable under some greater 

offense.

 I think, you know, the other side sort of 

relies on this assumption that all conduct which might 

satisfy the greater will necessarily be prosecuted under 

the greater.  And as a legal matter, it's included 

within the lesser, and as a factual matter, it's just 

not true that it always gets prosecuted under that 

greater offense.

So it's -- it would be a tougher case.  It 

would make our case more difficult, but I think legally 

and factually the Government's answer would be the same.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I asked my clerk to 

just do a survey of the States, and he came up with -­

and I'm sure that this is rough -- but that 46 of the 

States have these tiered systems.  Now, there may be 

some questions as to some of them, like you've raised 

some questions about Indiana's, but that 46 States 

essentially conceive of this as two different kinds of 

conduct, one which is the violent kind and the other 

which is the not violent crime.

 MR. WALL:  Well, my State law research is a 

little different from your clerk's.  I've got 37 States 

and D.C.  But the -- the point is that under the nested 

statutes, the aggravator isn't always like this one, 

risk.  Sometimes it's, as in Indiana, injury or death. 

And where you're talking about actual injury or death, 

those aggravators far outstrip the level of potential 

risk that ACCA requires.

 So I don't think in those States Petitioner 

would give an argument that those aggravators would 

affect at all the analysis of the basic offense.  There 

are a handful of States that, unlike Indiana, have as an 

aggravator risk, though even some of those States treat

the basic offense as a felony, which is I think a 

judgment by the State that, even in the basic case, this 

is risky conduct, deserving of severe punishment under 

State law.  So, you know, there are nested statutes, 

but -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not necessarily risky. 

Conduct that shows disrespect for the law.

 MR. WALL:  Justice Scalia, I mean I -­

again, I think it is significant that in 1998 the 

General Assembly broke this out as a separate subsection 

and said:  We're not even going to require prosecutors 

to prove risk.  I think that represents a judgment by 

the State that the conduct is risky on a typical basis: 

We just want the State to prove you used a vehicle.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or even if it isn't risky, 

you should not thumb your nose at the police when they 

tell you to stop.

 MR. WALL:  Well, that's right, and the 

reason -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Risky or not.

 MR. WALL:  The reason you shouldn't, Justice 

Scalia, is because that's the kind of purposeful, 

violent, and aggressive conduct the State wants to deter 

by treating it as a felony.  But I -- I mean, I -­

cases in Indiana or elsewhere, or whether one looks at 

the character of the conduct, this offense is just 

different in both degree and kind from the offenses that 

this Court has said fall outside of ACCA's residual 

clause.

 It's much more like escape from custody. 

It's much more like the enumerated offenses.  Indeed, 

the risk of confrontation is certain.  I mean, I -- it's 

important, I think, that -- I mean, I -- these flights 

are not calm affairs.  They're dangerous events.  The 

average speed that the offender is traveling nationwide 

is 25 miles an hour over the speed limit.  This is 

someone who on average is young, unlicensed, influenced 

by alcohol -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought there was 

-- I don't know where -- I don't remember where it was 

from.  I thought there was a development of best police 

practices that you don't just chase people.  You know, 

if they're going 30 miles an hour over the speed limit 

through a school zone, that doesn't mean the police 

officer should do that.  You know, you call ahead, they 

put these strips on the road, whatever.

 MR. WALL:  Mr. Chief Justice, that's right. 

I think police agencies have been struggling with this 

question, which is why there's a lot of data on police

pursuits, frankly, especially in the last 10 or 15 

years.  I think some of them are becoming more 

restrictive, and so the data picks up pursuits.  It 

doesn't pick up all flights.  And I think if there were 

sound evidence that when people were not pursued, they 

were actually driving at low speeds and safely, that 

would affect the data, though not so much that it would 

move it outside of similarity to the enumerated 

offenses.

 But I think the -- the data is pretty good 

in indicating that the typical flight is -- really does 

pose a serious potential risk of physical injury to 

others, a risk that materializes more often than with 

other crimes that Congress clearly intended to fall 

within the ACCA.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I ask you this:  If a 

person is convicted of vehicular flight that causes 

death, is that aggressive conduct?

 MR. WALL:  Yes, the Government would say it 

is, Justice Alito.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Is the conduct there any 

different from the conduct when death doesn't result?

 MR. WALL:  No, Justice Alito.  The 

Government's answer is that categorically the behavior 

is aggressive and that in some cases it will result in 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

41 

injury or death and in some it will not, but in all 

cases it carries that potential.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Doesn't whether it's 

aggressive or not depend upon how it happened?  I mean, 

it could be -- I mean, the flight puts in place the 

potential for -- for violence, I agree with that; but if 

somebody just, you know, jumps out between two cars 

while the fellow's fleeing, how has his conduct changed 

to aggressive?

 MR. WALL:  Mr. Chief -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's not like he -­

it's not like he's aiming for the guy.  I mean, it's 

putting it in a dangerous situation.  It's purposeful. 

Again, I'll give you violent in the sense that it has 

that potential.  But he didn't want to hit the -- the 

person.

 MR. WALL:  Mr. Chief Justice -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's not aggression 

against the person.

 MR. WALL:  There's no question that, on a 

case by case basis, you could flee in a way that was not 

very risky, that was not very violent, or not very 

aggressive.  And if this Court went on a case-by-case 

basis, then we'd look at the conduct here, and the 

Government would still win, because this is the typical

case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But he's saying even when 

it's risky, it's not aggressive.

 MR. WALL:  And I -- my -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You can be risky and not 

aggressive, can't you?

 MR. WALL:  Yes, on a case-by-case basis. 

But, categorically, which is what this Court looks at, 

the conduct encompassed by the elements in the ordinary 

case -- in the ordinary case -- the character of the 

conduct is aggressive.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Who's he aggressing 

against?  When someone sees the police and says I'm 

getting out of here and drives down the highway, say, at 

80 miles an hour, you know, 25 miles above the speed 

limit, who is he -- I'm sure it's not the right verb, 

but who is he aggressing against?

 MR. WALL:  Well, I don't know that he is 

aggressing against anyone, in the same way that if I 

recklessly I fire a gun into a large crowd of people, 

you know, I haven't aggressed against anyone in 

particular.  He's aggressed against anyone who strays 

into his field of flight and who could be injured by 

what is typically a high-speed flight and pursuit.  So I 

don't -- there is no specific target, but that will be

true of many of the crimes that are violent felonies, 

that the -- the aggressive nature -­

generally.

MR. WALL:  -- of the conduct is directed 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- there's no 

specific target.  There's no target.  What this guy 

hopes is that nobody gets in his way.

 MR. WALL:  Well, so, too, with the burglar, 

who hopes that no one will come home; maybe even the 

arsonist, who hopes no one is in the house; or the 

extortionist, who hopes someone will pay, so he won't 

have to use violence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But they're mentioned; 

they're mentioned.  They're mentioned, and you're trying 

to get this in under the residual clause.

 MR. WALL:  That's right, Justice Scalia, a 

residual clause that, as you yourself have recognized, 

is extremely broadly worded.  It -- it abstracts out as 

the quality of the enumerated offenses that they create 

a serious potential risk of physical injury to others. 

And I can't find any metric along which flight doesn't 

do that, whether one looks through the cases, media 

reports, the statistical data, whatever one -- Indiana,

nationally -- whatever standard or metric one uses, this 

is an extremely risky offense to others.

 And I, you know -- so it's very difficult to 

figure out what test, what interpretation of that 

language would exclude this from -- from ACCA.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose you have one of 36 

States which treat this -- treat the general offense as 

a misdemeanor and then make it a felony if you put 

somebody at risk.  Just reading that statute, you'd 

think those 36 States, when they have the general 

offense, do something where the guy acted pretty 

trivially; and where it's a felony, he actually put 

somebody at risk, sped off -- wouldn't that be your 

normal instinct in just guessing from the -- from the 

language?

 MR. WALL:  Justice Breyer, the States -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  How are we supposed to 

treat those, where there's a misdemeanor -­

MR. WALL:  The States -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  In your opinion, it's just 

a misdemeanor, we also treat it the same way; say it's a 

violent felony?

 MR. WALL:  The States treat it differently. 

Some, as Indiana -­

actually my question.  Are we supposed to, in this 

Federal statute, try to track whether it's a 

misdemeanor, what the language is?  We're going to have 

a nightmare of a Federal law for States to -- for judges 

to figure this out.  I mean, every little variation in 

thousands and thousands of possible variations could 

make a difference as to whether it's violent or not, 

depending on data which no one will have.

 MR. WALL:  Justice Breyer, I don't think so. 

If the Court were to affirm here, what that would mean 

is that the offense of flight is a violent felony 

insofar as you have a predicate conviction under a State 

statute where it's been punishable by up to a year, and 

so it could qualify for ACCA coverage.

 Now, some State convictions will have been 

treated as misdemeanors and won't be eligible for ACCA, 

but to the extent a State treats it as a felony, it's 

risky enough to satisfy the residual clause.  Now, if 

the Court treats (A) and (B) as what they are not, which 

is greater or lesser, then, yes, I think there will be 

problems with various State statutes, as Justice Kagan 

pointed out, and this Court may have to clear it up down 

the road.

 But if it treats this basic offense as what 

it is, not a greater or lesser, but alternative means of

proving a single offense that is risky, that would, I 

think, take care of all flight cases going forward.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, on this question of 

whether this statute is greater or lesser, it's greater 

or lesser if you just understand (b)(1)(A) as confined 

to vehicular flight.  In other words, if one looks only 

at vehicular flight, then (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) are 

indeed greater or lesser offenses.

 MR. WALL:  Yes, Justice Kagan, if you're 

looking only -- I take it you're looking only at the 

vehicle prong of (B), but the test in Schmuck is whether 

it's impossible to -- to commit the greater without 

committing the lesser.  It's not impossible to commit 

(B), because it does have the two other prongs, and I 

think -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, do you think that if I 

flee in a vehicle, I could be prosecuted under both and 

receive sentences under both?

 MR. WALL:  No, I don't think so, because I 

think the -- there is no evidence -- no case in Indiana 

that I'm aware of.  There's no evidence that the General 

Assembly intended these to be multiple punishments for a 

single incident.  They're alternative means of proving a 

single offense.  The State has always treated them that 

way, so far as I can tell.  I have not seen -- I've seen

prosecutions since 1998 that were all under (A).  I 

haven't seen anything that went under (A) and (B) and 

tried to get multiple punishments -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Wait a minute.

 MR. WALL:  -- and I think that would be a 

serious problem.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm a little confused by 

what you said and what point you're making.  You don't 

think that (B) is a lesser included of (A)?  Is that -­

no, that (A) is a lesser included of (B)?

 MR. WALL:  Your Honor, the Government does 

not think that (A) is a lesser included of (B).

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You can't commit (B) 

without committing (A) first.  (B) has just one 

additional element, but all of the elements of (A) are 

part of the elements of (B).  So, how can it not be a 

lesser included?

 MR. WALL:  Well, the element of (B) that's 

different, Justice Sotomayor, is the "while committing 

any offense described in subsection (a)."  So you can be 

resisting an officer or you can be obstructing the 

service of process and you can endanger someone in 

various ways, including with a vehicle, and you will 

have violated (B), and you can be prosecuted for that, 

and there are cases in Indiana like that.  And you have

not -- you have not been fleeing in a vehicle from an 

officer at any point, so you haven't violated (A).

 So the existence of the other prong there -­

that's what I was trying to get into with Justice 

Kagan -- means that this is not a greater or lesser 

under Schmuck.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But as a vehicular flight 

only, it would be greater or lesser.

 MR. WALL:  If you divided up the prongs 

under Schmuck, but I think the Schmuck -- what follows 

logically from that test is that you look at the entire 

offense and ask whether it's possible to commit it 

without committing the lesser, and that test is not 

satisfied here.  I don't think you carve it up prong by 

prong.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm -- this is greater or 

lesser for purposes of what?  Double jeopardy?

 MR. WALL:  No, it's greater or lesser for 

purposes of Petitioner's argument that you should assume 

that every risky flight gets prosecuted under (B), and 

hence (A) is a non-risky offense.  And that argument 

fails for multiple reasons, one of which I was trying to 

spin out.  It's not even true that this is greater or 

lesser.

argument.  I mean, it -- it seems to me that, yes, you 

could -- you could run afoul of (B) by committing an 

offense under subsection little (a) in some other ways, 

but if you run afoul of (B) by committing the offense 

of -- of flight from a law enforcement officer, it seems 

to me that that automatically includes (A).

 MR. WALL:  Well, except that there are two 

alternative means of proving the same offense under 

State law.  They have the same State law penalties, so 

the prosecutors can go under (A) or they can go under 

(B).  And as far as I can tell, for the last, say, 13 

years, they've been going under -- they've been going 

under (A).

 So it's not -- Justice Scalia, it's not -­

there are aggravators in this statute for injury or 

death.  They're the ones that are in (2) and (3), the 

class C and class B felonies.  But this is not a greater 

or lesser.  It's -- they're alternative means.  I think 

only if you got -- set that aside would you get to the 

sort of Schmuck analysis that I was going through with 

-- with Justice Kagan.

 And I think one of the important things to 

recognize about this offense is that, you know, in 

the -- 50 percent of these offenders are ultimately 

charged with a violation that's unrelated to their

flight, a serious felony unrelated to their flight.

 And the reason I think that's important is 

because what you will look -- the reason that they're 

traveling at such high speeds, the reason they're 

evading officers, the reason the typical case is not 

someone just going a couple blocks and stopping, is 

because they've got drugs in the car or guns, they have 

parole violations or outstanding warrants.  It is the 

background against which I think you have to assess the 

character of the -- of the conduct here.  And whether 

you're looking at it under risk or under the character 

of the conduct, the Government submits that it easily 

satisfies the residual clause.

 If there are no further questions, thank 

you.

violent than escape from custody?  What's your best 

answer to why this is just not identical to escape, 

which is a fleeing-from situation just as this is.

 MR. MARSH:  Justice Sotomayor, the basic 

distinction is that the person who's charged with 

escape, assuming that escape means escape from a secure 

institution or from a person, is that the person is in 

custody, and it takes, in the ordinary case, aggression 

and violence to get out of the custody of that person. 

The person who is fleeing is trying to avoid being 

taken.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, here an officer 

has told you to stop.  They're trying to effect custody. 

And I don't know what the aggression or violence is, 

other than, you know, breaking a window, doing 

something.  It doesn't require the escape -- that you 

actually injure someone to get out.  It's just that you 

run away.

 MR. MARSH:  I think the phrase that you just 

used is the distinction that I was referring to.  The 

person who is fleeing is trying to avoid being in

the officer and resisting, they're going away from the 

officer.  The person who is in custody has to use some 

kind of force, and in Johnson, of course the -- this

Court referred to violent as the -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  That's not true.  There are 

a lot -- you can -- there are prison escapes all the 

time where it's done through subterfuge.

 MR. MARSH:  That's -- that's true, Justice 

Alito, but as the Court held in James, finding an 

example of a case that would not be violent does not 

solve the ordinary case.  The ordinary case, I would 

suggest, requires something more than that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's, for me, 

anyway, an important question.  I'll -- I'm not sure the 

ordinary case does.  I assume the ordinary prison escape 

is -- I don't know -- over the wall, under the tunnel 

or, you know, while the guard's looking a different way, 

or some -- I don't know that it's typical that when the 

guard is there, you say now's my chance.  The typical 

case doesn't involve aggression.

 MR. MARSH:  Of course, the ordinary case or 

the typical case, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the court 

needs to look at the conduct encompassed by the elements 

of the statute, and so we would have to look at exactly 

what the statute requires.

 The circuit courts have been very divided on 

escape.  In my circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Federal 

statute, 751, has been held not to be -- which is a

general escape statute -- not to be a violent felony. 

But, again, the Court talks about the ordinary case in 

the James case for the purpose of disabusing the idea 

that one can't get out from under the violent felony 

designation just by coming up with a hypothetical case 

or an example where it can be done without -- without 

violence.

 Here, I would suggest that counsel has just 

created for the Court some kind of a hypothetical case 

to define the typical or ordinary case.  This Court has 

never done that, and this Court said in James that it's 

important to stick to the conduct encompassed by the 

elements of the offense, because if we start factoring 

in other kinds of conduct, as several of the things 

which have been mentioned by counsel for the Government, 

that begins to raise Apprendi problems, which is another 

whole issue.  But the Court said in James -- and I would 

acknowledge is the law -- that so long as the 

determination as to whether there's a serious potential 

risk of physical injury is made by focusing on the 

conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, then 

there's not an Apprendi problem.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 MR. MARSH:  Thank you.
