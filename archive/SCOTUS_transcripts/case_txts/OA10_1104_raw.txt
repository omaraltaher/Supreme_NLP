 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

5

7
8
9  please the Court:
 Over the last three decades, the Court has 
10
11  made clear that Bivens remedies are disfavored and will 
12  only be authorized in narrow situations where there are 
13  no adequate alternative means for redressing a 
14  plaintiff's injuries and no other factor counsels 
15
16  He has not shown that he lacked a traditional tort 
17  remedy for the injuries of which he complains, and 
18  Petitioners' status as employees of a private 
19  contractor, rather than the government, at a minimum 
20
21
22  said initially; that is, if there's no alternative 
23  remedy, Bivens fills the gap. 
24
25

gives rise to factors counseling hesitation. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We go back to what you 

 Suppose we had a case just like Carlson, 

only the State law allows survivor actions.  In Carlson, 

hesitation.  Respondent has satisfied neither criterion.

 MR. FRANKLIN:  Well, the rule --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that so? 
 MR. FRANKLIN:  In -- the rule -- the Carlson 

Congress has pre-empted all tort claims against them. 
So, whether Indiana law now -- which has been amended, 
but whether Indiana law provides a remedy or doesn't is 
immaterial, because Congress has pre-empted all tort 
claims against actual employees of the government.
 But these -- this case involves -- the 

1  I thought the rule emerging from Carlson is that prison 
2  personnel in Federal prisons are subject to Bivens 
3  liability, and we don't look in each case to see whether 
4  there could have been a State tort.
5
6
7
8  rule still applies, Your Honor, because that involved 
9  actual Federal Government employees.  And since Carlson, 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  Petitioners are not employees of the government.  They 
17  are employees of a private contractor.  And under the 
18  Westfall Act, what Congress did was pre-empt all claims 
19  against actual government officials while preserving 
20
21
22  private contractors.  For them, there are adequate 
23  alternative tort remedies.  And it's virtually 
24  undisputed in this case that there was such a remedy 
25

Bivens remedies. 

 But it did the opposite for employees of 

here.  And they are deliberately -- Congress expressly 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 So, yes, in the Carlson situation, there is 

preserved that.  But here we have a different 

 What Congress did in the Westfall Act is it 

recognize and what we believe the Court has recognized 
in cases like Malesko, and that is, where there are 
adequate alternative tort -- excuse me -- where there 
are no adequate --

1  excluded them from the category of employees against 
2  whom it preserved Bivens remedies. 
3
4  still a Bivens claim because Congress has expressly 
5
6  congressional policy that we are, in effect, asking the 
7  Court to embrace here. 
8
9  said what in effect we are asking this Court to

16  case about California law here.  But suppose we were in 
17  a State where the law was very different from what 
18  California's law appears to be, where there was no 
19  special duty recognized for jailors and, indeed, where 
20
21  because there was a finding of -- a holding of the State 
22  supreme court that there was no duty on the part of 
23  jailors to inmates.  What would happen then? 
24

that there weren't.  I mean, I think you have a good

Eighth Amendment, but it's actually superior. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But is your answer --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Franklin, there were 

1  would be a different case, and the Court could in that 
2  circumstance say there are no adequate alternative 
3  remedies.  But the reason we think it's entirely 
4  hypothetical is there has nothing been shown in the 
5
6  dissenters made clear, that any State doesn't afford the 
7  bedrock cause of negligence.  And that cause, as the 
8  Court held in Malesko quite expressly, is not only 
9  adequate to redress any actions that would violate the 
10
11
12
13  some references to Mississippi law that seem to be 
14  inconsistent with the notion that all States would 
15
16
17  I'm correct, comes from an amicus brief, and that law 
18  does not -- would not on its face prohibit an action 
19  against a private managed prison holding Federal 
prisoners.  These laws -- and the Mississippi law is an 
20
21  example; there's a New York law.  Those apply to State 
22  government officials.  They're similar to the Westfall 
23  Act, but on a State level.  They immunize State 
24  government officials from claims, but those claims would 
25

be subject to 1983 actions.  Here we have a privately 

provide an adequate remedy.

17
18  prisoners, identical mistreatment, and one gets a 
19  Federal remedy and the other doesn't.
20

22  The prisoner -- the Federal prisoner has, in that sense, 
23  a remedy that's beyond the Eighth Amendment, that 
24  goes --

2  don't worry, there's going to be liability and probably 
3  perhaps even more extensive liability than in Bivens, 
4  what difference does it make?  Bivens doesn't give you

to first say that the Court in Malesko adopted the

MR. FRANKLIN:  I understand --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What difference does it 

1

3  arguably narrow, more narrow? 
4

6  principle that if there is an alternative remedy, that's 
7  not a reason for piling on a Federal remedy; that's a 
8  reason not to.  But in a practical sense --
9

11
12  make? 
13
14
15
16  does matter for individuals in my clients' situation. 
17  If a State tort claim is brought, there is respondeat 
18  superior liability under a State court claim.  And in 
19  many if not most cases, the plaintiff will choose, 
20
21  individual out of the case. 
 Now, the deterrent effect that Bivens is 
22
23  concerned with still exists because the case can be 
24  brought against the individual.  However, if there's a

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Franklin --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- do you have a theory 

mysterious to me.  If you bring it as a negligence 
claim, you get a lower standard of liability, negligence 
versus deliberate indifference. 

1  individual; it cannot be brought under respondeat 
2  superior.  So, if there is a Bivens claim, as a

22  that people will bring them under the tort law. 
 It could be that there are forms in some of

written on them, that Bivens is there.  It could be that

can say that if the Court rules as we ask it to in this 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  To go back to what I asked 

 But we would think that if the Court rules 

before when I hypothesized a State that didn't have 
adequate remedies, and you said -- well, just to pin 
down what you said, if there were no adequate remedies, 
there would be a Bivens action available?

1  prisoners are not quite aware that the Westfall Act 
2  doesn't cover private contractors. 
3
4  as we -- as we suggest it should, that there -- that the 
prisoners who are relatively savvy, even on a pro se 
5
6  basis, about their rights would then understand that 
7  they have these rights and will exercise them and that 
8  the Bivens remedy would not have to be employed 
9  willy-nilly as it was in this case.  But I --
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
 MR. FRANKLIN:  There might be, Your Honor. 
15
16  There still is the factors counseling hesitation, which 
17  is the second step of the Bivens analysis.  And I 
18  wouldn't want to give up that there might be factors in 
19  those cases counseling hesitation.  But certainly our 
position is not that in a circumstance, if that arose --
20
21  and, again, we think it's hypothetical because there's 
22  no indication either that it has arisen or that it will 
23  arise -- but if it were to, our position wouldn't rule 
24  out the possibility of a Bivens claim in those 
25

circumstances. 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. FRANKLIN:  Well, it -- as the case came 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  To get back to the question 
1
2  that Justice Ginsburg asked, is it -- is that consistent 
3  with Carlson?  Because the Court in Carlson didn't say 
4  that there's a Bivens action because in this particular 
State there isn't a viable State action, but it might be 
5
6  different in another State where there is a viable State 
7  claim.  It did it on basically a categorical ground. 
8
9  to the Court in Carlson, it was undisputed that there 
was no adequate State law remedy, the lower courts had 
10
11 
held.  So, that was sort of the basic premise that the 
12 
Court then went ahead and decided the case on. 
13
 Since Carlson, we've had cases, notably 
14  Malesko, also Wilkie, which have made clear that the 
15
16  factor in the Bivens analysis and is in fact the 
17  dispositive factor in Malesko, and as in this case as 
18  well. 
19
20
21  alternative remedies.  Again, the deliberate 
22  indifference standard is much, much more hard -- much 
23  harder to meet than a traditional negligence standard. 
24  California law is, further, more protective of 
25

adequacy of remedies, including State law remedies, is a 

 We don't think that there is really any 

serious dispute in this case that there were adequate 

prisoners. 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And in our view, that would turn the Bivens 

create what they refer to as a categorical cause of 

 As we understand the Respondents' position, 
1
2  the Court -- they would urge the Court, notwithstanding 
3  the availability of alternative remedies in this case 
4  and as far as we can tell in every foreseeable case, to 
5
6  action, one that would apply regardless of whether the 
7  remedies are adequate or not. 
8
9  jurisprudence effectively on its head.  The Court has 
said Bivens is a narrow -- I think Justice Ginsburg at 
10
11 
least paraphrased our argument as saying it's a 
gap-filling mechanism, which is what our argument is, 
12 
13 
that would apply only in those circumstances when it's 
necessary.  Other than that, the Court has consistently 
14 
deferred the matter to Congress.  And that's where we 
15
16 
think it ought to lie in this case. 
17
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Does a prisoner in a State 
18  that requires the filing of a certificate of merit in a 
19  medical malpractice case have a -- have an 
20
21
22
23
24  not in this case.  The Eleventh Circuit in Alba 
25

 MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes, again, that's --
 JUSTICE ALITO: -- for malpractice? 
 MR. FRANKLIN:  We say yes.  That issue is 

alternative -- a viable alternative State claim --

expressly addressed that issue under that State's law, 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

supposed to satisfy that requirement? 

 MR. FRANKLIN:  The same way any other 

 And I would add, by the way, that --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, how is a prisoner 

1  and said, yes, that is adequate.  It's simply a 
2  procedural requirement that applies to all plaintiffs. 
3
4
5
6
7  plaintiff is supposed to -- but what I was going to add 
8  is that when you're alleging an Eighth Amendment 
9  violation, you're talking about a claim that's by its 
nature very severe.  You're talking about deliberate 
10
11 
indifference to serious medical needs that constitutes 
12 
the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain. 
13
14  that it might even be easier to procure that kind of a 
declaration, but that issue was decided in Alba.  So, 
15
16  that -- that was decided.  If it comes up in another 
17  case, it can be decided there.  We don't think that that 
18  would render the -- if it's -- if it's an adequate 
19  remedy for everyone else in that State and most States 
20
21  Bivens. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did any of those courts 
22
23  address the problem of how the pro se prisoner is going 
24  to get an affidavit?
25

that have these things, then it's an adequate remedy for 

 In those circumstances, we would suggest

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't -- I don't 

violation, and everything is very severe.  But the point 
is they're going to bring a negligence action, not an 
Eighth Amendment action. 

1  is the only court that I'm aware of on the circuit level 
2  that considered it, and I believe they did address that 
3  issue and simply said that it is -- puts them on an 
4  equal footing with other plaintiffs and that that would 
5
6
7  understand your answer to Justice Kagan.  If I heard you 
8  right, you were saying, well, they're going to be able 
9  to get a certificate because it's an Eighth Amendment

13
14
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21 
22
23  Mr. Franklin, is really just a practical one --
24
25

 MR. FRANKLIN:  Right. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So --
MR. FRANKLIN:  I'm talking about if the 
conduct -- we're comparing here between conduct that 
would violate the Eighth Amendment and conduct that's 
negligent.  And I'm saying if the conduct rises to the 
level of an Eighth Amendment violation, which is what 
we're talking about in terms of the adequacy, then it 
would be easier, one would presume. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I think the question, 

 MR. FRANKLIN:  Sure.
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- which is how a pro se

 MR. FRANKLIN:  I would think there would, 

case because there's no such certificate here in 
California. 

1  person sitting in prison is supposed to have access to a 
2  doctor who will provide this certificate.  And, I mean, 
3  maybe there would be means, but I guess I'm asking 
4  whether there would be.
5
6  but I don't want to say -- I don't want to argue someone 
7  else's case on that.  I mean, I do think that that was 
8  an issue that was resolved, at least in the Eleventh 
9  Circuit in Alba.  It's not an issue that applies in this 
10
11 
12
 I do think it would be adequate.  I mean, 
13  Bush v. Lucas, which is a Federal remedies case, said 
14  there were what they called "meaningful remedies."  As 
long as there's a meaningful remedy, it's sufficient. 
15
16  And if Congress wants to think that there's a problem, 
17  for example, if Congress thinks there's a problem with 
18  these certificates of merit in the case of privately run 
19  facilities, then it certainly can establish a cause of 
20
21
22  as we say, gap-filling doctrine.  And the Court has 
23  always used it very sparingly.  And the reason the Court 
24  has done that is because there is no authority for it in 
25

the language of any constitutional or statutory 

action as it did in section 1983. 

 But the Bivens doctrine is really a narrow,

remedy is neither necessary nor appropriate. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Shah, go back to what 

allowed them to have a good faith defense.  So, in 
practice, how different is that, whether they have 
qualified immunity or whether they have a good faith 
defense? 

1  immunity defense.  Under the circumstances present here, 
2  which I submit reflect the heartland of cases alleging 
3  Eighth Amendment violations for deliberate indifference 
4  to serious medical needs, recognition of the Bivens

7  you said about lacking -- these private -- these 
8  employees of the private corporation you said lack 
9  qualified immunity.  But they do have -- courts have 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16
17  good faith defense.  So, I wouldn't call it a recognized 
18  defense.  It is true that some lower courts have applied 
19  a good faith defense.  Reading those cases, it's not 
entirely clear exactly what the content of that good 
20
21  faith defense is.  What is clear is that it's something 
22  less than qualified immunity.  It appears in most of the 
23  cases that they're grafting on some sort of subjective 
24  element, subjective intent element, on top of what you

hesitation because of the lack of a recognized immunity 
defense, whether that's qualified immunity or good

1
2  than qualified immunity, and I think that in and of 
3  itself creates an asymmetry.  But I think the larger 
4  point is, is that these prisoners have alternative 
5
6  a private employee rather than a government employee. 
7
 The government employee is subject to the 
8  Westfall Act, and, therefore, all civil actions other 
9  than Bivens are pre-empted.  And so, I think that's the 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  was a State law that gave absolute immunity to these 
17  private correctional officers, and that was the case 
18  before us.  This particular State, it's undisputed, 
19  would not permit any kind of intentional or negligence 
20

23  this case that any State has such a rule -- but if a 
24  State were to adopt that such rule, I think that would

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Interesting, because
 

 MR. SHAH:  Well, yes, Your Honor, except the 

different situation, and a Bivens remedy may well be
 

claim or not.  That's really the outcome of your 
position. 

1  because in your -- in your hypothetical, there is 
2  absolute immunity.  There wouldn't be a way for the 
3  prisoner to redress -- seek redress for the gravamen of 
4  his injuries.  And I think in that case, we have a very 
5
6  justified.  But --
7
8  what you're proposing is a sort of State-by-State,
 
9  circuit-by-circuit, presumably, existence of a Bivens
 
10
11 
12
13  fact that there has been no suggestion that any State 
14  has such a draconian rule or has ever passed one.  We're 
simply arguing for a rule that would limit Bivens to 
15
16  when there is no adequate State law remedy.  That's 
17  clearly the case here.  It's clearly going to be the 
18  case in the vast majority of Eighth Amendment prisoners. 
19  What this Court should not do is craft a default rule 
allowing Bivens remedies against employees of private 
20
21  prison corporations just to account for the hypothetical 
22  possibility that there may be a case which may or may 
23  not ever arise in which an adequate alternative is not. 
24  That turns Bivens jurisprudence on its head.
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then I guess the 

21

 MR. SHAH:  I would agree with that, Your 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, how -- define how 

come up with a precise formulation.  I think the 

1  question is -- yes, when you talk about an overlap of 
2  remedies, we have said that it doesn't need to be a 
3  matching one-to-one remedy, but you do need some degree 
4  of meaningful overlap, don't you?
5
6  Honor.  I think -- I think --
7
8  much or how do we describe the adequacy of that overlap? 
9
 MR. SHAH:  I think it would be difficult to 
10
11  formulation that we use in our brief is that as long as 
12  it redressed the gravamen of the prisoner's injuries. 
13  So, I think as long as it provides some meaningful 
14  relief for the injuries and in turn that would provide 
some deterrence to the individual employees' actions --
15
16  I think as long as those two elements are present, I 
17  think we would think that there is an adequate 
18  alternative remedy. 
19
20
21  could approach it from the flip side and say there would 
22  not be an adequate alternative remedy where the State 
23  law is either inconsistent with or hostile to the 
24  corresponding constitutional interest.  We submit in 
this case there's no question that there are remedies

 Do you have any other example of something

State law? 

1  available under California State law and, as far as we 
2  know, the State law of every other State in this country 
3  that would allow --
4
5
6  unusual to say that you don't have a Federal cause of 
7  action because of something a State gives you. 
8
9  like that, where the availability of Federal relief

14  often will look at if someone's claims of deprivation of

16  violation of process -- the Federal court may often look 
17  at what are the available State law procedures to 
18  provide redress for that claim before it would impose or 
19  find a violation of Federal due process.
20
21  Federal courts do look at the availability of State law 
22  remedies and look at their adequacy before determining 
23  whether a Federal law remedy is necessary.  And this 
24  Court has done that.  And the Court did it in Malesko, I 
think is the best example in the Bivens context of where

 So, I think there are analogues where

 MR. SHAH:  Two responses, Your Honor.  While 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  What is the theory behind 

1  the Court looked at alternative State remedies and said 
2  that, hey, look, the availability of these other 
3  remedies counsel against the imposition of a Bivens 
4  remedy.
5
6  that, Mr. Shah?  I mean it's an obvious theory when 
7  Congress has provided an alternative remedial system, 
8  which is a separation of powers theory.  But what's the 
9  theory about looking to State law for these kinds of 
10
11
12  I agree the separation of powers problem is much more 
13  heightened when Congress acts, I think there is still a 
14  separation of powers issue even when Congress has not 
acted.  That is, the Court should be hesitant before --
15
16  before implying a judicial -- a cause of action for 
17  damages under the Constitution, given that it's 
18  typically been Congress's province to do so. 
19
20
21  Court in its -- in its Bivens jurisprudence for implying 
22  such a remedy.  One is the need to provide some 
23  meaningful relief.  We submit when there is an 
24  alternative State remedy, that rationale has been 
25

 But, beyond that, the rationales -- there 
have been two rationales that have been given by this 

satisfied. 

24
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 The other rationale this Court has offered 

that rationale too will be accomplished. 

 The three cases in which this Court has 

1
2  is provide some deterrence to the actions of an 
3  individual employee or officer.  We also submit that 
4  when there is a State tort damages remedy available, 
5
6
7  recognized a Bivens remedy, Bivens itself, Davis, and 
8  Carlson, those two factors were not present.  There was 
9  either no alternative remedy at all or, at least as in 
Carlson, no alternative remedy against the individual 
10
11 
officer. 
12
 JUSTICE ALITO:  What would you propose that 
13  the Court say about the degree of adequate State remedy 
14  that is necessary?  Just -- what we have here in 
California is enough and not go any further or --
15
16
17  with that.  Certainly, here there hasn't been any 
18  dispute that there would be -- any real serious dispute 
19  that there would be an adequate alternative remedy.  I 
20
21  adequate alternative remedy addresses the gravamen of 
22  the prisoner's injuries, that should be sufficient.  And 
23  I think it could give content to that by looking at the 
24  two rationales this Court has offered for Bivens.
25

think the Court could also say that, as long as the 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose that a State did for 

 MR. SHAH:  I think the Court should start 

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. SHAH:  I think that would be a tougher 

and give the prisoner just a tort claim against the 

1  claims against private prisons and private prison guards 
2  what I understand New York has done with respect to 
3  State-run prisons; in other words, that you eliminate 
4  any claim against individual prison employees or guards 
5
6  State.  Would that be adequate? 
7
8  case.  And, of course, I assume in your hypothetical 
9  that that's -- that that would also apply to Federal 
prisoners and federally contracted prisons, and it's 
10
11 
difficult to figure out what the State's interests --
12
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Not a claim against the 
13  State.  I misspoke.  A claim -- only a claim against the 
14  company that runs the prison.
15
16  would be a more difficult hypothetical because the 
17  rational about individual deterrence of the individual 
18  officer may not be as strong in that hypothetical.  But, 
19  once again, no State has such a rule, and it's difficult 
to imagine a State's incentive to adopt such a rule 
20
21  because it's not coming out of the State's pockets. 
22  These are federally contracted prisons, contracted by 
23  BOP and run by private prison corporations.

 MR. SHAH:  Your Honor, again I think that

 MR. SHAH:  Your Honor, it is true, the 

labels are different and there's going to be different 

-- those damages are procured under State law or under a 

1  constitutional claim.  It's an Eighth Amendment claim. 
2  And if you're looking to State remedies, that's an 
3  ordinary tort remedy with no constitutional involvement. 
4

6  meaning to those remedies.  But from the prisoner's 
7  standpoint, the rationale behind Bivens was to provide 
8  some damages relief.  From the prisoner's standpoint,

19  could say, well, there has been an intermediate 
appellate court who has decided this.  We take on 
20

don't think the law is clear in -- excuse me -- in 
California that his other claims, the deprivation of 
nutrition and hygiene, forced labor at some point before 
he was -- his injuries were healed, that those would 
necessarily be covered.

13 
14 
15
16
17  question that I asked Mr. Franklin?  Because it just 
18  doesn't make any sense to me.  The gravamen of this 
19  claim is a medical malpractice claim.  Why aren't your 
20
21  liability, and all you have to prove is negligence.  Why 
22  wasn't this brought as a State law claim? 
23
24  parts to that, two answers I would give.  First, Mr. 
25

State law remedies better?  You have vicarious

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, if the -- if the 

practice, is how that works. 

 Now, why wouldn't medical malpractice work 

1  Government.  He often has access -- actually only has
 
2  access to Federal law books.  When he sees himself
 
3  injured, he thinks this is presumably a Federal case.
 
4  So, I think there is a certain ethic or, at least,
 
5
6
7  here? 
8
9  consciousness that we can correct, right?
10
11  the beginning. 
12
13  true appropriate remedy, and the better remedy from your 
14  client's point of view, is a State law action, we should 
15
16
 MR. PREIS:  Well, we think that prisoners 
17  should have access to the State law action, and when 
18  there's cause of action available, it might indeed be a 
19  better remedy.  But I think in terms of whether or not 
20
21  deterring the medical professionals, but we have 
22  multiple defendants in this case, not all of them -- of 
23  which would be culpable under -- or liable under a 
24  medical malpractice regime.  How do we handle the other 
25

medical malpractice works here, it will work in terms of 

prisoners -- excuse me -- the other defendants? 

just say bring a State law action.

cases. 

 So, I want to return to Justice Breyer's 

1
2  remedies available, and I would concede, of course, 
3  that's important to the -- to the prisoner.  But, of 
4  course, the Court is concerned with deterrence in these 
5
6
7  question, if I might.  The gravamen of this case is that 
8  in ordinary cases, most of the time -- and the Court is 
9  required in this case to figure how big is that "most of 
the time"?  Is it 99 percent of time?  Is it 80 percent 
10
11 
of the time?  And that's what we simply don't have 
12 
evidence on in this case.  And I want to point --
13
14  which was many years ago, instead of talking about, 
like, starvation cases or medical malpractice, they 
15
16  talked about a general thing called negligence. 
17
18
19  doctors, and then it was medical malpractice, and it 
applied to others, and -- and is there something here

12  the view that there's an ordinary duty of care, a duty 
13  to be reasonable, is quite a bit more complex than the

2  appropriate remedy.  And the quote is from Malesko.

4
Malesko, where you quote, is that if a Federal prisoner 
5
6  in a BOP facility alleges a constitutional deprivation, 
7  he may bring a Bivens claim against the offending 
8  individual officer.  Now, your friend describes that as 
9  a distortion of what we said in Malesko, and I just 
10
11  a fairly serious assertion. 
12
13  seriously disagree with the suggestion it's a 
14  distortion.

16  clear, you quote that language -- you say "in the 
17  private prison setting"; and the language specifically 
18  says in a BOP facility. 
19
20
21  remedies between a BOP facility and individuals in a 
22  private facility should be similar, that it made no 
23  sense to give extra remedies to people in a private 
24  facility.  And so, the Court, Justice -- Chief Justice 
Rehnquist at the time, was making a comparison saying

19  far is that we're asking the Court to reach out and 
create an extraordinary cause of action.  I simply don't 
20
21  think that's true.  This case is very similar if not the 
22  same as Carlson. 
 In Carlson, the Court said that a Federal 
23
24  prisoner has a cause of action against Federal actors 
for a Federal constitutional right.  That's what this

law remedy would not be available.

 So, the question becomes, is "privately 

absolutely no attention to the private status.  The 
Court in Malesko said that Malesko, that case, was in 
every meaningful sense the same as FDIC v. Meyer. 
FDIC v. Meyer was a suit against a public agency.

which didn't exist in Carlson, and that makes the two 
cases different. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In Carlson, the Court was 
1
2  operating on the theory that with respect to the Federal 
3  employee, it was a Bivens remedy for damages or no 
4  remedy at all.
 MR. PREIS:  No individual remedy. 
5
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Right. 
6
 MR. PREIS:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.

for an individual remedy over an entity remedy.  But I

16  don't think it's fair to say that the Court addressed in 
17  Carlson how it would compare to individual remedies. 
18
19  There was an individual remedy proposed that would be 
available under State law, and the alternative was a 
20
21  remedy under the Constitution itself.  So, when the 
22  Court was faced with two alternative individual actions,

7  between the two causes of action?  In other words, if 
8  you think the most significant aspect of Bivens is 
9  to deter constitutional violations, doesn't that work 
equally as well or perhaps more effectively under the 
10
11 
State law than under Bivens?

6  obviously, the liability is imposed on the individual. 
7  We would expect, as a general matter, that there would 
8  be indemnification by the corporation.  The question 
9  then is, of course, whether that gets passed on to the 
Federal Government.  And I don't think it's fair -- if 
10

the Court allows a Bivens action here, I think there's 
the suggestion that all of a sudden, there'll be a whole

the case.

17  with it in general, I don't know how much practical 
18  deterrence there is as if you sue the individual and 
19  the -- the individual doesn't actually pay; the 
20
21  the private context that the individual may get stuck

5
6  warden of a Maryland prison is aware that if -- if he 
7  allows one prisoner to beat up another prisoner, he is 
8  only liable for maliciousness and not for deliberate 
9  indifference, if indeed there is a difference between 
the two?  Do you think that -- that he's threading the 
10
11 
needle that finely, as far as -- as far as deterrence is 
12 
concerned?

14  been this Court's presumption that actors, legal actors, 
15
16  can't say --

19  knows he's subject to State tort law and that State tort 
law renders him liable for negligence and, indeed, for 
20
21  physical assaults.  Some of your causes of action are 
22  intentional torts, not even negligence.  I find it hard

the enforcement of Federal rights in Federal prisons 
with regard to Federal actors and set up a scheme where 
that's handled through State law.  There's simply not a 
justification there.

 MR. PREIS:  Your Honor, if it's the case 
1
2  that there's not a dime's worth of difference, that 
3  would only be at this point.  And one can expect State 
4  law to change over time.  I think one of the questions 
propounded to Mr. Franklin or Mr. Shah was, what if a 
5
6  State imposed a -- or created absolute immunity?  I 
7  think -- I take Your Honor's point to be that there 
8  could be a similarity at one point.  And we agree that 
9  that could exist for any -- for a particular

17  spoken in this case.  And that's simply not the case. 
18  In the -- put it this way:  The FTCA and the Westfall 
19  Act deal only with Federal employees, the liability of 
the Federal Government for actions of Federal employees. 
20
21  Their argument is essentially that Congress attempted to 
22  deal with whether or not private contractors should be 
23  liable in these situations by -- by amending a statute 
24  that has nothing to do with private contractors.  And

Congress referred to employees of the United States was

17  think that's a -- flipping, turning Bivens on its head. 
18  Bivens is a narrow remedy that is only allowed when it 
19  is necessary.  If those circumstances arise, they can be 
20
21
22  these Bivens claims have been pled in the alternative; 
23  that is, a Bivens remedy, but alternatively State law? 
24
 MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes, that does happen, Your

than that, even if we can't hypothesize it, maybe 

dealt with at that time. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you know if any of

 If there are no further questions --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there diversity in 

1  frequently.  But in these circumstances, we would 
2  expect, if the Court rules our way, that there would be 
3  in fact resort to what are not only adequate, but 
4  superior, State law remedies and that Bivens would then 
be reserved for another day if something happened that 
5

 MR. FRANKLIN:  There may be.  I think -- I 
10
11  think he alleged that there was.  We would agree with 
12  the other side that the domicile of a -- of a prisoner 
13  is, at least in the circuits, determined by where the 
14  prisoner had been before they were in prison, and I 
think this particular prisoner had been somewhere other 
15
16  than California.  So, probably.  I can't -- I can't say 
17  about the -- the amount in controversy, but probably.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 The case is submitted. 
 (Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the
