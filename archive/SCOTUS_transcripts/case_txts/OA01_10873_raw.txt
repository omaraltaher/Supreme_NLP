CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


first in Number 01-10873, Khanh Phuong Nguyen versus the


United States and a companion case.


Mr. Green.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. GREEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


The issue in this case is whether the


participation of a non-Article III judge on an improperly


constituted panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals


renders the decision of that panel void.


The parties are in agreement that the 

designation of Judge Munson, who sits for a 10-year term


on the Ninth Circuit panel, violated the statute


pertaining to designations.  But that statute does more


work than simply govern designations.  That statute


protects the Article III character of the circuit courts


of appeals by ensuring that only Article III judges are


designated to sit on the Circuit courts of appeals.


QUESTION:  Counsel, may I ask you, in this case, is


it possible that a quorum of the court would consist of


two members of a three-member panel on the court of

appeals?


MR. GREEN:  Yes.  A properly constituted


quorum -- or a quorum of a properly constituted panel


could -- could be two members.  But our objection here,


Justice O'Connor, is with the participation of a judge


who, with all due respect, had no business being there in


the first place.


QUESTION:  Right.  Even -- even though the panel


was unanimous.


MR. GREEN:  Even though the panel was unanimous.


QUESTION:  Now, if -- if we were to agree with


you and it went back, could the same two remaining judges


constitute a properly arranged panel and decide the case


again?


MR. GREEN: 


No, for -- for two reasons. 

Principally because the rules that govern quorum call for


a -- a two-member panel rather than a three-member panel


when there's some emergency that's certified or when


there's a disqualification or recusal.  So I -- I think


there --


however.


QUESTION:  The same two could be on a new panel,


MR. GREEN:  I would maintain not in this case


for the simple reason that it appears that there has been


some participation in the preparation of respondent's

brief by the Chief Judge, as well as Judge Goodwin.  So we


would maintain, given that involvement, it would be best


to send this back to a newly constituted and


properly constituted --


QUESTION:  Is this -- is this a right that can


be waived?  No objection was made to this.


MR. GREEN:  It is a right that can be waived,


Justice O'Connor.  There's -- there -- that's -- that I


think is beyond peradventure.  But I don't think there was


waiver here because there's no record evidence that


indicates that there was a waiver.  This Court in New York


v. Hill, for example, found a waiver --


QUESTION:  There was no objection.


QUESTION:  I'm surprised you say that there can


be a waiver. 


So the Ninth Circuit could routinely send 

out to its litigants a waiver notice waiving participation


of non-Article III personnel and there would be no


structural objection?  I -- I thought --


MR. GREEN:  Well, I think --


QUESTION:  I thought the whole point of -- of


your -- of your error analysis is this affects the


structural integrity of the court and it can't be waived.


MR. GREEN:  Well, the additional point I was


going to make in response to Justice O'Connor's question


is that, in fact, even though there may be consent or even

though there may be waiver, that has not stopped this


Court from considering these important structural


limitations in the past.


QUESTION:  Well, but what -- what is your


position?  Can the right be waived or not?  I mean, if --


if you say the right can be waived, then it's just a


question of whether or not they knew or should have known


or something like that.


MR. GREEN:  I think that the decision is void,


and so the position -- the position would be that although


all Article III provisions can be waived, in this instance


because of the nature of the structural error, the consent


or the waiver would not matter at all.


QUESTION:  Well, then -- then your -- counsel


could have appeared in the Ninth Circuit fully aware that 

Judge Munson was sitting, go all the way through the


argument and the briefing, never mentioning a word about


it, and still the counsel would have the ability to void


the thing later.


MR. GREEN:  I -- I think that's -- that's


correct.  I think that would be the necessary consequence.


QUESTION:  And not to void if he -- if he won.


Right?


QUESTION:  And not to void it if he won.


QUESTION:  That's a nice position to be in.  You

just sit there, don't make any objection.  If you win the


case, everything is fine, and if you lose the case, you


play dog in the manger and -- and come up here and say,


oop, this was an improper panel.  That doesn't sound to me


the -- the -- like the way the system ought to work.


MR. GREEN:  But, Justice Scalia, I think that


relies upon counsel in that situation being confident that


this Court would grant a writ of certiorari.  I -- I


think that that kind of gamesmanship is really quite


far-fetched.  This Court does not sit as a court of


errors.  So even though I as counsel know that that might


be error below, I would still have to -- I would have to


be relying on the -- the equivalent of legal lightning


striking, so to speak, in order to -- to be certain that


that error would be corrected.


QUESTION:  Mr. Green, how does Article III --


how can Article III be claimed by your client who was


tried not before an Article III court, before a


territorial court -- your client has no entitlement to an


Article III court.  So this seems -- you're addressing an


abstract question about the proper composition of a Ninth


Circuit panel.  Yet, your litigant, your client has no


entitlement to an Article III tribunal either at trial or


on appeal.  So I think that there's a serious problem of


whether your clients are positioned to raise the proper

composition of an Article III court when they are not even


entitled to an Article III court.


MR. GREEN:  That is true as a general matter at


the trial court stage.  However, it -- it's very much our


position here -- and I would disagree with the premise


only insofar as you said as to the court of appeals. 


Congress vested jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.,


section 1291, over appeals from the territories in the


United States Circuit Court of Appeals.


QUESTION:  Yes, but it didn't have to.  In other


words, a case -- an Article III -- a case in which


litigants are entitled to an Article III tribunal then


must go to an Article III court.  Here Congress did


designate the Ninth Circuit to hear these appeals from


non-Article III trial courts. 


But your clients --

Congress didn't have to do that with respect to your


clients.  Congress could have given them an Article IV


appellate tribunal and that would have been okay.


MR. GREEN:  No.  I -- When Congress vests


jurisdiction in the United States courts of appeals, it


does so not only to its -- in accordance not only with its


plenary power over the territories under Article IV, but


also pursuant to Article III.  When Congress creates any


inferior court and creates a jurisdiction in those courts,


we would maintain that -- that Congress is acting pursuant

to Article III.  And in this instance --


QUESTION:  But when Congress created the


district court for the Northern Marianas, for Guam, what


authority was it exercising?


MR. GREEN:  It was -- it was exercising its


plenary authority pursuant to Article IV.


QUESTION:  I -- I assume you've got a -- maybe


I'm wrong, but I assume you've got a fall-back and that


is, okay, if you don't accept -- we don't accept the


constitutional position, you're still claiming that you


have a legal entitlement to the Ninth Circuit and, hence,


to a completely Article III court.


MR. GREEN:  That -- that's exactly correct.


QUESTION:  And that could be true if Congress


was acting under -- under Article IV.


MR. GREEN:  That -- that's correct.  Even if


Congress was acting under Article IV, the statute plainly


vests jurisdiction, and it -- and it provides for


independent -- independent review of these appeals by an


Article III court.


To -- to -- as respondent suggests, to -- to


argue that a panel of the court of appeals could be


specially constituted for these appeals would rewrite


section 1291.  Section 1291 says in very plain terms that


jurisdiction shall vest in the court of appeals.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Green, suppose -- suppose I


disagree with you that -- that you -- you can sit through


a trial and not object with -- with impunity, and -- and I


think that you lose here unless you can show plain error


and the usual requirements for avoiding the rule about --


about contemporaneous objection.  Why do you come within


the plain error requirements and, in particular, the


requirement that -- that there have -- that -- that the


mistake seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or


public reputation of judicial proceedings?  Why -- why is


that the case?


You acknowledge that your client could have been


tried by non-Article III judges.  You acknowledge that the


judge who sat, although he was non-Article III, was a


Federal judge properly appointed. 


He could have tried 

your client.  So how can I say that this -- that the


proceeding -- yes, there was a -- there was a mistake, but


did -- was it -- was it a mistake that seriously affected


the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the


proceeding?  I -- I just don't see that.


MR. GREEN:  In the following senses, Justice


Scalia, it did affect it.


First of all, with respect to fairness, the


Ninth Circuit is -- is a court of fully independent


review, and I would maintain that precisely because the

petitioners here were tried by an Article IV court, it


makes sense, and it may actually be constitutionally


required that in some sense their -- their appellate


review is had by an Article III court.


But in any event, Congress statutorily vested


jurisdiction in a fully independent Article III court, and


as a result of doing so, to put Judge Munson who sits for


a 10-year term on a panel as a co-equal participant would


affect the fairness of the court.  We have a unique --


QUESTION:  Suppose the panel had included a


judge who was holding a recess appointment, a Federal


judge who was appointed on a recess basis and therefore at


that point didn't have secure tenure?


MR. GREEN:  I -- I think there would be issues


of -- of qualification there, and there might even be --

where a -- a recess appointment was -- was held in a -- in


a qualified sense, then I would say that was an


Article III -- an Article III qualification for an


Article III court potentially.  If there were issues as


to the qualification, we might be in the realm of the


de facto officer doctrine.


QUESTION:  But Justice Scalia's question, at


least as I understood it, I think meant for you to


concentrate on why -- why this would bring the


administration of justice into disrepute, so to speak.

 MR. GREEN:  Well --


QUESTION:  You -- you make your argument that


this was improper, what was done, and the Government


agrees.  But there's an additional requirement here under


plain error.


MR. GREEN:  Yes, and -- and I would add to my


response to Justice Scalia that we have an amicus brief


here from Judge Moore who sits in precisely the same seat,


so to speak, that Judge Munson sits as a territorial judge


in the Virgin Islands.  The amicus brief of Judge Moore


points out very plainly that he views himself as open to


question with regard to his impartiality because he is


subject to the hostile treatment -- to use Justice


Douglas' phraseology, the hostile treatment of the press


and the -- and the glowering disfavor of those who have in 

their hands the power of reappointment.


QUESTION:  Gee, he -- he should resign if he


feels that way, it seems to me.


[Laughter.]


MR. GREEN:  He wants -- he -- he prefers that


you convert him to an Article III judge, so --


[Laughter.]


QUESTION:  I'm sure he does.  I'm sure he does.


QUESTION:  I mean, you -- you have a -- a


statutory argument.

 MR. GREEN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And you have a constitutional


argument.


MR. GREEN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  All right.  Let's assume away the


statutory argument for the moment.  There you have the


problem -- you're -- you're right that it's contrary to


the statute, but maybe it isn't plain error.  I'm focusing


only on the constitutional argument, and from the point of


view of the constitutional argument, I would like you to


assume the statute says the opposite.  The statute says


that this judge can sit.


All right.  So purposes of a constitutional


argument, why can't your party waive -- why can't your


clients have waived that? 


My particular thought is that 

we're just considering a case in which -- a different case


in which it's at least arguable -- there are two sides to


the argument -- whether two parties can get together and


have a magistrate, who is not an Article III judge, try


their case.  The consent simply consisting of the fact


they went ahead without objection.  In that case, there's


the statute, but for present purposes, we're assuming the


opposite statute.


So I mean, if it's at least arguable that you


could have consent, shown only by the fact they went ahead

to a trial before a magistrate and that would be enough to


validate constitutionally the magistrate trying the case,


why isn't the fact that you went ahead here


constitutionally sufficient to show that you agreed to the


trial before -- the -- the appeal that included one judge


from Guam?


MR. GREEN:  Because this Court has -- has said


that the claims of structural validity, claims that go to


the very validity of the tribunal itself, are claims which


invoke institutional interests, not just personal


interests --


QUESTION:  Now, I understand that, but my


question is, how is that any more true or less true where


what they've done is consent through behavior to trial of


a case before a magistrate?


MR. GREEN:  Well, this Court has never -- this


Court has never addressed the question of whether you can


have --


QUESTION:  You think that magistrate trials --


MR. GREEN:  -- a trial --


QUESTION:  -- through consent are


unconstitutional?


MR. GREEN:  I'm sorry?


QUESTION:  No, no.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to


interrupt you.  I jumped ahead to -- thinking what you

to say.


[Laughter.]


QUESTION:  And I want to hear what you're going


MR. GREEN:  I do that sometimes too.


QUESTION:  My fault.


MR. GREEN:  The Court has -- the Court has never


before held that it would be permissible for a -- or for a


magistrate to conduct a full trial.  And that I would


maintain because that also might affect institutional


interests could also not be subject to waiver or consent.


QUESTION:  So are you saying --


MR. GREEN:  That's -- that argument is


certainly --


QUESTION:  -- if we agree with you then, if we


agree with you that consent through behavior is not good


enough constitutionally, we would also be saying it is


unconstitutional to have consent to a trial before a


magistrate.  You see, that's quite a -- a -- if you're


going to say yes to that, that's a problem.


MR. GREEN:  No, I -- I understand that.  But


again, I'm -- I'm going to go to the dividing line between


Article III interests and Appointments Clause interests


and those structural limitations and structural

protections in the court system which are not quite the


same as the kind of structural trial errors that this


Court has addressed in -- in Gomez, that this Court


addressed last term in Cotton.  Those really are errors


that go to the validity of the claim, not necessarily to


the validity of the -- or to the very validity of the


institutional interests.


I think the hypothetical that you posit is


actually Glidden, and in Glidden, this Court held that


even where the designation of the judges from the Court of


Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals was


lawful in that sense, the Court took pains to look and see


whether the courts from which those judges were designated


were Article III courts.


QUESTION: 


Well, Glidden -- really there was 

no -- no opinion for the Court in that case.


MR. GREEN:  No, there wasn't, but the Chief


Justice and Justice Clark in that case concurred in the


result, and the difference that they had with the majority


was that they didn't think that Bakelite and Williams


should be deemed overruled, only that they had been


superseded by subsequent events, including the grant of


lifetime tenure to the judges on the Court of Claims and


to the -- to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.


QUESTION:  But they -- they didn't join the

opinion, did they, of Justice --


MR. GREEN:  No.  No, they did not.  But I -- I


would maintain that there was a -- a majority of five on a


seven-member Court because two of the Justices had recused


themselves.  A majority of five.


QUESTION:  In the Government's brief, they


mention a conversation with the Chief Judge of the Ninth


Circuit by a former lawyer for your client.  I'm curious


to know, A, whether you disagree with what is said, and B,


how did they get in -- how does that get before us?


MR. GREEN:  I can't answer the second question. 


To be frank, I'd like to know the answer to the second


question as well.


But as to the first question, I really would


start with the proposition that I don't think it matters. 

I -- I don't think it matters here.  The conversation,


even as reported by respondents, would not in -- in my


mind and in our position constitute a waiver or consent. 


The issue of who hears your appeal is probably so


important that it's necessary that that be done somehow in


the defendant's presence.


Respondent relies on Olano.  In Olano, the Court


took pains to point out that the defendants were present


when the discussions of whether the -- the alternate


jurors could deliberate or not.  Here I would say this

is -- this would be the same sort of issue subject to the


same sort of waiver and consent requirements.


QUESTION:  That's odd in a -- in a circuit that


has the vast majority of its appeals decided without any


oral argument.  You said that the defendant has to be


there?  Your party has to be there?


MR. GREEN:  I think for -- he doesn't have to be


there, but there would have to be some indication on -- on


the record, in addition to the conversation that -- that


respondents recite, that -- that Petitioner Nguyen


understood that there was -- that -- that she was waiving


some important right to a fully independent review by an


Article III court.


And I want to stress, as I say that, that --


that this claim that respondents make with respect to 

waiver and consent really affects only one of the


petitioners here.  We have to continue with the -- with


the case of Petitioner Phan for whom no oral argument was


made.


QUESTION:  But this important right that you --


you were relying on, it's her right only because there


happens to be a statute that sets up the Ninth Circuit as


the appellate forum.  You have recognized that she did not


have any independent right to that kind of forum.  She


could have had -- since the court -- the -- the authority

at trial is determined by Article IV, similarly for


territory authority on appeal.


MR. GREEN:  But even if she had only a statutory


right in that sense, it's -- it is the case that Congress


creates jurisdiction and creates the inferior courts


pursuant to Article III under a statute.  That doesn't


mean that constitutional protections and constitutional


rights don't attend the statutory grants of jurisdiction


and -- and the activities of the courts that are created


pursuant to Article III.


There are numerous examples of -- of pure


statutory rights.  Let's take, for example, the right to


appeal.  That is merely a statutory right.  This Court has


not held that that's a constitutional right.


QUESTION: 


Yes, but ordinarily statutory rights 

can be forfeited if you don't assert them at the earliest


time when you reasonably could.


MR. GREEN:  That is -- that is true.  But


here --


QUESTION:  And I'm not using the word waiver. 


It's not a question of a person consenting, but forfeiting


by not raising it at the earliest reasonable stage.


MR. GREEN:  That is true, but this Court has


held in cases that involve similar Article III issues and


similar issues of the Appointments Clause that -- that

issues of consent and waiver are not dispositive.  A


fortiori then, I think issues of forfeiture would not be


dispositive.


QUESTION:  I have one question on the merits I'd


like to ask you.  Let's assume we get to the merits of a


constitutional question.  I assume for that purpose that


the statute says, the Ninth Circuit shall travel to Guam


and hear appeals and for purposes of this -- for purposes


of this voyage to Guam to hear the appeal, the make-up of


the panel will be two Article III judges and one Article I


judge.  All right?  That's the statute.


Now, why is that unconstitutional?  I cannot --


it's very unusual, but I cannot think of any due process


right of any Guam person who would be hurt, and I cannot


think of -- why it's wrong to ask an Article III judge to 

take on this additional adjudicatory function with an


Article I judge sitting next to him.  It's purely


adjudicatory.  It's not handing out radio licenses.  It's


not doing anything else that's unsuitable to a judge.  Why


not?  That's the merits of the question, and I'm not


saying it has an obvious answer, but I want to hear your


answer.


MR. GREEN:  I'm going to give almost the same


answer that -- that we would give as to -- as to our


claims.  It violates the Appointments Clause.

 QUESTION:  The Appointments Clause which wasn't


even raised in the reply brief.  I mean, that -- that's --


or in the cert petition.  Is that all?  If it's not the


Appointments -- I'll go look at that.  Sorry.  I just


hadn't -- I was -- I was -- thought you were going to say


something about the structural Article III problem.


MR. GREEN:  Well, I'm going -- I'm going to


there as well --


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. GREEN:  -- and -- and say that -- that if


the judge was an Article I judge, that -- if that judge


had lifetime tenure, then we would be back in the realm of


Glidden again, trying to decide whether that court was


actually an Article III court.


QUESTION:  No, no. 


I say why -- why do you have 

to -- the Ninth Circuit is an Article III court.


MR. GREEN:  Correct.


QUESTION:  My statute says that for purposes of


hearing an appeal from Guam, two -- the Ninth Circuit


hears it.  The panel shall consist of two Article III


judges and one Article I judge.  Okay?  Now, I want to


know what in the Constitution forbids that statute.  I'm


not saying it's obvious one way or the other.  I want to


know.  And it won't help just to say it forbids it.  I


want to know why it forbids it.

 MR. GREEN:  It -- it forbids it because of the


special nature of Article III courts.  This Court has


frequently noted that Article III courts are independent. 


They have constitutional independence.  They have


constitutional salary protection.  Article I judges are


not independent in the same way.


QUESTION:  But this statute, in effect, says --


if -- if you take that position, the statute, in effect,


says, we don't want an Article III court.  Let's -- let's


concede that with -- with the one Article I judge sitting


on it, it ceases to be an Article III court.  But that --


the statute says that.  What's the matter with that?


MR. GREEN:  Well, we said in our brief that if


Congress were acting to -- in accordance with its plenary


power, which -- as I think Justice Breyer's hypothetical 

poses, that might well be constitutional.  I think


there --


QUESTION:  So -- so that if Congress said, all


right, we're going to have appeals from the territorial


courts in a court consisting of one territorial judge and


two Article III judges, however selected, no problem with


that constitutionally.  Right?


MR. GREEN:  I -- I think that is a very


difficult and open question, and I -- and I think there


might be a constitutional issue if we to back to Crowell

v. Benson, and -- and Crowell's reaffirmation in -- in


Northern -- or rather, Thomas.  There is a significant


issue as to whether you can have territorial judges


exercising precisely the same kind of almost Article III


jurisprudence that district -- regular Article III


district judges have and -- and not have some sort of


Article III review from that.


QUESTION:  So you -- you would -- you would have


the same problem if Congress said we're going to set up an


Article IV court of appeals consisting of three Article IV


judges.  You'd have the same problem?


MR. GREEN:  I think that -- that claim can be


made, as I say, on the basis of Crowell and -- and on the


basis of Thomas.


QUESTION: 


Well, the claim can be made, but I 

mean, would you make it?  Do you think that is a sound


claim?


MR. GREEN:  I think -- I think I would make it


and I think I would make it for the following reasons. 


Precisely because, as Justice Ginsburg points out, these


Article IV judges, in trying cases and interpreting


Federal law, are certainly doing the same kinds of work,


exercising the judicial power --


QUESTION:  Yes, but you could make the same


argument about trial judges and -- and Article III

district judges.  They're doing the same kind of work. 


They're subject to the same pressures and the same


concerns, and if it's okay for the district court, why


wouldn't it be okay for an appellate court?


MR. GREEN:  Well, I -- there is certainly


Article III review.  I'm not sure that -- that Article III


review has been constitutionally mandated in that sense.


But where there is no Article III protection in the first


place with respect to -- to judges who are exercising that


authority at the trial court level, Crowell v. Benson and


I think Thomas indicate that -- that there is a -- there


is an open question at least as to whether Article III


review is mandated.  And this Court said the same in


Guam v. Olsen on -- on precisely the same issue.


I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for 

rebuttal.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Green.


Ms. Millett, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. MILLETT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


There is no dispute in this case that a


statutory violation occurred, and there's also no dispute


that no challenge was made to that violation below.  The

narrow question presented is whether these individual


defendants are entitled to reversal under the plain error


doctrine --


QUESTION:  May I ask you a question at the


outset?  And actually two questions.  Some years ago I was


in London, and I was asked to sit with a British court on


the bench.  And I -- I didn't do it, but I often thought,


well, I wonder if they would have let me participate in


the decision.


Supposing here, instead of the Article I judge,


you had a British judge and they asked him to sit.  That


would be one question.  Would that make it a different


case?  And secondly, what if they asked the President of


the -- of the Guam Bar Association to sit as a third


person on the panel? 
 Would that make any difference? 

MS. MILLETT:  The -- there certainly would still


be a statutory violation in those cases absolutely.


QUESTION:  Yes.  The same statutory violation


you have here.


MS. MILLETT:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  And would you just say that's


harmless error?


MS. MILLETT:  Well, plain error I think is --


QUESTION:  Plain error.


MS. MILLETT:  -- a higher standard.  I certainly

hope someone would object, but if they don't and assuming


that it's a case coming out of the territory again, then


we would go back to the same analysis and say whether --


could Congress create -- if Congress could create a court


that consisted of two judges and Guam --


QUESTION:  They could create a court with two


judges and a British judge.


MS. MILLETT:  -- and a lawyer --


QUESTION:  Let's assume they could do it.


MS. MILLETT:  Yes.


QUESTION:  But with the statute we have now --


MS. MILLETT:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- what would you do in that case


that I asked you?


MS. MILLETT: 


The -- I think our position would 

be the same as it is here.


QUESTION:  That would be perfectly okay.


MS. MILLETT:  I'm putting aside any sort of due


process concerns that might apply --


QUESTION:  Well, wait.


QUESTION:  Well, that --


QUESTION:  To get -- to get due process, you --


you get to -- you get to that portion of the plain error


doctrine which says plain error applies if it seriously


affects the integrity or fairness of the proceeding.  And

if you have the President of the Guam Bar Association


sitting on the court, doesn't that seriously affect the


fairness of the proceeding in a manner that -- that having


a -- an Article IV judge does not?


MS. MILLETT:  Well, in American Insurance


Company versus Canter, which was opinion by Chief Justice


Marshall at the beginning of this Nation, dealing with


territorial cases, it addressed there a court that


consisted of a lawyer and five -- I'm sorry -- a notary


and five jurors in a territory --


QUESTION:  But that -- but that didn't -- that


was not a court which in -- in other parts of its duties


was not an Article III court.  You're saying that you can


become an -- be an Article III judge one day and Article


IV judge the other day. 


Or an Article III -- I should say 

an Article III court one day, an Article IV court the next


day.  There's simply no authority for that proposition


that I know of.  Tell me if I'm wrong.


MS. MILLETT:  Justice Kennedy, I think there are


difficult constitutional questions that would be raised if


Congress were to prescribe this.  I think based on the


analysis in our brief, it is a statute we could defend. 


But there would be difficult constitutional questions if


that happened.


What happened here was a mistake, not a

confrontation between the branches with Congress trying to


change our --


QUESTION:  Well, but your position is there --


there could be a waiver.  I thought your answer to Justice


Stevens was that the parties could waive.


Suppose -- suppose that we issued this decision


and -- and your position prevails.  Everybody agrees that


this appointment should not have been made.  What's to


prevent the Ninth Circuit from just asking the parties to


please waive their rights under this case?


MS. MILLETT:  I think, Your Honor, what would


prevent them is a decision from this Court declaring


limitations on their statutory appointment power.  And if


this Court -- and if the Ninth Circuit --


QUESTION:  No.  They waive that. 


But suppose 

the parties waive it.


MS. MILLETT:  And if -- and if the Ninth Circuit


were to engage, which is not to be presumed by


governmental officials, court or executive -- but were to


engage in some pattern of violating the statute, I think


this Court's supervisory authorities could take care of


that.


But in an individual case like this, where there


was no assertion of the right, this question would still


be the same.  Did plain error occur that affected the

substantial rights of these particular defendants?


QUESTION:  Yes, but the interesting case


under -- leave plain error out.  I mean, you may be right


on the plain error.


MS. MILLETT:  I hope so.


QUESTION:  But there is, I think, in Justice


Stevens' question a very important implication.  To get


the due process part out of it, assume that the people in


front of the court are not American citizens.  Indeed,


assume it's Judge Wald going to be appointed to the


International Court.  Now, there's no due process problem.


So can the Congress appoint a sitting Federal


judge to go to a foreign place where it's perfectly all


right with the foreign people and hear their case?  Now,


I'm not sure. 


But that's, I think, what they're arguing 

is at issue here.


MS. MILLETT:  I --


QUESTION:  Not a due process problem --


MS. MILLETT:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- but a question of what kind of


function you can give to a sitting Federal judge because,


after all, we have our two sitting Federal judges in the


Ninth Circuit.  They went out to Guam, in principle.  They


constituted themselves a different sort of tribunal,


including the Article I judge, and no one claims that was

unfair to anybody in Guam.  So there's no due process


problem.


Now, what's the answer?


MS. MILLETT:  I think, Your -- Your Honor,


that -- that we would defend that statute, and we think


that it would be permissible, assuming -- I mean, the -- a


better way to approach it is that the analysis that would


be applied would be as this Court did in Mistretta versus


the United States.  And you would focus on -- and a number


of cases.  You would focus on what is the nature of the


job that's being imposed.  It's a judicial function.  It


wouldn't be asked to do some sort of Article I function. 


And would doing that function so distract or withdraw from


the burden -- I'm sorry -- distract or interrupt the


judge's -- or court's ability to function as an 

Article III court.  That would be the analysis.


Now, to -- to put a finer point on it, in


fact -- and the reason I have to take the position it


would be okay, is Congress has enacted a statute,


28 U.S.C. 297, which authorizes judges of the Ninth


Circuit to go sit in the Freely Associated Compact States,


which is Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, which are


not --


QUESTION:  But that -- but that -- you're --


you're -- there are two questions.  One is can an

Article III judge go to another court.  That's not this


case.  This case is whether a non-Article III judge can go


to an Article III court so that the Article III court is


on some days an Article III court and some days not an


Article III court.


I -- I assume that the law of the circuit is


something the Ninth -- Ninth Circuit is proud of.  Is


it going to now have under -- under your theory an --


an asterisk by the opinions that are written by


non-Article III judges so that that's not so much the law


of the circuit?  I mean, this -- this is the problem: 


what happens to the court, not what happens to the judge.


MS. MILLETT:  No, I understand, Justice Kennedy. 


There are two points to your question.  I would like to


get to them both.


The first is, would it violate the Constitution


to -- does it violate the Constitution to have someone


who's not an Article III judge sit with the Ninth Circuit


on a given day?  And our position is that Congress could


do it and that we would defend that statute based on the


analysis I gave --


QUESTION:  So you think Congress could -- could


authorize a State superior court judge to sit on this


Court?


MS. MILLETT:  No, not on this Court.  I think

this Court has unique status.  The Supreme Court has


unique status under the Constitution.  There shall be one


Supreme Court, and its composition is specifically defined


by Article I and nobody in Congress has any authority or


power to change that.


But if you're talking about the territories,


could Congress say they have no right to appeal at all? 


Yes.  Could Congress say your appeal will be within the


limit -- as long as it doesn't violate due process or a


fundamental right, will be to three State court judges? 


Yes.


Now, the more difficult question is, could you


have the combination as we had here?  And we think under


the analysis of United States versus Mistretta, that would


be okay, but in -- in particular, as to territorial 

residents.  But even if it's not --


QUESTION:  But, again, Mistretta involved the


assignment of a judge to a commission.  It didn't involve


the delegation of duties to a court.  And that's what


you're -- and that's what you're saying, and that's quite


different.


MS. MILLETT:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Under your theory -- forget the


Supreme Court -- the Ninth Circuit could, if it was


authorized by Congress, have a visiting State court judge

every day as the visitor of the day.


MS. MILLETT:  At least in territorial cases.


QUESTION:  And that would not impair its


Article III character.  I -- I just find that very


difficult to believe.


MS. MILLETT:  Well, Justice Kennedy, the way we


get to this position is two steps.  Is first -- there


isn't, obviously, clearly on point, but if you add


Mistretta to Morrison versus Olson, which had a delegation


of non-Article III functions to -- to -- that's the -- the


independent counsel case -- to the special division that


appoints the independent counsel -- and so you combine


that and you combine that with the precedents on sharing


of power with magistrate judges -- those together -- and


then add to all of that the very limited constitutional 

rights to -- to a particular form of tribunal accorded to


people in the territories.


But I also wanted to get back -- we think that


it could be defended.  But even if the answer is no, we


don't think the constitutional violation would be plain


error.


But to get back to your binding precedent point,


which I think is an important one, it's -- there's three


things to keep in mind.


First of all, whether this is a binding

precedent or not has absolutely no effect on the claims of


these individual defendants.  Their position would be the


same if the decision were unpublished.  And I think the


Ninth Circuit has itself in a difficult position here.  It


should address, in the first case, the power of this


precedent.


And it's not an issue this Court has never


considered.  In Glidden -- the Glidden Company case, the


two concurring Justices specifically said -- they -- they


agreed that the court was competent at least -- it was an


Article III court -- after -- at least after Congress had


passed the statute giving them that status.  But if those


two concurring Justices, which provided the most narrow


ground for decisions in that case, specifically said that


they would think -- they would uphold the validity of 

those decisions that were issued prior to Congress'


action.  And I think this Court's de facto officer


doctrine would speak to whether unchallenged --


unchallenged opinions should at some point have --


QUESTION:  Ms. Millett, I'm surprised at the


answers that you're giving, that they're not prefaced by


what you said -- I thought you said -- in your brief which


was that Congress did not enact a statute that allowed the


Ninth Circuit to include one of these judges.  The Court


shouldn't speculate on the constitutionality of a

different statute.  The statute that Congress, in fact,


enacted said that it was wrong to include this judge, and


so the only question should be what is the consequence of


the Ninth Circuit having failed to follow the statute that


Congress enacted instead of speculating on, oh, suppose


Congress had, in fact, enacted -- enacted such a statute. 


But you -- you seem to be engaging in the -- the


hypothetical statute that Congress didn't enact to


determine whether it would be constitutional.


MS. MILLETT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, we


absolutely agree.  I was trying to be responsive to


questions that were posed.  But we absolutely agree that


this is not the appropriate case to address limitations on


congressional power over appellate review in territorial


cases.


QUESTION:  Well, I think it's -- I think it's


sometimes not unusual for us to put a hypothetical case to


test your proposition.  And the proposition we are testing


is whether there is a structural deficiency caused by a


territorial judge sitting, either by accident or on


purpose, if -- if there's such a -- a structural


impairment of its constitutional role, of its


constitutional integrity that there must be reversal.  And


the hypothetical is just simply designed to -- to


illustrate the point.

 MS. MILLETT:  Right.  Well, Justice Kennedy, if


we're talking about now reversal under the plain error


doctrine, then the types of structural errors in which


this Court has found reversal to be appropriate under the


plain error doctrine to violate substantial rights or even


to make harmless error analysis inapplicable have -- is a


very narrow, small class.  And those are -- those are


errors --


QUESTION:  I -- I agree with you that that's --


that that's a hard point in -- in the case.


Let me ask you.  Do we focus just on the rights


of the -- of the litigant in this case?  Or is it


appropriate for us to consider the constitutional


integrity of an Article III court?  In other words,


suppose we thought there was damage to the court, not 

necessarily to the litigant.  Can we take account of that


in the plain error --


MS. MILLETT:  The -- the fourth prong of the


plain error analysis is whether the -- the error seriously


affected the fairness or integrity of judicial


proceedings, which would seem to be responsive to -- to


your concern, and that would be the appropriate place to


put it.


But I think it's important to understand that --


that the types of errors that are deemed structural under

the plain error -- I'm not talking about structure under


Article III -- are things that go to -- and I think that


would satisfy prong four -- are things that go to whether


the court essentially functioned as a court.  Does it --


is it consistent with the basic precepts that underlie our


judicial system?  Was there race discrimination?  Was it a


public trial where they completely denied --


QUESTION:  But your position, as I understand,


is this -- this right can be waived, and I'm not quite


clear on why -- supposing we decide with you in this case,


why next month the Ninth Circuit might go back and ask for


written waivers from all the lawyers in Guam for -- to


repeat the process and put on the president of the bar


association as the third person on the panel.  Why


couldn't they do that?


MS. MILLETT:  Well, Justice Stevens, we're


asking this -- in theory that could happen, but I think


we're asking this Court to decide this case on the


assumption that judges, like executive officers, attempt


to comply with the Constitution and don't intentionally


file rulings of this Court or statutes --


QUESTION:  Well, they're complying with the


rule --


QUESTION:  No, but if it's --


QUESTION:  -- if there's -- if there's a -- a

waivable right there, and they say we think it's in the


interest of harmony between the judges and lawyers in the


Ninth Circuit to let one of the lawyers sit with us and


see how we work here a couple of times.


MS. MILLETT:  But -- right --


QUESTION:  And they're going to do this.


MS. MILLETT:  But, Justice Stevens, before this


Court would address whether it's waivable, it would say


whether it's wrong.  This is isn't that something that was


just --


wrong.


QUESTION:  Well, you've already admitted it's


MS. MILLETT:  Right.  And so I think it's one


thing to have a right that -- that is -- that is, you


know, parties can do with one way or the other and the 

statute or the law doesn't speak to it.  But where this


Court -- if this Court were to agree with, I think, both


of this in this case that this was wrong, that I don't


think we would presume that the Ninth Circuit is going to


go -- keep doing -- and -- and the Justice Department


isn't going to defend it.


QUESTION:  No.  But it's wrong only if you


cannot waive it.  In the -- the hypothetical is that --


that the waiver is right up front, that the person says it


would be wrong without the waiver, but I waive.

 MS. MILLETT:  No, Justice -- Justice Souter.  I


think you can have errors that are wrong, but the question


is whether in -- in -- by not objecting to that, they're


entitled to relief.  That's different --


QUESTION:  No, but the -- the question I --


MS. MILLETT:  -- than whether it's a right they


can waive.


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  But I think the question


was why will this not -- this practice not be perpetuated


if it is waivable.  It is not an answer to that to say


that -- the other courts will not gratuitously engage in


unconstitutional action because, if the waiver is


effective, there's no unconstitutional action.  So it


seems to me that on your position you have to face the


fact that if it's waivable, it can properly happen again 

if there's a waiver.


MS. MILLETT:  No, Justice Souter --


QUESTION:  Okay.  Let me -- let me --


QUESTION:  The same --


QUESTION:  -- hear that with -- with what my


follow-up question was going to be.  And you can answer


them both.


Why -- instead of getting into waiver, why don't


we say, under the plain error doctrine, look, everybody


agrees that it was wrong?  Everybody agrees that it was

plain.  And there is, in fact, a serious question about


the integrity of the court when the composition of the


court is simply illegal.


And so, if you want to stick to waiver, I don't


know what the answer is to Justice Stevens' problem. 


The -- the alternative to waiver is to face the fact that


there's something seriously wrong with a court which is


unabashedly illegally constituted.


MS. MILLETT:  Justice Souter, when we're talking


about waiver here, we are talking about something that is


unconstitutional, just like someone could waive their --


can waive their right to an Article III tribunal, but if


Congress passed a statute that violated it, it would still


be unconstitutional for the court to sit in that manner. 


We don't think this is an unconstitutional issue.  But


waiver is not the same as it's something the parties can


freely take or drop because you have to go back and -- to


the step before that and say this is wrong and it won't be


done and it shouldn't be done.


But if we assume that -- we're -- we're in the


context of plain error analysis here.  That's why the


concept of waiver is being discussed.  It's not whether a


mistake was made or whether these people have the right


freely to choose.  They don't, under the statute, have the


right freely to choose what the composition of the panel

will -- will be.  We agree with that.


But when no objection was made below,


proceedings were completed, an appeal was completed


without any objection, they fully and freely participated


in that, and it was only after the outcome that they


turned around to challenge the -- the composition of their


court, that's an important value too.


QUESTION:  It seems to me the waiver would be


stronger if it were in advance instead of afterwards.  I'm


positing a case where everybody agrees in advance we'll


let the -- we'll let this director of tourism of our -- of


Guam participate as a judge today because that will help


the image of the court and so forth.  Everybody agrees


we'll let them try it.  Why isn't that waiver more --


QUESTION:  The question isn't --


QUESTION:  -- more binding than the one we have


here?


QUESTION:  And -- and Justice Stevens' question


is important because this case has consequence --


consequences and it tells Congress what might be done. 


Congress might say, well, we won't put this burden of


waiving a statutory right.  We'll take away the statutory


right and say that Article -- that -- that Article IV


judges, territorial judges, can always sit on Ninth


Circuit opinions involving Guam.  That's -- that's why

we're testing whether or not there's a structural error in


what occurs here.


MS. MILLETT:  And I think this Court's clear


rules are that constitutional questions should not be


decided unnecessarily.  And it's not necessary to


resolution of this case to say what would happen if there


was a full decision by Congress to enact a statute to


make it -- to engage a confrontation between the branches


and to analyze whether that would be appropriate --


QUESTION:  Well, I thought --


QUESTION:  But -- but it is important because


you're saying that it's just a statutory right.


MS. MILLETT:  And even if it's --


QUESTION:  And I'm -- and I'm suggesting that it


might be more than that.


MS. MILLETT:  And -- and our position will be


even -- we don't think it's a constitutional violation not


because of what Congress can do or not do, but because


even if it violates Article III, that's no injury to


people who have --


QUESTION:  Right.


MS. MILLETT:  -- no Article III protections.


QUESTION:  There clearly is no due process


problem.  I'm mixed up now.


MS. MILLETT:  Mm-hmm.

 QUESTION:  Suddenly we're talking about waiver. 


Maybe I put that in as a -- it's a kind of red herring. 


It's not a question of waiver.  It's a question of whether


this is plain error which turns into a question of does it


seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public


reputation of judicial proceedings.


Now, I take it in all these hypotheticals where


the Ninth Circuit is deliberately, which I don't think


they'd do, defying a congressional statute, getting


everybody to have waivers on the record, which are totally


contrary to what Congress said, that it would seriously


interfere with the integrity.  But in a case where nobody


even thought of the issue, where they raised it a lot


later, it's all come up by accident, et cetera, and --


that maybe it wouldn't interfere with the public 

reputation.  So what has waiver to do with it?


MS. MILLETT:  That -- no, I -- thank you for


saying much more articulately than I've been able to


what -- what our point is about waiver versus plain error. 


And I think that's exactly right.  And does -- does this


affect the judicial -- judicial integrity has to be


analyzed in the context of these individual defendants. 


The decision should not be if this particular error


occurred writ large across the Nation by courts, would it


violate judicial integrity --

 QUESTION:  Well, in the --


MS. MILLETT:  -- as to whether this --


QUESTION:  -- in -- in our Fulminante case, I


think we held that even structural error was subject to


harmless error review, that it was not simply an automatic


reversal.


MS. MILLETT:  Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice. 


And there -- the -- the types of things that are not even


subject to harmless error are not whether a mistake was


made under Article III.  In fact, in Ex parte Ward, this


Court under the de facto -- de facto officer doctrine


sustained the actions of the -- of a recess appointment


judge.  But the question is whether it's something that


essentially means this wasn't functioning as a court.  It


is that profound. 
 This is inconsistent with our --

QUESTION:  May I -- may I ask you a very


practical question that -- this case is now here.  So it


has gotten some notice.  What is the Ninth Circuit


currently doing with respect to panels that review


decisions from Guam, from Samoa, from Northern Marianas? 


Is the Ninth Circuit continuing to use territorial judges


to fill out their panels, or has it stopped doing it?


QUESTION:  Please don't tell us that they're


asking for express waivers.


(Laughter.)

 MS. MILLETT:  I'm grateful to say that we at


least don't know of that if they are doing it.


But as far as we know, this -- this was an


isolated incident.  The Ninth Circuit sat in the Northern


Mariana Islands just last month, February, and had a full


complement of Article III judges.  It had never


happened -- it had happened back in the '50s, but it --


QUESTION:  It seems it couldn't be pure accident


because the -- the Chief Judge of the circuit would have


to designate that judge.  So that was an advertent act


that she designated this territorial judge.


MS. MILLETT:  No, there's no doubt.  And there's


no doubt that -- that a conscious decision to appoint this


judge was made, but I think the question went to


whether -- as I understood it, went to whether there's an 

ongoing problem or a policy.


QUESTION:  Right.


MS. MILLETT:  There is no policy that we're


aware of of doing this.  It hadn't happened for 50 years. 


It hasn't happened since this Court granted certiorari. 


No reason to think it -- that they're going to do it, at


least until this Court rules, and on the assumption that


this Court will agree with both parties in this case and


tell them that it is wrong to do that, that it won't


happen again.  And that's --

 QUESTION:  Well, we don't usually talk about a


statutory violation as being something that's immoral. 


It's just a violation of the statute.


MS. MILLETT:  It's wrong.


QUESTION:  But it's wrong without a waiver.


MS. MILLETT:  No, I think --


QUESTION:  So that doesn't decide much in my


view.


MS. MILLETT:  With respect, Justice Kennedy,


it's not that it's -- it's right with a waiver.  It is


still proscribed by statute.  It is still unlawful. 


The -- the waiver issue is only whether when the -- when


an objection wasn't made, are -- are the defendants


entitled to the extraordinary relief of plain error. 


That's not a routine type of waiver. 


That is -- is it was 

wrong.  We all know it's wrong, and -- and -- but do


these -- does it -- did it really hurt the interests


either of these defendants or, in this particular


proceeding, did it offend judicial integrity.


And we think because of the narrow context in


which this was decided -- it was a territorial case -- to


have a territorial judge sitting with two Ninth Circuit


judges, statutorily wrong -- maybe there's debate about


whether it would be constitutionally permissible.  But it


did not make this no longer a court.  It did not rise to

the level of race discrimination or total --


QUESTION:  Well, Ms. -- Ms. Millett, may I


interrupt you there?


I mean, you have said -- and -- and I understand


what you're getting at.  That does not make this no longer


a court.  But in -- in a way that sort of begs the


question because the one thing that is plain is that this


so-called court is not the court that the statute calls


for.  So far as the statutory definition of the


appropriate court to hear this appeal, this court is


illegally constituted.  And don't we -- even if we confine


our concern to this one instance, don't we have a reason


to find that that fact does go to the integrity of the


proceeding for the purposes of the plain error rule?


MS. MILLETT:  No, Justice Souter.  Our position


is that it would not because you had a quorum of Ninth


Circuit judges here, and a quorum is sufficient under


28 U.S.C., a quorum of two on this panel, to decide --


QUESTION:  Yes, but the quorum assumes that


you've lost one who was also an appropriately constituted


member of the court.  And you haven't, so --


MS. MILLETT:  I'm not going to argue that this


type of error is not what Congress was anticipating in the


quorum provision.  But it's not that far, if you think of


what happens when a panel sits and then a judge recuses

himself after argument, once the case is submitted.  And


so they have participated.  Their -- obviously their name


would not be on the opinion.  That would be one


distinction.  But the fact that the judge sat there and


participated and could have had some influence -- it would


be unknown -- would not go to the power of the court to


act.


And this Court has made the distinctions in


Ex parte Ward, four Justices in the Freytag, and as far


back as Martin versus Hunter's Lessee, the power of the


court to act, the Ninth Circuit to act with a quorum here,


is to be distinguished from the lawfulness which -- with


which they acted.  In Ex parte Ward, a -- a recess


appointment Federal judge, who lacked tenure, by -- by


definition lacked salary guarantees, sat.


QUESTION:  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  Yes.


MS. MILLETT:  And this Court said that this


court, whichever district court it was -- I forget, I'm


sorry -- had jurisdiction.  The wrong person being there


exercising it goes to the lawfulness with which the court


acted.


And so I think because we had a quorum here, the


Ninth Circuit had power to act.  It acted unlawfully in


the exercise of that power, but --


QUESTION:  So long as it -- but -- but if -- if

power to act is the criterion, then your answer would have


to be the same if the director of tourism had been


substituted in this case because the power of the Ninth


Circuit would be there to act, a quorum of Article III


judges would be sitting, and -- and so I take it your


answer would have to be the same.


MS. MILLETT:  My answer on jurisdiction would be


the same.  My answer on -- on the --


QUESTION:  No, but I thought your answer to the


plain error question of integrity was essentially an


answer that relied heavily on jurisdiction.  And the


jurisdictional answer was, this is the Ninth Circuit.  It


has power to act.  There's a quorum of Ninth Circuit


judges.  And that would be the -- that would be the same


if the third member were not an Article IV judge but had 

been the director of tourism.


MS. MILLETT:  To clarify, Justice Souter, I was


talking specifically about power.  On prong four, I think


we would have a much harder row to -- row to hoe if we had


to show that it did not affect integrity to have a


director of tourism sit on a panel, but we --


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I agree --


MS. MILLETT:  But --


QUESTION:  -- but -- which is simply to say


there are other concerns than the jurisdictional concern.

 MS. MILLETT:  Right.  Right, certainly prong


four goes far beyond jurisdiction.  But what makes this


not offend judicial integrity is that territorial


residents who have no right to an Article III compliant


tribunal had their case heard by three Federal judges.  It


was heard fairly.  They had no disqualifying


constitutional due process biases.  They rendered a


unanimous decision on overwhelming evidence in the face of


highly discretionary challenges.


And so -- and -- and you have combined with that


what Justice Scalia referred to in discussing with -- with


counsel for petitioner, the -- the counter-concern that


there's a judicial integrity problem with allowing people


to proceed before a court and then wait until there's an


adverse outcome to challenge who it was that rendered that 

decision.


And so taking all of those factors together in


the particular, peculiar context of territorial residents,


we don't think this offended judicial integrity or the


reputation of these proceedings.  They had three judges,


not a judge and a layperson, not a judge and a child. 


They had three judges.  There was no unconstitutional


bias.  There was full consideration of their arguments.


They had every opportunity, if they didn't want this


panel, to raise an objection, but they didn't.  They took

it.  They went with the judgment, and it's now, under the


plain error doctrine, I think too late in the day to


object to the composition of the panel.


QUESTION:  Given how small the community is, the


bar is, in Guam and the Northern Marianas, it puts counsel


in a somewhat difficult position for the judge to say, oh,


do you mind if I sit on this case even though I'm not


qualified.  So I -- I'm not sure the waiver was all that


voluntary.  There's nothing in the record on the point.


MS. MILLETT:  Justice Kennedy, I think defense


counsel are frequently -- had to -- have to make difficult


decisions.  They have to decide whether they want to


alienate the jury by objecting to evidence.  Do they want


to alienate the judge by seeming too obstreperous?  Do


they want to seem like they're hiding something from the 

jury?  They have to make these difficult decisions, but


the whole point of an adversarial system is that defense


counsel is charged with doing that and you have to strike


balances.


And if on balance they decided, which I don't


think counsel should think about their own reputation in


defending their clients, but if they decided it would be


better not to make the panel angry, I'm not going to


object, that's a strategic choice that they've made.  But


at the same time, they may have made the decision, this is

a good panel for us.  We don't know.


There's nothing inherently prejudicial.  Unlike


most harmless error or plain errors where it's inherently


prejudicial to a defendant to admit a confession or


suppress evidence about the circumstances of the


confession, there's nothing inherently prejudicial


ex ante, up front about a particular judge sitting.  And


so there's important --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Millett.


Mr. Green, you have 3 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. GREEN:  This case was not decided in that


kind of narrow context.  It is not the case that court of


appeals from -- or decisions of the court of -- the Ninth 

Circuit Court of Appeals from Guam or the Northern Mariana


Islands are narrow decisions, or somehow limited.  In Cruz


versus the United States, the Ninth Circuit decided a


question about the transportation of firearms in


interstate commerce and -- and created a split on the


basis of a Guam appeal with the Sixth Circuit.


Judge Munson, in effect, would be deciding cases


that would apply to district judges in Montana.  I -- I


think that is, in part, answer to your question, Justice


Breyer, about the -- about the Article I judge.

 With respect to --


QUESTION:  Why isn't the answer to that you just


treat them like unpublished decisions?  They have no


precedential value.


MR. GREEN:  I think actually the Ninth Circuit


couldn't do that because of its Article III nature.  I --


I think that would be a -- an exceedingly odd thing to do


for the --


QUESTION:  But Article III courts do issue


unpublished -- quote, unpublished.  Of course, they are


published, but non-precedential.


MR. GREEN:  That's true, but we know the issue


of -- of unpublished decisions is -- is changing, and


nonetheless there may be some knowledge, intra-circuit


knowledge, about how these issues were treated.  These


judges are, as we discussed earlier, interpreting Federal


law.  This was a case about laws that arose from -- from


18 U.S.C.


And, Justice Souter, I would point out that with


respect to integrity here, I -- I think it would be -- it


would have more integrity, oddly enough, for the court to


have sat with the director of tourism of Guam.  Now, I say


that because Judge Moore points out in his amicus brief


that -- that he is open to attack on the ground of whether


he's impartial to the Government.  And -- and here Judge

Munson was sitting on a case in which the Government was


the opposing party.


I would add too that this is the kind of case


where the Court can -- can articulate a high wall, a


bright line for Congress.  When Congress vests


jurisdiction in an Article III court, that means


Article III review.  That decision or that principle is


implicit in Glidden, and this case represents the missing


piece of that puzzle.


If there are no further questions.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Green.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
