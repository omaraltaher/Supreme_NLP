CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-809, Maryland v. Joseph Jermaine Pringle.


Mr. Bair.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY E. BAIR


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. BAIR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


When the officer stopped the car respondent was


riding in and found drugs packaged for distribution in the


rear seat armrest, and then also found a large amount of


cash in the glove compartment -


QUESTION: What - the rear seat armrest was


pushed up -


MR. BAIR: Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION: - and then the drugs were behind the -


the armrest?


MR. BAIR: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.  The rear seat


armrest was pushed up against the rear seat.  The officer


merely folded it down and then the drugs appeared, and


these are drugs that were packaged in five separate


individual packages that were packaged for distribution at


$20 a bag.  The officer also found $763 in a rolled-up


ball of cash in the glove compartment, and there - at that

time there was individualized probable cause that focused


on all three people in that car, and this is so for three


principal reasons.  First -


QUESTION: At the end of the day, what happened?


MR. BAIR: At the end of the day, all three were


arrested, respondent confessed, and said the -


QUESTION: And respondent was a front seat


passenger?


MR. BAIR: Yes, Justice O'Connor.


QUESTION: He's the one who confessed?


MR. BAIR: Yes.


QUESTION: And was found ultimately guilty of -


MR. BAIR: He was found -


QUESTION: - some drug-related offense?


MR. BAIR: He was found guilty both of possession 

and possession with intent to distribute.


QUESTION: And the other two?


MR. BAIR: The other two were not charged


formally after respondent confessed.  The officer made a


discretionary decision not to charge the other two at the


station house after respondent confessed to this crime.


QUESTION: Do you say that there was probable


cause for the arrest of all three at the time they were


found?


MR. BAIR: Yes, Your Honor.

 QUESTION: Was there probable cause sufficient to


support charges at a preliminary hearing -


MR. BAIR: I think there would have been.


QUESTION: - against all three?


MR. BAIR: I - yes, Justice O'Connor, I think


there would have been.  I think, given the circumstances


of this arrest, the mere fact that one of the three


confessed doesn't ultimately determine that the other two


were not culpable.


QUESTION: Is there any additional requirement


for establishing probable cause at a preliminary hearing


above and beyond what's needed for the arrest, or are they


identical, in your opinion?


MR. BAIR: I would say they're identical, Your


Honor.


QUESTION: So - so under - under that view,


assume no confession, hypothetical case, under that view,


these people, all of the three could have been bound over


for trial?


MR. BAIR: I believe so.  I believe so.


QUESTION: And under that view, any motion to


dismiss prior to trial would have to be denied?


MR. BAIR: I believe there would have been


probable cause to charge and to take the cases to trial.


QUESTION: And I suppose what happens in that

case is the judge says, and I want to tell you right up


front I think this is a very skimpy case, you'd better


come up with something - I guess that's the way it works -


MR. BAIR: I think so -


QUESTION: But there's - but the - as Justice


O'Connor said, it's probable cause and it's the same


standard - excuse me - it's the same standard to bind over


on arraignment as it is for the officer to arrest?


MR. BAIR: My understanding from the case law,


Your Honor, is that probable cause is probable cause, be


it to search, to arrest, or it - I think it's a fluid


concept, obviously depending on the exact context, and I'm


not saying that a prosecutor would not exercise discretion


as would a police officer in a given case not to take a 

case forward.


QUESTION: Well, a preliminary hearing is largely


a matter of Maryland law, isn't it, or State law?


MR. BAIR: It is and -


QUESTION: I mean, is there any - any


constitutional requirement that there be a preliminary


hearing before a criminal case is tried?


MR. BAIR: Not that I know of, Your Honor, no.


QUESTION: Well, I take it even under the


Constitution, if it's a Federal case, both the indictment

and the - or the information shows simply probable cause,


that's enough to bind over?


MR. BAIR: I believe so, Justice Kennedy, I


believe so.  Now, in this case, of course, there was -


QUESTION: But if you say it's fluid, that - that


concerns me.  I was somewhat puzzled by what the


Government said in its brief, page 26 to 28, it says,


well, you know, it's fluid, the prosecutor takes a second


look and it - it sounds as if the prosecutor has a greater


burden, but I - I'm not sure that that's the law.


MR. BAIR: I'm not sure it's a greater burden.  I


think the prosecutor's decision, of course, is looking


forward to trial where they know that they have to prove


the case beyond a reasonable doubt.  They know they have


to get past a motion for judgment of acquittal.  The


police officer on the scene is making the same type of


decision vis-a-vis probable cause but it's in a very


different context.  I think that's the difference.


QUESTION: In your view, is this very fact-


specific so that it might come out differently if the


money and the drugs had been located in some little pocket


next to the driver as opposed to some rear seat passenger


or other passenger?


MR. BAIR: I think one factor that would


significantly change the totality of the circumstances

here would be, for instance, if the drugs had been found


on the person of one of the passengers.


QUESTION: No, that wasn't my question.  What if


-


MR. BAIR: If it had been -


QUESTION: - they were found very close to the


driver, you know, sometimes there's a little pocket right


next to -


MR. BAIR: In the door?


QUESTION: - on the door, on the driver's side. 


Suppose it were there but you had a passenger in the front


and in the rear.  Any different result?


MR. BAIR: Not in this case, no.  I think - I


think if - if the drugs are found in a common area of the


passenger compartment of the car -


QUESTION: How about the trunk?


MR. BAIR: I think the trunk changes things a


little bit, but of course you have to look at the totality


of the circumstances, Justice Ginsburg.


QUESTION: Why a little bit?  I thought this


whole case was predicated - your whole case was predicated


on those drugs between the armrest and the backseat were


accessible to all three people in that car.


MR. BAIR: That's -


QUESTION: Now, if you have something in a locked

trunk, it truly is not accessible to the passengers.


MR. BAIR: It certainly is not as accessible, and


of course it's not as immediately accessible, but, for


instance, if there had been a large quantity of drugs in


the trunk or if there had been a dead body in the trunk, I


think then there is a - the calculus changes in terms of


totality of the circumstances, and I think if it were that


situation, even though that particular evidence was in the


trunk, I think there's still a - a strong inference that


could be drawn that everyone in the car knew about it,


because who would take the chance in terms of taking along


innocent passengers -


QUESTION: Well, let's stick to the five - these


five bags that were stuck in a Ziploc bag.  The Ziploc bag


is in the trunk, not a dead body.


MR. BAIR: I understand.  I think in that case


there would be a much closer case, it would be a much more


difficult case vis-a-vis all three occupants of the car.


QUESTION: But under -


QUESTION: Okay, what about the -


QUESTION: - under - under your view, if - if the


car is in a high crime area and some mother gets a ride


from her son who she perhaps doesn't know has been


involved in drugs, then if drugs are found anywhere in


that car, she's subject to arrest and - and sufficient for

charge?


MR. BAIR: Not - not -


QUESTION: I mean, suppose it's at - in the


middle of the day and she's going to the grocery store, we


don't have it at 3:00 a.m. in an area where drugs are


frequently sold.  Does that enter into the calculus?


MR. BAIR: I think it does, Your Honor.  I think,


obviously with - with - with the totality of the


circumstances, anytime you change - and, of course, some


of these are going to have more minor impact, some are


going to have more major impact.  But in this case you


had, of course, 3:16 in the morning, three men who were


roughly of the same age who appeared to be intimately


connected with one another, you had the drugs and the


money. 


I think here's a very strong case, but I agree, 

Justice O'Connor -


QUESTION: What if there had been four people in


the car?


MR. BAIR: I don't know that four people would


change things.


QUESTION: How about six?


MR. BAIR: I think within the -


QUESTION: Or what if it was a minivan and there


were eight in the minivan?


(Laughter.)

 MR. BAIR: I'm not sure it changes it


significantly, Your Honor.  I think that the most


significant -


QUESTION: You think with eight people in the


minivan you could arrest all eight and hold them over for


trial?


MR. BAIR: I think if you have identical


circumstances to these in terms of the time, how well-


acquainted they all appeared, the fact there was money,


the fact that there were drugs packaged for distribution. 


It appeared to the officer, a reasonable inference, that


there was a drug distribution common enterprise.


QUESTION: But the distribution, as I understand


it, was just enough to take care of a big party.  There


was no evidence that they were for sale, was there? 

MR. BAIR: Well, the evidence, at the time the


officer made the arrest, I think he could draw an


inference that there was cash proceeds perhaps of former


drug sales, prior drug sales, and there were five


individually packaged crack - hits of crack cocaine. 


QUESTION: And the charge was possession with


intent to distribute, wasn't it?


MR. BAIR: Yes, it was both simple possession and


possession with intent to distribute, and he was


convicted.

 QUESTION: How about if it had been a bus?  Now,


we've gone from the sedan to the minivan, how about the


bus?


MR. BAIR: I think a bus is different, Your


Honor.  I think a bus changes things significantly in the


- in the context of, of course, the numbers of people are


much greater, and then there's -


QUESTION: Are you talking about a public bus or


you're talking about a chartered bus?


(Laughter.)


MR. BAIR: I think that would affect obviously


the totality of circumstances as well.


QUESTION: What - what is - what is the rule that


you're - there's the restatement hypotheticals -


Restatement of Torts, where there's the dead body, two 

people are each accusing the other, and add - I don't know


how the hypothetical would work - but add to the mix that


only one could have done it.  Can you arrest both?


MR. BAIR: I think you can, Your Honor.  I think


both the Restatement of Torts, the Model Code of Pre-


Arraignment Procedure, and just the - the nature of


probable cause would permit that, because we're talking


about -


QUESTION: The Model Code of Pre-Arraignment


Procedure just talks again about probable cause?

 MR. BAIR: Same situation where you have, say,


two people, only one of whom could be guilty of the crime. 


You could still have - you still would have probable cause


to arrest both.


QUESTION: But that's two people and here you've


got three.


QUESTION: What about three?  I was going to ask,


what about three?


MR. BAIR: I think three is - is -


QUESTION: You can arrest all three?


MR. BAIR: I think so.


QUESTION: What about five?  You're going to


arrest all five?  Even - I mean, you know, it gets worse


and worse -


MR. BAIR: Well, of course.


QUESTION: - 10 percent chance, there are 10 of


them now -


MR. BAIR: And - and -


QUESTION: - so the chance that any individual


one did it is 10 percent.  That's still enough?


MR. BAIR: I think we can't draw - the Court in


Gates said that you cannot quantify probable cause.  You


have to - in those circumstances -


QUESTION: It doesn't mean probable.


MR. BAIR: No, it does not mean probable.

Clearly -


QUESTION: Why do we call it probable cause?


MR. BAIR: I'm not - I think there's a bit of a


misnomer there, but clearly from the case law of this


Court, it means a fair probability, it means something


greater than reasonable suspicion under Terry -


QUESTION: But if you had to reduce it to a


percentage figure, what would you call the percentage


required for probable cause?


MR. BAIR: I don't know that I could, Your Honor. 


I really don't know that it's useful to -


QUESTION: But it's less than 50, though, I


gather?

MR. BAIR: Yes.  Your - the cases of this Court


QUESTION: So that takes care of the two people


in the room, but when you get down to 33-1/3 with three


people?


would be -


MR. BAIR: I think - I think three people clearly


QUESTION: And with four people it would be 25


percent.  Is that enough?


MR. BAIR: Probably, probably.


QUESTION: Probably.

 QUESTION: You - you agree - you agree that at


some point the probability is - when the numbers of people


present keep increasing, at some point the probability is


going to be too slim?


MR. BAIR: Yes, I agree with that.  I agree with


that, but again, in Illinois v. Gates, this Court said we


will not, we cannot, it's not useful to try to quantify


probable cause in that way, we still have to look at the


totality of the circumstances beyond whether there are two


people or three people or whatever.


QUESTION: And one is -


MR. BAIR: Of course, on the Government's theory


I don't think it would matter, because they say you can


infer a conspiracy, and I suppose then the whole bus could


be in the conspiracy, but if it's an individual approach, 

which I think you're taking, then the number of people


might make a difference.


MR. BAIR: I think so.  Now, of course, it would


depend on - on the crime that the probable cause was going


to.  In this particular crime, of course, drugs can be


jointly and constructively possessed, so clearly in this


particular car, all three of the people could be guilty of


the crime, not just one.


QUESTION: Do you accept Justice Stevens'


suggestion that your position might differ from the

Government here?


MR. BAIR: I don't know that it does.  I think


our positions are basically the same.


QUESTION: So - so you do think a conspiracy can


generally - can be inferred as to all people in these - in


the instance like this?


MR. BAIR: In our case, absolutely, absolutely. 


In our case, clearly -


QUESTION: But if one of them -


QUESTION: But you didn't argue the - excuse me -


you didn't argue the conspiracy theory in the State


court, I don't think, did you?


MR. BAIR: Well, I think we did, Your Honor.  I


think we argued in the State court that because drugs can


be jointly and constructively possessed, that any one, 

two, or three of the individuals in the car were - were


guilty of this crime.


QUESTION: If you know nothing more than what you


know here - I mean, I take it that if - if it were


undisputed that one of the three was a hitchhiker, you -


you would not make the argument with respect to the


hitchhiker?


MR. BAIR: I think if - if it's undisputed, and


of course, that's going to be a difficult situation to -


to know that there's no actual connection -

 QUESTION: That's the wonderful thing about being


on the Supreme Court.


MR. BAIR: If it's -


QUESTION: You can make those assumptions.


MR. BAIR: If it's undisputed, then I think that


significantly changes, because I think a lot - a core


concept here is this notion of common enterprise, that


when you have people in a car together, particularly a


small passenger car, there's an inference, I think in this


case a very strong inference, that all three of these


people were engaged in a common enterprise.  So -


QUESTION: But do you have - do you need the -


QUESTION: What if the car - what if the car


included a driver and two hitchhikers and the drugs were


found exactly as they were here, and there's obviously no 

common enterprise, would there be probable cause?


MR. BAIR: I guess it would be - of course, that


would be a more difficult case because you had the money


in the glove compartment of the car and the drugs in the


backseat of the car, so that -


QUESTION: I'm not sure the money really adds


anything to the analysis, to tell you the truth.


MR. BAIR: I think it adds -


QUESTION: Because there's certainly nothing


illegal about carrying money in the glove compartment,

where it is illegal to carry drugs in the - behind the


seat - the armrest.


MR. BAIR: Well, certainly the money without the


drugs would be a - a different case than the drugs without


the money.


QUESTION: But you -


QUESTION: The hitchhiker - the hitchhiker


example poses a question for the arresting officer,


because does he have to accept the declaration of someone


that I'm just a hitchhiker here?


MR. BAIR: No, and - and that, of course, goes


back to whether it's undisputed in some way, I don't know


quite how it would be undisputed.  You've always got the -


the officer who on the scene is making a reasonable


judgement from all the facts and circumstances, and one of 

those is, I don't have to believe the criminal or


criminals in this car.  I know there are drugs in the car,


we have a known crime here being committed in the presence


of the officer, possession or possession with intent to


distribute drugs.


QUESTION: Well, I'm still curious about the


answer to my question.  Assume the officer did accept the


truth of the representation they were two - two


hitchhikers picked up at different times, and maybe he was


following the car, for instance, so he knew that was true,

and then there's the driver and then there are drugs in


the backseat just as there are here.  Would there be


probable cause in that case?


MR. BAIR: Two - two answers to that, Justice


Stevens.  One, of course, is you would measure the


probable cause by an objective standard and not by the


subjective standard of that particular police officer. 


The other is -


QUESTION: But what is the answer?


MR. BAIR: The other is, it could be that -


QUESTION: I thought you were going to say the


two answers were yes and no.


(Laughter.)


MR. BAIR: It could be, Your Honor, that the -


the driver knew the hitchhikers and that's why he picked 

them up.  I mean, a lot of times people -


QUESTION: No, no, no.  I'm just assuming the


only relevant facts are that it's undisputed they were two


- two unrelated - they're three unrelated people, they're


just entirely different backgrounds, one doesn't even


speak English and one doesn't speak Spanish, but there are


three of them in the car and the drugs are found exactly


under the circumstances here.  What I'm trying to say - if


there were no conspiracy theory, would there be probable


cause?

 MR. BAIR: I think so, yes.  Yes, I think there


would be.


QUESTION: You - you have - you really have to


say that based on the dead victim hypothetical that you


answered earlier.


MR. BAIR: I think so, I think so, that - that if


the, again, one - the other inference among the - the -


the indicators of a common enterprise would be, I think


it's unusual that several people are going to be taking a


chance driving around, either with evidence of a murder or


evidence of a drug conspiracy.  They're not simply as a


matter of reasonable inferences that an officer can draw,


take the chance of having innocent people along. 


Unless there are any further questions, I - I'd


reserve the remainder of my time.


QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Bair.


Mr. Srinivasan, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE


SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,


and may it please the Court:


The totality of the circumstances apparent to


the officer at the scene established probable cause for


respondent's arrest.  Of particular significance, the

officer uncovered drugs that were packaged for


distribution and that were concealed in the location in


which they were readily discoverable by the other


passengers.


QUESTION: Your brief reads to me - at about page


15 - to suggest that you're proposing a broad rule that


probable cause exists to arrest all occupants of a car


anytime commercial quantities of narcotics are found in


the passenger portion of the car.


MR. SRINIVASAN: It's - we don't intend -


QUESTION: Is that your position?


MR. SRINIVASAN: We don't intend to suggest a


broad rule, Justice O'Connor.


QUESTION: Do you agree that it is a totality of


the circumstances test?


MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, it's a totality of the


circumstances test, and it will turn on contextual factors


that are present in any particular case. 


QUESTION: Well, you do say at page 15, beginning


of the first full paragraph, for these reasons, the


discovery of an amount of narcotics suitable for


distribution in the passenger compartment supports an


inference that all of the car's occupants were aware of,


and hence, involved with the drugs.  That's a sweeping


statement.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, what - what we intend to


say is that ordinarily when drugs that are packaged for


distribution are found in a location in which they're


readily discoverable by the other passengers, a reasonable


officer can fairly conclude that there's a fair


probability that each passenger is - is aware of the


drugs, but of course in particular cases -


QUESTION: But it - it might - wouldn't different


factors enter into it?  Suppose it's a young child -


MR. SRINIVASAN: Absolutely, Justice O'Connor.


QUESTION: - in the vehicle, and it's in the


middle of the day and they're dropping the child off at


school or something.  Are you suggesting there would


nonetheless be this inference and the child could be


hauled up and sent to the juvenile court?


MR. SRINIVASAN: No.  The inference is tethered


to the particular facts of this case.  In cases that


present different facts, for example, if a child was in


the car of - if, as was earlier discussed, a hitchhiker


were in the car, the probable - probable cause calculus


would be different.  But in this case there was no reason


to suspect that any of the individuals was uninvolved in


the possession of the cocaine.  In fact, what's


particularly significant in this case in our view is the


location in which the drugs were found, because they were

found wedged behind the rear seat armrest, which


apparently is the type of armrest that's adjustable in an


up or down position.  The very purpose of that type of


armrest is to give the passenger an option according to


his preference whether the position - the armrest in one


position or the other, so it's highly -


QUESTION: The only evidence that supports the


notion that some were uninvolved is that as soon as one of


them confessed, the police immediately dismissed the


charge against the other two, and therefore abandoned the


notion that it was a common enterprise.


MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I - it - there's a - I


think there's a different question concerning whether


there was probable cause for an arrest and the


determination by an officer whether to proceed with 

charges.  Just because the officer -


QUESTION: You'd think if the - if the backseat


person or whoever it was that confessed had confessed


while the officer was arresting him, there would have


remained the probable cause as to the other two?  Could he


have said, I don't believe you, I'll take all three of you


in anyway?


MR. SRINIVASAN: There might well have been,


Justice Stevens, because an officer's not required to


believe the version of events that's given to him by

people on the scene.  It might well be the case that they


have a coordinated plan in advance to pin the blame on a


particular person as opposed to the other two, and an


officer can take into account the totality of


circumstances in making that type of assessment.


QUESTION: May I - may I clarify whether you are


indeed relying on common enterprise?  I thought the view


was it may or may not be a common enterprise, but here is


a situation, drugs equally accessible, drugs accessible to


any one of the three.  We can't say whether all three or


which one, so looking at the three, and we say, well, it's


not more - not more likely the driver than the front seat


passenger, who's there behind the money, or the backseat


passenger, because any one of them could have pulled down


that armrest. 


I thought that was your theory, not a - not 

necessarily a common enterprise.


MR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct, Justice


Ginsburg.  It's not necessarily a common enterprise.  It


could be any one of the three or it could be all of them


or some combination of the three of them, and the


combination of those various scenarios rose to the level


of a fair probability that respondent was involved with


the cocaine.  And as I was - as I was saying, that's


particularly the case because they were concealed behind


the armrest, which is a type of instrument that

affirmatively invites manipulation by a passenger, so if


one of the occupants of the vehicle alone were responsible


for carrying cocaine, it seems quite unlikely that he


would have chosen the area behind the armrest as a place


to conceal it from the other passengers.


QUESTION: Do - do we demand the same standard


from the arresting officer as we do from the district


attorney who decides whether or not to proceed to


preliminary hearing?


MR. SRINIVASAN: The probable cause standard


works the same.  In both situations the question would be


whether there's a fair probability.  Now -


QUESTION: But - but do we demand a higher


standard -


MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it's -


QUESTION: - from either of them in making that


assessment?


MR. SRINIVASAN: It's often the case that


prosecutors will have more rigorous standards as a matter


of internal - matter of internal guidelines.  And for


example, in the U.S. Attorney's manual, it dictates that


prosecutors in the Federal system need to ensure that it's


likely that they'll be able to obtain a conviction on -


QUESTION: Well isn't - isn't that - that means


the - the probable cause standard is the same, but the

prosecutor has an obligation to try to find out more and


get more evidence before he goes forward.  Isn't that the


difference?


MR. SRINIVASAN: Right.  The nature of the


application of the probable cause standard is different in


the prosecutorial stage because the prosecutor is


identifying a particular offense, laying out the facts to


support that offense, and the -


QUESTION: But the - but the standard - the


standard that determines the - the - the degree of


likelihood of inference, that is the same standard,


whether we're talking about the police officer or whether


we're talking about the district attorney later?


MR. SRINIVASAN: Correct. That remains constant


in both scenarios.


QUESTION: I - I'm not sure what you're saying. 


You're saying it - it can get to the jury with no more


than probable cause and should not be thrown out by the


court?


MR. SRINIVASAN: There's a different - there's a


different question whether the evidence is sufficient to


convict as presented by the prosecutor and whether the


prosecutor has enough to go forward with the charges.


QUESTION: No, but you're saying the prosecutor


does not have an obligation to refrain from bringing a

prosecution where he plainly on the face of it doesn't


have enough evidence to convict?


MR. SRINIVASAN: As long as there's probable


cause to go forward, the prosecutor can go forward with


the charges.


QUESTION: To say plainly on the face of it is


something that a - a prosecutor is seldom confronted with. 


I mean, you've got different people telling different


stories usually and it's usually a question of who's


believed.


MR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct, Mr. Chief


Justice, and -


QUESTION: Well, I'm assuming he has three people


in the car and the chance for each of them is 33-1/3


percent -


MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, he could go -


QUESTION: - and he prosecutes one of them and he


has nothing else.  That's all he has, three people in the


car, stuff in the back seat -


MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that's -


QUESTION: - and he picks the passenger and


brings a prosecution.  The passenger, it could have been


me, it could have been the other two, 33-1/3 percent.


MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that's - that's different


from the facts of this case, but even assuming that it

were an equal likelihood that each of them independently


were involved in the offense, the prosecutor could go


forward in that situation, but it's highly unlikely that


he would go forward in that situation because - because


he's unlikely to obtain to a verdict in his favor.  So


there's institutional incentives -


QUESTION: And the district court probably would


not let the case go to the jury if the motion was made at


the end of the prosecution's case and this was all you


had?


MR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct, Justice Kennedy.


QUESTION: The prosecution should - the


prosecutor should bring cases which clearly will not be


able to go to the jury?


MR. SRINIVASAN: No, not should bring cases -

QUESTION: May, may.


MR. SRINIVASAN: May, under the Constitution.


QUESTION: Okay, that's not my understanding of


the prosecutor's -


MR. SRINIVASAN: And that's why, I think,


prosecutors typically enforce upon themselves a more


rigorous obligation than the probable cause standard.


QUESTION: But we have no case saying that they


may not proceed?


MR. SRINIVASAN: No, there's no case that I'm

aware of that says that they can't proceed where there's


probable cause.


QUESTION: But you just said the manual


instructed them not to bring cases to trial.


MR. SRINIVASAN: In - in the Federal system -


QUESTION: Yes.


MR. SRINIVASAN: - there's Federal guidelines


that spell out when Federal prosecutors are supposed to


bring cases to trial, but I'm not aware that that's


required by Federal law or by the Constitution.  Each


prosecutor's office might have their own -


QUESTION: Do you have readily at hand the - the


citation to the manual?


MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't - I don't have the


particular provision.


QUESTION: Of course, the - the manual wouldn't


in any way bind Maryland authority.


MR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct.  Each


prosecutor's office might have different standards.


QUESTION: If - if the Federal manual binds


anyone.


MR. SRINIVASAN: Right.  Well, the deficiencies


in the Maryland court's probable cause analysis, we think,


are particularly are apparent when one considers the


implications for officers at the scene in circumstances

like this case, because apparently the up-shot is that


officers either could arrest no one or that they could


arrest the driver alone, and the latter situation seems


unsound because perhaps the least likely scenario in


circumstances like this case is that - that the driver was


acting alone and carrying the contraband in the car,


because if the driver in fact were acting alone, one might


expect that he would conceal the contraband in a location


in which it was not so readily discoverable by the other


passengers.


QUESTION: What about the respondent's position


that your position means two innocent people may be locked


up in jail, because suppose Pringle hadn't fessed up, and


he exercised his right to remain silent.  Then you might


have a prolonged periods, assuming they couldn't make 

bail, three people stuck in the brig and two of them are


innocent.


MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it's


possible that innocent persons will be arrested and bound


over in circumstances like in this case, but the probable


cause standard accepts that possibility as the cost of


ensuring the effective enforcement of the criminal laws. 


In fact, this Court reiterated in Wardlow recently that


the probable cause standard accepts that innocent persons


may be arrested on occasion.  That's simply the cost of a

QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Srinivasan.


Ms. Forster, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF NANCY S. FORSTER


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. FORSTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This is a unique case with highly unusual facts,


and the reason it is unique is because of the facts - not


because of the facts that exist so much in this case, but


because of those that do not exist here.  There was no


testimony whatsoever in this case that Mr. Pringle had


control over or knowledge of the drugs hidden in the back


seat of the car -


QUESTION: Ms. Forster, when you say testimony, 

you're not referring to any scheduled hearing or formal


hearing, are you?


MS. FORSTER: Well, Your Honor, what the court in


Maryland reviews on appeal is the motion to suppress


hearing, and at that hearing there was no evidence


presented whatsoever that the officer in this case noticed


any furtive movements by Mr. Pringle, any furtive


gestures, that he said anything suspicious at the scene,


or that he acted in any unusually nervous manner.  All we


have here -

 QUESTION: Well, I thought we were considering


this on the basis offered, which is the three people at


3:30 a.m. in a high crime neighborhood in a sedan where


there were a certain quantity of drugs behind the armrest


and money in the glove compartment.


MS. FORSTER: A few corrections, if I may,


Justice O'Connor -


QUESTION: Three people in the car.


MS. FORSTER: This is - 3:00 a.m. is accurate,


3:16 a.m.  It is in a residential area.  This was not in


fact a high crime area.  And I think that under the


totality of circumstances we have to put that in context,


and the context is this, that it's 3:00 a.m. on a Saturday


night with a car of three young men in their twenties in a


residential area, and I think that anyone who has children 

of that age knows that often their Saturday night does not


even begin until 10:00 or 11:00 p.m.


QUESTION: Well, a lot of people wouldn't refer


to children as being in their twenties, I think.


(Laughter.)


MS. FORSTER: Young adult children, Your Honor.


QUESTION: You - you make an interesting opening


statement that this is a highly unusual - we've - a lot of


us read a lot of these cases.  It seems to me this happens


all the time, that drugs in the car, the person says, it's

not mine.  It seems to me that that's commonplace.


MS. FORSTER: But what we have here with respect


to Mr. Pringle is simply presence and nothing more.  We


have no further -


QUESTION: But isn't there - isn't there


something more than presence here?  Isn't the significance


- isn't the significant evidence of this case something


that appears when you contrast it with Houghton from a


couple of years ago?  Houghton, you had evidence that the


driver of the car was a recreational, a personal drug


user.  We don't, I think, in this society, at least


certainly today, assume that everyone who is in the


company of a recreational drug user is also a drug user or


an accessory to the first person's drug use.  Here,


however, what the police officer had was evidence, not 

merely of the time, but of - of three people in a


relatively small car with commercial quantities of drugs,


an amount of money that was enough to suggest that drug


dealing was going on, and I think a - an inference was


possible that someone in that car was dealing in the


drugs.


And it seems to me that the different inference


that can be drawn about the others here as distinct from


the inference in the Houghton case is, most drug dealers


do not go around in their place of business, the car, with

people who are totally innocent of drug activity -


MS. FORSTER: If I -


QUESTION: - and isn't that the basic difference


between this and Houghton and doesn't that inference


support - amount to probably cause?


MS. FORSTER: Your Honor, if I - if I may, with


respect to this being packaging - the drugs packaged that


is indicative of sale or for distribution, there was


absolutely no evidence in this record that this was


anything inconsistent with personal use.


QUESTION: Five - five crack cocaine hits?


MS. FORSTER: Yes, Your Honor.  In fact, I think


that there are a lot of crack cocaine addicts for which


that is a small amount of personal use.


QUESTION: But is -


QUESTION: How about a big roll of money?


MS. FORSTER: And, Your Honor, also, there's a


problem with the record in this respect with regard to


money -


QUESTION: Well, you pointed it out, but I think


it - I thought, and tell me if I'm wrong here, I thought


that it was - it was - the evidence was, regardless of how


he first described the quantity that he saw, I thought the


evidence came out that there was 700 and some odd dollars


in it, so I think the judge could infer that it was fairly

- a fairly sizable roll of bills.


MS. FORSTER: Justice Souter, the actual amount


did not come out until the trial.  That never came out at


the motion to suppress hearing, and in fact, the amount of


money was never characterized at the motion to suppress


hearing by the officer who testified, other than to say he


saw the sum of money, that's all.


QUESTION: And what is in - and it was in the


glove compartment?


MS. FORSTER: It was concealed in the glove


compartment?


QUESTION: And it was open, it wasn't in a wallet


or something like that?


QUESTION: A roll of bills.


MS. FORSTER: We don't - we don't know.  In fact,


the officer who - Officer Snyder, when he testified at the


motion to suppress hearing, simply said that when Mr.


Parlo, the driver of the automobile, went to retrieve his


license and registration from the glove box, that is when


I saw the money.


QUESTION: So it's reasonable -


QUESTION: But he - he must have seen it in the


form of a - a roll of bills or something, rather than, as


Justice Souter said, just not in a wallet.


MS. FORSTER: The record is unclear.

 QUESTION: Well, but, I mean, you - you don't


have to have been born yesterday to decide that.


MS. FORSTER: Well, the - Your Honor, I guess the


point is, is that all that was before the trial - the


trial judge at the motion to suppress hearing - there was


never any characterization of the denomination, the


amount, nothing, just the only thing that was said was the


money.


QUESTION: Do you have a roll of bills exposed in


your glove compartment?


MS. FORSTER: At times I do, Your Honor.


QUESTION: You do?


MS. FORSTER: Yes.


QUESTION: You better be careful if you do.


(Laughter.)


MS. FORSTER: I might also point out that at the


actual trial, the expert who did testify for the State


with regard to the - whether or not this was an intent to


distribute - testified that without Mr. Pringle's


confession and this statement, he could not in fact say


that this was consistent with an intent to distribute


based solely -


QUESTION: So it was at least possession.  So


would you concede that a crime - in the officer's presence


there was evidence of the commission of a crime?

 MS. FORSTER: Yes.


QUESTION: Then - so the officer says, I know


that a crime has been committed.  In the whole world there


are only three possible people who could do it.  What


instruction would you give to the officer on the scene who


knows that a crime has been committed, there are three


possible people, but he can't say which?  Is it the answer


that he can make no arrest?


MS. FORSTER: No, that's not the answer.


QUESTION: What arrest can he make?


MS. FORSTER: Justice Ginsburg, in this case, the


officer could arrest Mr. Parlo, the driver of the


automobile, because I think it is universally accepted


that we can impute the driver owner of an automobile with


the knowledge that he knows what is in his car and he has 

exclusive control over that which is in his car.  So the


officer here should have arrested Mr. Parlo.


QUESTION: And no one else?


MS. FORSTER: Your Honor, I would suggest that


perhaps - I mean, and of course, this is not the issue


before the Court, that perhaps because of Mr. Smith, the


backseat occupant, may also have been arrested given that


the nature of an armrest is not really a normal repository


that one would place personal items in -


QUESTION: So maybe - definitely the driver,

maybe the backseat passenger -


MS. FORSTER: Maybe Mr. Smith.


QUESTION: - but not the one who in fact -


MS. FORSTER: But definitely -


QUESTION: - who in fact committed the crime.


MS. FORSTER: Definitely not Mr. Pringle, but of


course, if we're going to use Mr. Pringle's confession in


determining in hindsight, we need not have -


QUESTION: If this were - if this were a bus or a


tavern or a theater or some of the examples, then it


certainly would unreasonable to assume that the front seat


passenger could reach back to the last row of the theater. 


But here, this was a small car.  It isn't hard for


somebody in the front seat to turn around and push down


the armrest.


MS. FORSTER: Justice Ginsburg, I agree with that


- that perhaps it would not be difficult, given the


compact nature of this car.  However, there was no


testimony that in fact that anyone saw Mr. Pringle do


that, number one, and number two -


QUESTION: Well, that's because they - they


didn't have a buy committed in the presence of the officer


at the scene.


MS. FORSTER: Well, I - I understand that, Your


Honor.

 QUESTION: I mean, I don't know why that counts


against -


MS. FORSTER: Well, my second response would be


this, that I think that it would be highly unreasonable


that Mr. Smith, the backseat passenger, would allow Mr.


Pringle to turn around and store the drugs in the armrest


right next to him.


QUESTION: Why?


QUESTION: Ms. Forster, the Maryland Court of


Appeals, which ruled in your favor, says, during the


search Officer Snyder seized $763 from the glove


compartment, so they are - they accepted that as a fact.


MS. FORSTER: Your Honor, the Maryland - with all


due respect, the Maryland Court of Appeals made a mistake


in this case because what they said in their opinion -

QUESTION: Well, but no, we take the facts as the


lower court found them.  I mean, I don't think it will do


to say that the court of appeals is wrong on the facts.


MS. FORSTER: Your Honor, what the court of


appeals incorrectly did in this case was - and they


dropped a footnote to suggest that it was unclear to them


whether or not there was a separate motion to suppress


hearing or whether there was a combined motion to suppress


trial proceeding.  In fact, that's incorrect.  There was a


separate motion to suppress hearing.

 QUESTION: But the - but they nonetheless say


that Office Snyder seized $763.


MS. FORSTER: That's true, Your Honor, and for


purposes of Mr. Pringle's position, the fact that that


money is concealed, really it makes no difference the


amount.  However, if the - as the petitioner and the U.S.


Solicitor find the amount to be significant, I think we


should have a clearer record.


QUESTION: Why - why did you say the driver, I


mean, on your theory?  I think it would be harder for the


driver who's driving along to put the bags back in the


backseat than it would be for the passengers.


MS. FORSTER: Well, Justice Breyer, that assumes


that the driver did not put it there before he picked up


his passengers.


QUESTION: Well, if he put it there before,


wouldn't they all know it was there?


MS. FORSTER: I don't think so, Your Honor.  If


it's - if it's sandwiched between the armrest as it's


pushed up against the seat, no, I don't.


QUESTION: But the driver consented to have the


car searched, so one might think, my goodness, if he knew


there were drugs there, why did he say yes when he could


have said no?


MS. FORSTER: Justice Ginsburg, I can tell you as

a criminal defense lawyer that defendants consent all the


time when they have a car full of drugs and they know the


drugs are there.  It's not unusual and it -


QUESTION: This is not like the - one of the


cases that you relied on is the Di Re case.  Your answer


to me was, arrest the driver.  There, the informer had


fingered the driver, so the police knew that they had the


right man when they arrested the driver.  Here, it isn't


at all like Di Re because the driver may or may not have


been the right person.


MS. FORSTER: Except that - how this case is


similar to Di Re is that in Di Re this Court held that if


the act - the criminal activity, the ongoing criminal


activity, is not visible to the occupants, the mere


presence is not enough on which to have probable cause to 

arrest.  And here we have concealed drugs and nothing more


than Mr. Pringle's presence in the front seat.


QUESTION: But there - there's - there's another


difference.  The drugs are not locked up in the trunk. 


They are at a place where the backseat person could push


it down.  There wasn't a serious attempt to hide those


drugs securely.


MS. FORSTER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I agree with


that.  But however, that would only point more closely to


Mr. Smith, the backseat person sitting directly next to

the armrest, not to Mr. Pringle, the front seat passenger.


QUESTION: Well, except if - if you accept the


proposition that the - that there probably was a roll of


bills visible in the glove compartment, Mr. Pringle was


within easy reach, not even arm's reach of the rolled


bills.


MS. FORSTER: Well, Justice Souter, the - the


problem with that, of course, it's pure speculation, but


we don't even know if this glove compartment was locked or


unlocked.  What we know is that it was opened by the


driver at the time he was asked to retrieve his license


and registration.  Whether he had to unlock that glove


compartment is not clear at all for the record.


QUESTION: Well, we - we don't know that and we


don't know whether the armrest had come down during the 

time the backseat passenger was there.  There are lots of


things at a probable cause stage that one does not know,


but the very fact - if - if we're going to talk - if we're


going to find it significant that something is within


reach of one of the passengers or not, I would have


supposed that for probable cause purposes, the fact that


the money was in reach was a relevant fact.


MS. FORSTER: But, Your Honor, I - I think that


if we want to speculate that perhaps then we could say


that that would be enough, but probable cause requires far

more than speculation.  It requires a fair probability, at


least of complicity, and we simply don't have the facts in


this case that would support that fair probability with


respect to Mr. Pringle, because all the record shows is


that Mr. Pringle was present in a car where drugs were


found hidden.


And if I may address the common enterprise


theory that both the petitioner and the U.S. Solicitor


relies on in this case, the problem with the common


enterprise theory is that the cases that they cite in


support of that involved ongoing criminal activity that


was conducted in plain view.  You have the Ulster County


case, where the Court found that the weapons, one of which


was described as as large as a cannon, that was in plain


view of all of the occupants of the car.  And in the


Houghton case - so it was reasonable in the Ulster County


case, or if that had in fact been the issue in that case,


which it was not -


QUESTION: Those I just think that - look, it


just doesn't strike me as plausible that when you have


three people in a car, one of them would stuff some drugs


behind an armrest where they're very easy to find, unless


he thought the other two were in on it, I mean, unless you


thought the other two at least didn't care, and if they


didn't care they're out there transporting the drugs with

them.


MS. FORSTER: Well -


QUESTION: So - so how - I don't even know, I


mean, what I'm struggling for is, that seems like a


reasonable inference so how - how do I know, I mean, I'm


making this kind of inference.  How do I know whether I


should or not?


MS. FORSTER: Justice Breyer, the inference that


the backseat passenger may stuff the drugs in the armrest


-


QUESTION: Any of the three, I mean, any of them


might, and why would they?  Why - you'd have to be crazy


to be stuffing crack into a car like that without thinking


your friends are - have - don't give a damn at the very


least -


MS. FORSTER: But certainly -


QUESTION: - and probably are in on it.


QUESTION: But certainly, I think that even if


they - he does that in the view of Mr. Pringle, that - so


that Mr. Pringle has knowledge that the drugs were shoved


in the armrest - that certainly does not also go to the


next level, which is that Mr. Pringle possesses those


drugs.  I may see one - a passenger -


QUESTION: Would - would - would the - the


officer at that point then be able to say, ah, but, in any

case I could arrest the other two because they're


harboring a felon?  In other words, you said that you


could maybe arrest the ones who sitting next to the - the


other, since the drugs are barely concealed?


MS. FORSTER: Well, no, Your Honor, I - perhaps I


- I was not clear.


QUESTION: Here's what she's thinking, and there


might be a million different crimes.  You say to the front


seat passenger, everything's the same, but you say to the


front seat passenger, Mr. Front Seat Passenger, did you


know that there were drugs down there in the armrest?  And


he says yes, and that's all he says.  I would imagine he


could be arrested then, couldn't he?


MS. FORSTER: No, Your Honor, I -


QUESTION: You couldn't arrest him then? 

MS. FORSTER: I don't think he could be arrested.


QUESTION: For transporting the drugs or helping


to transport them or being an accessory or doing


something?


MS. FORSTER: Well, certainly if he's the front


seat passenger and not the driver he's - he's along for


the ride.  He's not necessarily the person transporting -


QUESTION: Well, he doesn't say anything.  We


don't know anything about it.  He just says, sure I knew

there were drugs back there, that's all.


MS. FORSTER: Under those circumstances, Your


Honor, I think you'd have a much closer case.


QUESTION: No, no, but - but no, look, either


there is a crime of being in a car knowing that or there


isn't.  Is there or not?  I don't know.


MS. FORSTER: Well, the crime of possession


requires not just knowledge, but it also requires the


intent to exercise dominion and control over the drug.


QUESTION: All right, so - so you'd have to then


make an inference that a person who says, yes, I knew the


drugs where there, was also going to help later on.


MS. FORSTER: Yes.  That would -


QUESTION: All right.  But that's -


MS. FORSTER: - there would have to be some 

reasonable inference -


QUESTION: And you think that's not reasonable


either?


MS. FORSTER: I think it is not just on those


facts alone.


QUESTION: Okay.


QUESTION: Am I right in assuming that the other


two people in the car didn't testify at the suppression


hearing?


MS. FORSTER: No, they did not, Your Honor.

 QUESTION: Or at the trial?


MS. FORSTER: No, Your Honor, nor at the trial. 


Only Officer Snyder testified at the motion to suppress


hearing for the State.


If I may go back to the common enterprise


theory, as I said, the cases that the State and the U.S.


Solicitor rely on here involved criminal activity


conducted in plain view, and - which, from which an


officer could reasonably infer, I think, a common


nefarious enterprise.  We have a - less than one gram of


cocaine in this case that is hidden, hidden, concealed in


the backseat armrest, and secondly, again, with respect to


this being a commercial quantity of drugs, there is simply


nothing in the record that supports that.  This was -


QUESTION: Well, it was in separate little 

packets, right?


MS. FORSTER: Yes, it was, but that, again -


QUESTION: A kind that people would buy for a


single dose?


MS. FORSTER: That, again, your Honor, is not


inconsistent with personal use, and certainly I should


think that if this police -


QUESTION: Yeah, and one of their charges was


possession, was it not?  I mean, we're not dealing only


with intent to distribute but -

 MS. FORSTER: That - that is correct.  The charge


was possession -


QUESTION: Pure possession is what -


MS. FORSTER: - and possession with intent.


QUESTION: Well, to say it's not inconsistent


with personal use, I don't think gets your client totally


off the hook, because something can be both consistent


with personal use and consistent with commercial intent. 


You know, something can - you can infer both ways.


MS. FORSTER: However, Justice Rehnquist, here


this amount is not indicative of an operation that


requires the participation of more than one person.  This


is an amount that, if it's for sale, it's for sale -


QUESTION: But - but how about the combination of


that with the - with the $763 roll in the glove 

compartment?


MS. FORSTER: Well, Your Honor, I think then it


would still require speculation on the part of this police


officer to assume that one was connected to the other.  I


think that the only common enterprise that reasonably


could have been inferred from the facts of this case is a


common enterprise to go from one destination to another


and nothing more than that, and given the concealed nature


of the drugs in this case, the lack of any suspicious


activities on Mr. Pringle's part, and the lack of, I

think, any reasonable inference pointing to complicity


that he possessed the hidden drugs, the Maryland Court of


Appeals in this case correctly held that there was no


probable cause to arrest Mr. Pringle, and this ruling


should be affirmed.


QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Forster.


MS. FORSTER: Thank you.


QUESTION: Mr. Bair, you have 4 minutes


remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARY E. BAIR


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. BAIR: Thank you, Your Honor.  I just wanted


to first clarify any record inconsistencies or - or


clarifications that might be in order.  I believe that the


court of appeals' opinion, which is at appendix page 3A to 

the petition for cert, makes very clear that the court of


appeals, the highest court in Maryland, construed the


record as the officer seeing a large amount of money


rolled up in the glove compartment, and it totaled $763. 


That is clearly stated in the court of appeals' opinion,


and I would direct the Court's attention to the trial


transcripts at pages 83 to 84.  It is not in the joint


appendix but it is in the record in the case, the trial


transcript pages 83 to 84 from the trial on April 10th of


2000.  The police officer who arrested respondent

testified at the trial that he saw a large roll of money


in the glove compartment and that it totaled $763, so


clearly there is record support and the court of appeals


so found.


With regard to the glove compartment being


closed or locked, there's nothing in the record ever


indicating that the glove compartment was locked.  I think


the only natural inference from this record is that it was


closed at the time the car was stopped.  The officer saw


the drug - excuse me - saw the money in the glove


compartment when the driver went to retrieve his vehicle


registration, and then after the officer obtained consent


to search the car, he then opened the glove compartment


again and seized the money.


I think it's ironic that the rule that is being 

suggested by respondent is the bright line rule that the


driver should always be arrested.  I think that's


absolutely inconsistent with this Court's Fourth Amendment


law. In closing, unless the Court has any questions -


QUESTION: Yeah, I do have one -


MR. BAIR: Yes.


QUESTION: - which is, I think she said, look,


there are three possible inferences.  One is that the


passenger had nothing to do with it, didn't know about it. 


Two is, everybody knew about it but that's all.  And


Page 50 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005 

three, they knew about it and wanted to help sell the


drugs.  All right.  Now, she says, one plus two are so


great that three isn't probable cause, but about, at least


two.


MR. BAIR: Your Honor, I think all - the nature


of probable cause is that the officer is entitled to


accept under the totality of the facts any of those


inferences.  I think any - any -


QUESTION: Two - two isn't a crime, I mean, if


they just all knew about it?


MR. BAIR: Under Maryland law, they have to have


an intent to exercise control over the drugs.  If they


simply knew about it, that would not be enough for a


conviction, but I think -


QUESTION: It has to be all three - it has to be 

three is great enough, so despite one plus two - okay.


MR. BAIR: Yes, but I think for probable cause


purposes, clearly that would be sufficient.  Thank you,


Your Honor.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Bair. 


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:52 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
