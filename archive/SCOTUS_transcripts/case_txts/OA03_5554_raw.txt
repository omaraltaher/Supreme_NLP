 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument

5  District Court of Nevada.

 Mr. Dolan.  Am I pronouncing your client's name

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. DOLAN


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR. DOLAN:  Your Honor, it's Hiibel.


 QUESTION:  Hiibel.  Very well. 


 MR. DOLAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  May


13  it please the Court:


14

 I'm here today to respectfully ask this


15  honorable Court to find that the search and seizure of my


16  client was illegal and unreasonable and, in the process,


17  to reverse my client's conviction. 


18

 Petitioner Hiibel was arrested and convicted of


19  a crime simply because he did not identify himself or


20  provide identity.


21

 QUESTION:  Could the officer have just said,


22  show me your driver's license? 


23

24

25

 MR. DOLAN:  We don't believe so, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  Why? 


 MR. DOLAN:  This was not a traffic stop.  This


3


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  was a -- an interaction between a pedestrian and a law


2  enforcement officer, wherein the officer -­


3

 QUESTION:  But there was evidence -- was it not


4  clear that he had been driving and he got out of his


5  vehicle?  At the time the officer saw him, he was out.


6

 MR. DOLAN:  No, Your Honor.  There was never a


7  finding of fact on that issue.  In fact, the issue before


8  the trier of fact in the justice of the peace court there


9  in Winnemucca was whether or not the -- the charge of


10  resisting and delaying the officer occurred.


11

 QUESTION:  What was the factual situation?  He


12  -- he was certainly right next to a truck, wasn't he?


13

 MR. DOLAN:  Yes.  When Deputy Dove arrived at


14  the scene, Mr. Hiibel was standing at the passenger side


15  of the car.  His daughter was in the cab of the truck by


16  the -- the steering wheel.  And when Deputy Dove arrived


17  on the scene, he began the police-citizen encounter with


18  Mr. Hiibel.  They approached each other.  Deputy Dove


19  said, I heard that there was some kind of a fight.  Mr.


20  Hiibel said, I don't know anything about that.  Deputy


21  Dove then proceeded to ask approximately 11 times for Mr.


22  Hiibel to provide identification.  Let me see ID.  Let me


23  see ID. 


24

 QUESTION:  But you don't think he could have


25  asked for his driver's license?


4


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 MR. DOLAN:  No, Your Honor.  I don't believe


2  that there was any reasonable basis for that question at


3  that time.


4

 QUESTION:  Well, because the officer had been


5  told that in a truck -- in that truck somebody was hitting


6  somebody.


7

 MR. DOLAN:  Well, we believe that the deputy


8  certainly had the right to ask for identity and -- and we


9  think equally so Mr. Hiibel was free not to respond. 


10

 QUESTION:  I see.  What -- what do you think the


11  purpose of our -- of our Terry -- of our Terry decision


12  is?  I mean, it says that when an officer sees somebody in


13  suspicious circumstances, he can stop that person and


14  inquire to satisfy himself that nothing -- nothing


15  underhanded is going on.  Now, what -- what kind of


16  questions can he ask that -- that must be answered?  Any


17  at all?


18

19

20  say.


21

22

 MR. DOLAN:  The -­


 QUESTION:  He -- he can't even ask the name you


 MR. DOLAN:  Well, Your Honor -­


 QUESTION:  Can he ask what -- what are you doing


23  here if he sees somebody hanging around a jewelry store at


24  2:00 a.m. and -- and so he -- he conducts a Terry stop? 


25  What -- what can he ask the fellow?  What are you doing


5


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  here?  I mean, if he can't give his name, surely he


2  doesn't have to tell the officer what he's doing here.


3

 MR. DOLAN:  Well, we -- we certainly believe


4  that under the Fifth Amendment a person has no obligation


5  to respond to -- to that officer.  The -- the citizen


6  never knows whether or not the encounter is a consensual


7  encounter where he certainly has no obligation to speak or


8  do anything.  He -- in fact, he can freely terminate the


9  encounter at any time.


10

 Now, there is, under Your Honor's question, a


11  Terry stop.  Certainly the citizen doesn't know that.  The


12  officer does presumably, and if that Terry stop was to


13  evolve into a probable cause circumstance -­


14

 QUESTION:  No, it hasn't.  It hasn't evolved. 


15  It was just a Terry stop.


16

17

18

19

 MR. DOLAN:  Just a Terry stop.


 QUESTION:  And you say -­


 MR. DOLAN:  The officer is allowed to make -­


 QUESTION:  He's allowed to ask questions, but he


20  shouldn't expect answers.


21

 MR. DOLAN:  We certainly don't believe that the


22  government can criminalize the non-response which the


23  statute in this case does, Your Honor. 


24

 QUESTION:  Well, in a Terry stop, when the


25  officer is attempting to make a patdown, can the person


6


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  resist it?


2

 MR. DOLAN:  Not lawfully.  I believe that the


3  Court certainly allows, if there is independent basis to


4  conclude that the officer -- that the subject is armed,


5  the officer is lawful in using force to apply a patdown


6  search.  And if a person resisted that, then that would be


7  a basis for a criminal prosecution.


8

 QUESTION:  You take the position, as I


9  understand your brief, that the purposes of criminal


10  investigation simply do not extend to asking for the names


11  of witnesses, as -- as I understand you.  Suppose there's


12  a -- a bank robbery and -- and there's a fatal shooting


13  and the robbers run out of the bank.  The police come a


14  few minutes later.  Can they ask -- can they require the


15  witnesses to give their names?  Can there -- could there


16  be a State statute, properly drawn in that circumstance,


17  which would require the witnesses to give their names?


18

 MR. DOLAN:  We don't believe so, Your Honor.  We 


19  believe that the relation to the State that free citizens


20  have prevent the State from imposing obligations,


21  affirmative obligations, to terminate the citizen-police


22  encounter. 


23

 QUESTION:  Is your -- is your -- your negative


24  answer to my question premised on the Fifth Amendment or


25  some privacy concept?


7


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 MR. DOLAN:  The -- yes, Your Honor.  The -- the


2  privacy concept that the Fourth Amendment addresses


3  certainly allows a person to be free from an illegal


4  search.  We believe that when the Government is attempting


5  to extract data from a person without probable cause, it


6  is improper.


7

 QUESTION:  But identity is somehow different. 


8  It's kind of a neutral fact.  Under your view, it wouldn't


9  be possible to have some national identification card


10  requirement then.


11

 MR. DOLAN:  Your Honor, the -- the name is not


12  neutral, certainly in this domestic battery Terry stop,


13  because the name itself -­


14

 QUESTION:  Well, I think one's -- one's name


15  probably is just a neutral fact.  It's not incriminating


16  one way or the other.


17

 MR. DOLAN:  Your Honor, there are numerous


18  instances where one's name is not a neutral fact.  In the


19  facts of this case, the underlying purpose of the criminal


20  investigation was to determine if a domestic battery had


21  occurred. 


22

 QUESTION:  But there would be no problem in -­


23  in checking the license on the vehicle and then seeing -­


24  and then the officer could ask are you whoever is the


25  owner of the car.


8


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 MR. DOLAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  Certainly there


2  are numerous investigative tools available to the police,


3  including running the license plate.  In fact, Deputy


4  Dove -­


5

6

7

8

 QUESTION:  Well, he does that. 


 QUESTION:  You -- you -­


 QUESTION:  He does that and the person is -­


 QUESTION:  You can ask -- you can ask if he's


9  the owner of the car, the registered owner of the car, but


10  you can't ask him his name?


11

 MR. DOLAN:  Well, we certainly believe that had


12  that been the facts in the case and Mr. Hiibel chose not


13  to respond, there would not be a basis that's proper under


14  the law for a criminal prosecution in that regard, Your


15  Honor. 


16

 QUESTION:  Yes, but I thought -- no.  You were


17  going to say something. 


18

19

 QUESTION:  That's all right.  Go ahead. 


 QUESTION:  I -- I thought your position was that


20  if it had been sufficiently apparent that Mr. Hiibel was


21  associated with the truck, that he owned it, had been


22  driving it or something like that, that under those


23  circumstances, the -- the police could have -- could have


24  exercised the State's regulatory power over motor vehicles


25  and said, show me your driver's license or show me your


9


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  registration.  Is that correct? 

2

 MR. DOLAN:  We believe that -- that that is the 

3  law, Your Honor. 

4

5

6

 QUESTION:  All right. 

 MR. DOLAN:  But this was not the case. 

 QUESTION:  And you're saying the reason they 

7  couldn't do any of those things here, in the sense of 

8  demanding compliance, is that there wasn't a sufficient 

9  connection shown between the -- the -- Mr. Hiibel and the 

10  truck.  Is that what it boils down to? 

11

 MR. DOLAN:  Nor was it relevant at trial, Your 

12  Honor. 

13

 QUESTION:  Oh, okay.  But I mean, we're talking 

14  about the scene.  And at the scene, you're saying there 

15  just wasn't a predicate for forcing him to answer those 

16  questions. 

17

18

 Now --

 MR. DOLAN:  That is correct, Your Honor.  And it 

19  was -- it was not a fact that was deemed relevant by the 

20  State at the time or the defense. 

21

 QUESTION:  Since -- and since there was not, I 

22  take it your general position is that they can ask him 

23  anything.  He does not have to say anything in response to 

24  any question they ask.  Period. 

25

 MR. DOLAN:  That is -­

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

4

 QUESTION:  Isn't that it?


 MR. DOLAN:  Yes, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  Could they have -- could they -­


 QUESTION:  And that sort of assumes that there's


5  no responsibility on the part of citizens.  I mean, but we


6  impose all sorts of responsibilities on citizens in


7  connection with the -- the determination of criminal


8  activity.  I mean, harboring a felon is -- is a crime. 


9  It's -- it's unlawful to give a false response to a -- to


10  inquiry by a Federal investigative officer.  Why isn't it


11  a perfectly reasonable responsibility of a citizen, when


12  he's a witness to the -- to a crime, to have to give his


13  name so that he may call -- be called upon to testify? 


14  Why isn't that a minimal -- a minimal citizen's


15  responsibility and likewise in these circumstances?  I


16  cannot imagine that any responsible citizen would have -­


17  would have objected to giving the name.  And if -- if I -­


18  if one feels that way about it, why is it a violation of


19  the Constitution to -- to have citizens do what every


20  responsible citizen, it seems to me, would do?


21

 MR. DOLAN:  Your Honor, the imposition of an


22  affirmative duty to avoid criminal sanction when you are


23  otherwise innocent of any crime is an improper tipping of


24  balance in favor of the State at the expense of some


25  very -­


11


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION:  It's not in favor of the State. 


2  It's -­


3

 QUESTION:  What's your best case for that


4  proposition?


5

 MR. DOLAN:  Your Honor, the numerous anonymous


6  activities that this Court finds to be important to the


7  maintenance of a free society engaging -­


8

 QUESTION:  NAACP v. Alabama, but that was a


9  suspect class, membership lists.  What -- what else do you


10  have? 


11

 MR. DOLAN:  Your Honor, also the Watchtower line


12  of cases, religious solicitation, religious door-to-door


13  activity. 


14

15

 QUESTION:  That was a burden on speech.


 MR. DOLAN:  That is correct, Your Honor.  I'm


16  addressing circumstances where a citizen also is left at


17  the mercy of the discretion of an officer.  No citizen can


18  safely have a voluntary interaction with an officer


19  without risking arrest because there was no obligation in


20  the law for the officer to say, as a result of you telling


21  me that you have a red car, I now determine that


22  reasonable suspicion exists.


23

 QUESTION:  What about giving this man, who


24  appeared to be under the influence of alcohol, a


25  breathalizer test?  Nothing different.  It's just as a


12


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  basis for a Terry stop.  He's now out of the car.  The 

2  officer thinks Mr. Hiibel could be a menace on the road 

3  and so says, I'm giving you a breathalizer test.  Could he 

4  say -- could he resist that? 

5

 MR. DOLAN:  We -- we don't believe that there 

6  was reasonable suspicion at all that he was the operator 

7  of the car and there would have been no lawful basis for 

8  the -­

9

 QUESTION:  Well, the -- there's a passenger 

10  sitting on the passenger seat, and he's gotten out and 

11  he's on the driver's side.  Right? 

12

 MR. DOLAN:  No, Your Honor.  In fact, Mr. Hiibel 

13  was standing at the passenger side door and the -­

14

 QUESTION:  And the -- there was somebody in that 

15  seat. 

16

17

18

 MR. DOLAN:  No, Your Honor.  There -­

 QUESTION:  Where -- where was the daughter? 

 MR. DOLAN:  The daughter was -- when the officer 

19  arrived behind the wheel.  She eventually slid over to the 

20  passenger side when she was -- towards the end of the 

21  encounter, she exited and then was thrown to the ground 

22  and arrested.  But -­

23

 QUESTION:  Could -- could she have been asked 

24  the name?  Could she have been asked her father's name? 

25

 MR. DOLAN:  Certainly.  I believe available to 

13


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Deputy Dove at the time was to do what he was there to do,


2  and that was to investigate to see if a domestic battery


3  had occurred.  I don't believe the issue before the Court


4  is whether or not Deputy Dove engaged in the best or worst


5  police activity.  I believe the issue before this Court -­


6  and with respect to Justice Kennedy's question, homeless


7  people do not have the appropriate residences, permanent


8  residences, and accordingly would be unable to provide


9  their identification.


10

 QUESTION:  Yes, but have -- have our Terry cases


11  suggested that the whole point of a stop and a search,


12  based on reasonable suspicion, is to make identification?


13

14

15

 MR. DOLAN:  No, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  No?


 MR. DOLAN:  In -- no, Your Honor.  I believe


16  that certainly the concurring opinion of Justice White in


17  Terry itself clearly stated that he was of the opinion


18  that a person is not obliged to respond to -­


19

20

 QUESTION:  Well, that was a concurring opinion. 


 Do you think that a person stopped on reasonable


21  suspicion can be compelled to give a fingerprint?


22

 MR. DOLAN:  That is a qualitatively different


23  invasion of one's privacy.  But unless -­


24

25

 QUESTION:  Well, yes or no.


 MR. DOLAN:  Well, as a -­


14


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

2

 QUESTION:  No?


 MR. DOLAN:  -- general rule, no.  There may be


3  some exceptions.  This Court has addressed the possible


4  exceptions like being -- the officer knows that a


5  murder/rape has occurred, fingerprints, bloody


6  fingerprints, were found at the scene, there was


7  independent facts to tie the person to that scene.  And


8  the purpose of -- of a fingerprint would be to confirm or


9  dispel that officer's specific concern about the possible


10  criminality of that one person, and the Court has


11  indicated that that may be appropriate.  But that's a very


12  -- that's -- was limited to those facts. 


13

14

 This was a misdemeanor. 


 QUESTION:  So the -- the officer who approaches


15  somebody in a perfectly valid Terry stop, a really


16  suspicious looking character, he puts several questions to


17  him and the guy says, I'm -- I'm -- you know, I ain't


18  talking, the officer just has to turn on his heel and


19  leave the suspicious character to go about his suspicious


20  business. 


21

22

 MR. DOLAN:  Your Honor -­


 QUESTION:  He can't -- he can't say, come along


23  with me.  You know, we'll find out who you are and why


24  you're here.  He can't do that.


25

 MR. DOLAN:  We believe the law under Wardlow,


15


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Your Honor, requires that unless the police officer is


2  able to escalate his basis of knowledge to probable cause


3  after a reasonable period of time of inquiry -­


4

 QUESTION:  Why isn't the -- maybe you and I


5  differ on -- on what the -- what the course of a


6  responsible citizen is.  I would think the course of a


7  responsible citizen would be to answer the question what


8  you're doing here and what your name is.  And if he


9  doesn't answer that, I would -- I would say that that make


10  -- may cause the situation to rise to the level of


11  probable cause.


12

13

 MR. DOLAN:  We -- we -­


 QUESTION:  He's hanging around a jewelry store. 


14  It's late at night.  He won't say who he is.  He wouldn't


15  -- won't say what he's doing there.  I would -- I would


16  drag him in.


17

 MR. DOLAN:  Well, the -- the person could be


18  purchasing jewelry for his paramour and -- and he does not


19  want his wife to know.


20

21

22

23

24

25

 QUESTION:  It's possible but unlikely. 


 (Laughter.) 


 QUESTION:  But isn't there another answer?


 QUESTION:  Suppose --


 QUESTION:  Isn't there another answer? 


 QUESTION:  -- suppose there is probable cause to


16


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  arrest and an arrest is made.  Could the State then


2  require that the person answer as to his identity just so


3  that the officer can confirm that he's got the right


4  person?


5

 MR. DOLAN:  Again, I believe even in a post­


6  probable cause booking procedure, a person has the right


7  to remain silent if they view from their perspective -­


8  and I believe this is what the test is.  Rhode Island v.


9  Innis would -- would suggest that.


10

 QUESTION:  Now, is that a Fifth Amendment


11  privilege that you're -­


12

13

14

15  name -­


 MR. DOLAN:  Yes.


 QUESTION:  -- indicating here?


 MR. DOLAN:  Yes, Your Honor, because one's


16

 QUESTION:  Well, it -- it seems to me that that


17  is such a -- a minor detail, in light of what the police


18  can get in any event with fingerprints and so forth, that


19  the Fifth Amendment should just say that that's not


20  testimonial. 


21

22

 MR. DOLAN:  Well, the -- the Fifth -­


 QUESTION:  I mean, you're not probing the


23  perception, the memory, the cognition of the witness. 


24  You're just determining an extrinsic fact.


25

 MR. DOLAN:  Your Honor, the -- the name is in


17


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  fact testimonial because it is an assertion of fact, and


2  one can lie about one's name, and accordingly, I think -­


3  believe the test of what's testimonial or not is met.


4

 It's also incriminating because if an officer


5  determines that probable cause exists that a domestic


6  battery has occurred, that officer must arrest that


7  person.


8

 QUESTION:  May I ask you this question that


9  really follows up on Justice Scalia's question?  Would you


10  also argue that the refusal to give the name could not be

 MR. DOLAN:  Yes, Justice Stevens.  We believe

15  fact that the refusal is itself a crime in this case.

 QUESTION:  You could again then say you could


18  not even take it into account for determining whether


19  there's enough evidence to -- to take him to the station.

21  constitutional right can never increase one's level of -­

 QUESTION:  Yes, but suppose he -­


 QUESTION:  What -- what about -- what about,


24  say, the murder scene exception we talked about in that


25  Arizona case where an officer hears a shot fired, comes


18


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  into the house, there are eight or nine people in the


2  house.  Obviously, there's a dead body in the middle of


3  the floor.  Can he ask everybody else for their names?


4

 MR. DOLAN:  Well, we certainly believe the


5  officer can ask.


6

7

 QUESTION:  And are they obligated to respond? 


 MR. DOLAN:  I don't believe so, Your Honor, and


8  I believe that the imposition of a criminal sanction for


9  silence is --


10

 QUESTION:  Well, how are we ever -- how are we


11  going to solve a murder case if that's the law?


12

 MR. DOLAN:  Well, after -- post probable cause,


13  the law is a person is warned.  They are informed of their


14  right to remain silent.  They are also informed of other


15  constitutional rights.


16

 QUESTION:  No, no, no.  The Chief Justice's


17  hypothetical is like my bank hypothetical.  It said -­


18  we're just talking about witnesses now.


19

 MR. DOLAN:  Well, I don't -- I certainly think


20  that the State's case about the lawfulness of an arrest


21  and a conviction is -- is weaker for seizing a witness who


22  exercises their right to remain silent. 


23

 QUESTION:  But there are situations where the


24  State can -- that we -- well, Byers is one where we've


25  already said the name can be requested.  People are


19


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  required, when there's a registration for the draft, to


2  give their names which -- and that can't be made into a


3  consensual situation in exchange for some benefit.  So


4  we've treated names -- the question of name differently,


5  and there are many situations in which you are required to


6  give the name.


7

 MR. DOLAN:  Well, Your Honor, as regards the


8  Byers case, that statute spoke of a regulatory scheme in


9  which the -- the identity, which was required to be given,


10  was not to a member of law enforcement.  It was to the


11  owner of a vehicle.  The Nevada statute in question


12  specifically contemplates that the dialogue occurs within


13  a criminal investigation in a Terry stop, which was


14  different from Byers certainly, and also the intent of the


15  statute in Byers was just to ensure that civil liabilities


16  would be satisfied.


17

 QUESTION:  Well, in terms of the State's need to


18  know this information, how do you distinguish it from


19  requiring people to register, give their name for the


20  draft?


21

 MR. DOLAN:  In this case, Your Honor, the -- the


22  name is testimonial and incriminating because of the


23  dynamic of the Nevada statute in question. 


24

 QUESTION:  Well, you should just plead the Fifth


25  Amendment, say, I -- I refuse to answer on the ground that


20


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  it might incriminate me.  That -- was that -- was that 

2  what was done here?  I didn't realize you're -- you're 

3  making a -- a Fifth Amendment incrimination claim.  Is 

4  that -­

 MR. DOLAN:  We are, Your Honor. 

 QUESTION:  -- is that part of your -­

 QUESTION:  I -- I can go back for a second -­

 MR. DOLAN:  Yes, Your Honor, we are. 

 QUESTION:  So that -- that assumes that he was 

10  guilty and -- and had he not been -- had he not been 

11  guilty of the beating, then he -- then -- then you would 

12  acknowledge that he would have had to answer.  It's only 

13  the person who's guilty of the beating who would have a 

14  right not to answer. 

15

 MR. DOLAN:  One of the interests that the Fifth 

16  Amendment is designed to protect is to protect people who 

17  place -- find themselves in ambiguous circumstances 

18  where -­

21  could -­

 QUESTION:  No.  I think -­

 MR. DOLAN:  -- their silence or their admission

 QUESTION:  Please answer the -- the question yes 

23  or no.  Are you saying that only the -- the person who had 

24  been beating the woman in the truck and therefore 

25  disclosure of his name would incriminate him, only that 

21


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  person has the right not to answer?  Or are you saying


2  anybody who was asked had the right not to answer?


3

 MR. DOLAN:  Indeed -- indeed, everyone who was


4  asked. 


5

6

 QUESTION:  Under the Fifth Amendment -­


 QUESTION:  So you're not pleading the Fifth


7  Amendment then.  I -- that's -- that's what I thought you


8  were arguing and that has nothing to do with the Fifth


9  Amendment. 


10

 MR. DOLAN:  Well, the -- the -- from the


11  perspective of petitioner Hiibel, when Deputy Dove said to


12  him, I -- I hear that there was a fight here, and then


13  Deputy Dove started making inquiry of him, I think it was


14  reasonable for petitioner Hiibel to realize that at this


15  time he was facing the cruel trilemma, which this Court


16  speaks of, and in fact had -­


17

 QUESTION:  Okay, but if -- if at that point I


18  had walked down the street and the cop had turned to me


19  and said who are you, I wouldn't have had a Fifth


20  Amendment right to refuse, would I?


21

 MR. DOLAN:  If there was an imposition of


22  criminal sanction for the failure to respond -­


23

 QUESTION:  No, no, no, no.  I mean, you're


24  putting the cart before the horse.  So far as the Fifth


25  Amendment is concerned, whether the cop asked me, whether


22


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  there's a statute that says you -- you ought to give your


2  name to the police, would I have had a Fifth Amendment


3  right to refuse?


4

 MR. DOLAN:  If it's not the Fifth Amendment


5  right to refuse, it's your right to be let alone which


6  is -­


7

 QUESTION:  All right.  There might be a Fourth


8  Amendment -­


9

 QUESTION:  -- based upon other constitutional


10  principles. 


11

 QUESTION:  The only thing Justice Scalia and I


12  are trying to get at is we thought you were saying at one


13  point that everyone has a Fifth Amendment to refuse to


14  identify himself under all circumstances, and that -- that


15  -- is that your position?


16

 MR. DOLAN:  Your Honor, I -- the question is


17  only affirmative as regards the Fifth Amendment if the


18  State was to criminalize your silence in respect to that


19  question. 


20

 QUESTION:  Did the Supreme Court of Nevada pass


21  -- did you raise a Fifth Amendment question in the -- in


22  the Supreme Court of Nevada?


23

24

25

 MR. DOLAN:  We -- we did, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  And did the court pass on it?


 MR. DOLAN:  The court rejected the motion for


23


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  rehearing on that issue, Your Honor. 


2

 QUESTION:  Had you -- had you raised it before


3  the motion for rehearing?


4

 MR. DOLAN:  Yes.  Your Honor, it was raised at


5  the trial level through the citation at the trial -- I was


6  the trial attorney -- to Berkemer v. McCarty.  We -- I


7  appealed to the justice -- excuse me.  I appealed to the


8  Sixth Judicial District Court where both the State and the


9  defendant specifically briefed the Fifth Amendment issues


10  and argued the Fifth Amendment issues.


11

 QUESTION:  But -- but your answer that if -- if


12  the law requires that you give your name, then -- then


13  that makes everybody have a Fifth Amendment privilege is


14  just -- is just not right.  That's just circular.  I -- I


15  would agree that there may -- there likely is no Fifth


16  Amendment privilege for witnesses or I would -- I would


17  state that.  You might not agree.


18

 As to people that are suspect of a crime, even


19  if they're innocent, if you're -- if you're right that the


20  name is protected, then I think the privilege -- that the


21  privilege applies because even if they're innocent, it


22  might be a link in the chain of evidence necessary to


23  convict.  That's the -- that's the test.


24

 But the question, it -- it seems to me, is


25  whether a name itself -- a name itself is -- is -- has


24


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  such intrinsic testimonial consequences as opposed to


2  neutral regulatory consequences that it should be within


3  the Fifth Amendment.  That, it seems to me, the issue.


4

 MR. DOLAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  I believe that's


5  where the Court will -- will turn on that question.


6

 But also with respect to the Fourth Amendment


7  inquiry, a name is such that a person has a legitimate


8  expectation in the privacy in that name, otherwise the


9  government certainly then could require name tags and


10  perhaps color codes.


11

 QUESTION:  But the question of whether or not is


12  that privacy is diminished when they're witnesses to a


13  crime when they're present at a crime scene, and that's


14  certainly much different from saying that all citizens


15  have to give their name anytime a police officer asks them


16  for any reason.  That's a completely different case.


17

18

 MR. DOLAN:  Yes, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  I'm not -- I'm not even sure that the


19  driver of the truck would have a Fifth Amendment right.  I


20  don't know how your name incriminates you.  Your name may


21  help to -- to catch you, but I don't know that that


22  incriminates you.  By giving you -- by giving him your


23  name, you are what?  Proving that you did something wrong? 


24  I -- I don't see how it incriminates you.


25

 MR. DOLAN:  If -- if at a traffic stop a request

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

2  officer knows was driving the vehicle, I believe the

4  imposed government sanction in that -- in that -­


5

 QUESTION:  The Supreme Court of Nevada in its


6  concluding sentence of the majority says it follows that


7  N.R.S. such and such is good law consistent with the


8  Fourth Amendment.  And I don't see in the majority opinion


9  any reference to the Fifth Amendment.  Now, you say you


10  raised it on rehearing?


11

12

 MR. DOLAN:  Yes, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  And the -- the order of the Supreme


13  Court of Nevada is simply the petition for rehearing is


14  denied.


15

16

 MR. DOLAN:  The -­


 QUESTION:  So I'm -- I'm not sure at all you


17  raised it sufficiently before the supreme court. 


18

 MR. DOLAN:  Your Honor, the issue was also


19  briefed in the opening brief before the Nevada Supreme


20  Court.  The -- the Nevada Supreme Court just chose not to


21  address it in their opinion. 


22

 QUESTION:  You -- you did raise it then in your


23  briefs. 


24

25

 MR. DOLAN:  Yes, Your Honor, it did. 


 Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the remainder of

 QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Dolan. 


 Mr. Hafen, we'll hear from you. 


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CONRAD HAFEN


 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


 MR. HAFEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


7  the Court:


8

 There are three reasons why compelling a


9  lawfully detained person to identify himself is reasonable


10  under the Fourth Amendment.  It is a minimal intrusion. 


11  It advances officer safety, and it promotes effective law


12  enforcement in the prevention and detection of crime. 


13  Furthermore, it does not violate the Fifth Amendment


14  privilege against self-incrimination because identifying


15  yourself is a neutral act. 


16

 QUESTION:  Now, that -- that goes beyond Byers. 


17  My -- my -- the hard part of this case for me is that


18  Byers which, it seems to me, a much easier case, was so


19  difficult for the Court.  You had a fragmented Court.  You


20  didn't have an opinion for the majority of the Court.  And


21  this, it does seem to me, goes one step beyond Byers with


22  reference to the Fifth Amendment. 


23

24

 MR. HAFEN:  Well, in regard -­


 QUESTION:  And -- and Byers didn't take the


25  position that you just take, that it's -- that it's not


27


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  testimonial.  It seems to me that's a plausible enough


2  argument, but I -- I can't get that out of Byers.


3

 MR. HAFEN:  Well, Your Honor, in regard to


4  Byers, it was a plurality opinion, but there was also a


5  strong concurrence by Justice Harlan.  And in that


6  particular case, they talk about stating a name and


7  address as being a neutral act, and in the same context,


8  they talked about it in regard to a testimonial situation. 


9  They talk about it's a testimonial situation or a non­


10  testimonial situation when a person is stopped, the mere


11  stopping of the car, but in the same context, they also


12  say stating your name and your address is a neutral act.


13

 QUESTION:  Well, I'll -- I'll look at it again,


14  but it seems to me even the Harlan opinion was in the


15  context of what we might call the regulatory zone of -- of


16  automobile -- automobile regulation and control.


17

 MR. HAFEN:  They did talk about that, Your


18  Honor, but in the same context, they also describe or they


19  -- they address it in the criminal context.  The plurality


20  opinion addresses it in the criminal context, and Justice


21  Harlan also addresses it in the plurality -- or -­


22

 QUESTION:  The plurality opinion said that


23  noting a name -- notes that a name, quote, identifies but


24  does not by itself implicate anyone in criminal conduct -­


25

 MR. HAFEN:  That's correct. 


28


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

2

 QUESTION:  -- which is the same point. 


 MR. HAFEN:  That's correct, Your Honor.  That -­


3  that goes to the incriminating part of it, but when they


4  talk about the neutral act, we're interpreting that to go


5  to the testimonial part of it. 


6

 And this Court traditionally treats names


7  differently. 


8

 QUESTION:  You said name and address.  What else


9  would be under your neutral category?  Could a telephone


10  number, e-mail address?  How much fits in that neutral


11  category that citizens can be required to answer?


12

 MR. HAFEN:  Your Honor, the statute in Nevada


13  doesn't go that far.  It simply says compelling -- the -­


14  the identification or to identify one's self.  So under


15  the Nevada statute, those type of identifiers -­


16

 QUESTION:  But I'm asking you what fits -- what


17  fits within this neutral -- you -- you say that there are


18  certain things you can ask a person that they can be


19  required to respond to because they're not incriminating


20  and they're not a violation of privacy.  They're just


21  neutral.  So I'm just trying to get a handle on if we say


22  name is neutral, what else are we implicating.


23

 MR. HAFEN:  You could certainly make the


24  argument that those other things that you suggested, Your


25  Honor, are neutral.  However, going back to the Fourth


29


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Amendment, they really don't serve the purpose of officer


2  safety.  It's the name that you need so that you can


3  discover who this person is, what their background is -­


4

 QUESTION:  I -- I don't follow that really


5  because I can understand the Terry stop.  You have to pat


6  down immediately because the officer is at risk that the


7  person will be armed.  But by the time they do the


8  computer check, the harm -- I mean, that doesn't arrest


9  the situation.  It doesn't protect.  How is the officer


10  protected in that interval between when the person says I


11  won't give you my name -- I mean, it had to -- it has to


12  take some time to do a check, doesn't it?


13

 MR. HAFEN:  Well, Your Honor, going outside the


14  record, based on my experience as a prosecutor, that


15  information can be received in just a -- a matter of


16  minutes.  And so while the officer is waiting for that


17  information, he can certainly take the posture of


18  protecting himself.


19

 However, after receiving that information and


20  obtaining the criminal history on this person -- perhaps


21  he has a -- a history of battery on police officers -- he


22  can then escalate protection.  He either calls for backup


23  or perhaps unholsters his -- his revolver.  He has a


24  number of things that he can do after he gets that


25  information.  And so it is critical.

 QUESTION:  Does that -- does not information 

2  convert reasonable suspicion into probable cause? 

3

 MR. HAFEN:  Well -­

 QUESTION:  Suppose he finds he's a real bad guy. 

5  Does it now become probable cause? 

6

 MR. HAFEN:  That certainly adds into the 

7  equation, Your Honor, but that in and of itself wouldn't 

8  convert into probable cause.  The officer would have to 

9  look at the totality of the circumstances and on review 

10  of -­

11

 QUESTION:  Well, the totality of the 

12  circumstances are in -- in the beginning he has reasonable 

13  suspicion but not probable cause.  The one thing he 

14  learns, in addition to that, is this is a bad guy.  Is it 

15  now probable cause? 

16

 MR. HAFEN:  Well, again, I -- I don't believe so 

17  because there would be other factors that would -- would 

18  have to be taken into consideration. 

19

 QUESTION:  But I've already given you all the 

20  factors.  What other factors are there?  The total of the 

21  factors that exist are there's only reasonable suspicion. 

22  We add one more fact:  he's a bad guy.  Does that make it 

23  probable cause? 

24

25

 MR. HAFEN:  No. 

 QUESTION:  Why not?  Why not?  He has a record. 

31


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION:  Well, it might if he's a bad guy with


2  a particular -- with a particular pattern.  It was a


3  jewelry store and he said he's a bad guy because he robbed


4  a lot of jewelry stores under these same circumstances.  I


5  mean, you could play with hypotheticals, it seems to me. 


6

 QUESTION:  He has robbed this same jewelry store


7  10 previous times. 


8

9

 (Laughter.) 


 QUESTION:  Don't you think that would elevate it


10  to probable cause?


11

12

 MR. HAFEN:  Under your hypothetical, yes. 


 QUESTION:  Yes, but the likelihood of -- the


13  likelihood of getting that precise information is quite


14  remote, I think, in most of these cases.


15

16

17

18

 MR. HAFEN:  That's -- that's correct. 


 QUESTION:  What about Berkemer?


 MR. HAFEN:  Excuse me?


 QUESTION:  I -- I've read the -- the brief here. 


19  It's a case called Berkemer v. McCarty referred to on page


20  13.  There must be some obvious answer I'm missing. 


21  They're talking about a Terry stop and they say -- the -­


22  the Court says this.  You can ask him questions, but the


23  detainee is not obliged to respond and then a bunch of


24  others.  So if he's not obliged to respond, he's not


25  obliged to respond.  Now, what do we do about that case?


32


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 MR. HAFEN:  Well, Your Honor, two responses. 


2  First of all, I believe that reference in Berkemer is -­


3  is dicta by the Court.  The real holding in Berkemer was a


4  Miranda issue.


5

 Second, this Court has never specifically


6  addressed this question. 


7

 QUESTION:  All right.  So what you're saying is


8  that there's a lot.  You know, they have like two pages


9  here of different judges, Harlan, White, Berkemer, Davis,


10  and each time the Court said, but they're not obliged to


11  respond.


12

 Now -- now, I -- what I thought -- I guess I'm


13  approaching this case quite differently, but I thought


14  we're not talking about national ID cards.  What we're


15  talking about are Terry stops.  And a Terry stop is a


16  derogation from the ordinary situation where you can walk


17  along and do what you want.  So if we're derogating from


18  the person's ordinary freedom, what the Court did in


19  carving out exception was to create a condition.  You can


20  ask, but he doesn't have to answer. 


21

 Now, the virtue of that is simple.  Anyone can


22  understand it and it doesn't get us into all these


23  problems that were raised previously whether those


24  problems are right, wrong, or indifferent.  So if I read


25  three Supreme Court cases and it all says that, I think


33


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  maybe there's some burden in saying on your part why we


2  shouldn't just follow what it says.


3

 MR. HAFEN:  Well, in subsequent opinions that


4  were cited by the petitioner, they discuss the -- either a


5  dissent or a concurring, and in those particular


6  references, the Justice does say unsolved crimes,


7  questions to unsolved crimes, or as Justice White said -­


8

 QUESTION:  Then why complicate the matter?  That


9  is, you've already said a name doesn't normally


10  incriminate you, but it could.  Suppose his name is Killer


11  Magee.  I don't know. 


12

13

 (Laughter.) 


 QUESTION:  I mean, it's possible.  And then I


14  guess you could have other questions, you know, that don't


15  normally incriminate you.  Are you hungry?  Would you like


16  to sit down?  But -- so -- so why get into this


17  complicated thing of saying whether a question normally


18  isn't or normally is or sometimes or sometimes?  Why don't


19  we just follow what the Court said?


20

 MR. HAFEN:  Because again, Your Honor, I don't


21  believe in this particular issue where it's a stop and


22  identify statute, that the Court has specifically


23  addressed that. 


24

25

 QUESTION:  I thought your answer -­

 QUESTION:  -- is because the Court said it in 

2  dictum.  Right? 

3

4

 MR. HAFEN:  That -- that's correct. 

 QUESTION:  What case are you referring to when 

5  we said it in dictum? 

6

7

 MR. HAFEN:  In Berkemer v. McCarty. 

 QUESTION:  But even there, we did not say it was 

8  a Fifth Amendment violation. 

9

10

 QUESTION:  Right. 

 QUESTION:  A Fifth Amendment privilege, and 

11  that's what you're -- you're here to argue.  You're here 

12  to say that this is just not covered by the Fifth 

13  Amendment and it is not testimonial.  It's a neutral fact. 

14

 QUESTION:  I -- I agree with you about that. 

15  I'm talking about a Terry stop and I'm simply -­

20

 QUESTION:  Which is a Fourth Amendment issue. 

 QUESTION:  That's right. 

 QUESTION:  We have both issues here, do we not? 

 QUESTION:  Right, right, right. 

 QUESTION:  Fourth Amendment and Fifth Amendment? 

21  Even if it doesn't violate the Fifth Amendment, we're


22  still going to have to answer the Fourth Amendment


23  question I guess.


24

 MR. HAFEN:  That's correct, Your Honor, and


25  that's when the Court would engage in a balancing test.

1  And the Court traditionally has balanced -­


2

 QUESTION:  But we have not expressly said that


3  Nevada can require identification, or any other State.  We


4  haven't said that in a holding. 


5

6

7

8

9

 MR. HAFEN:  That's correct. 


 QUESTION:  And the language is --


 QUESTION:  Nor -- nor have we said otherwise.


 MR. HAFEN:  That's correct. 


 QUESTION:  It is correct?  I'm sorry.  Not in a


10  holding, but I mean, there are about four cases where they


11  say, of course -- and of course, it's that.  Now, I grant


12  you that dicta, which of course this is, is -- varies in


13  its strength and so forth, but if we have a repeated


14  series of cases that say it, doesn't there have to be a


15  pretty good reason for departing from it?  And that's what


16  I'm listening for:  a pretty good reason.


17

 QUESTION:  Well, do all those cases that you're


18  referring to hypothesize the existence of reasonable


19  suspicion or are some of them just confrontation without


20  reasonable suspicion?


21

 MR. HAFEN:  Well, are you -- in regard to


22  Berkemer?


23

24

 QUESTION:  Yes. 


 MR. HAFEN:  In regard to Berkemer, again that


25  went back to a Miranda issue, whether an individual -­


36


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  whether an officer would have to read Miranda to a -­


2  during a traffic stop.  And -­


3

 QUESTION:  But he says this while discussing


4  Terry stops.  That they said this while discussing Terry


5  stops.  Is that so in respect to Berkemer?  I'm just


6  reading the brief.  The -- the language I quoted was while


7  discussing Terry stops.


8

 MR. HAFEN:  That -- that's correct.  The Court


9  ultimately decided that a traffic stop was akin to a Terry


10  stop.  But the Court also addressed it in the situation of


11  a Fifth Amendment issue under a -- a Miranda concept.


12

13

 QUESTION:  Well, I -­


 QUESTION:  Could you -- could you explain to us


14  why you think the Nevada Supreme Court didn't mention the


15  Fifth Amendment in its opinion? 


16

 MR. HAFEN:  Your Honor, I -- I don't know.  I am


17  of the opinion that the -- the opinion simply addresses


18  the Fourth Amendment issue.  Why they didn't address the


19  -- the Fifth Amendment I don't know.  Those -- those


20  issues were certainly presented to that court.


21

 QUESTION:  Because they're quite different, and


22  certainly the Fifth Amendment issue is important and


23  perhaps even harder than the other issue.


24

 MR. HAFEN:  To -- to some extent, Your Honor. 


25  But again, our position is that it is not testimonial and


37


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  it's not incriminating.  It's simply -­


2

 QUESTION:  But it -- but it is the -- the odd


3  thing about this case is that the inquiry is made and it's


4  significant only in the context of a criminal


5  investigation.  That's the only time the statute applies,


6  when you've got a Terry stop.


7

 MR. HAFEN:  That -- that's correct.  And in


8  regard to the Fourth Amendment, again it gets back to this


9  balancing issue.  This Court is going to have to balance


10  the -- any apparent personal security interests of Mr.


11  Hiibel against the important legitimate interests that the


12  government has in this case.  And again, it gets back to


13  officer safety.  It gets back to the prevention and


14  detection of crime.  And again -­


15

 QUESTION:  Well, I understand all the arguments


16  on the Fourth Amendment, but for me the more difficult


17  issue, frankly, is the Fifth Amendment.  And it's really


18  strange that they didn't -- they didn't discuss it at all


19  and it is strange that -- we're all concerned about


20  identification cards and national and all this sort of


21  stuff.  But this case is very, very narrow.  It's just a


22  case where somebody gets stopped.  He doesn't realize


23  there's a statute on the books that said, if you don't


24  answer, you can go to jail or get -- get arrested.  The


25  funny thing about it is there are no warnings required


38


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  here.


2

 MR. HAFEN:  Well, in this particular case, the


3  deputy did warn him.  In fact, the evidence is clear in


4  the joint appendix on page 4 that the finding of fact by


5  the justice court was that Deputy Dove did tell Mr. Hiibel


6  if you don't give me identification, I'm going to have to


7  arrest you.


8

9

 QUESTION:  Yes. 


 MR. HAFEN:  And so in this particular case, he


10  was placed on notice -­


11

 QUESTION:  Of course, the statute -- but the


12  statute didn't require that. 


13

 MR. HAFEN:  That -- that's correct.  The statute


14  does say, shall identify yourself.


15

 QUESTION:  Well, ignorance of the law is


16  generally no excuse, is it?


17

18

 MR. HAFEN:  That's correct.  That's correct. 


 QUESTION:  Well, I agree that the Fifth


19  Amendment is -- is the hard -- harder question in this


20  case, especially given the convoluted opinions in Byers. 


21  It does seem to me that because the statute really focuses


22  on what we might call Terry stops, that you have a class


23  of persons who are within the zone of the commission of a


24  crime, and so the Fifth Amendment becomes -- it becomes


25  slightly more of a suspect class.  I don't know how that


39


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  could take care of the witness hypothetical.  But this


2  person was certainly under suspicion of -- of criminal


3  activity. 


4

 MR. HAFEN:  Well, to some extent, but going back


5  to the videotape that -- that the Court has, after Deputy


6  Dove asked the -- or informed Mr. Hiibel, I'm here because


7  of a fight between the two of you, he indicates, I know


8  nothing about that.  So that may very well take him


9  somewhat out of the class of a suspect now to a potential


10  witness.  At that time, Deputy Dove, based on that


11  response, doesn't know now, well, is this the man that was


12  reported hitting the woman in the truck or did that person


13  leave and this is simply another passenger in the truck. 


14  So viewed objectively, he has every right or -- to -- to


15  ask the question and because it wouldn't constitute a


16  Fifth Amendment violation in that context if Mr. Hiibel


17  truly was a witness, then he would be obligated to answer


18  the question. 


19

 QUESTION:  What -- what's the closest case you


20  have for us?  The Nevada court doesn't address this issue. 


21  What's the closest case you have for us to show that this


22  is not a Fifth Amendment violation?


23

 MR. HAFEN:  It would be Byers, and we rely upon


24  Byers.  And again, granted, it's a plurality decision but


25  with a strong concurrence by Justice Harlan.


40


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION:  I -- I thought your -- you were


2  saying earlier that your strongest reason would be that he


3  had already, in effect, taken himself out of Fifth


4  Amendment protection by saying I know nothing about that.


5

 MR. HAFEN:  In -- in that context, yes, because


6  now he, according to Deputy Dove, viewed objectively, is


7  potentially a -- a witness. 


8

 QUESTION:  Yes, but then your rationale for the


9  arrest should be that you're a potential witness, and for


10  that reason, we have a right to -- we have a right to


11  apprehend the witness to make him testify to the crime. 


12  You don't need the -- the Terry stop rationale for that. 


13  If you think he's a witness to a crime, the Terry stop is


14  really irrelevant.


15

 MR. HAFEN:  Well, but the reasonable suspicion


16  was formed prior to meeting with -- with Mr. Hiibel.  So


17  he had every -- at least he had the reasonable suspicion


18  for initially detaining.


19

 QUESTION:  From the standpoint of the Fifth


20  Amendment, what rule do you want us to adopt?  When can


21  the police require persons to give their identity in your


22  view under the Fifth Amendment constitutionally?


23

 MR. HAFEN:  During -- first of all, you have to


24  make sure that there's reasonable suspicion to detain the


25  person and at that point then when the officer asks the


41


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  person for identification or what his name is, then if the


2  person doesn't respond, then the person can be arrested.


3

 QUESTION:  What about our witness hypothetical


4  where -- the Chief Justice's hypothetical of -- of the


5  murder with five people standing there and my hypothetical


6  -- you don't -- you don't think the police can demand


7  identification at that point from witnesses?


8

 MR. HAFEN:  Oh, they -- they certainly could


9  demand at that point.


10

 QUESTION:  What -- could they be criminalized if


11  they fail to give the answer?


12

 MR. HAFEN:  Well, it depends if at that time


13  there's reasonable suspicion to believe that one of those


14  individuals may have committed a crime.


15

 QUESTION:  Oh, so then you're abandoning the


16  witness rationale. 


17

 QUESTION:  Well, but the statute doesn't apply


18  to pure witness.  That's the point.  This -- this statute


19  does not apply to the -- to the witness of the bank


20  robbery who's not suspected of doing the robbery.


21

 MR. HAFEN:  Well, again, it's -- it's going to


22  depend on the -- the search -- the situation.


23

 QUESTION:  No.  The -- the hypothetical


24  situation is purely a witness.  They've been standing in


25  line at the counter.  He saw somebody rob the bank.  But


42


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  he's not suspected at all.  All -- our hypothetical -- you


2  could make him give his name because you want his


3  testimony at the trial.  But that's not a -- that's not


4  this statute.


5

 MR. HAFEN:  Right.  The statute is specifically


6  tied into reasonable suspicion and whether that person may


7  have committed a crime.  I agree, yes.


8

 QUESTION:  Well, it would be rather odd that you


9  could ask innocent people to give their name and not -­


10  and not a person under criminal suspicion.


11

12

 MR. HAFEN:  Well, again, let -- let me back up.


 QUESTION:  Do you think that maybe when he's


13  invoking the Fifth Amendment, he has to invoke the Fifth


14  Amendment? 


15

16

 MR. HAFEN:  Yes. 


 QUESTION:  Do you think maybe -- if he just


17  can't say I won't answer -- he can be arrested if he just


18  says I won't answer, but if he says I won't answer on the


19  ground that it might tend to incriminate me, then the


20  policeman would probably have probable cause.  Wouldn't


21  he? 


22

23

 (Laughter.) 


 QUESTION:  But it seems to me sort of -- you


24  know, sort of sneaky to invoke the Fifth Amendment without


25  invoking the Fifth Amendment.  He -- he didn't -- that


43


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  wasn't the reason he gave for not answering.  I thought


2  people usually invoke the Fifth Amendment.  They say, I


3  refuse to answer that question -- you know, they have


4  their lawyer next to them -- on the ground that it might


5  tend to incriminate me.


6

7

 MR. HAFEN:  Well, they do -­


 QUESTION:  Can they -- can they just say I don't


8  want to answer that question? 


9

 MR. HAFEN:  I don't believe so.  I think that's


10  a very vague response, and I think they'd have to


11  specifically invoke the Fifth Amendment.  And as -­


12  Justice Scalia, as you pointed out, typically when they do


13  that, they do that in the context of maybe a grand jury


14  hearing or -- or a criminal trial.


15

 And so, again, the State's position in -- in


16  regard to this particular case is that as it relates to


17  the Fifth Amendment, is the name itself is a neutral act. 


18  It simply doesn't implicate an individual in any criminal


19  conduct.  It doesn't say in this particular case in regard


20  to Mr. Hiibel, that he struck the woman.  It doesn't even


21  imply that he may have been driving the car.  It doesn't


22  go to any -­


23

 QUESTION:  May -- may I interrupt?  How do you


24  distinguish this so-called neutral fact from a billion


25  other neutral facts which have evidentiary significance in


44


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  a criminal trial?  It's a neutral fact that I'm wearing a


2  pinstripe suit, but if the evidence was that the bank


3  robber was wearing a pinstripe suit, this -- this would be


4  relevant evidence and it might tip the scale in -- in


5  proof.  It's neutral.


6

 MR. HAFEN:  Well, that would certainly go to the


7  Wade and the Gilbert cases that talk about voice analysis,


8  lineup -­

 QUESTION:  But this is -- this is -­


 QUESTION:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Hafen.


 MR. HAFEN:  Thank you. 


 QUESTION:  Mr. Srinivasan, we'll hear from you.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN


 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES


 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT


 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,


17  and may it please the Court:


18

 A person detained, based on reasonable suspicion


19  of crime, may be required to provide his name to officers


20  because that requirement contributes significantly to the


21  ability of law enforcement officers to ensure their own


22  safety and that of the public while imposing only a


23  minimal burden on an individual's protected interests in


24  privacy. 


25

 The question under the Fourth Amendment would be


45


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  whether an otherwise -­

2

 QUESTION:  Would you -- may I just interrupt 

3  there?  How does it help the officer's safety if -- he's 

4  made the patdown.  He finds he is or not armed.  If he's 

5  armed, of course, he arrests him.  He's not armed.  And he 

6  -- now, how does it help the officer's safety at this 

7  point to find out whether he should just let him go away 

8  or he should call a station and ask -- do something when 

9  he knows his name? 

10

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Justice Stevens, it's true that 

11  a patdown authority provides a measure of protection for 

12  an officers, and it's -- it's an important one, but the 

13  authority to determine a person's name and thereby run a 

14  background check is a highly significant, complementary 

15  measure. 

16

 QUESTION:  Do officers always pat down before 

17  they ask questions?  I've had officers ask me questions 

18  often without telling me to spread my legs, put my arms up 

19  against the wall, and they -- they frisk me. 

20

21

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  No.  And -- and -­

 QUESTION:  We certainly wouldn't want to 

22  encourage that kind of activity, would we? 

23

24

 (Laughter.) 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  No, and a patdown authority is 

25  conditioned -­

46


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION:  I think the Terry case does encourage


2  that kind of activity.  If you have reasonable suspicion,


3  that's the first thing you do is -- is pat them down.


4

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, the authority to conduct


5  a patdown search, first of all, is conditioned on there


6  being reason -- a reasonable basis for believing that the


7  person is armed and dangerous.  And so obtaining a


8  person's name -­


9

 QUESTION:  And my question is once he finds he's


10  not armed, why is his officer -- why is his safety


11  implicated by not deciding to let him go instead of


12  calling the station and detaining him further?


13

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Because a patdown isn't


14  foolproof.  The -- the officer might be assaulted in a


15  physical assault rather than through the use of arms -­


16

17

18

 QUESTION:  Well, and a patdown would not -­


 MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- and in addition --


 QUESTION:  A patdown would not occur unless he


19  had reason to believe the person was armed, which in most


20  cases he will not have.  And he -- if he finds out that


21  the guy he's confronting with is, you know, Machine Gun


22  Harry, he's going to have a -- a different approach to


23  that individual.  I don't see how there's any question


24  that it -- it can help the -- the officer's safety unless


25  you expect the officer always to pat down people, which


47


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  they -- they can't do unless they have reason to believe 

2  that the person is armed -­

3

4

5

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's -­

 QUESTION:  -- which usually they don't I assume. 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's right, Justice Scalia. 

6  The first response to Justice Stevens' question is that 

7  the patdown authority is conditioned on there being a 

8  reasonable basis for believing that the person is armed 

9  and dangerous. 

10

 QUESTION:  There has to be a reasonable 

11  suspicion, but there doesn't have to be reasonable 

12  suspicion that he's armed. 

13

14

15

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  There has -­

 QUESTION:  That's not part of the inquiry. 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  There has to be a reasonable 

16  basis for believing that the person is armed and dangerous 

17  before the authority to conduct a patdown frisk kicks in. 

18  And what the -- what the authority to determine a person's 

19  name and thereby determine their criminal history does is 

20  to afford the officer with information that may lead him 

21  to believe that he's dealing with a dangerous individual. 

22

 QUESTION:  Well, is it your position they should 

23  get the answer to the identity question before they pat 

24  him down? 

25

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  No.  I don't think it's a -­

48


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  it's a question of sequence.


2

 QUESTION:  Which comes first in your view in the


3  normal police procedure where there is reasonable


4  suspicion under Terry?


5

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, it would -- first of all,


6  it would depend on whether there's a reasonable basis for


7  believing that the person is armed and dangerous because


8  if there is not that reasonable basis, the authority


9  doesn't have the authority to conduct a patdown at all. 


10

 QUESTION:  All right, but on your reasoning that


11  he can ask for the -- for the name for reasons of safety


12  -- and that's why it should be allowed without anything


13  more -- why doesn't exactly that same reason support an


14  authority to -- to patdown even in the absence of any


15  reason to believe that the person may be armed and


16  dangerous?  It would contribute to officer safety. 


17

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  No, it would, but the -- the


18  reason why the Fourth Amendment requires a showing a


19  reasonable basis to believe that they're armed and


20  dangerous before conducting a patdown is because, as the


21  Court described the patdown in Terry, it represents a


22  severe intrusion on the person's personal security.  And


23  that's not the case for the question, what is your name. 


24  That doesn't represent any sort of physical intrusion on


25  the person whatsoever. 


49


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION:  So -- so your argument really boils


2  down to the -- I mean, the -- the crucial part of your


3  argument is -- is the -- is the relatively -- relative 


4  insignificance of the intrusion.


5

6

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's --


 QUESTION:  But for that, we'd be in the same


7  boat with name and patdown. 


8

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, that's critical to


9  explaining why in all cases the officer should have an


10  authority to compel the person to disclose his name.


11

12

13

 QUESTION:  The insignificance of the intrusion.


 MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's correct. 


 QUESTION:  Now, I thought -- I thought under


14  Terry we've held that a police officer may detain someone


15  briefly without probable cause on a reasonable suspicion


16  the person has committed or is about to commit a crime and


17  during that process may ask all kinds of questions of the


18  person, although, as far as I can find out, this Court has


19  said the person does not have to respond to the questions.


20

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  What you're pointing to,


21  Justice O'Connor, I believe is the dictum that was


22  discussed early in Berkemer v. -- in Berkemer v. McCarty. 


23  And that, first of all, is dictum, but not only is it


24  dictum, it's ambiguous dictum because the language that


25  the Court used was that the officer is entitled to ask a


50


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  moderate number of questions, first, to determine the


2  person's identity and, second, to obtain information with


3  which to confirm or dispel the officer's suspicions.  And


4  then the Court goes on to say that, of course, the


5  detainee is not required to respond.  It's unclear whether


6  that statement concerning that the detainee is not


7  required to respond relates to the initial basis for


8  asking questions which is determinative of his identity.


9

 QUESTION:  But we've just never said that the


10  officer may require the identification.  That's what this


11  case asks us to determine. 


12

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's right, Justice O'Connor,


13  but the Court specifically left the -- the question open,


14  at least on two occasions, both in Brown v. Texas and in


15  Kolender v. Lawson.  So I don't think the Court is in any


16  way inhibited by its precedents. 


17

 QUESTION:  And the right to do a patdown is


18  something you do after the officer has made the initial


19  decision to detain and ask some questions presumably.


20

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's right.  That's right. 


21  It comes after the officer has made a determination to


22  detain.  That's correct. 


23

 The issue under the Fifth Amendment I think is


24  -- is -­


25

 QUESTION:  Can we go back to -- would you go


51


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  back to the Fourth because I -- I suppose the -- the


2  officer can ask, you know, and he doesn't get an answer,


3  so he pats him down.  What's wrong with that? 


4

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, if he has a reason to


5  believe -­


6

 QUESTION:  I mean, it's very, very unlikely I


7  would think, unless you have some evidence to the


8  contrary, that the officer who's in a Terry stop


9  situation.  Are there -- a lot of instances where they


10  look -- he said what's your name and then the person -­


11  and by the way, you have to answer or you're going to be


12  in more trouble so therefore the person gives him his real


13  name, which happens to turn out to be one of the worst


14  criminals in the country, and then he pats him down.  I


15  grant you that could happen. 


16

 But contrast that with a situation where you


17  take Berkemer literally, and now you say if he doesn't


18  answer, sure you can pat him down.


19

 What's wrong -- I -- I don't see it.  I'm back


20  to my point which you heard me ask, and I -- I'd really


21  like an answer in terms of -- I mean, Berkemer cites Davis


22  and Davis refers to the settled principle -- settled -­


23  that you can't -- you can ask what you want, but they


24  don't have to answer.  Okay?  So there are a lot of


25  circumstances where it may be national ID cards or


52


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  whatever, which are not Terry stop situations.  But why


2  should we retreat from that dictum?


3

 Now, I hear your answer about the -- about the


4  danger and I think that's an important point.  But I -- I


5  sort of canceled that by thinking not answering would also


6  give the policeman a justification for the patdown.  And


7  -- and now, if that's right, what other reason is there


8  for retreating from the rather strong dictum?


9

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  No, but Justice Breyer, I don't


10  think the patdown eliminates the danger.  The patdown is


11  important in addressing the possibility that the person


12  might use arms that are on their person against the


13  officer, but it does -- it in no way eliminates the danger


14  to the officer.  And that's why -­


15

 QUESTION:  And -- and you don't believe that the


16  failure to give a name gives the officer reason to believe


17  that the person is armed, do you?  I mean, simply because


18  he refuses to give you a name, do you have justification


19  to do a patdown? 


20

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  No.  We're not -- we're not


21  taking that position and the courts -­


22

 QUESTION:  No, I wouldn't think so.  I -- I know


23  a lot of people that might not want to give their names -­


24

 QUESTION:  Well, it would be pretty odd to say


25  that you can force a person to give his name in order to


53


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  protect the policeman, but the far lesser restriction of


2  just taking it into account as evidence you can't do. 


3  That would be an unusual position.  I mean, taking it into


4  account is a factor suggesting danger, you can't do, but


5  of course you can require him to answer under penalty of a


6  crime. 


7

8

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I think -­


 QUESTION:  So, I mean, everybody is in a false


9  position here because you're -- you're being put in a


10  slightly false position. 


11

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  I don't know that it's a false


12  position. 


13

 QUESTION:  All right.  Yes, all right.  I'll -­


14  I'll take your answer.  Danger.  Is there anything else?


15

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, it's not only danger to


16  the officer's safety, but it also could provide crucial


17  information for the officer to -- to assess the


18  individual's conduct because if the officer learns that


19  the person has previously been convicted of a crime that


20  fits the pattern that he observed in deciding to detain


21  the person, then that could go a long ways towards


22  officer's determination that there's probable cause for an


23  arrest.  And of course, that would be crucial in -- in


24  terms of public safety because it could prevent commission


25  of an imminent offense or the ongoing commission of a


54


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  continuing offense. 

2

 QUESTION:  Then why -- why do you stop at the 

3  name?  Answers to any questions would have that effect. 

4

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  No, that's true.  And -- and as 

5  -- from the perspective of the Fourth Amendment, I'm not 

6  sure that there's a limitation related to answers to 

7  questions.  I think the limitation would arise under the 

8  Fifth Amendment, and what the Fifth -­

9

 QUESTION:  So -- so far as the -- so far as 

10  Terry and the Fourth Amendment are concerned, I'm -- I'm 

11  not sure I understand you.  Are you saying that there is 

12  an obligation to answer all questions, not just names? 

13

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  No.  I -- no.  The Court hasn't 

14  specifically spoken to that question, but we don't 

15  challenge the dictum -­

16

 QUESTION:  No, but I -- I thought -- is that -­

17  is that the position that you're taking? 

18

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  No.  We don't take the -- we 

19  don't take that position because we don't challenge the 

20  dictum in Berkemer and other cases insofar as -­

21

 QUESTION:  Okay.  Then why do you stop -- why do 

22  you stop at the name?  Is it again the -- the minimal 

23  intrusion, that that is a more minimal intrusion than 

24  other information? 

25

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's correct.

 QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Srinivasan.


 Mr. Dolan, you have 4 minutes remaining. 


 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. DOLAN


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR. DOLAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 


 Within the -- within the Fourth Amendment


7  balancing construct, we believe that the government's


8  argument that officer safety is served by requiring a


9  person to utter their name is a false assumption.  Truly


10  if the officer is stopping Machine Gun Harry and he says,


11  oh, I'm John Smith, and -- and if you follow the


12  government's position, then the officer at that time can


13  relax his guard, thereby increasing the -- the possibility


14  of danger.  So we think that as the Court engages in the


15  analysis of what is appropriate under the balancing -­


16

 QUESTION:  Well, you're -- you're saying people


17  can disobey the law to make it ineffective.  That's not


18  usually an argument we accept.


19

 MR. DOLAN:  I'm saying that the -- what -- the


20  government's argument is based upon the assumption that


21  everyone will tell the truth during a Terry stop, and I


22  don't believe that corresponds with common sense,


23  especially if Machine Gun Harry is there.  He doesn't want


24  to be identified and it's in his interest to say my name


25  is Tom Smith.  And if you follow the government's


56


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  conclusion -- rather, it's position, then the officer then


2  relaxes his guard, doesn't take appropriate steps.  We


3  believe that officers must protect themselves but do so in


4  a way that is consistent with the Constitution.


5

 When the Court established the Terry rule, it


6  created an exception to the previous rule was that


7  seizures could only occur on probable cause, which was a


8  greater evidentiary standard.  And the Court was very


9  careful to suggest that there was a limited right, not a


10  general exploratory search, that now we will be involved


11  when -- excuse me -- because a name, the government


12  suggests, will be the key to unlock data that is endless,


13  given the modern age of technology, that the government


14  can learn about that person.


15

 It is a general exploratory search which the


16  government ultimately is asking this Court to approve of. 


17  And then privacy is a -- a nice principle to talk about as


18  a part of history.  Going forward, it will not be part of


19  American citizens' natural relationship by right that they


20  can count on.  There are related freedoms that this Court


21  also looks to in the balancing. 


22

 QUESTION:  Well, but if there's reasonable


23  suspicion to believe the person is committing a crime, it


24  doesn't shock me that they'd use the identification


25  mechanisms to check it out.  I mean, we're -- we're on the


57


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  assumption that the person has been stopped on the basis


2  of reasonable suspicion -­


3

4

5

6

 MR. DOLAN:  And -- and -­


 QUESTION:  -- of committing a crime. 


 MR. DOLAN:  I would agree, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  So why not let them check in the


7  computer records to see if this is the worst prior


8  offender they've ever had?


9

 MR. DOLAN:  Well -- well, with respect to the


10  Terry stop itself, it is for investigation related to


11  whether or not a crime may occur or is about to occur. 


12  And the officer has available to them tools to inquire. 


13  They can temporarily detain the person to see if there are


14  witnesses around who could identify the person as having


15  engaged in criminal conduct and the like.


16

 But the -- the notion that a person has to


17  affirmatively provide a ticket to terminate that Terry


18  encounter really tips the balance too much in favor of the


19  State and risks a lot of benefits to our society that


20  accrue through freely being able to move, to be let alone,


21  to engage in protected activity without being subjected to


22  the accosting that one is subjected to during a Terry


23  stop.


24

 Suspicious behavior is not easily or usefully


25  quantified, so this Court has found.  And because what is


58
