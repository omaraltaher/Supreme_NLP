CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next in Case 15-1031, Howell v. Howell. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Unikowsky. 

 

           

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM G. UNIKOWSKY 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it please the Court: 

 

 

 

            

In Mansell v. Mansell, this Court held that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not authorize State courts to treat waived Military 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Retirement Pay as divisible property in divorce.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question in this case is whether Mansell's holding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies only to waivers that preceded the divorce, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it applies to all waivers no matter when they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occur, and we respectfully submit that the latter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation is correct.  And I'd like to make two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

points this morning.  One is that we think the text of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute compels our interpretation, and the second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that we think our interpretation just makes sense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So our first argument is based on the text, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I think it's just inescapable that what the State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court did here was divide Petitioner's waived retirement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay.  And I think that can be seen from the fact that if

the State's court's order had simply just said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

henceforth, Petitioner's waived retirement pay is now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divided, if that's -- those were the words of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modification order, there would have been no difference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at all in effect than what actually occurred in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modification.  So --

  

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose that what the 

  

 

 

 

 

court had said is, taking a look at what the retirement 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay is now, how much it is total, and had specified then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a dollar amount for the wife equivalent to what the half 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was before the disability benefits, that would be okay; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and if it takes disability later, she still keeps the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount that was awarded, the dollar amount. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So, I'm sorry.  If the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

question was if the -- if the modification order had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply said you have to pay a dollar amount equal to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount that you've waived, if that was the modification 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order, we can assume the same preemption concern that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exists because that's the economic equivalent of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

division of the --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  I -- I think 

    

   

  

 

Justice Ginsburg's question is, the original divorce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decree here said Petitioner's entitled to and is awarded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as her sole and separate property 50 percent of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent's military retirement.  If it had read

Petitioner's entitled to $250 a month, period, full 

   

 

 

 

 

 

stop, to ensure that that is received by her, she'll get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$250 a month from his Military Retirement Pay. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So I -- if -- if that was a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

settlement, then I think that it would be enforceable. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Our position today has nothing to do with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the enforcement of settlements.  In this case, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

divorce court said that the settlement as written only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized Respondent to receive half of Petitioner's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pension.  That's why it modified it. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

But if the original order had simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specified a dollar value per month, then we would have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no objection to enforcing that.  In the same sense that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if Petitioner had agreed to express indemnification 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision and thereby, you know, waived his rights under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the USFSPA, we think that litigation waiver would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay, would be enforceable, just like any other waiver 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in litigation. 

 

            

So I -- I do agree that if there's simply a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollar figure that Petitioner had signed, that would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unobjectionable.  And the other --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So could she go back to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court now and ask for a dollar figure instead? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I -- I don't think so, 

    

   

 

 

 

because I think that that would be a modification 

   

   

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

imposed by the court that would be -- that Petitioner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

never agreed to, so he's never waived this protection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  She can't go back into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

court -- I thought in divorce courts you can go back and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change circumstances and seek a modification of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

monetary awards.  Why can't she do that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, I think the question 

   

  

 

 

 

is whether this particular type of changed circumstance, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is a waiver of Military Retirement Pay, authorizes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this particular remedy, which is this indemnification 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is -- is the answer that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a difference in adjusting alimony payments 

   

 

 

 

 

and property -- and -- and property settlements that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been concluded? 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yes, Justice Kennedy. 

  

 

 

 

Absolutely.  We -- we don't agree the USFSPA is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interfering with the State court's power over alimony. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I think we expressly say that in our reply brief. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, if Petitioner -- if -- excuse me --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent needed more alimony, the statute has the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

savings clause that expressly says that she can come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to court and get more.

that one spouse pays to the other based on economic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

need.  The division of property gives a spouse the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

property outright.  It's hers.  It's not something that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

she is getting from somebody else.  It is hers, because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's an enormous difference between equitable 

 

 

 

 

 

division of property and alimony. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yes.  That is our exact 

  

  

 

 

 

 

position, Justice Ginsburg.  We think that the statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not interfere with the ability toward alimony, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this was a division of property, and here's a Federal 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

statute which is defining the ex-spouse's property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest as half of the residual share of the pension. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This -- this is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty basic question I should know the answer to, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you talk about dividing the property, is that by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any proportion? 

 

            

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yes --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You get 

  

 

 

 

two-thirds/one-third?  It's not -- doesn't have to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

50/50? 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  That's correct.  So Arizona 

  

  

 

 

 

is a community property State, and so property is almost 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invariably divided 50/50.  There -- there are some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions which are not applicable to this case.

Other states, equitable division states, 

 

 

 

 

sometimes deviate from 50/50 divisions, but even if they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were 60/40, I think that would still be a division of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

property; it would just be an unequal division of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it under the community 

  

 

 

 

 

 

property law that the 50 percent that the spouse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

received of the retirement pay was hers even if they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hadn't been divorced? 

 

 

            

In other words, what is community property? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I thought community property is the two spouses' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest in the property, each of which owns half from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day one.  Is that right? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yes.  That is what 

  

  

 

 

 

community -- how community property works.  But here, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal statute is defining what the State courts --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So is -- is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You're not -- I'm not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

arguing for you.  In that case I'll ask him.  But the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divorce decree changed nothing.  It simply gave her what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was hers. 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yes.  That is our 

  

  

 

 

 

interpretation of the divorce decree. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how could he take any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

action that impinges on what's her money or her property

right? 

            

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well --

  

 

 

9 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I think that's the 

    

   

 

 

 

U.S.'s position and your adversary's, which is, if, as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

result of the original settlement divorce decree, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

became her property, what right did he have any -- to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take any action that would remove that property or take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it away from her? 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, I think the question 

   

  

 

 

 

is what is her property right.  And you're right.  If --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you define her property right as one half of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

total retirement pay, regardless of whether a waiver has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurred, then yes, under that conception of that being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

her property right, in fact, Petitioner would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

converted part of her property right. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But the point is the Federal statute, what I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it's saying is it doesn't allow the State courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to define the community property right that way.  What 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's saying is the definition of the community property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right is the total amount of the retirement pay minus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the waived portion. 

 

 

            

And so if the State court -- and, in fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's actually what the State court did in the -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Petitioner appendix pages 12a and 13a.  I mean, what 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's saying is that Respondent's property right was half

it's just inescapable that what happened in this case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was just a flat-out division of Petitioner's waived 

   

 

 

 

 

 

retirement pay.  And so that's why we view this as just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a direct conflict with Federal law. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I don't think the Court even needs to get to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implied peremption and purposes and objectives.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think this is just doing what -- the -- the thing that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal law says that State courts can't do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about them saying we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

divided the property based on a certain expectation that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the wife would have so much, and now, because the amount 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is lower, then the divorce decree should be reopened so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we can give her more of another asset to make up for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what she's missing. 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So I think that reopening 

   

  

 

 

 

the decree to just give her another asset would be --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is essentially what happened in this case -- would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be preempted by Federal law. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, we're not saying Federal law preempts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the situation where State court says:  Okay, when we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find as a matter of State law that the ex-spouse just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

didn't understand what she was signing, there's some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of mutual mistake. 

 

 

 

11 

            

So if -- the reopening of the decree would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not be preempted.  In that case, if the parties just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reached a new settlement, that would be okay, or if the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divorce court entered a new decree that complied with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal law, that would be okay too. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What would be 

  

 

 

 

noncomplying with Federal law if you reopened the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divorce decree and the judge says now you get a share --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a larger share of some other property? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, I think that that 

   

  

 

 

 

would essentially render Mansell a -- a dead letter 

   

   

 

 

 

 

because, you know, just returning to the pre-divorce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context, the effects of Mansell where the waiver 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened before the divorce, it seems to me that if a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divorce court just said, I'm going to raise the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable share by the exact amount of the waiver 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because I just don't agree with Mansell and I want to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

nullify it, I mean, that would just directly conflict 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the whole point of Mansell's holding, which is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the waiver of the retirement pay lowers the amount of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divisible property. 

 

            

I'd also hasten to add that that -- that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not what happened here.  Arizona is not an equitable

division State.  I think the Court was saying that all 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

the assets have to be divided 50/50 and just defined the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant asset subject to division as the total amount 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Military Retirement Pay, which I think is just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary to the Federal definition. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But could a court say, well, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

in light of the fact that the woman is not getting the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

usual community property division, that that factor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could -- that that could factor into the determination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of alimony or the determination of child support? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So I think it actually 

   

  

 

 

 

could, yes.  I think that if the situation before the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court was, you know, because of this waiver, I just -- I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't afford daycare payments for the child and I -- I'm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsible for them.  And she can come back to court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying, I need child support, that's a need-based issue, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

it's not a property division, then yes.  This -- the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saving clause of this statute carves out child support 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and alimony orders from the preemptive force. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I think that, as long as the court is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applying child support and alimony standards, which are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on need, it's based on -- they're usually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

temporary until the child becomes the age of majority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or, you know, the wife gets back -- or the husband gets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back on his or her feet.  So as long as the court is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

actually applying the alimony and child support 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

standards, we actually don't read this statute to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impinge on a State court's authority at all.  That's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

just not what's happened in this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, as I pointed out, 

   

  

 

 

 

those are different animals then that -- the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property belongs to her, alimony and child support. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And alimony, suppose she remarries.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

ends, right? 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Correct.  Yes. 

  

  

 

            

I'd like to just turn for a moment as to why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we feel our -- our position makes sense, because we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

framed our second argument in our brief as ensuring the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of the veteran keep all of his disability pay, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both in form and in substance. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think it makes sense that Congress would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have wanted veterans to keep all their disability pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the obvious reason that it's the veteran who's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disabled.  And the point of the disability pay is to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substitute for income that the veteran can't earn 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because of his or her disability.  That's how it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defined.  You get a disability rating if you have a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reduced income potential.  And so I think that this --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it makes perfect sense.  I think everyone agrees that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the veteran should keep the disability pay.

The reason this dispute has come up is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

Congress has made this decision to cut a veteran's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

pension or to force a veteran to waive a portion of his 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own pension, which has already been earned, if he also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

becomes disabled and accepts the disability pay.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's a pretty harsh judgment that Congress made, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

essentially, to protect the public fisc, but that's what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress did. 

 

            

So I think that what the statute is doing is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying if the veteran is forced to do that, then the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

veteran and the ex-spouse will both have their amounts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reduced by an equal amount; in other words, what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divisible is just going to be the residual share.  So I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that's what this statute is doing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And then if you frame it that way, I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it makes perfect sense to treat the pre-divorce scenario 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the post-divorce scenario as parallel.  Because I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think that the goal of protecting disability pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really has anything to do with the timing of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability relative to the divorce.  In other words, if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have two disabled veterans and they're both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divorced, I think that their interest in keeping their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability pay is the same, even if one of them happened 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to become disabled the year before his divorce and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other one happened to become disabled the year

afterwards.  So I think that, you know, framed in those 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

terms, I think the -- the purpose of arguments don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguish between the pre-divorce and the post-divorce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scenario. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The problem is, really, 

  

 

 

 

 

that when people are getting divorced and they already 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know they can't divide up the disability pay, that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts have a full picture and can then determine 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

alimony and child custody with those factors in mind. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And we presume that, at the time of their divorce, this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

woman was relying on a certain amount of income that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be fixed for the rest of her life, and she planned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

her life around that income.  And he has now taken an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

act independent of her and not just reducing her income, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but with her reduction of income, he's also getting a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tax benefit.  So he's getting, you know, whatever, 20 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent, a third more than she is by this unilateral 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

act. 

            

In terms of policy, that is a substantially 

   

 

 

 

 

 

different impact --

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and one that, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

know, the government is taking the position that if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're doing this post-divorce, you're changing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nature of the policy. 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

16 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I -- I think that all we're 

    

   

 

 

 

 

asking for is for parallel treatment in the pre-divorce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context and the post-divorce context. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  But what I'm saying 

  

  

 

 

 

 

to you, as a matter of policy, is that right? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, I think --

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't -- I mean, I 

    

   

 

 

 

don't know the answer legally, but is -- there is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference in terms of what Congress might have expected 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or not expected. 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, first of all, it's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

really clear to me that the policy interests are so much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stronger post-divorce than pre-divorce.  They're 

  

 

 

 

different, but I'm not sure they're stronger.  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's certainly a lot of equitable arguments in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

pre-divorce context.  I mean, these are typically 

    

 

 

 

 

spouses from longer marriages who often relied on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability pay during the marriage.  They may have, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, quit their job to care for their veteran spouse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who's disabled. 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Sure.  But that goes to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the issues of alimony and -- and child support.  Those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will get made up there. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, then, that -- they may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

get made up in alimony and child support, but there's --

you know, the deprivation of property in that case has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's own harshness. 

 

 

            

            

Now, I think there's a difference --

   

   

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the point is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

divorce court will know if he's already getting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability pay, then her share of the pension will be so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much less.  And with that knowledge, the divorce court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can say, so I'm going to give her more of some other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property. 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So I don't think the divorce 

   

  

 

 

 

 

court can do that in that context because then Mansell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be essentially a dead letter.  In other words, if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the divorce court said, well, you know, this -- this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person waived his retirement pay and, you know, I don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like that and so -- you know, I don't agree with the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mansell rule, so I'm just going to increase the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable share to just balance out the waiver --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well --

  

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  -- we think they don't have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

--

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The judge doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

have to say that. 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, I mean -- I mean --

   

   

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right?  I mean, the 

    

  

 

 

 

alimony -- they're all -- there's not a set number that

this has to be.  And it seems to me that it -- it would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

be a situation where we're certainly going to take into 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account the whole picture.  And I think it would be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps unreasonable for the judge to say, well, I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to look at everything in figuring out the amount 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of alimony, but I'm not going to look at the fact that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he's getting, you know, disability pay. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  That may be.  And so if a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court could do that before the decree, we also think the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court can do that after the decree.  All we're saying is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that before the decree, the court couldn't just adjust 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollar for dollar to compensate for the waiver, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that would essentially overrule Mansell.  And if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court can't do that before the decree, we're just asking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for parallel treatment after the decree. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But sorry to come back to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this, Mr. Unikowski, but you are making a distinction, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

right, that the court can take into account this rule

can't take into account this rule when distributing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other kinds of property; is that right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Right.  Distributing 

  

  

 

property, yes.  I mean, alimony and child support --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right.  You're making a 

  

  

 

 

 

distinction between need-based payments and property 

 

 

 

 

 

division. 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yes.  That is the 

  

  

 

 

 

distinction, yes. 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and this rule can be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken into account in the former, but not in the latter. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Right.  And that's the same 

  

  

 

 

 

 

pre- and post-divorce.  We're just drawing no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

distinction between the original decree and the

If there's no further questions, I'll

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES W. WIRKEN 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WIRKEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The authority granted to the States by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Former Spouses Protection Act to treat -- to treat 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marital -- to treat Military Retirement Pay as property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and divide it necessarily operates at the time of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divorce.  The text of the Act, its primary purpose to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

protect the former spouse, and the practical realities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

of divorce make the time of divorce paramount.  That is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when family courts must determine the extent of all of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the marital property, divide that property, and also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coordinate the multiple moving parts of a divorce, which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

include spousal maintenance, which is often intertwined 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the division of property. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, the authority to divide Military 

 

 

 

 

 

Retirement Pay is limited only by the Act's exclusion of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amounts of retirement pay that are then being deducted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the result of a previous waiver to receive disability 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits.  And whether that division at the time of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divorce occurs before the member's retirement, as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute expressly allows, and, therefore, before any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waiver has occurred, or the division occurs after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retirement, the State law consequences of the property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

division must follow along. 

 

 

 

            

And those consequences can include the fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the -- in -- in a particular State that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retirement pay awarded to a spouse is considered to be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that spouse's vested property.  And also, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

consequential right of the State to formulate remedies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to protect and affect that property right, to compensate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for any damage that might be done to that property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest.

And another consequence I -- that I think 

   

   

 

 

 

21 

has come up here today is -- is that of the finality of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the divorce decree and whether the State court has the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ability to go back and modify -- after a waiver of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retirement pay in favor of disability pay, to go back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and modify a division of property.  I think --

    

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What --

  

 

 

 

MR. WIRKEN:  I --

    

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is the general 

  

 

 

 

 

 

answer to that?  I mean, it -- I gather there's a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction between the finality of division of -- with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to property, as opposed to some other -- as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposed to cash, I guess, or -- or income.  Is -- is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there that difference? 

 

 

            

MR. WIRKEN:  I think the -- I think the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

general answer, Your Honor, is that the a decree 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

dividing -- to the extent it divides property is final. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And for good reason.  And in Arizona, certainly when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is a settlement agreement, as there was here, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it then becomes incorporated into the divorce decree, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's impossible, I would say, to go back and modify the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

division of property. 

 

 

            

You know, one of the objectives of family 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law courts is to achieve finality and -- and not have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

folks coming back in the future.  Certainly, child

support and spousal maintenance can be exceptions, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there has to be a substantial and continuing change of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances in order to justify revisiting, reopening, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modifying child support or spousal maintenance. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But property division is -- is thought to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set in stone.  At the time of divorce, the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spouses are splitting the sheets and the Court must 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine how many sheets there are and how big they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and decide who gets what.  And what that is -- what is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided at that point in time is what they have going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward.  And neither one can do anything to affect what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was -- that community property that was divided and then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

becomes now the separate property of each of those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spouses. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So suppose the only asset 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is the pension.  Then would the family court's order 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here be permissible? 

 

 

            

MR. WIRKEN:  I'm sorry.  Supposing that the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

retirement is the only asset?

indemnity, to create a remedy here, of course.  Whether 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

it's the only asset or not, it's certainly in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical -- because her community property interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has been transformed into her separate property interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then unilaterally damaged by the actions of her 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ex-husband. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, how do you deal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with your adversary's position that her borrowing from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our prior case that the only reasonable expectation that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court or she could have had was that his military 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay was always subject to a potential deduction for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability pay?  That's basically his argument, that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

act tells anyone relying on military pay that it can, as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a matter of law, be changed by a disability award. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

because --

 

            

MR. WIRKEN:  I disagree with my friend, 

    

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know you do.  The 

    

  

 

 

 

question is how and why. 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. WIRKEN:  Well -- well, Congress gave the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

States the right to treat this kind of property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

according to State law.  And, therefore, you know, going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

along with that, when -- in a community property State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or in any State, whatever the property scheme may be, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court gets to divide what was then before the Court.

And in -- in this situation, there had been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

no waiver whatsoever, and so the Court is looking at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making a -- looking at the big picture, has -- as a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple of you have referenced, they -- they're looking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at all of the assets in making -- and, by the way, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an equitable division in Arizona.  It's not an even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

division, as in California and other community property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State.  And the Court is doing what is equitable in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to balance the division of property among them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Once having done that, the die is -- is --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is cast.  It is set in stone and the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose it turns out that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in time one, we enter a divorce decree.  The divorce 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

decree says and in addition, you're going to get half of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what Uncle Joe gives Sam, the husband.  By that time, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

turns out to be -- I mean, from the beginning, Uncle Joe 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leaves property in a form that it's illegal to give to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the woman.  I can imagine cases. 

    

 

 

 

              

I mean, can the State give money that later 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on it turns out that it was absolutely illegal to give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that person that money?  I don't know how that works.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be very surprised if res judicata in divorce cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says:  Okay, I'm sorry, we have a decree here, and then 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're going to violate Federal law because the decree 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violates Federal law, as it turns out.

MR. WIRKEN:  Well, as I understand your 

   

  

 

 

 

hypothetical --

 

25 

            

            

court --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe it's too complicated. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. WIRKEN:  You're talking about a State 

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm saying there's a 

  

 

 

 

 

Federal law here, and the Federal law says:  I'm very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorry, you cannot give this money to the spouse, for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good reason or bad, perhaps bad.  But it says you can't. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And is the fact that you gave that money to the spouse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ahead of time, why does that matter?  That's his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument. 

            

MR. WIRKEN:  And there are two things going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on here, and -- and one of them is at the time of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divorce and many divorces, there is no disability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit --

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, there is. 

  

 

 

 

MR. WIRKEN:  -- paid. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  There is a disability.  The 

   

  

  

 

 

disability is that if it turns out that what you are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving over time is money that was turned in to get the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability, it is illegal for you to do it.  Now, that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's there at the time of the decree. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WIRKEN:  No.  The -- the -- what is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

illegal is the division of retirement pay that has

already been waived to receive disability --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  That's not what it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

26 

says in the statute.  It says in the statute that it is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illegal to treat disposable retired pay as property of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the member and his spouse.  That is what is now legal. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's legal; right?  With an exception. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

The exception is the result of a waiver of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

retired pay.  That, you can't do.  So you can't do it on 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day 1; you can't do it day 20; you can't do it day 30. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And what they are saying is a well-known property 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest.  It is an interest that you do not get till 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day 40.  But you can't divide it on day 1.  Just like 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a -- like, you know, they're used to be these 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property interests that you received on a contingency. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WIRKEN:  The statute in Subsection D(1) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in the last sentence contemplates the division of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

military retirement pay even before the service member 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has retired, and, therefore, before there could have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been any waiver and any disability benefits taken. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true.  So it's given 

  

  

 

 

 

 

to her, but it's subject under Federal law to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contingency.  We used to have our first-year property 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

class filled with this kind of stuff.  I mean, you know, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody would get a horse, but he'd only get the horse 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the contingency that Uncle Joe died, which doesn't

states --

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I know. 

    

 

MR. WIRKEN:  -- to divide the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

retirement pay, according to State law, at the time of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the divorce.  And if at that time there is no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability -- the retirement pay hasn't been waived, no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability benefits are being claimed, they aren't being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divided. 

            

What's being divided, and necessarily so, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the expectation of this retirement, and -- and for good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason, because all these moving parts have to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somehow balanced equitably between these spouses.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

State court gets to say:  You get 50 percent or you get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

X dollar amount or you get X percentage.  And it doesn't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to be fifty-fifty.  But whatever it is, the State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court decides that, in its wisdom at that moment in

time, as a -- only a State court can do best. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why isn't your solution, 

  

 

 

 

 

and I think you're saying when he elects the disability, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when -- when he does that, then the State court can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide an indemnification for her that's equal to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount that she's losing.  But isn't that just an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end-run around the Mansell decision?  The Mansell 

  

 

 

 

 

 

decision says --

 

 

            

            

            

MR. WIRKEN:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why not? 

  

 

 

MR. WIRKEN:  Because it's not a -- it's not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

a division of any disability pay.  There's not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistribution of property being made. 

 

 

 

 

            

This decree divided the military retirement 

 

 

 

 

 

pay 50/50, and that part of this decree was never 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changed when the court issued its remedy order to -- for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Miss -- for the benefit of Mrs. Howell.  The 50/50 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

division still remained, but that 50 percent had become 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worth less, and by the unilateral action of the husband, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so he was ordered to make a make-up payment to her to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reimburse her for her loss.  It really wasn't a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modification of the decree at all by the way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

that's --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well -- well, 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. WIRKEN:  It -- it was an enforcement.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maybe this isn't 

  

 

 

 

 

29 

that, but that -- that's very legalistic in the sense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you're saying well, you can't divide this, but you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to pay her money so that's she's put in the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position as if you'd divided this. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Is that your suggestion? 

 

 

 

MR. WIRKEN:  Well, no.  I -- I understand 

    

   

  

 

 

the -- the parallel that my colleague draws and that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggest in your question, but they -- it's not a legal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equivalent.  It practically -- there's no way to escape 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fact that it's dollar for dollar because it wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make any sense to --

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if I were --

   

  

 

 

 

 

MR. WIRKEN:  -- remedy for a lesser or 

   

  

 

 

 

 

greater amount than what she lost. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If I were a 

   

  

 

 

 

legislator and I passed this law for a particular 

   

   

 

 

 

 

purpose, and at the end of the day the result is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same as if the law hadn't had any -- it has no practical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect at all, I would think that's contrary to -- to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the legislation was designed to accomplish. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WIRKEN:  But you as a legislature 

   

  

 

 

 

sitting across the street adopted this to protect that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spouse and to enable States to divide the retirement pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as property according to State law at the time of the

divorce.  And --

  

 

30 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then maybe I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the one who insisted on the part of the law that says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it's disability, you don't get to divide that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WIRKEN:  If it has already been waived, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it cannot be divided.  But here, when she divorced, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had not been waived.  There is no disability to divide, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and none was divided. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think we should not lose sight of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact that these parties made an agreement.  This wasn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that was litigated and adjudicated.  It was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the product of a settlement agreement and implicit in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that agreement is a covenant of good faith and fair 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealing, and that one will not do anything in -- in his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion to injure the contract benefits of the -- of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other, the wife.  And yet he unilaterally chose, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voluntarily chose, to apply for disability benefits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But when -- when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

did -- the disability benefits started how many years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after the divorce? 

 

 

            

            

MR. WIRKEN:  13 or 14, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then I mean, I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think it's -- it's not like there was a bait and switch 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved. 

            

MR. WIRKEN:  Not suggesting that.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

the -- whenever it was, the agreement goes on far longer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31 

than that.  And as I think was suggested in your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

colleague's question, Justice Sotomayor, that there was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an expectation that this wife had and it was basically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rooted in that settlement agreement that they made. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So -- and certainly, Mansell doesn't preempt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the right of spouses to -- to make agreements for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

division of their community property.  It may prohibit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an agreement for the division of retirement pay that has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already been waived to receive disability benefits, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much is clear, but that is the extent of the preemption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or prohibition in Mansell. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the -- the agreement, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the court's order I know required him to pay a certain 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount.  It -- it took care of the Laches question. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What happens moving forward?  The military pays her 50 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent minus the disability pay and he has to pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separately the difference? 

 

 

            

            

MR. WIRKEN:  Exactly.  And -- and what is --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where he gets it from it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't matter? 

 

            

MR. WIRKEN:  And where -- where he gets it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from, he -- you know, he has his share of the military 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retirement pay and it can legitimately come from that.

know. 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you said he could pay 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

her this amount, this indemnification out of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability --

 

            

MR. WIRKEN:  He -- no, he can pay it out of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his share of the military retirement pay.  His -- let's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say that, you know, he was getting -- when they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divorced, it was all military retirement, a hundred 

   

 

 

 

 

 

percent, and let's say it gets reduced by 20 percent by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

virtue of his disability rating, so he still has 40 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent, as does she, of the original retirement pay. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He -- he can pay her out of his 40 percent of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retirement pay.  He can also pay her out of other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assets.  He is -- he is not directed to pay her out of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability benefits.  And -- and this is not a situation 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the record reflects that he has no other assets. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And -- and indeed, he -- he has his share of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retirement pay.

I -- I think it -- it's key that Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

gave the States the right to divide retirement pay at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

the time of divorce according to respective State law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that when that happens, the divided interests are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vested in each of the parties, and this order to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indemnify does -- does not violate the Act.  It does not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempt State law.  It does not effectively divide 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability benefits.  And to a point raised by my 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

colleague, the order is -- is not one that modified the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decree at all.  It was an enforcement order. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, I know you might say that the Arizona 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme Court characterized it as a modification.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

court did so for a different reason.  It was deciding 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether a State statute regarding modification applied. 

   

 

 

 

 

It determined that it did not, but it first determined 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there was a modification because there was no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

indemnification provision in the decree. 

 

 

 

 

            

But for purposes of this Act, a modified 

   

 

 

 

 

 

decree is defined in the definitions as a -- a court 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

order that affects a division of property.  There was no 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

division of property affected by the indemnification 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order.  It was, instead, in the nature of an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement.  In fact, the Arizona Supreme Court at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

least twice refers to it as a reimbursement order or an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indemnification order or a make-up payment.  It was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

enforcing.  It never changed anything in the original 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

divorce decree.  So it was not a modification for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

purposes of the Act. 

 

 

 

            

What should the rule be?  Given the concern 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

of Congress for former spouses, Congress could not have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended to allow a service member to -- to obtain a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divorce, divide the MRP, and then apply for disability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits and waive MRP and leave the former spouse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without a State court --

   

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's --

  

 

 

 

 

concern for former spouses is certainly evident in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act, but as we've always said, no statute pursues its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose at all costs, and with obviously a different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose applicable with respect to the part of the law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that says you can't divide disability payments.  So I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think you can resort to the purpose of the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in -- in a general sense to -- to resolve every 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsidiary legal issue. 

 

 

            

MR. WIRKEN:  But the primary purpose, 

  

 

 

 

 

according to Congress, was to protect the -- the spouse. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah.  And it's 

  

  

 

 

 

subsidiary purpose was to do so in a way that preserved 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability payments and didn't allow them to be divided. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WIRKEN:  To be divided.  But -- and I --

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

this is, again, a situation, a case in which there were

no disability benefits to divide at the time of divorce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when her property rights were vested in her. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So this Court should therefore hold that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

division of Military Retirement Pay is determined 

 

 

 

 

 

 

according to State law at the time of divorce and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an order remedying damage to such a share is not

Honor has about what the effect of Mansell is under the

to give a -- a relief to spouses after a post-divorce 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

indemnification affects the already separated share of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the wife, and it still -- the rule of Mansell and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Spouses' Protection Act still retains its effect because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the subsequent waiver shrinks the pie that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available for the remedy, but it doesn't change or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dictate what division the State court had to take either

former spouse.  So we take a broader view of the State 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36 

courts' ability to respond to changes in circumstance, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether that change be because of a waiver of -- waiver 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of disability benefits or any other reason.  And that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Act's primary function is to leave to State law the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ability to equitably divide these assets in the first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Explain this.  I'll have an 

  

  

 

 

 

 

easier time if you can explain it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What the decree says is 50 percent of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retirement goes to the husband and 50 percent to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wife.  It doesn't say what the retirement is. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Suppose that -- that ten years later, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government raises the retirement.  Does the wife get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

more? 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  So, your Honor, I believe, 

   

  

 

 

 

under your Honor's hypothetical, the answer is yes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Yes.  Yes. 

  

  

  

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Yes, but it is up to a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State court to determine --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  State court says yes. 

  

 

 

 

 

Okay. 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  Now, second thing

is, unfortunately, Congress lowers the amount.  Does the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

37 

half go down to the wife too? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  So, once again, under -- it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

depends on State law. So --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It depends on State law. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

In other words -- in other words, if you say that 50 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent goes to the wife, 50 percent goes to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

husband, and you cut it, then more than 50 percent will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go to the wife. 

 

 

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  That's right, because -- so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

let me be clear of what we think the role of the Spousal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Protection Act is. 

 

 

            

The Spousal Protection Act instructs State 

 

 

 

 

 

courts how to calculate the disposable retired pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available for division, and otherwise puts disposable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retired pay on equal footing at any other civilian asset 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so that it allows the State court to treat the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disposable retirement pay as any other marital property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a variety of ways. 

   

 

 

            

One is it can equitably divide those assets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in any way it sees fit, from zero to one hundred 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose the statute, it 

  

 

 

 

 

said, following Mansell, that the wife cannot have more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than 50 percent of the actual after tax income from

retirement.  Then can the State do it? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

retirement. 

            

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  The after tax income from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah. 

  

 

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, I think that the 

   

  

 

 

 

state could do, in terms of a remedy, is all they could 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divide is the --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'll tell you what. 

  

 

 

 

 

There's a statute, a federal statute, says if taxes go 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

up, or if the payments are reduced for retirement, under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no circumstances can the wife obtain more than the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reduced -- half the reduced payment. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Right.  So if they could --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And then can the State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

court do something about that? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  It couldn't if it limited 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it to any other sources of income. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

it. 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not keeping that out of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm saying can the State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

just say, well, we don't care.  There is a state statute 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which says that we have to keep the wife's share at no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more than 50 percent.  But let's forget about that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's a federal statute to that effect.  We'll have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

our State law.  Can't do that, can it? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  If I understand your 

   

  

 

 

Honor's question, which is that there's only military 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retirement pay, and the question is can the wife get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

more than 50 percent share of it --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

says no. 

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  In a state statute that 

   

  

 

 

 

MS. EISENSTEIN:  The answer is no. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Right. 

  

 

MS. EISENSTEIN:  And that would be --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So if that says no, then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

why, if it goes down because of the choice of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

husband, who is protected in this choice by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception, why is that different. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  It's different because 

  

 

 

 

there are other assets besides the military -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability benefits used to satisfy the indemnification 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order in this case, and so there's a very --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that the only 

  

 

 

 

 

difference? 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  I think that's a 

    

 

 

 

significant difference. 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  That's the only 

  

  

 

 

 

 

difference.  So in other words, if it says, no, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot give the wife more than 50 percent of the

pension, then what they could do is have the decree, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

it says the wife gets 50 percent, gets -- sorry -- you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't -- you cannot give them more than 50 percent --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm getting mixed up in my thing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It says you can't give more than 50 percent, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then there's a statute says you can't give -- you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't give 60 percent, but the judge says, here's what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'll do:  I'll give you 50 percent from this, and I'd 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like to give you more than 60 percent so I'm going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take 10 percent from something else. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, I think that the 

   

  

 

 

 

economic equivalent is not the only test, and that's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test that Petitioner wants this court to adopt.  I think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court needs to look at the legal basis for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

award. 

            

And as the discussion highlighted earlier, 

 

 

 

 

 

there are many economically equivalent ways that a court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

can reach the same division of property and total 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial transfer from one party to the other, some of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which are legal under this federal law and some of which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are not. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It seems to me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that -- in other words, you're saying -- you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically saying there's no real substance to this law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All the court has to do is find some charade to get to

the same result. 

 

 

41 

              

I mean, would it be all right under your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view if they say, okay, you get 50 percent of -- all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- no disability payments yet.  You get 50 percent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the retirement pay.  Listen to me.  But in the event 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there is disability pay -- there are disability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payments that result in a reduction of the military pay, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I appreciate that I cannot divide the disability pay, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

but your share of the retirement pay is going to go up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as if we were dividing the disability pay.  Is that good 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or bad? 

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well -- well, your Honor, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it -- it is -- it is okay to the extent that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court is applying its generally applicable principles of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property division to treat the portion that is available 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under federal law --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The court wants to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

make sure that the spouse, whether wife or husband, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receives half of the military retirement pay, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- and going forward.  So she does -- he or she 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does exactly what I set forth; says, okay, you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to half.  But if there's disability pay, you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to an additional amount exactly equal to half 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the disability pay. 

 

 

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, yes.  I think the 

    

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

statute expressly contemplates fixed sum awards.  And so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

the -- the --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you have a law 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that says -- you have a law that says you can't divide 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability pay, and yet, you say it's okay to say, well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm not going to divide it, but I'm just going to award 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you an amount equal to what it would be if I divided it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, let me be clear. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's the sort of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

thing that gives, you know, law a bad name.  It's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just --

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It makes a charade 

   

  

 

 

 

out of the statute. 

 

 

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, your Honor, I 

  

 

 

 

 

respectfully submit that State courts have a lot of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

experience in treating differently separate property, 

 

 

 

 

 

marital property, separate income, property interest. 

 

 

 

 

 

That is the kind of bread and butter that State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts -- those kind of distinctions are the bread and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

butter that State courts apply their own state law to. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And so this Act --

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What does -- what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

does that have to do with my question? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  So the question is, your

Alderson Reporting Company

Honor, in terms of the ability -- your Honor was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43 

concerned that the State order could be a sham.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

State courts are in the practice of treating as --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defining and treating as what is the quantum of marital 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property and fairly applying those State rules. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So what the Spousal Protection Act does is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it throws to the State court the broad authority to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treat disposable retirement pay as marital property, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

along with all of the civil assets.  Having made that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

division and giving that broad authority to divide the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property, presumably it comes with the ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforce that division.  And the spouse's now separate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

property interests are presumably given the bundle of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights that the State would normally give to protect it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And assuming --

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but again, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

law does something else too.  It says you cannot divide 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability payments. 

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Right.  So that takes the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

pie that can be divided and shrinks it.  It doesn't tell 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State courts how to allocate that benefit.  And so when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it comes to considering the role that disability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits play, we propose the rule should be that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability benefits cannot be treated under the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law as divisible property.  But it can be a

consideration.  And most State courts, under the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

equitable division schemes, consider the separate --

 

 

 

 

 

 

44 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You know States --

  

 

 

 

 

 

consideration.  You say it can be divided, just in a way 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the law prohibits, so long as we don't say it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divided.  So we take half of it and add it to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required military pay. 

 

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well -- well, your Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we don't -- I don't interpret your Honor's hypothetical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a division of property.  I interpret your Honor's 

    

   

 

 

 

 

hypothetical as getting a contingent interest in other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

property that may be available.  The work that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But money is money. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Whether it gets the additional amount from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability pay or from something else doesn't make a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference. 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, your Honor, money 

  

 

 

 

 

isn't money.  When the State court originally had the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the broad discretion to allocate anywhere from zero 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent to one hundred percent of not only the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civilian assets but the disposal retirement pay in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first place. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I think the question is can 

    

 

 

 

 

 

a State depart -- a -- a State court depart from the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule that the State court would use in dividing property

solely for the purpose of making up for the fact that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45 

the disability payment cannot be divided. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  No.  And so --

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought that's what you 

    

 

 

 

 

were saying they could do. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  No, your Honor.  I think 

    

  

 

 

 

that the court can use its broadly applicable rules for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcing existing property divisions; in this case, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Arizona rule is one that prohibits a party from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

unilaterally harming the interest of the other spouse, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and gives a makeup remedy.  But there's still important 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

protections that the Spousal Protection Act gives to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability benefits.  No matter what, the 

  

 

 

 

 

anti-attachment provision -- this isn't the Spousal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Protection Act, other federal law, which is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anti-attachment provision -- protects disability 

 

 

 

 

benefits from any kind of award to satisfy a property 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  It can be used for alimony and child support, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but it -- that -- in the event that there's only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability benefits at issue, there is no relief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Thank you.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

Justice. 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

So I actually agree that finality in divorce 

   

 

 

 

 

 

decrees is very important.  And we're not -- our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position is not trying to alter, sort of, ordinarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable rules of res judicata. 

 

 

 

 

            

But the question in this case is finality as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to what.  And we have an answer from the Arizona Supreme 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court.  The court interpreted the decree to say that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what it did was it divided Petitioner's pension, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever it was.  And that is a ruling that I think we 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to accept as this case reaches the Court; that's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state law interpretation which binds this Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so what the court held, however, is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was not going to enforce the decree as written.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was going to import a State law rule that basically says 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the relevant divisible asset was the total amount 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the retirement pay and divide that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think the court is quite clear.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

saying that it conceptualizes the property interests as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the total amount of money that Petitioner was receiving, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it said that by waiving retirement pay, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner converted a portion of respondent's property. 

   

 

 

 

 

And so it's saying that Respondent holds a property

interest in half of that waived amount.  So that's just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same thing as treating waived retirement pay as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divisible.  And so --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How consequential is the 

  

 

 

 

 

47 

issue before us?  Because if you're right, then in all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

future divorce settlements, they won't say half of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Military Retirement Pay.  They'll give a dollar amount 

   

  

 

 

 

 

which is equal to what the Military Retirement Pay is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before any disability payment kicks in. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, that might be 

  

 

 

 

 

negotiated for consideration.  I mean, there's actually 

    

 

 

 

 

a lot of reported cases in which --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What consideration?  I 

  

  

 

 

mean, being aware of this possible diminution, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer for the -- for the spouse will say, I don't want 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to get half of the MRP; I want to get a dollar amount 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's equivalent to what half of the MRP is right now. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, I mean, the veteran 

   

  

 

 

 

doesn't have to agree to that.  I mean, the settlement 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is bilateral.  And if the veteran doesn't agree, then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they'll just go to divorce court and there'll be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decree where the court, we would say, would have to just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divide the retirement pay as mandated by Congress. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, we agree that settlements are good. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And there have been many reported cases where the

veteran says, look, I'll -- I'll make you this promise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

if you agree to give me, you know, the car or whatever. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So we're not -- we're not reading this statute as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impinging on settlements. 

 

 

            

But in this case, the court held that what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the settlement was, was just dividing the pension 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever it was 50-50.  The fact that Petitioner is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required to pay this reimbursement order, it's not what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he had agreed to; it's this order imposed by State law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying that it was going to treat Respondent as holding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a property interest in half of the amount of the waived 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retirement pay, which we think is -- is what the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute prohibits. 

 

            

And in response to Justice Sotomayor's 

 

 

 

 

 

question earlier, yes, I think that the reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

expectation is that the waivers might occur.  I think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's important to recognize that waivers of retirement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay for disability are not rare or obscure.  There's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hundreds of thousands of veterans who have done just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  And I don't think it's a tremendous shock to an 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

experienced divorce lawyer that this might happen.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

so during negotiations for a divorce settlement, this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

may come up.  So I just think the idea that, you know, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no way to predict this could conceivably happen, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think, is just inconsistent with the reality of -- of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

49 

divorce litigation in military divorces. 

 

 

 

 

            

I'd like to respond to the -- the comments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- of counsel about other assets, that it's perfectly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fine to divide the accrual of disability pay as long as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are just other assets used to fund it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So first of all, I think that's quite 

   

 

 

 

 

 

contrary to this Court's decision in Hillman and several 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other cases.  I think it's both counterintuitive, and I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that the holding of those cases is that you can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do that, because just the four corners of the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hillman holding was that, you know, Federal law preempts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a statute that doesn't directly act on property, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just has property go into a bank account and then is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transferred to the other bank account, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially the same situation as here. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think it's also quite pertinent that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

what the statute says is that it's division of waived 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retirement pay that's impermissible.  And recall that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

waived retirement pay literally is not money you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting.  The definition of waived retirement pay 

  

 

 

 

 

 

literally is the money that you're not getting so you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can get disability pay.  So when we talk about dividing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waived retirement pay, what just that inherently means 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is forcing you to pay an amount from your general assets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equal to that waived retirement pay to the other spouse.

So I just think that, you know, it's not even just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50 

legalistic.  I just think the statute cannot be 

    

 

 

 

 

 

construed to permit operation on the general assets. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I just want to make one other point. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And, you know, Justice Sotomayor asked questions earlier 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about sort of the policy distinctions between pre- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

post-divorce waivers.  And we're not denying that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's no policy distinctions at all.  I mean, we can't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deny that.  Of course there are differences in policy. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I think that the interest of the disabled veteran is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same before and after.  But there are policy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinctions at stake. 

 

 

              

I think the question in this case is whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this statute can be interpreted to recognize that those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy distinctions and distinguished between those two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scenarios, and I just don't think you can't get it out 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the statutory text, which does prohibit waived 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retirement pay from being treated as divisible no matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when the waiver occurs. 

 

 

 

            

If the Court has no further questions, I'll 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rest.  Thank you.
