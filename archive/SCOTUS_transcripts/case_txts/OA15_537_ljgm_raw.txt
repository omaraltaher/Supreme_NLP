CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

and Martinez-Maldonado v. the United States.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MS. BLATT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

For three reasons, acquittals should have 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

full effect under the Double Jeopardy Clause without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regard to invalid vacated convictions. 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

First, vacated convictions are legal 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

nullities, including under the Double Jeopardy Clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Second, vacated convictions are not relevant to what a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury necessarily decided.  And third, the government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

should bear the consequences when overlapping charges 

 

 

 

 

 

 

produce split verdicts of acquittals and invalid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

convictions. 

21 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I take it from that you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

would agree that there might be cases where, under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ashe v. Swenson, there's an acquittal on one count, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction on the other count, conviction set aside, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government can retry the count that had been set aside, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

2 

on the ground that under Ashe v. Swenson the verdict on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other count was just irrelevant. 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

MS. BLATT:  That's right.  So we -- the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

defendant always has to meet the burden of just showing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the acquittal necessarily decided a fact that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

government wants to prove in a subsequent prosecution. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In this case, could it be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

argued -- was the argument before the jury on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy in the travel counts closely intertwined with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

666 so that it -- you can't say the jury decided most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likely on some issue that's irrelevant to 666? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BLATT:  Right.  The only issue -- the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

only issue that was in dispute was whether there was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bribe.  There's no dispute that to get to Las Vegas from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto Rico, you have to travel.  There was no dispute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they agreed to go to a boxing match together.  So 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the only dispute at all was whether there was a bribe. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so when the jury acquitted on conspiracy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and travel to commit Program Section 666, bribery, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily decided there was no bribery. 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

Now, the Court of Appeals did not hold that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

It was just Petitioners' argument throughout the case, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point that the government just never disputed, a point 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the government never disputed in its brief in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposition, and a point that the government never 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

5 

1 

disputed in its brief on the merits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Blatt -- but if we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

trying to figure out what this jury found, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're not what talking about claim preclusion.  Claim 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

preclusion -- there can never be a new trial on the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

travel or the conspiracy.  But we're talking about issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

preclusion. 

8 

            

And this jury, we don't know what it decided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

because of the inconsistency.  It said yes to bribery on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one; no to bribery on the other.  And it might have just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided that conviction of the predicate offense, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bribery, was enough, and that the government had laid it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on too strong by adding the conspiracy and the travel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

count. 

15 

            

16 

decided? 

17 

            

How do we know that's not what the jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MS. BLATT:  Well, we know, just looking at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

the acquittals alone, that we know what they decided. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So the question is -- and it's, I think, under Yeager 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and under the Double Jeopardy Clause -- is this Court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the first time in the history of its jurisprudence, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to give any meaning to or relevance to an invalid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

conviction? 

24 

            

You have never held an invalid conviction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

was relevant to or evidence of anything, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

6 

Justice Ginsburg, and let me just suggest the last place 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you should start is the Double Jeopardy Clause, where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illegal, invalid, vacated convictions always been legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

nullities. 

5 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Blatt, it does seem to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

me that's what your argument rests on in the end:  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

idea that we shouldn't give any weight or any influence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to an invalid conviction.  Is that a double jeopardy 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

principle, or does it come from someplace else? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MS. BLATT:  Both.  So we have our main -- I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

would call it our legal argument, is just that vacated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions are legal nullities, void ab initio.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretend that they just don't exist. 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

15 

that? 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  Well, why do we do 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

              

I mean, I take it you have -- you know, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

usually you do pretend that they don't exist.  There are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not many instances that we can find where we do look to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vacated convictions for something or other.  But in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, the vacated conviction surely does tell us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something about what the jury did do or what the jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't do.  It's part of the factual picture, and so the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question has to be, well, notwithstanding that, why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't we look at it?  And I guess the -- why? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BLATT:  Right.  Well, so, again, there's

the legal argument, which I do want to get back to, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the factual argument, in Yeager, it was never 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disputed, and it was beyond obvious that a jury that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquits cannot rationally hang.  There is this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

historical fact, and the dissent was all up in arms that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury decisions were completely inconsistent.  And it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was at least relevant under 401 that the jury, if it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to acquit, it could not have hung. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the Court said, I think, three things. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

But the most -- and I think as a factual matter, you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't know what a jury decides when there's an illegal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction.  Just like a hung count, which a jury 

   

   

  

 

 

 

doesn't decide anything in a hung count.  That's what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the Court said in Yeager. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You know, I think you're 

   

  

 

 

 

contesting the premise of my question.  Because the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

premise of my question is that this vacated conviction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does tell you something about what the jury did.  Now 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what it tells you is that the jury did inconsistent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things, because the vacated conviction tells you that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the one hand, the valid convictions, the jury said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there was not bribery.  And on the other hand, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vacated conviction, the jury said there was bribery. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And let's assume for the moment that that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true, that that is exactly what the vacated convictions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

8 

1 

tell you.  They tell you that the jury went in two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

inconsistent ways. 

 

3 

            

4 

            

MS. BLATT:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And now you're saying, 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

notwithstanding that the vacated conviction tells you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something about what the jury did or didn't do about how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury reasoned, we shouldn't look at it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

And there's something very powerful, 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

rhetorically, in your statement.  But I guess what I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

trying to figure out:  Is it anything more than 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rhetoric?  Is --

  

 

12 

            

13 

            

MS. BLATT:  Yeah, let me --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- there, like, a legal 

   

  

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

principle here about why we shouldn't look to vacated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions to tell us something about the facts, when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they can tell us something about the facts? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

MS. BLATT:  Sure.  Let me prove it to you. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

I mean, I'm happy to prove it, that the only reason you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vacate a conviction is because the conviction is a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

worthless piece of paper and unreliable.  And at looking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how an error inversely affects acquittals and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions proves the point.  Because whereas errors 

  

 

 

 

 

 

render the conviction completely worthless and 

 

 

 

 

 

unreliable, an error in the face of an acquittal has the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposite effect of making the acquittal all that more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

9 

1 

meaningful, reliable, and worthy of respect. 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm not sure that really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

answers the question.  Because the vacated conviction 

  

 

 

 

 

 

may be worthless for a reason that is irrelevant to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point that Justice Kagan was making, which seems to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the situation here.  It's -- it's a wrongful conviction 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

because an element was missing, but that doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undermine the argument that the two verdicts were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

inconsistent.

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MS. BLATT:  So the reason why Yeager -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, Yeager said -- I don't think any dispute, and this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the government's whole argument.  Yeager, all that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mattered was there was no jury decision.  And the only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason why you care about jury decisions --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the Yeager case 

  

 

 

 

 

was -- the jury didn't reach any decision.  Here, your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury did reach a decision.  The decision was vacated 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

because, in the court's view, the charge was erroneous. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

By the way, that's not -- it's not clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the charge was erroneous, is it?  There's a split 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on that issue. 

 

 

            

MS. BLATT:  It's clear as it comes to this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court, but I think, you know, I'd have to go back and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read Sun Diamond, which is --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The question is --

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

10 

MS. BLATT:  Is whether to quid pro quo. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it quid pro quo, or is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

            

3 

it gratuity as well?  As I understand it, there's a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

circuit split. 

 

5 

            

MS. BLATT:  Right.  And the government's 

  

  

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

position is, if the court had directed a verdict and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, you must find guilty, and the jury both acquit and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convict, you still have a piece of relevant information 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the jury acted inconsistency -- inconsistently. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

And what I'm trying to say about a jury 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

verdict is that it doesn't count in our legal system 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless it's imbued with finality and validity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But why is that true 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

when you can have a set-aside of the verdict that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent of the jury charge?  You can have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation, like in the State of Michigan, where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction was set aside because the defendant was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deprived of his right to proceed pro se.  There, there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still a complete inconsistency between the acquittal and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the conviction.  The set-aside had nothing to do with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the nature of the charge.  Why would you say in that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation we should be ignoring --

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

MS. BLATT:  So I think for errors like 

   

  

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

Feretta and Gonzalez-Lopez, right to counsel and a few 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

other kind of nutty structural errors, where the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

11 

has never said it's prejudicial, but we're going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treat it as such, because you can't unwind the apple 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cart.  But for all other errors, including a biased 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

judge, absences of counsel, you know, a Brady violation, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a directed verdict, a reasonable doubt instruction, they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

are prejudicial.  And when a --

   

  

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But what do they have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

do to impeach the inconsistent act of the jury? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MS. BLATT:  Okay.  So what -- exactly what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

they had to do in Yeager, because then the other reason 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Yeager held that hung counts were not relevant is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because they were indecipherable.  And this part is key. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is because they are indecipherable the defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't be put to the impossible burden of reconciling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the acquittal, even though they may be reconcilable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in ways that don't undermine the acquittal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

And vacation -- vacated convictions are the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

same.  Let me explain why.  The instructional error, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

because of it, no one knows and no one can know why the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury convicted.  And therefore, the defendants should 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not be put in the impossible burden of explaining that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the consistency -- that the inconsistency is on a point 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's not relevant to the acquittals. 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

And so here's the example we gave in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

brief, is that all 12 jurors -- and the -- this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

12 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

the -- this is the point of the -- the error itself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causing the inconsistency.  All 12 jurors could have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought Petitioners were not guilty of a crime, of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quid pro quo exchange.  And the only inconsistency, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only inconsistency, is they were divided on whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was a lawful gratuity. 

   

 

 

7 

            

And so in that case, it's completely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

possible that the verdicts are consistent on the only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

relevant question. 

 

10 

            

11 

            

12 

know. 

13 

            

14 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry.  I --

    

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah, but we don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. BLATT:  Exactly. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, that's the 

    

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

whole point.  And then it -- well, exactly, except you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the burden, as I understand it, under the law, of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carrying the burden of indicating that -- a double 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

jeopardy violation.  And if you don't know, you can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carry that burden. 

 

 

20 

            

MS. BLATT:  So unlike an acquittal, this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

just Yeager all over again.  Yeager said we -- because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can't ask the jury what transpired in the courtroom, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the burden is not on the defendant to reconcile it.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know when you have a final invalid jury verdict, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Chief Justice, what the jury found.  And that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

13 

only reason that final invalid jury verdicts have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ever -- have ever counted under our system at all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Without the finality --

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't understand why 

    

 

 

 

5 

6 

you're saying we don't know why the jury convicted on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

666.  It convicted because the evidence was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

overwhelming. 

8 

            

9 

            

10 

            

MS. BLATT:  Well, it convicted on 666 --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's why it convicted. 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. BLATT:  -- on a charge that allowed it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

to convict based on completely lawful conduct.  So if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury -- the evidence could have been overwhelming. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I understand there was an 

    

 

 

 

 

14 

instructional error.  But we know why the jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

convicted. 

16 

            

17 

            

MS. BLATT:  No.  The jury could have --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because under the --

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

because under the erroneous instruction, they clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found the facts of a violation.  All of the factual 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements the government asserted were found to be true. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

MS. BLATT:  Under the wrong -- under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

something that's not a crime.  If they had charged the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury that if the defendant were wearing glasses, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committed a crime, and the jury returns a guilty 

   

   

 

 

 

 

verdict, you shouldn't care.  You can't just say, well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

14 

1 

it's a guilty verdict. 

   

 

2 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, the jury was 

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

operating under the same charge with respect to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compound crimes.  So in order to convict, it would have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had to find there was neither quid pro quo nor gratuity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's what it would have had to find, which would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent with finding --

 

 

 

8 

            

MS. BLATT:  So it's actually inverse.  To 

  

  

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

convict, all the jury had to do was find one out of two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibilities.  The jury could have convicted either if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they found a lawful gratuity or an unlawful bribe.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to acquit, Justice Ginsburg, the jury had to reject and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider all of the government's theories of criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability.  So you know the acquittals, there's no way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- there's no way to read them other than the jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquitted Petitioners of a crime. 

   

 

 

17 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the question I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

asked you before?  If we're trying to find out what this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury did, isn't it a reasonable assumption that they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted on the bribery for which there was much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence?  They thought that having the compound crimes, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the conspiracy and the travel, was just laying it on too 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thick, so they weren't going to convict on those.  Why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't that have been? 

 

 

 

25 

            

MS. BLATT:  Yeah.  I think -- I mean, it's 

    

   

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

15 

the same case in Yeager where the Court said, look, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's an apparent inconsistency.  No one questioned 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that the verdicts were irreconcilable, and that who --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

who knows? 

 

5 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that in Yeager, 

    

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

the Court said there was no -- there was no conflict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because there was no decision.  A hung jury doesn't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

decide anything. 

 

9 

            

10 

            

MS. BLATT:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This jury, we know, did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

decide something. 

 

12 

            

MS. BLATT:  We know the jury decided 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

something that is completely irrelevant.  We know the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury decided something that the law finds anathema.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know the jury found that Petitioners may have committed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawful conduct.  There is a reason why this Court has 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

never, ever, ever treated an invalid conviction of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence or -- or relevant to anything.  If the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had directed a verdict of guilty, I would just be 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

astonished if you were saying, well, we know they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted; we know they found him guilty. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under your argument, the 

  

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

trial court could instruct the jury:  If you find guilt 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on 666 and if you find that there was travel, you must 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find that there was guilt under the travel section as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

16 

1 

well.  That's what you're saying. 

  

 

 

 

2 

            

MS. BLATT:  I'm actually -- that one, I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

lost on what you're asking.  Sorry. 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you're saying in 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

answer to Justice Ginsburg's question that the jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't make different decisions with multiple counts.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on your theory, the trial court can instruct the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury:  If you find guilt on 666, you must find guilt on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the others, if you find there was travel. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BLATT:  Right.  And our position works 

  

  

 

 

 

 

no matter what kind of error you have.  When you have an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

acquittal --

 

13 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I think that's an 

   

  

 

 

 

14 

improper instruction. 

 

15 

            

MS. BLATT:  It is an improper instruction. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

And the question is, is if the instruction is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudicial in a way that renders the decision not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

final, invalid, it can't be any more relevant evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than the jury's just refusal to find anything. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

And it's kind of like -- I'll give you an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

example.  If I say I need a car and you give me one 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

without any brakes or steering wheel, it's not that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

helpful.  And here you just have something on its face 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's invalid.  On its face, it's a worthless piece of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

paper.  It's never been recognized of anything.  And I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

17 

1 

2 

do think I'll get back to legal argument because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factual argument doesn't seem to be moving you. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

On the legal argument is -- the only reason 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

I'm even here -- the only reason we're here and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these vacated convictions don't themselves bar retrial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the Double Jeopardy Clause is because this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has, over and over and over, called them complete 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

nullities. 

9 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Maybe one way I can figure 

   

  

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

out the scope of your argument is just to ask, do you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that the government is always unable to use a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vacated conviction, that is for any purpose, or do you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that the government is unable to use a vacated 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction only for double jeopardy purposes? 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

MS. BLATT:  This Court has never used a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

vacated conviction for any purpose, period.  Yes. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you have the history on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

your side, most of it.  Do you think that that's because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government, you know, cannot use a vacated 

   

 

 

 

 

 

conviction for any purpose? 

 

 

 

21 

            

MS. BLATT:  Yes.  I mean, since Blackstone, 

    

  

 

 

 

22 

23 

I don't know, in the 1600s is it -- when it's -- when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's void ab initio, it disappears. 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  This isn't a double jeopardy 

   

  

 

 

 

25 

argument.  This is a something else argument. 

   

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

18 

MS. BLATT:  True. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But what is it?  What is the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

            

3 

4 

something else?  Why can't the government use a vacated 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

conviction for any purpose? 

 

 

 

5 

            

MS. BLATT:  Well, I mean, we have -- we have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

it's void ab initio and then it's void ab initio under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Well, why --

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Look at the label.  It's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

void ab initio, but I mean, it's void in the sense that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can't be punished for a vacated conviction.  But the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is, can we use what the vacated conviction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tells us about a historical fact, or can we use it for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some other purpose that, you know, that I'm not thinking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about right now? 

 

 

15 

            

16

what's -- what part of the Constitution are we looking

let Yeager go like this, I mean, there's historical fact 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the hung jury, and the entire government brief and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the entire dissent is they're not reconcilable.  It's --

Yeager does defeat what you're saying.  But on the void 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ab initio, there's a reason that invalid convictions are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

void ab initio -- and I don't want to leave the Double 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jeopardy Clause -- is if their -- the government wants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its cake and eat it -- eat it too.  It wants to say that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're complete nullities under United States versus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ball, otherwise we wouldn't be here. 

 

 

 

 

 

9

10 

complete nullities.  I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

11 

            

12 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  They lack legal effect, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

it is a historical fact that it occurs.  So surely they 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can be used to prove a historical fact.  For example, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppose there's a case in which the -- in which the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is whether a witness who testified for the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution was bribed.  Surely the -- the conviction 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be used in that situation, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

MS. BLATT:  I guarantee you if that 

    

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

testimony was struck from the record, it's gone.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disappeared.  And here that's what we're talking about. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

No, it didn't --

 

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  You're 

  

  

 

 

24 

25 

suggesting that if there's a retrial in a vacated 

   

   

 

 

 

 

conviction that you can't use the testimony that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

20 

1 

elicited during that conviction? 

 

 

 

2 

            

MS. BLATT:  That was bribed, and the court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

struck from the record.  And they say -- the government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants to introduce bribe testimony.  I don't know of a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case that says you can do that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

7 

Justice --

 

8 

            

9 

question. 

10 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That -- that wasn't 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. BLATT:  Well, maybe I misunderstood the 

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- Alito's hypothetical, 

  

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

as I understand it.  His hypothetical is the juror 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

lied -- pardon me -- the witness lies.  Conviction set 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aside for instructional error. 

 

 

 

14 

            

15 

            

MS. BLATT:  All right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can that witness be 

  

 

 

 

 

16 

prosecuted for perjury? 

 

 

17 

            

MS. BLATT:  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  Yes. 

  

  

  

 

 

18 

Absolutely.  Our question is --

  

 

 

 

19 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So then -- and then his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

point could follow this; the conviction can be used for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

some things. 

 

22 

            

MS. BLATT:  You're not using the conviction. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

You're using the witness's testimony.  You can use 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence that's introduced in an invalid conviction for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other purposes.  The question is are you -- the only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

21 

thing we're talking about is the verdict on its face 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's invalid.  The same way if you had said you can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convict on preponderance of the evidence.  It's just the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

piece of paper that the government's relying on in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying the jury necessarily found guilt.  It's not guilt 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the way the law recognizes. 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

But I do think there's something quite 

   

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

unseemly about when the Court in Yeager said if you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the continuing -- if hung counts are void and a nonevent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the continuing jeopardy principle, they're also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

void and nonevents under Ashe.  And here the government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has it -- well, they got to count -- they at least count 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for something when it helps us, in it's not only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rendering the clause incoherent but kind of perverse. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but the basic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

point that was made in Yeager made over and over again 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that when the jury is hung, the jury hasn't done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything.  So the defendant in that case was able to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carry the burden that the jury hasn't done anything.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're right back to the typical Ashe case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

But this is very different.  Now what you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

saying -- and the way you phrase things, I think, is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant.  You said, well, what do we know?  We know 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury might have done this.  Well, that means you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't know what the jury did.  And again, it seems to me

that, I guess, everybody agrees it's the defendant's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

burden, and it's different than a hung jury.  The hung 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury, the jury hasn't done anything.  When there's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction, the jury has done something.  They may have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done something under erroneous understanding of the law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or they may have done something under the correct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding of the law.  But either way, I don't know 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you can put that much reliance on Yeager. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BLATT:  I think -- I mean, what our 

    

   

 

 

 

 

argument does depend on is that the reason why the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cares about jury verdicts is they come with a stamp of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finality and validity.  And let me look at -- let's look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at Powell.  Powell is a case where you had a valid 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

conviction and a valid acquittal.  It was basically 

   

  

 

 

 

 

apples and apples.  And this case is apples and rotten 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apples.  And if you can't use even a valid verdict to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impeach another verdict, you sure shouldn't be able to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use an invalid verdict either. 

 

 

 

 

            

It's just -- that is what Yeager said, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Powell means acquittals can't be undermined by hung 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counts.  Well, they shouldn't be able to be undermined 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by invalid verdicts either. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When the acquittal isn't 

  

 

 

 

 

undermined in that it has claim preclusive effect, those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquittals are final.  They are done.  These people can 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

23 

never be prosecuted for the travel offense or the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy offense.  So it's not -- I think you're not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to say the acquittals don't count under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government -- I mean, yes, they do count. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

MS. BLATT:  And that was the very argument 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

made by, you know, the government in Yeager, is who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cares about the acquittals, because they are going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

count.  But the Court said, no, to really count, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to have the full effect with Ashe --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because there was nothing 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

on the other side in Yeager.  If you say a hung jury, a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hung -- the jury says we can't decide. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

MS. BLATT:  Right.  And I think a rotten 

   

   

  

  

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

apple is worse than, you know, the orange in Yeager. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You basically had an apple and an orange.  Here you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something infected with reversible error.  And just the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

irony that it has never been counted by this Court --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The error had nothing to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

do with the inconsistency. 

 

 

 

20 

            

MS. BLATT:  Yes, it -- well, it could have. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

It definitely could have.  It could have caused the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistency, but it was precisely because we can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, the defendant could never meet the burden of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reconciling the acquittals with the hung counts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that was what Yeager was saying, is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

24 

sure, the defendant has the burden, but we're not going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to give them the impossible burden of explaining, well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if the jury acquitted, what were they doing hanging?  No 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one could ever reconcile that imponderable.  It was a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complete inconsistency.  And the Court said, yeah, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

looks kind of inconsistent, but we just -- we're not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really sure what a hung count is.  You can't really tell 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what they did.  It could have been an exhaustion; who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knows?  And here --

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It didn't say we're not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

really sure.  It said a hung count is equivalent to no 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision at all. 

 

 

13 

            

MS. BLATT:  And I think an invalid verdict 

   

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

on a legally relevant question is worse than no decision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at all.  Again, the government's position is the jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted.  Sure, it was a coerced confession that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

withheld the crucial confession of the real killer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They didn't have a lawyer.  But it's a piece of paper. 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

They unanimously found him guilty.  Oh, and there was a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preponderance of the evidence instruction too. 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

But it sure says, well, it has a lot of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

meaning to us, because it's evidence of inconsistency. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And it should -- and the jury acquits.  And you say, oh, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, that's just an acquittal.  Okay.  Well, they can't 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

retry him.

Acquittals -- I mean, the acquittal has to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

mean something under Ashe more than just, you know, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury -- you have to assume that the jury necessarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found him not guilty of the elements.  That is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposition of this case. 

 

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You're -- you're saying it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

is highly doubtful if the government had charged just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counts 2 and 3 and got an acquittal, and that they could 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then have had a second trial under 666.  You're saying 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that just couldn't happen under Ashe v. Swenson. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

MS. BLATT:  That's exactly right.  Yes. 

  

  

 

 

 

12 

Yes.  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes. 

  

  

 

 

13 

            

And the point I'm making about once you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

the acquittal is that -- and I do think this was going 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on in Yeager, because the whole point of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's brief is we get one complete opportunity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Yeah, I know it's a nullity, but let's pretend it's not 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

really a nullity here.  But at least we need one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

complete opportunity. 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

And there were a lot of questions about why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

should the principles of Ashe outweigh?  And the answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was because of sort of the -- the special status 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquittals have.  They're sacrosanct.  The Court has 

  

  

 

 

 

 

said their unassailability is the most fundamental rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the history of double jeopardy law, and the primary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

26 

1 

purpose of the clause is to protect their integrity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

And the Court said the fact you've already 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

got an acquittal after running the gauntlet and staring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down the barrel of the government's gun -- and here it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was really a firing squad -- that should count for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something.  It should count for barring retrial instead 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of permitting it.  And because acquittals are so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

special, our position is the government should give you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something pretty good if they're going to impeach it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

And if the hung count nondecisions weren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

good enough in Yeager, it's hard to see how the rotten, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infected apple with a worm should be good enough here. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

14 

            

Can I reserve the rest?

offense that they're seeking to preclude relitigation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now, but also acquitting them of offenses involving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bribery as a predicate.  And it's undisputed that those 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

verdicts cannot be reconciled.  They are indisputably 

  

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent.  Because of that, we know that error 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurred, and that the jurors must have neglected to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow the instructions with respect to that count. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

            

Because of that, this case falls within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

Powell's recognition that when a jury issues 

   

 

 

 

 

inconsistent verdicts, a defendant can't point to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

acquittal and say that that acquittal necessarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolved any facts in the defendant's favor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But suppose the 

  

 

 

 

14 

15 

hypothetical were -- just conspiracy and travel are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charged, and there's an acquittal.  Could you then try 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

on 666? 

 

17 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  No, because in that 

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

situation, there would be nothing in the record to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicate that the jury had done anything other than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow their instructions, apply a lot of facts, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

make factual findings in the defendant's favor.  But the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation is different when the jury returns 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent verdicts, because there, we have conclusive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence that something went wrong; the jury erred, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't following its instructions.  And so when the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

28 

charges are brought at the same time, as they were here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the jury acts inconsistently, we lack that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confidence that the acquittal is actually a reflection 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of findings in the defendant's favor. 

 

 

 

 

 

1

5 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you agree with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

Ms. Blatt's statement that the government has never 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before sought to gain a benefit from a vacated 

   

   

 

 

 

 

8 

conviction? 

9 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  Well, I think that it's 

   

  

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

important to separate out the use of the vacated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction.  It's certainly the case that a vacated 

   

  

 

 

 

 

conviction can't be used to establish the defendant's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilt of that charge.  The -- the fact that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction is vacated forecloses reliance on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction for that purpose. 

 

 

 

16 

            

But we're not relying on the conviction for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

that purpose here.  We're looking at it to establish 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only the jury's inconsistency.  That's a historical 

   

  

 

 

 

fact.  It's -- it's a matter on this historical record 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that actually occurred. 

 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What other purpose could you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

use a vacated conviction for?  Is there anything else 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that the government can use a vacated conviction for, or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is this the only thing? 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  I think it can use it to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

29 

establish any kind of historical fact when -- when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the purpose to which the conviction is being put. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And we cite a number of lower court cases that look at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vacated convictions to establish things like motive for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- for a subsequent crime, which would establish the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's plan or intent. 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

So there are situations where it's really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

the existence of the conviction that tells us something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about what actually happened with facts on the ground, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that I think the conviction is relevant for. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

12 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Who -- who's not --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could you use it in a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

civil case?  Could a -- could a -- a party use it in a 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil case to impose civil liability?  Say, well, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, the jury obviously found that you did this; there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was an instruction on the criminal aspect but didn't --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but you did this act, and that's collateral estoppel, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's issue preclusion, in a civil case for damages. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  No.  It wouldn't be 

  

  

 

 

 

20 

appropriate to rely on it there, because as a Federal --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

22 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why not? 

  

 

 

MS. PRELOGAR:  -- civil collateral estoppel 

  

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

principle, the verdict has to be final, and it would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lack finality if the conviction had been reversed.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think that actually points up Petitioner's primary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

30 

argument here, which is to focus on what the conviction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily established, and that's not actually the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct focal point of this inquiry, because we're not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ones trying to rely on the conviction to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collaterally estop Petitioners from doing anything. 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

Rather, they're the ones invoking collateral 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

estoppel, and they're relying on the acquittal to do so. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So the proper focal point of the inquiry here is what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did that acquittal actually decide?  And in light of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistency, we can't know that it resolved any issues 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the defendant's favor. 

 

 

 

12 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you don't know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

based on the conviction.  You don't know that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdicts are inconsistent.  What you know -- it's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same problem I was raising with your friend on the other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side.  What you know is they might be.  And so it seems 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to me that what we're being asked to decide, if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility that they might be is enough to allow the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government to relitigate the substantive -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive count.  And it does seem to me that's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little bit of a -- an extension of what our precedents 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

have said. 

 

23 

24 

25 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  We do know, though, that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

these verdicts definitely were inconsistent.  It's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

just a possibility, because the jury was instructed on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

31 

1 

2 

the same theories of liability for all of the counts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involving Section 666. 

 

 

3 

            

4 

            

The First Circuit considered this issue --

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

jury -- if the jury relied on the part of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction that was legally invalid, then you don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know that they reached a -- a verdict inconsistent with 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

what was the acquittal in the prior case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

10 

            

11 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  We can't rely --

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  A valid conviction. 

    

 

 

 

MS. PRELOGAR:  That's true we can't rule out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

that possibility, but it's equally possible that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury validly convicted on a quid pro quo bribery theory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and decided to acquit on the other offenses out of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lenity or mistake or confusion. 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

And when we're in this world where we just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

don't know, and Petitioners concede that we can't be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain what other verdict rested on, then in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation the -- the general collateral estoppel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle is that they cannot preclude that issue from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further litigation.  Because it's not just whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's a possibility that the jury resolved issues in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

their favor.  There has to be a certainty that the jury 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

did that. 

 

25 

            

And I think it's actually something notable 

   

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

32 

that it's not at all unusual for acquittals to lack 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preclusive effect when there's some ambiguity about what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury had actually decided. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Blatt suggested that 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

there's something -- I think she used the word 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

"unseemly" -- about using a vacated conviction for this, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

or indeed for any other purpose, given the traditions of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our legal system where it's just very hard to find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instances in which we have done so. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So, you know, I'm not sure I understand 

   

 

 

 

 

 

where the unseemliness prohibition comes from, but it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does seem, you now, quite out of kilter with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditions of our legal system to use vacated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions in a manner that affects individuals' 

   

 

 

 

 

constitutional rights.  So, I guess, tell me why we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't be concerned about that? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  You shouldn't be concerned 

  

 

 

 

 

about it because the tradition is limited to looking at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions to stand in for the defendant's guilt.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we acknowledged here that we are -- we can't rely on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions to establish that. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think the tradition goes 

    

 

 

 

 

further.  I mean, you have a tough time in your brief 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

coming up with any instances, and the only times you do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are -- are some -- a couple of scattered lower court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

33 

decisions.  But you have, other than that, a really 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

tough time coming up with any instances in which courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have used vacated convictions for any purpose. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  Those lower court examples, 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

though, I think are particularly relevant, because what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

a number of them are doing are using the vacated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction to answer precisely the question that we have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at issue here, which is to try to ascertain the basis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a jury's other verdict. 

   

 

 

10 

            

And when the whole question is what did the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

jury actually necessarily decide.  The jury's verdicts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are quite obvious relevance in answering that question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And in fact, it's -- it's also the case that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction can be relevant to help the defendant, not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just harm the defendant, by actually clarifying the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis of an accompanying verdict that might otherwise be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

ambiguous. 

18 

            

We cite a case that does this, the Velasquez 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

case from the Third Circuit.  The way that that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation works is that if a defendant, for example, has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defended on multiple theories, let's say it's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy case and he said there was no agreement and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no overt act, he won't be able to establish, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquittal, which basis the jury accepted in returning 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

that verdict. 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

34 

1 

            

But if there's a separate conviction in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

case, maybe overlapping with the overt act, even if that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction is set aside, the defendant could point to it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and say this shows that the jury must have resolved the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement issue in my favor on that separate verdict of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

acquittal. 

7 

            

So this isn't an argument that -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

convictions are relevant only when they benefit the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government, or that we're able to use them to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's disadvantage.  It's an argument about the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

nature of the inquiry.  And I think that when you're 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking at the question of -- of what that jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily decided, its verdicts are quite salient 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevance in answering that question. 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

Petitioners' primary argument is based on 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Yeager.  Petitioners contend that because there, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

court didn't consider the hung count, the same result 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to obtain here.  But Yeager is fundamentally 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different because there, there wasn't a jury decision at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

all through the hung count, and so there wasn't anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that could actually create a true inconsistency with the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

one verdict in that case that the jurors had returned, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the verdict of acquittal. 

 

 

 

              

I think Yeager is a manifestation of this 

   

 

 

 

 

Court's long-standing presumption that jurors follow 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

35 

their instructions, they're presumed to act rationally. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And Yeager ultimately concluded that the hung count was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just too thin of a reed to attribute irrationality to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury as a whole.  Because by definition, the jury as 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a whole in that hung count hadn't done anything.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hadn't agreed on anything. 

 

 

 

            

 

The verdicts are differently situated as 

 

 

 

 

Yeager itself recognized.  Yeager distinguished Powell 

  

 

 

 

 

and said that when you have inconsistent verdicts, there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury has spoken through its verdicts.  And if it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reached contradictory results, then what we know is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that inconsistency exists as a matter of the record of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case, and Powell says that in a situation presenting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that kind of inconsistency, it wouldn't be appropriate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to assume that the verdict of acquittal is the proper 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict, the one that the jury really meant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In fact, Powell said that the most obvious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explanation for that kind of inconsistency is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurors were convinced of guilt and decided to acquit out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4

19 

20 

of lenity. 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

And it would be particularly inappropriate, 

 

 

 

 

 

I think, to accord preclusive effect to that kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict based on lenity, because it would essentially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

magnify the effects of the jury's nullification and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extend it far beyond the compromise the jury itself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

struck and affect other counts beyond what the jury ever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

intended. 

3 

            

And so I think Powell rightly recognized 

   

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

that when we're in a situation where we can't know that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury was following its instructions and applying a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot of fact in a rational manner, then the defendant's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not able to carry the burden to show that the acquittal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the verdict that -- that the jury truly meant and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended to resolve the factual disputes in the case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think that we cite a number of examples as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

well where it's clear that there are a number of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples where there will be ambiguity in what an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquittal resolved, even separate and apart from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent verdict.  And so petitioners' suggestion 

  

 

 

 

 

that this fails to accord respect to verdicts I think is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out of sync with how general preclusion principles 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

operate. 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Imagine again my conspiracy example where 

 

 

 

 

 

the defendant offers two defenses and says there was no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement and no overt act.  In that situation, if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury acquits and we have a general verdict of acquittal, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we won't be able to ascertain the exact argument that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury adopted.  In that situation we know they must 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have decided something in his favor, but the inability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to identify which issue was resolved in the defendant's

favor provides a basis to avoid collateral estoppel. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

And I think this is just a recognition that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

collateral estoppel is something of an extraordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy here, and yet we need to be satisfied that its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most fundamental prerequisite is satisfied, that 

 

 

 

 

 

something was actually resolved in the defendant's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you agree with 

  

 

 

 

 

Petitioner that if you have a jury finding, jury makes a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding, but that finding is infected by race 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination, you can't use that for anything even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though it's a jury finding? 

   

 

 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  Certainly you can't use it to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish that the jury found the defendant guilty, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because in that situation, that kind of error would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish that the jury wasn't basing that conviction on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any relevant circumstance.  And to the extent that that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error itself results in apparent inconsistency in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdicts and establishes that the -- what seems to be an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistency was actually based on the error itself, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then, of course, collateral estoppel wouldn't apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because that would restore our presumption that the jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did act rationally and find facts in reaching its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict of acquittal. 

 

 

            

But to the extent that the error doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

38 

explain the inconsistency, doesn't resolve the verdicts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then we'd still be in a world where, as Powell 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized, we simply can't see that through the verdict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of acquittal the jury necessarily resolved facts in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

defendant's favor. 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, does that position 

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

extend to anything that affects the evidence in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, so that if any prosecution evidence is improperly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitted or any defense evidence is improperly excluded, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same would follow? 

 

 

 

11 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  So long as it creates 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

reversible error, then, of course, the conviction would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to be set aside based on that evidence.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assuming that the evidence applied across the board --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought your answer to 

    

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

Justice Ginsburg was that if there was a particular kind 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of error that resulted in the reversal, then the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction could not be used to show inconsistency in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

the verdicts. 

 

20 

            

21 

            

22 

to clarify. 

 

Did I misunderstand your answer? 

   

 

 

MS. PRELOGAR:  No, I apologize.  Let me try 

   

  

  

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

              

I was trying to distinguish between those 

 

 

 

 

 

errors that are actually confined to the count of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction and those errors that would apply across the

board to all counts.  So if there's a particular error 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the case, say an instructional error that only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affects the count of conviction, then that might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually resolve the apparent inconsistency, because if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury received two different instructions on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overlapping charges, then we might think by looking at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the instructions that we can actually clear up the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistency that would otherwise exist.  So to that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent, that type of error could resolve the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistency and provide that the predicate for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collateral estoppel is satisfied. 

 

 

 

            

But putting aside that class of errors, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're not in that world here, then I don't think the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

type of error at all affects the analysis, because so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long as it's disconnected from the inconsistency itself, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then it doesn't do anything to clarify what that jury, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we know must have disregarded its instructions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what that jury was doing. 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think that there's actually -- the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

sole reason that Petitioners say that the Court should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disregard the inconsistency here is because of the legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error in this case. 

 

 

 

            

But it bears emphasis that they have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy for that legal error.  The remedy is a new trial. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's the ordinary remedy in this circumstance, and, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

40 

1 

2 

Justice Ginsburg, in your hypothetical, there too, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant would be entitled to a new trial. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

3

23 

24 

this case is actually gain complete immunity from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further prosecution on these charges.  They want to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

extend the effects of the acquittal on those independent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counts to this situation and prevent retrial of the very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

count that the jury itself convicted them on.  And they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are not entitled to that much greater remedy unless they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can satisfy the prerequisites for collateral estoppel. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that is the greater 

  

 

 

 

 

 

remedy that Yeager gave, and I understand your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

distinction between Yeager and this case, but it does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leave you with a fundamental anomaly, which is, in a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case in which there's an acquittal and a hung count, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquittal is the only thing that matters.  And in a case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where there's an acquittal and a vacated conviction, you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, where a court has said this has got to be -- this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has got to be reversed and it no longer exists, in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case the person comes up with a far less good situation. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  But that result makes sense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in light of the way Yeager reasoned through the issue in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case, because in Yeager you could look to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquittal and identify that it must have made factual

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It makes sense in terms of

parts of Yeager's reasoning, but not in terms of other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parts of Yeager's reasoning. 

 

 

 

4 

            

Another part of Yeager's reasoning just said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

hung counts have never been accorded respect as a matter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of law or history.  And similarly, one could say vacated 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions have never been accorded respect as a matter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of law or history.  They are vacated.  They are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

nullities.  You don't get respect for that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  I understand that portion of 

    

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

Yeager, though to just simply confirm what the Court had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already said, which is that hung counts are evidence of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing because they don't represent jury decisions at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all.  A jury doesn't speak through its -- a jury speaks 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

only through its verdict.  And so something that signals 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just disagreement or a failure to agree or even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

extraneous --

 

18 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I guess I see -- when 

   

   

  

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

I read Yeager, I see two different rationales, and on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one you're exactly right.  There's a real distinction 

   

  

 

 

 

 

with this case. 

 

 

22 

            

On the other, seems you're exactly wrong. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

There's no distinction in this case at all because both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have never been accorded respect as a matter of law or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

history.

itself signaled that the issue on which the case turned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that we didn't have the kind of true inconsistency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that existed in a case like Powell, and the finality of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the conviction, its validity doesn't erase the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistency that existed in Powell or provide any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

greater clue about what that jury was actually thinking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and what it actually decided through its verdicts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so I think Yeager itself emphasized that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

although we do have these finality concerns, a verdict 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of acquittal is final only with those issues that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually decided, and Yeager was able to conclude that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury in that case, through the acquittal, did decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues in the defendant's favor as opposed to, for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, deciding to acquit out of compassion, exercise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lenity, or neglect to follow instructions through the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

count of acquittal. 

 

 

            

That's not the case here where we have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusive evidence.  We know for sure this jury didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow its instructions, and that brings the case in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line with Powell, notwithstanding the fact that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions had to be vacated for unrelated reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think it's -- it's important to emphasize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too the weighty interests that land on the side of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retrial in this circumstance.  Thus, the ordinary remedy

here and it's for good reason, because when there's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal error in a trial, that doesn't signal that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government necessarily failed to prove its case and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's still a strong societal interest in ensuring 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that the government has an opportunity to enforce the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal laws against that person, and if it can prove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its case under proper instructions, obtain a guilty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

verdict to punish the criminal misconduct. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  The question on which we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

granted review refers to a vacated unconstitutional 

   

 

 

 

 

11 

conviction. 

12 

            

But is that what we have here?  Is this an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

unconstitutional conviction?

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  I think that we -- that the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction, if it were based on proper theory, would not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be unconstitutional, and so we don't necessarily know. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That was the reason why the conviction had to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vacated, was because it wasn't clear what basis the jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had resolved the verdict on. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, it was an erroneous 

  

 

 

 

 

 

instruction, so it was instructional error.  Is that a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

constitutional error? 

 

23 

24 

25 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  It's a -- I think it rises to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

the level of a constitutional error insofar as the First 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit held that the defendants -- that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

44 

instructional error would have permitted criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction based on conduct that doesn't constitute a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime, putting, of course, to one side, as Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg noted, the circuit split on that issue.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by no means an issue that's been fully resolved.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the majority of circuits have found that the gratuity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory that the jury was instructed on here is a proper 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation of Section 666.

10 

instructional error a constitutional error? 

   

 

 

11 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  I don't think that all of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

them would necessarily rise to the level of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional error.  I guess any error that ultimately 

    

 

 

 

 

 

is prejudicial and where we can't know for certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the defendant was properly convicted based on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that charge, I think at the very least would of course 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant setting aside the conviction and vacating it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  So if there were a harmless

error --

beyond a reasonable doubt because it's a constitutional 

   

   

 

 

 

24 

error? 

25 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  I'm not sure whether the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

45 

lower court applied a Chapman standard here, and I think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately the potential difference in standards 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't have affected the analysis, because the court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concluded that there was -- that there was sufficient 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence on the proper quid pro quo theory, also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence that would have supported a bribery theory. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

And so the court just couldn't tell either way on what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ground the jury would have possibly grounded this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4

verdict. 

10 

            

Ultimately, though, I think in light of that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

error, the appropriate result is the ordinary remedy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, a retrial.  Petitioners are only entitled to avoid 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that remedy if they can carry their burden, and it's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stringent one, of showing that the jury actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolved issues in their favor in this litigation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

They haven't carried that burden here.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

seek to be excused from it based on the legal error. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But they haven't actually carried the error -- carried 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the burden of showing that that jury that returned those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent verdicts necessarily thought they were not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilty of committing quid pro quo bribery. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

Unless the court has further questions, we'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

respectfully ask that you affirm the judgment of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

First Circuit.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

5 

Justice. 

6 

            

MS. BLATT:  Thanks.  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Justice Alito, any instructional error that 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

allows a jury to convict on something that's not a crime 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

violates the due process clause, but not all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructional errors violate the due process clause.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't want to be convicted for something that wasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a crime.  So I don't -- that doesn't surprise me. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

I'm going to start sort of backwards. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

Justice Ginsburg, on your question about an all-white 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury where blacks are excluded, I'd go back and look at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the transcript, because she said, oh, well, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might -- that might resolve the inconsistency. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

And there's a real discomfort that she had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

there, because she didn't want to say, well, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquitted him of murder, but because they also convicted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him of murder, maybe it was because they were -- they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were all white. 

 

 

22 

            

It's -- it's the same argument here, is --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

she's saying, well, maybe that did cause the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

inconsistency. 

25 

            

And it's our same argument too.  Nobody 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

47 

1 

2 

3 

knows if the inconsistency is because they were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

irreconcilably divided on whether he was not guilty of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime, or maybe it was purely a result of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

instructional error. 

 

5 

            

And it's because Yeager said it's 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

impossible, we could never meet that burden, and neither 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could that -- the poor African American in her example, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he could never show that burden either, which is why the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden shouldn't be on us. 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

Justice Kagan, your bit about unseemliness, 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

I'll take unseemliness.  Every single government brief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

on don't you dare reverse a conviction; convictions are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

final, they bring closure to our community unless --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless the error is so foul that it makes our country 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not have fairness and integrity in our criminal justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

system. 

17 

            

You just -- we can't -- we can't have any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

confidence in the verdict.  That is the whole 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposition behind the prejudicial-error doctrine, is we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take a jury's decision as sacrosanct unless it just --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's that bad.  And that's the -- that's the premise of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your structural-error doctrine.  So unseemliness is 

  

 

 

 

 

written into your structural error, your prejudicial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error, your plain error.  It's written into all of your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case law on the criminal law. 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

48 

1 

            

On the third point about civil, I think it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

fascinating.  There are no cases.  The government 

  

  

 

 

 

 

doesn't cite any.  The 2009 brief in Yeager is identical 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to this brief.  There are no civil cases saying you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two inconsistent verdicts, but one is invalidated and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then somehow that cancels it out. 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

There's no settled common law of if you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

something invalid, you still get to look at it.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, the law -- and of course we're going to defer to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg, but the law has always been an invalid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction just disappears for collateral estoppel. 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

The other point I want to make, there was a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

lot of talking about, well, juries are just lean --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lenity, and they're just being nice.  But we know since 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Powell that overlapping charges skyrockets the 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction rate.  With each additional charge, a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

conviction rate starts out at 68 percent and it jumps to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

88 percent.  So the opposite is true, in reality, is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more charges the government brings, the more likely that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is a --

   

 

21 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The jury might have taken 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

care of that in this case.  The jury might have reacted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the overcharging by saying we're not -- we will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convict on the predicate offense, but we're not going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convict on these compound offenses. 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

49 

1 

            

MS. BLATT:  Right.  But I just -- that's not 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

a basis to dismiss the otherwise collateral estoppel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect under Ashe.  I mean, the question is, is are we 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to count illegal invalid verdicts as relevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence of inconsistency.  And almost the entirety of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government's argument, at least the last ten 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minutes, were just complete verbatim recounts of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

oral argument in Yeager and the brief in Yeager, is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have to have one free chance.  The defendant didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meet her burden.  After all, collateral estoppel, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

got to meet your burden.  There was no way he could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reconcile the verdicts.  The jury obviously didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

follow the law, and you should presume they followed the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  If they followed the law, they had to acquit. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It just -- this is definitely a broken 

   

 

 

 

 

 

record.  And yes, they have a formalistic distinction 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that there is no jury decision.  But it's worse when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what you have is a jury decision that on its face is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offensive to our legal system. 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

On the historical record, the only thing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

they came up with -- I don't know how many -- 30,000 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

volumes was the two cases in the lower courts.  But the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority, the cases they were talking about are more, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like, for civil.  You can't get civil damages if there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was an illegal conviction.  It disputes probable cause, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

50 

1 

and the courts are split. 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

But this Court -- and this court has been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

around for a while, and I think it counts more than the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two lower court decisions they have, has said it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impeached, full stop.  It's void ab initio.  It's a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal fiction for a reason.  It's not something that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutors get to dig up from the grave and visit from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time to time even though it was invalid.  It's cremated. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

Its gone. 

 

10 

            

And again, it is something astonishing to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

say, well, we're going to treat it, even though it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional under the due process clause, it's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal nullity under the double jeopardy clause.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

even though we're not letting the government use it to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove our conviction, I mean, our guilt or innocence, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's just that if we otherwise had a double jeopardy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right because we were found not guilty, they can negate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it and take it away. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you really arguing that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it can't be used to prove a historical fact, that it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not a -- it cannot be a relevant historical fact? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BLATT:  In the same way that Yeager --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the relevant historical fact is a finding of guilt. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's why they couldn't get through their brief without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finishing up with historical fact on what the jury

thought about the defendant's guilt.


 

 

 

 

            

And I noticed she didn't once say "legal


   

 

 

 

 

 

conviction."  If she had to give her argument saying the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury legally convicted, it was an invalid verdict, it


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was an unconstitutional verdict, her argument doesn't
