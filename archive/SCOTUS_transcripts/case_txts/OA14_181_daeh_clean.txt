Liberty Mutual         Insurance Company.              Ms. Asay.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIDGET C. ASAY                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 MS. ASAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:               Under ­­ under the principles this Court       adopted in Travelers, Vermont's collection of health       care data is not preempted. The database statute does          not affect ERISA plans in any way that undermines         ERISA's core objectives, does not require plans to offer         benefits, affect the financing or fiduciary standards       for plans, or change the way the plans administer         benefits to their members.                Vermont is merely collecting standardized     data that Blue Cross necessarily generates and already        provides to the State for itself and other entities.                     JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it hasn't been argued        by Liberty, and we can ask them about that, that this is            burdensome, that it might be different from State to         State and so forth, and it may be that this sounds more            Alderson Reporting Company Official in conflict preemption than statutory preemption. But        can you just answer a few questions?                    Does this apply to people that are not        residents in Vermont but that have been treated in         Vermont?             And does it also apply to people that are         outside of ­­ that are Vermonters but are treated         outside Vermont?                I mean, what ­­ who is the universe to whom         these ­­ this applies?                And it seems to me that that would be         difficult for plans to ­­ to figure out.                    MS. ASAY: As implemented by the board, Your         Honor, the ­­ the database requirements apply to        Vermonters receiving health care services from a covered         insurer regardless of their location, so both inside        Vermont and outside Vermont, if it's paid for by a          covered insurer. It does not ­­ the board has chosen           not to require data from non­Vermont residents receiving        care in Vermont.               With respect to the ­­ to the burden and         with respect to the burden issue ­­                  JUSTICE SCALIA: You say it's chosen to.        Does the statute authorize it to?                  MS. ASAY: The statute authorizes it to do         Alderson Reporting Company Official either, Your Honor.               JUSTICE SCALIA: We ­­ we ­­ we ought to          consider that, don't you think?                 MS. ASAY: I don't ­­ I don't believe so,            Your Honor, because the ­­ the program that has been          challenged here by Liberty Mutual is the program as it          has been implemented by the board, and that ­­ that is           how it has been implemented.                 And this kind of generally applicable health       care regulation is not preempted for the reasons that         this Court has expressed in a series of decisions,          including Travelers, De Buono, Mackey, and Dillingham.                   JUSTICE GINSBURG: What of the point that        Justice Kennedy suggested, that ­­ that States can have         different reporting requirements? So it's a little bit          like Egelhoff in that respect, that if there were         uniform requirements, that would be less burdensome, but        if each State has its own specifications, then that         becomes burdensome and costly.                MS. ASAY: Your Honor, two responses to        that. The first is that there is simply no evidence in            this record that there is any cognizable burden on the          third­party administrators who are health care insurers       who generate this data and are providing it already in          their capacity as insurers.    Alderson Reporting Company Official             Second, certainly some States may choose to       do these programs differently, but as several of the         amicus briefs explain, including the brief from the        National Association of Health Data Organizations, these       are carefully designed programs that track the       electronic transaction rule under HIPAA that provides       national standards for electronic claims transactions.                  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose States had      different reporting requirements and the plan showed ­­       they haven't ­­ I don't think showed, but suppose they           showed that this was burdensome. Does that affect the          analysis of the preemption question?                 MS. ASAY: Only in this way, Your Honor: I           think that the Court's holding in Travelers can be         distilled to basically three questions. The first        question is:              Does the plan ­­ does the State law        specifically and directly regulate ERISA plans only?       That's not at issue in this case. It does not.                       The second question is whether the State is        regulating in an area that Congress reserved to the         States or is regulating in an area with which ERISA is           principally concerned. And here the State is engaging         in classic health care regulation, so on that question         the answer is no.    Alderson Reporting Company Official                         And then Travelers leaves open ­­     JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You could say         that it's engaged in health care regulation. You could          also say it's ­­ it is engaged in data collection. And            if you say the latter, that is something that ­­ that           ERISA covers.              MS. ASAY: Your Honor, ERISA governs plan        financial reporting and plan disclosures to the members.        It ­­ primarily the reporting requirements that ERISA        sets out are about the plan finances: actuarial         statements, statements of audited financial statements,      information about how the plan is ­­ about the ­­ the           degree of the plan's financial soundness. And nothing         that Vermont is doing has anything to do ­­                    JUSTICE ALITO: Is that still true ­­                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well ­­                 JUSTICE ALITO: ­­ after the Affordable Care        Act? Doesn't the Affordable Care Act include in ERISA a           section authorizing the Secretary to gather information       from plans for the purpose of improving health outcomes?                     MS. ASAY: Yes. The Affordable Care Act         made a technical amendment to ERISA, which in turn          incorporated the Act's amendments to the Public Health        Services Act. Those do not change the test for ERISA           preemption. They're not part of the plan's annual         Alderson Reporting Company Official reporting to the Department of Labor.                  There's a couple of reasons for that. One          is that the Affordable Care Act itself has a ­­ has a ­­              an ­­ almost an anti­preemption provision, a provision         that says that the Affordable Care Act only prevents         those State laws that prevent the application of the         Act.             Part of ERISA also, which has those         amendments in it, is not part of ERISA as it was           originally passed. That was added by HIPAA. And Part            itself has a provision that says it does not ­­                                              JUSTICE ALITO: But why does it matter ­­        MS. ASAY: ­­ affect the ­­      JUSTICE ALITO: ­­ why does it matter        whether it was in ERISA as originally passed? It is in            ERISA now. And it is true that there is sort of an             anti­preemption provision, but there is also a provision         in the Affordable Care Act that says that the ­­ the           provisions that are added have no effect on the ERISA          preemption provision.              MS. ASAY: That's right, Your Honor.                   JUSTICE ALITO: So what do you make of that?                      MS. ASAY: What I make of that is that it            does not change the test for preemption either way. And           when ­­ when Congress passed the Affordable Care Act,         Alderson Reporting Company Official Travelers had been on the books for years. The          standards set forth in Travelers, which reserved, to the         State's, health care regulation, was understood by ­­ by         Traveler ­­ was understood by Congress, and it was not          changed.             And this program that ­­ that Vermont has        adopted is a classic health care regulation. The          data ­­             JUSTICE BREYER: It is health care       regulation. Vermont also has laws that govern        fiduciaries. So could they have a statute which says           all fiduciaries, including fiduciaries ­­ ERISA      fiduciaries must report ­­ fill out the following forms         about how they ­­ how they invest their money.                     Can they do that?                MS. ASAY: They could ­­ they could have a          standard for ­­              JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. Can they do          just what I said? Is ­­ or is that preempted?                        MS. ASAY: It would be preempted ­­                   JUSTICE BREYER: Correct.                MS. ASAY: ­­ as applied to the ERISA plan.                      JUSTICE BREYER: Now, suppose, instead of       that, what they say is, what we would like is that all            fiduciaries of ERISA plans send us each month a report           Alderson Reporting Company Official of all of the benefits under the retirement plan that          they have paid to any member.                              Can they do that?    MS. ASAY: Your Honor, I think the answer to           that probably depends on the area in which the State is           regulating.             JUSTICE BREYER: So what they're doing is        they have their ­­ their Secretary of Health and Human          Services that would like to know how wealthy or poor the           workers are. So that's why they do it.                     MS. ASAY: I think that would prevent a very            close question.              question?                         JUSTICE BREYER: You think that's a close         MS. ASAY: That is a close question.         JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, they can ­­        gee, I see case after case here that says that reporting            requirements are a central function. You know, I ­­           you've read them just as well as I. And ­­ and it seems              to me surprising that they can do that.                                Isn't that the job of the Labor Department.        MS. ASAY: I think that is primarily the job           of the Labor Department. And I ­­ I say that it ­­                          JUSTICE BREYER: Because obviously, my      question ­­ it's a good answer, because you're saying          Alderson Reporting Company Official I'm not getting anywhere with this line of ­­ because          you're ­­ because I'm going to say what about health          care. That's the next question.                  My actual question I'm driving at is this:        You should have the information. I have no doubt about            that. But the question is whether you have to go to the             Labor Department first or HHS and say, we want uniform          rules here, or whether they have to come to you when the            rules of States turn out to be a mess.                       And you ­­ you ­­ you say you want to go           first and let them come after me, and I think the other             side says no. If you want to do what you want to do, go               to the Labor Department, get a national rule that gives           you large range to get what you want.                                MS. ASAY: And ­­    JUSTICE BREYER: And I don't know the answer          to that question. That's why I ask it.                      MS. ASAY: And, Your Honor, the answer to         that question is that, because this is classic health         care regulation for which States are responsible ­­       insurance rate review, budget review, health care       research ­­ it is an area in which States are permitted           to regulate. And they're permitted to regulate even         slightly differently from State to State.                  And as the Department of Labor, the Federal        Alderson Reporting Company Official government agrees with us that this is an area that          ERISA leaves to the States, even though it involves data          collection, because ERISA cannot possibly have been       intended to sweep away all collection of information        from plans by States. Congress adopted a deliberately          expansive definition of a welfare benefit plan and ERISA          that includes, not just the direct provision of medical         care, but also day care centers, apprenticeship       programs, prepaid legal services. These are all areas         in which when plans would act, they would necessarily be          providing information to States.                JUSTICE ALITO: I ­­ I see that ­­ I ­­ I               see that argument as to ERISA as originally enacted, but          I am very troubled by the fact that it now authorizes           the collection of data for the purpose of improving         health outcomes ­­ health care outcomes. I ­­ I don't             see how that ­­ unless the anti­preemption provision        saves the day, I don't see how that does not undermine            your principal argument, which is that ERISA may preempt         reporting of financial data and that sort of thing, but          it doesn't preempt the collection of data regarding        health care.              MS. ASAY: Your Honor, the ­­ the scope of          ERISA's preemption provision in is governed by what         Congress intended when it passed ERISA in . And the           Alderson Reporting Company Official later amendments to ERISA regarding group health plans        include the language that says, "does not affect or         modify that standard." And so this Court, when it is           considering the scope of the ­­ of the areas that          Congress left to the States in ­­                   JUSTICE ALITO: I really don't see how that          can possibly be. If Congress enacted an amendment         tomorrow that says one of the core purposes of ERISA is           to collect health care information, and here is a ­­          here is the health care collecting requirement, you        would say, well, that's not preempted, because that        wasn't the purpose when they enacted the preemption        provision, originally.              MS. ASAY: I would certainly say that was          not preempted if it was added to Part , which says that            Part does not affect the test for ERISA preemption in            .             JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, saying it doesn't       affect the test is quite different from saying that ­­         that ­­ that nothing changes. The test remains the          same, but now, that test is applied to collection,         which ­­ which the Labor Department is itself        conducting, or is itself authorized to conduct. That's         not changing the test. It's simply ­­ it's simply          changing the facts to which the test has been applied ­­          Alderson Reporting Company Official or the law to which the test has been applied.                      MS. ASAY: It would change the test, Your         Honor, because if ERISA was now considered to have a          broader, expansive scope that intruded into health care,        that would change this Court's settled precedent in        Travelers and De Buono. And again, Congress ­­                    JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that doesn't change       the test. Our test would still be the same whether it's            a core function of ERISA or not, and ­­ and it has made             it a core function of ERISA.                   MS. ASAY: It has not made it a core           function of ERISA. It has ­­ there were ­­ it's the            Affordable Care Act's amendment to ERISA, and again,        there's also in addition to Part 's preemption        language, there is the Affordable Care Act's       anti­preemption language, and to think that when       Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, which       contemplated a robust Federal­State partnership in       health experimentation, which included language that      authorized the Department of Health and Human Services        to provide Medicare ­­               JUSTICE BREYER: But this is no problem for         you. All you have to do is go to DOL or HHS. The State                representative says, this is what we want to do, will          you please promulgate a regulation. ­­ you can do it            Alderson Reporting Company Official maybe in days or days ­­ which says that this and             similar things are fine. And in our opinion, it is           not ­­ it is not preempted. I think you could do that.              That's my opinion. I may be the only one who thinks             that. So I ­­ I think it's just a question of which                forms you have to go through.                  But if we take you and say, I'm going to ask           ­­ I'm really asking the government this question,        because I don't see why they're on your side, and           they'll have an answer to that. See, I want to find             out. But what I want to find out is this: The factor I                saw was million people have these plans. And if            million people have these plans, there can be States          with different sets of regulations imposing a huge          financial burden upon health care.                 And were that to happen, suddenly all the        people we're trying to help under this plan will find          themselves much worse off, and purely for bureaucratic        reasons. If I take their side of it, I can have some               assurance that the purpose of Congress in these statutes         will be fulfilled, because there will not be        unnecessary, conflicting reporting requirements, which     sound like nothing, but they're very expensive to ­­ to          actually implement.              Now, that's my basic problem. The same        Alderson Reporting Company Official question for you, for the government, and for the other          side, but the other side will agree with the way I put             the question.              MS. ASAY: And if I may try responding this           way, Your Honor. The ­­ the notion that it's more           efficient for the Department of Labor to collect a         subset of standardized ­­               JUSTICE BREYER: You're not going to collect        anything. All they're going to say is in our reg, you            have permission to go and impose these requirements.        But by having to go to them first, we prevent the           conflicting requirements of different systems.                  MS. ASAY: And it's possible that they may         be able to do that. I'm not sure where that authority            would come from ­­               JUSTICE SCALIA: It ­­ it ­­ it isn't clear          that they're able to do that, is it?                                MS. ASAY: No.    JUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't clear that a        Federal agency can eliminate preemption by simply       saying, okay, you can go ahead and do it.                     point ­­             JUSTICE BREYER: I'm only asking. My        JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though it's otherwise       preempted under the statute, we say it's okay. I ­­ I             Alderson Reporting Company Official think that's not a ­­ not a ­­ not a clear ­­ a clear                  question.             MS. ASAY: It's ­­ I think it's not clear           that they can do that. And again, I think the question             for the Court is not what the Department of Labor can           do, but what Congress reserved to the States.                    JUSTICE KENNEDY: I ­­ I know your time is            running up, but consider two cases. Case one: Vermont           is the only State that requires this. Case two:            states requirement ­­ require this and it's all        different and it's burdensome.                            Same preemption analysis?   MS. ASAY: Yes, Your Honor, same preemption        analysis  as in Travelers and De Buono and Mackey.                    JUSTICE KENNEDY: And same result?                  MS. ASAY: Yes, Your Honor, same result. As          in Mackey, where this Court held that State garnishment         litigation procedures as applied to the very benefits        that the plan was paying out were permissible. Clearly,          those were going to vary State by State, and involve the           plans in State­by­State regulation.                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: On rebuttal, because I       don't want to eat up more of your time, would you go            through the ­­ through more careful ­­ more slowly, the          fact that this information is all electronic, all of it          Alderson Reporting Company Official already set out in the HIPAA regulations. And so it's           just a question of ­­ and ­­ and now, all reporting is             being done in one system, ICD­, right? Everybody has          to use the one computer system.                  MS. ASAY: I am not actually familiar with          that, but I will ­­ if I may reserve my remaining time.                                                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       MS. ASAY: Thank you.     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Bash.                    ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. BASH                FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,                     SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER               MR. BASH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:                 I would like to start, if I could, with         Justice Breyer's questions, and then hopefully I can         move on to Justice Alito's questions about the ACA and          Justice Kennedy's questions about the burden here. Let         me set out how we see the interaction of the preemption           framework and recordkeeping requirements, and then turn       to what I think DOL's role is here.                     Both sides agree, essentially, that ERISA      plans can be subject to some reporting requirements,        probably many reporting requirements, incident to State       laws in other substantive fields. So, for example, the          Alderson Reporting Company Official Solicitor General gave the example of day care centers.         ERISA plans can run day care centers. I don't think            anyone doubts that you can have all sorts of reporting          requirements to make sure the staff is trained, the         facilities are safe. And so forth.                   This Court's case in De Buono upheld a tax          imposed on employer contributions to an ERISA medical        benefit plan that provided the medical benefits       directly. And we told the Court at the time that that            tax had all sorts of reporting requirements. So         essentially, the question is here, where to draw the         line between reporting requirements that are permissible       and those that are nonpermissible.                 As I take Respondent's view, it's that        they're ­­ it's certain information that is so core to          the plan that you simply can't have State law reporting          requirements about that information.                  I don't think that can be right. Take, for         example, real property held in trust by a pension plan.           DOL requires reporting on that. Obviously, you need to          know the assets the pension plan has, but certainly a          State taxing authority can require reporting about that        same information to assess a property tax.                    The same was true with the tax in De Buono.          The same is true, by the way, in Dillingham. That was a             Alderson Reporting Company Official case about an ERISA­run apprentice program. And        California law said, you either follow our standards for         apprenticeship, or you have to pay a higher wage. I            mean, that was as core as you get. It was literally the             way the apprenticeship program was set up.                   So I don't think the test can be whether the           information is, in some sense, core to ERISA. I think            the test has to be, is this reporting requirement         incident to a law in the field governed by ERISA, ­­           vesting, funding, fiduciary duties and so forth ­­ or is          it incident to a law in health care, or in day care             center regulation?              Here, I don't think anyone disputes: This         information is used for hospital budget review, for        health insurance rate review, for medical research.       There's no question that it's incident to classic State         health care regulation.               JUSTICE KAGAN: Why isn't there also a        requirement that the law just not be burdensome over a          certain level?              MR. BASH: It ­­ it is, Justice Kagan. And           I ­­ I think I cut short my test.                       The first inquiry is: Is this incident to a          field that ERISA doesn't govern? I think that's          satisfied here.  Alderson Reporting Company Official               But then there's still another question    under Travelers, which looked to both purpose and        effects of whether the effect of the law is so          burdensome that effectively frustrates or impedes the       design of ERISA plans or the administration of ERISA         plans. And I think a law like this that imposes             reporting requirements on a claim could theoretically be         that burdensome. And so when ­­                  JUSTICE KENNEDY: How is that any different        than conflict preemption? How does that give any         special effect to the statute here? I mean, you could            make that argument if there was no preemption provision.                     MR. BASH: Well, I ­­ I think the way it's             different than conflict preemption, or at least one way,         is that if it actually is in the core field governed by            ERISA, I mean, if the State said, we just want to make             sure these pension plans are well­funded, so we're going         to ask for reports incident to that role, it would be           preempted even if the requirements weren't particularly       burdensome.               I mean, the Court has never held that in a         specific case, but I think the Court's analysis leans          towards that direction. So it could either be within          the preempted field, in which case it relates to ERISA          plans and it's out, or it could be so burdensome that it            Alderson Reporting Company Official effectively frustrates the purpose of a uniform ERISA ­­                     JUSTICE SCALIA: The former sounds to me        like standard field preemption and the latter like        standard conflict preemption.                                       MR. BASH: Well, I think there have been ­­          JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that what you're saying?        MR. BASH: There have been some well­written        separate opinions in this area that ­­                  JUSTICE SCALIA: I know that.                   (Laughter.)             MR. BASH: I don't think ­­ I don't think ­­            and here's what I would say about that: I mean, I know                your opinion and the opinion of a few other justices           have suggested we should shift to field preemption. I          think if the Court were to say what we've been doing all            along is field preemption, and it makes more sense         doctrinally to classify it that way, from the Department         of Labor's perspective, that would be fine.                     I think we would be a little bit concerned         if the Court signaled to lower courts in its opinion          that it was marking a big shift in its jurisprudence           that could destabilize the law. We think ­­                    JUSTICE BREYER: Why aren't you on the other         side of the case? That is, I was fine with you until I               read a few of these amicus briefs, and then suddenly I            Alderson Reporting Company Official saw million people. And there are associations all          over the place that are worried about this problem. And           they have a big chart where they show the possibilities           of ­­ of conflict. You yourself are worried about          conflict. Conflict among States in requirements means        money. A lot of money. That's what they say, and             that's plausible.              So what I want to know is: What do you all             propose to do about that in the U.S. government? One           thing to do about it ­­ and I've looked up the regs, so             maybe Justice Scalia disagrees, but I'm talking about        what I think. All right?                   The ­­ the ­­ it seems like they would have          authority to issue regs either way; blocking, or getting         permission first. That's where I ended up, and that's           what I wanted your view about. You see what I'm saying?                         MR. BASH: I see what you're saying.         There's two pieces there, whether this actually has a         burden and what we could do about it if there was. I             didn't mean to suggest we think it has a burden.                       It's the view of the Department of Justice        that the significant burden has not been shown ­­ the          Department of Labor that the significant burden has not         been shown here. So that starting premise, we do not           agree with that. All I'm saying is that if a party             Alderson Reporting Company Official could show that burden, that would raise a substantial          preemption question and would be highly relevant to the         preemption analysis.              been shown?              JUSTICE KAGAN: Then why hasn't that burden        MR. BASH: Respondent submitted nothing      below. I mean, really. They submitted an Internet fax            sheet ­­             JUSTICE KAGAN: There's something very      intuitive about their argument, and it's ­­ it's        essentially what Justice Kennedy said. It's ­­ it's         when States devise different requirements for        this, different formatting, different particular     information requested, that just all adds up to a lot of            hassle, which all adds up to a lot of money.                       MR. BASH: Two points. I mean, first it           seems far less burdensome than State laws this Court has          already upheld, or that State laws that I think most           people would agree have to be upheld.                     I mean, the tax ­­ or the surcharge in        Travelers ­­ that was the case where you bought         commercial insurance, you had to pay a surcharge up to            percent more on medical purchases, that's       unbelievably burdensome, and surely had reporting      requirements associated with it. And having to pay         Alderson Reporting Company Official vastly different surcharges in States could be        burdensome too.              What this Court's precedents have said,      including Travelers and Dillingham and De Buono is that         a mere burden is not enough. What has to be shown is             that it interferes with the administration of benefits.                                So in Egelhoff ­­   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but a       consistent theme in our cases, when you say a mere           burden is not enough, is that the government wants         employers to, one, set things up ­­ they don't have to           ­­ and two, they want the money to go to benefits, not            to go to administrative and bureaucracy expenses.                   Is it your view in analyzing this question,        do we look at what would happen if States adopted           different programs, or do we look at just Vermont         because Vermont happens to be first?                  MR. BASH: The former. Our view is you have           to contemplate the States would adopt different        regimes?             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, I think that's         right. So you don't think different regimes of          reporting is going to require a significant diversion of          money away from benefits to administration?                  MR. BASH: Not ­­ not on this record. Mr.           Alderson Reporting Company Official Chief Justice, recall ­­               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What kind of a        record do you need to show that?                               MR. BASH: Well ­­    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course you can't        have a record of what States are doing if it's a             hypothetical question.              MR. BASH: Well, I think there's a couple           ways Respondent could have made the showing here. I          mean, at minimum, Respondent could have had its own         third­party administrator come in and say these       reporting requirements are burdensome; this is what       we've had to do. We've had to change the way we process             claims because they're so burdensome. I suspect they          could not have made that showing ­­                  JUSTICE BREYER: But you have pages and          of the Blue Cross Blue Shield brief. And there they            have a big chart, and there are all these organizations           out there that are trying, like the Uniform Law         Commissioners, to create uniformity. That's why I say          that's why I'm puzzled as to what to do.                     Am I supposed to write an opinion that says          even though Blue Cross Blue Shield feels it's a big mess            and trying to straighten it out, they didn't make the          right record in the Vermont trial court? How do I write             Alderson Reporting Company Official that opinion?              MR. BASH: Going to the ­­ the chart point,          I mean, the chart actually doesn't show conflicting        requirements. Most of the counterpoints they have is         like not required. I don't think there are conflicting           requirements.             And even if you look at the end of the Blue           Cross Blue Shield brief, they never actually say this         is ­­             JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I'm serious. How          do I write the opinion? I suppose it could happen, but              it hasn't happened yet. How do I write the opinion?                        MR. BASH: I think ­­ I think the opinion is             written like this: One, this is a reporting requirement           incident to a field that is not governed by ERISA,           health care regulation. It's presumptively valid, but        we're going to look and see if Respondent has made a           showing that it's so burdensome, it fundamentally       changes the way plans are administered or designed.        Respondent has not made that showing here. That is how           the opinion is written.                  I mean, this Court has never actually said       that a burden is so bad that it's preempted, even if it             operates in a field outside of ERISA. It has suggested            in dicta that it's possible, but that is inherently a          Alderson Reporting Company Official factual determination, and it's hard to see how the         Court could reach that conclusion without some factual        showing ­­             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we go through at         one point ­­ all of a sudden there ­­ the th State             that does this, and it's the different things, we say           is that a burden? Is that a sufficient burden? We say               no. But then when States do it, maybe it's a            different answer. That seems like a very odd preemption           analysis.             MR. BASH: Well, I ­­ I don't think it            should turn on that, Mr. Chief Justice. I do think it's             appropriate for a court to consider what if States           impose different requirements like this. But just like          different States might have different requirements       for daycare centers, or for prepaid legal services,        that, I don't think, is the sort of burden ­­                      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but this goes        to basic, very comprehensive reporting of data. It's         not simply, well, if you run a daycare center, you have            to comply with the rules about daycare centers. Of          course you do. It's quite different.                   One of the things ERISA plans do is report         data and compile data. And it seems to me that the            analysis that says, well, daycare centers you can. That          Alderson Reporting Company Official seems a little bit off basis.                                           MR. BASH: May I respond, Mr. Chief Justice?          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No.     Of course you can.                (Laughter.)                         CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Please.     MR. BASH: I think that the ­­ I'll try to            do it in two sentences.                   I think that the burden here is far less        substantial than the burden of complying with State        apprenticeship regulations for the way you designed the        program in Dillingham. Here, most self­insured plans        use third­party administrators. And often those       third­party administrators are insurance companies that      already have the infrastructure in place for reporting        requirements as applied to them which cannot be        preempted under ERISA.               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   Mr. Waxman.               ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                 MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:                 A signal goal of ERISA enacted in was        to foster employee benefit plans that could operate        Alderson Reporting Company Official nationally under nationally uniform rules of      administration, first and foremost, rules about      recordkeeping and reporting.                Now, of course ERISA plans, like other      regular businesses, are subject to ancillary regulation       like maintaining a safe workplace, paying minimum wage         and prevailing wage laws, paying their State real estate         taxes on their headquarters, and if they choose to run a           hospital, run a law firm for their legal services,          benefit program, run a childcare center, they are         subject to local regulation like other providers of        those local services.               But in every single case in this Court, and         every lower court decision that I have found in which           courts have upheld, State by State, reporting       requirements, it has always been incident to a        substantive obligation that the State could impose. And         no one contends that Vermont could impose substantive        regulations on the claims that Liberty Mutual pays under         its employment plan.                           Now, I want to go to the point of ­­          JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, why was it that         you introduced absolutely no evidence of burden in the         lower courts here?               MR. WAXMAN: That is not true, Justice        Alderson Reporting Company Official Kagan. What ­­ we did not introduce any evidence about           what it would cost us in dollars and cents to have Blue            Cross Blue Shield comply with the Vermont request that         is the subject to the subpoena. But we did introduce           substantial evidence in the record below, and ­­ and         some of it is included in the Joint Appendix, and all           the pages that are extra long folded in, about what it           is that we have to do, both in Vermont and in the then              other States that imposed very, very different        reporting obligations.              So we didn't put a dollars and cents in, but           we did make the lower court, the district court, on its           request, very aware of this very substantial burden.                    And Congress, in determining ­­ in ­­ in        deciding to, in exchange for blanket Federal regulation        of these fostered national plans, to grant a very broad           preemption provision that says this is going to be         Federal regulation ­­                                      JUSTICE BREYER: What about the converse ­­       MR. WAXMAN: ­­ not State regulation.       JUSTICE BREYER: What about the converse?       What about the converse point for you that I was making            before? The number that jumped out from the page is the             million people this affects. Now, that's a huge           number, and therefore the risk of conflicting       Alderson Reporting Company Official regulations is serious ­­                           MR. WAXMAN: It's ­­    JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ in raising costs.       That's for you. But they say it hasn't been shown           yet ­­                         MR. WAXMAN: Well, that ­­     JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ so I ask you: If it            does come about, if it should come about and you lost           this case, why can't your clients go right to the          Department of Labor, whose regulations I've read, or        possibly ACCA, and say, we want you to impose a uniform            national data collection system or the equivalent, put        limits, and then preempt the conflicting State limits?                    Now, it may be other members of the Court do          not agree with this approach, but I've written a case,           MetroMedia, where I think the agencies have a lot of            power there, and I think they have more capacity to           decide this kind of thing than a group of judges.                                   points:             So what about that for you?      MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, a couple of         First, in the lower court and in this Court,         neither party on the other side has disputed what I          think is the self­evident proposition, that the       Department of Labor and now the Department of Labor and          Alderson Reporting Company Official the Department of Health and Human Services, absolutely        have the statutory authority under ERISA to impose the         kind of recordkeeping and reporting requirements that       Vermont and now or other States do. They have            never disavowed that. The ­­ the SG's brief at both the            invitation stage and the merits stage sort of coyly         suggests that that's right, and ­­                 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that sounds like a        one­size­fits­all solution, and there's some value to       States being able to think about their own health care          needs.             MR. WAXMAN: Of course.                 JUSTICE KAGAN: And to think about what        things they want.               So I mean, just again, let's go back to this           burden because it is a very intuitive idea that you have            on your side: different States; that's a lot of            money. But I guess I wonder why it is a lot of money.                 I mean, as I understand what's going on here, that all            the data that's being requested is data that Blue Cross          Blue Shield generates anyway. That all the data that's          being requested is data that Blue Cross Blue Shield         reports for other people. That really this is a          formatting question, even with respect to the wide        variety of States, that the States have started getting         Alderson Reporting Company Official their formatting more uniform.                So I ­­ I mean, you know, it's ­­ you can             say it's million people, but, you know, in the end           what's the cost?                           the record?              MR. WAXMAN: Oh.    JUSTICE KAGAN: And why don't you have it in          MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I ­­ there is not a ­­             with respect to burden, Congress, in enacting the        preemption provision and their ­­ we ­­ we've cited to          the Court place after place in the conference reports,         the House reports, the statements of the sponsors, the         recognition in ­­ in repealing the Disclosure Act, which         set a reporting ­­ a national reporting floor and           allowed the States to add onto it and record evidence          before Congress that small plans were spending up to          percent of their entire assets on State reporting.         Congress made the determination that this Court has        reflected in many, many of its decisions, including        Egelhoff, that the very fact that there could be          different State regulations is the burden that the        preemption provision is designed to address.                              And the notion ­­ and that ­­      JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we know ­­ we know,         Mr. Waxman, that Blue ­­ Blue Cross is providing this          Alderson Reporting Company Official information with respect to individuals that its own        plans insure, and we're told that it is providing the          information for other self­insured ERISA plans who       didn't make this objection. So do we know at least what            is the burden of providing that information for the         other self­insured ERISA plans that Blue Cross is ­­ is          providing the information for?                MR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, the Blue       Cross Blue Shield Association has actually filed a brief          in its ­­ in this case, and it explains at great detail,            as does the brief of the multi­employer plans, which         like Liberty Mutual operate in States, about the         burden, about the fact that Blue Cross Blue Shield         doesn't have all this information in the normal course,         the multi­employer plans don't have it, and Blue Cross         Blue Shield, as a third­party administrator, has told         this Court just exactly how burdensome and how expensive         it is.              Of course they could do it for Liberty        Mutual in Vermont. The only question is how much it's           going to cost and how much they're going to charge.                      But look, for example, at since this ­­       since this litigation began, the Commonwealth of       Massachusetts has now told Liberty Mutual that it wants         reporting under its APCD statute. And as we recount at           Alderson Reporting Company Official page of our brief, their regulations require, among         other things, the premiums the plan charges, its        actuarial assumptions, the summary of its plan designs,        the plan's reserves, its surplus, its provider payments,        its provider levels, and information about medical       procedures whose claims are denied. And the chart that          we submitted in the district court reflects the wide         variation in States.               There is ­­ the ­­ the burden that Congress         foresaw is coming to play before our very eyes as          States ­­ more and more States adopt these mandatory         plans.             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that information,       the ­­ the ­­ the laundry list you went through, is that            already available at Blue Cross Blue Shield and being         reported somewhere else?               MR. WAXMAN: No, it is not. Absolutely not.          And the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association amicus brief         reports that. The multi­employer plan brief reports        that they only ­­ that their plans generally have about           to percent of the information that's required by          any one of these States. And to go to ­­ I think it was                Justice Breyer's hypothetical ­­ look, the same rules        that apply here are going to apply to pension plans.          And the State of Vermont, like many other States now, is           Alderson Reporting Company Official concerned not just about health care costs and        delivering good health care outcomes, but it's concerned        about the financial well­being of its senior citizens.        And in fact, they've asked the Department of Labor to          permit State ­­ States to operate their own ERISA         pension plans for their residents.                 Now, they could pass a database statute that         says, we're really concerned about whether elderly, you        know, Vermonters are going to have enough money in their          elder years, and we know that million people are          covered by employer pension plans, and we just want you          to report ­­ you can pay whatever you want, but we want            you to keep records and report to us about what your           plan is and how much money people are going to have when            they retire. Every single dollar ­­                                          JUSTICE BREYER: Why can't you do this?        MR. WAXMAN: Well, every ­­     JUSTICE BREYER: Why can't you ­­ why can't         you simply go ­­ and the statute says, (a)() ­­ the           statute says that the Secretary of Labor and the         authorities ­­ broad in these ­­ has authority to         undertake surveys and collect, compile, analyze, publish       data information and statistics on welfare plans. Okay?         That's ERISA welfare plans.                So you go to them.     Alderson Reporting Company Official MR. WAXMAN: Well ­­    JUSTICE BREYER: And you say, DOL, we want                                 you to promulgate a reg that says you will collect some            of this information, but even if you collect ­­ don't          collect it all, you let the States collect the rest.                                  MR. WAXMAN: Just ­­    JUSTICE BREYER: Now, they can prevent it        from being burdensome.               MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, I know how         exciting it is to get in the middle of a jurisprudential            debate between you and Justice Scalia.                                          JUSTICE BREYER: But this ­­     MR. WAXMAN: I ­­     JUSTICE BREYER: I don't see ­­ this is not           ­­ go ahead.               MR. WAXMAN: I'm ­­ my ­­ my fingers are          tingling at the prospect. I am not sure ­­                      (Laughter.)             MR. WAXMAN: I am not sure that the          Department of Labor has the regulatory authority to        essentially excuse the preemption provision, but ­­ and        you don't have to just go to the provision of ERISA that            you quoted ­­ in (a)()(B) of ERISA, it authorizes         the Secretary of Labor to require the production of,         quote, "any information or data from an ERISA plan where          Alderson Reporting Company Official he finds that such data or information is necessary to          carry out the purposes of this subchapter." And         adverting to Justice Alito's comments, in the ACCA, the         Secretary has the authority to require the production        of ­­ from plans of, quote, "any other information as          determined appropriate by the Secretary."                 So the notion that preemption here is sort        of like an ­­ operates like an accordion ­­ if the           Department of Labor has the authority to get it but          hasn't chosen to exercise, it's not preempted; but if         they did promulgate a regulation, either of your color          or Justice Scalia's color, that it would be preempted ­­         is a crazy ­­ is a crazy notion.                      JUSTICE BREYER: You might think this is not         sane, but what I'm ­­ the way I'm seeing it here is            there are two competing problems. One is they should be           able to get information like this in the States.                                 But two, there is a problem of burden.         And I think there are probably or          people in Department of Labor and HHS that could write          regs that reconcile those problems and allow both. But          I can't, because I'm a judge.                   So what I'm trying to figure out is how to          interpret this statute in a way that achieves those          objectives. Alderson Reporting Company Official             MR. WAXMAN: How to interpret this statute        as to say that in exchange for blanket Federal         regulation of these plans, now augmented in the context         of health care plans by the Affordable Care Act, the ­­          by the Federal government, the States are preempted from         regulating the core functions of what an ERISA plan         does. And there is nothing more core than the payment           of benefits.              If the State is attempting to regulate,       whether it's by substantively regulating or imposing a        recordkeeping or reporting obligation about the very       activity that defines it as an ­­ as an ERISA plan, the            payment of benefits, that State law necessarily relates        to, because it has a connection with, an ERISA plan.                       And frankly, it's pretty ironic that the       Petitioner and the government claim on the one hand that          it is so important to get this information from these          plans because percent of all citizens in the         United States get their health care from these        self­funded plans, and yet requiring them to keep the         particular records that the State wants and to report it          on a quarterly, annually, or monthly basis, has no          relation to or connection with the plan. I don't           understand how both of those thoughts can inhere at the          same time.  Alderson Reporting Company Official             JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, I guess I just           don't understand this argument. I ­­ I ­­ I mean, I ­­                I understand completely that there should be some        restriction on overly burdensome State regulations of       whatever kind. You know, it could be taxes, it could be            day care, it could be anything. Right? But why is it             that this regulation falls in a different category than          taxes or childcare or anything else? Because the State          here clearly is not attempting to, and is not         regulating, payment of benefits. It's doing something        that has an effect on your operations, no doubt, but the           State is operating in a completely separate area for          completely separate purposes in a way that does not          trump or conflict with, or anything else, the choices         that ERISA has made as to payment of benefits.                     MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I ­­ I want to ­­ I want                to come to the end and dispute that premise that you ­­           the end of your question. But if the ­­ if you look at              this Court's cases that have set about to evaluate the          burden, or at least included, as in the last section of           Travelers, a section that says of course if this were           terribly burdensome there might be another question,       those are cases ­­ and it's Travelers, Dillingham, and         De Buono. We all agree on that ­­ those were all cases             in which there was a burden being placed on an entity            Alderson Reporting Company Official that wasn't ­­ in Travelers it was hospitals; in         De Buono it was hospitals; in Dillingham it was         apprenticeship programs, all of which affected the price        that ERISA plans might have to pay to get benefits or           services from those kinds of providers.                  And so it took several sentences in each of         those ­­ several paragraphs in each of those opinions         even to explain how putting a tax on the non­Blue Cross            insurance plans in Travelers, or respecting the       prevailing wage rate in California, actually had an        effect on any ERISA plan anyway, because they weren't         regulation of the plans, per se. They were indirect          regulations. And when the regulation is indirect, that         is, it is not a regulation that is directed at the very             activity that makes the plan an ERISA plan, you do look           at burden. And indirect regulation obviously can occur.         But if ­­ as this Court explained in the last section of            Travelers, if it's too burdensome, it might be        preempted.             But where the regulation is direct, where       the State is requiring reporting because the self ­­        because the self­insured plan is engaged in the very         activity that brings it under ERISA that qualifies it as          an ERISA plan, that obviously relates to and has a          connection with the plan, and is preempted.       Alderson Reporting Company Official             JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're ­­ you're saying       that the State simply cannot have an all ­­ all­payer          database, that that's out because ERISA precludes it,        even though it's going to leave a big hole in the            information that the State has about that health care         being given to its citizens,                 MR. WAXMAN: I don't think that that's at          all the case, Justice Ginsburg, and I don't want to be            misunderstood about this.               The State of Vermont, just to take one        example: The database statute authorizes the relevant        Secretary to obtain this information from everybody, not        only who pays for health care in Vermont, but the          hospitals and clinics that provide it. But the         Secretary, the executive official has chosen not to        require that information from hospitals and clinics and        doctors in Vermont.               There is also no doubt that if all­payer        claims databases so badly need the information from        self­funded plans, and it turns out that the self­funded         plan ­­ a significant number of self­funded plans say          no, that's preempted, the Federal government has all the         authority it needs to get that information and require         that that information be provided, either to the        Secretary and then to the States, or directly to the          Alderson Reporting Company Official States.             And in fact, they can do what often happens         in areas of field preemption and express preemption,        which is to make it worth the plan's while. You know?            They can offer all sorts of benefits to self­employed         plans to provide this information if it's so important.                     What's interesting when we're talking about      what is or isn't in the record in this case, is no            explanation whatsoever from the State of Vermont at any         stage as to why they haven't requested the actual         providers of these health care services to provide the         information and that it is inadequate. I mean, the ­­           the ­­ the only exchange I can recall is in the Second             Circuit oral argument transcript, which is recorded and        discussed in Judge ­­ Judge Straub's dissenting opinion,        the State was asked, you know, look, how important is it           to get the ­­ the ­­ the district judge ­­ I think it              was the district judge ­­                JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well ­­ well, as ­­ as         you're explaining this, it just seems to me it's much          easier to ask the plan provider than to ask doctors           in ­­ in ­­ in one small town, and others, and all             the patients ­­                          MR. WAXMAN: You know ­­     JUSTICE KENNEDY: ­­ unless I misunderstand        Alderson Reporting Company Official your point ­­                          MR. WAXMAN: No, you're not.      JUSTICE KENNEDY: ­­ it seems to me it's         much ­­ much easier.                MR. WAXMAN: It ­­ perhaps it's easier, but         here's the point. And this is the insight of the ERISA            preemption provision: The hospitals in Vermont, the        clinics in Vermont, the medical practices in Vermont are         not subject to varying regulation in different        States. They operate locally. They're subject to State          regulation.             Here, we're talking about plans that      Congress wanted to encourage that would do something        new, that would provide health care benefits and other         employee benefits on a national basis, and in order to           foster that, to subject them to a single set of           reporting, recordkeeping, and regulatory obligations.                 And that, it seems to me, is the insight of          ERISA. And it was the ­­ the bargain that ERISA plainly            struck.               I ­­ I simply noted in response to        Justice Ginsburg's question that the State statute gives        them the authority to do it. There aren't that many           hospitals in Vermont. They already have all the         information about what services are or aren't being        Alderson Reporting Company Official provided.             The State could have said, no, no, no. We          absolutely can't get by without this. But the         representation at oral argument in front of the judge,         which has also been transcribed and is in the record,          the State ­­ the lawyer representing the State ­­ the          judge was sort of trying to settle this case and said,           you know, how much do you really need this information?          And the response was, we don't really need it. This is            just a couple of employees. This is just one plan. But              there's a principle here.                 And we agree with that. And we also agree          with the representations of my friends on the other side          that the question for this Court ­­ it has to take           account of the possibility, which is the emerging        reality, that all States and the District of Columbia          and Puerto Rico will have their own mandatory all­payer         claims databases that will require different things.                   And if I can just anticipate Justice        Sotomayor's question reserved for rebuttal to ­­ to the         State of Vermont, our brief explains, and the Blue Cross          Blue Shield brief also explains, how there are ­­ of the           hundreds of data fields that Vermont alone requires,        there are dozens of them as to which there is no ICD ­­            whatever the ­­ the ­­ the agreed national format is.          Alderson Reporting Company Official There are dozens and dozens of them as to which there is            no HIPAA standard, no HIPAA guarantee of       confidentiality. And this is just one State. If you           look, as I said, at the Massachusetts APCD statute,          which is the only other State that's actually come to          Liberty Mutual so far, and look at our discussion of it           on Page , the stuff that they are asking for is so            obviously critical to what the plan does.                   JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is ­­ this        information is provided by Blue Cross for some        self­insured plans, right?               MR. WAXMAN: I believe that ­­ I believe           that the record shows that Blue Cross Blue Shield         provides this information to Vermont, not only on behalf         of itself as an insurer, but also some other ­­                     JUSTICE GINSBURG: And do we know ­­ do we          know what costs Blue Shield then passes on to those          other self­insured plans?               MR. WAXMAN: We don't know it. We were not           able to get it from Blue Cross at the time the case was             before the district judge.                But in any event, as the Chief Justice's        question suggests, the ­­ this issue doesn't end at         Vermont. It ­­ it has to take account of a burden that              Congress was very, very aware of, it was very cognizant          Alderson Reporting Company Official of the regime under the Repeal Disclosure Act, and the          costs of plans that are trying to be national plans          complying with different State regulations.                  And I really commend to the Court the amicus          brief filed by the multi­employer plans in this case.         These are plans that are essentially union­sponsored       plans. They are not fancy plans. Every dollar that           they have to spend comply ­­ gathering the data that          each State ­­ that different States say they have to          have comes directly out of the benefits that they can          pay. Just as if ­­ if Vermont decides next week, if it             wins this case, that it wants to get information about          pension plans, and how they're being administered, and        what benefits are being provided and not provided, those         are all percent self­funded plans. If my employer          has to provide all that information, that is coming out          of my (k) benefits.                JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, could a State         pass a tax law that requires information about ­­ about           pension disbursements, about claim payments, about      assets held in trust? Could a State do that?                       MR. WAXMAN: I don't think that a State ­­           when you're saying requested information or imposing a        tax?             JUSTICE KAGAN: A tax law that requires         Alderson Reporting Company Official information of various kinds.                MR. WAXMAN: I don't think a ­­ I don't             think a State can impose a tax on benefits that are ­­                         JUSTICE KAGAN: Not impose a tax, that         requires information in order to ensure that the State         is taxing the right things.                 MR. WAXMAN: In other words, we want to tax          the benefits that you're getting ­­                 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think that a State          tax law can't require any information about any of the          things that ERISA does, that the plans do, pension         disbursements, assets, claim payments, nothing?                 MR. WAXMAN: I ­­ I think not. I think that               the State ­­ I mean, I don't think this case turns on              it, but thinking about it, if the State could say, look,           we just want to know all the benefits that you pay every            one of our residents, I think that would be preempted.                       As I say, that's ­­ that's not what's going          on here. And even if I'm wrong about it, it seems to me              that this is quite different. You know, there is a lot             of discussion on the other side of, you know, this just           requires the press of a button and all the information           goes.             And our brief goes on for pages and pages,         and the other amici ­­ amicus briefs show how that is so            Alderson Reporting Company Official far from true. In order to comply with these, it's not            just a question of saying, oh, yes, we paid Seth Waxman            $ in benefits last year. This requires that we keep           records that we don't keep, and that we display them and           provide information in ways that we don't, and that         differ from one State to another. And for those          reasons, unless the Court has questions, I will submit          that the judgment should be affirmed.                              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       Ms. Asay, you have three minutes remaining.                 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIDGET C. ASAY                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                             MS. ASAY: Thank you.     I'd like to begin with Justice Sotomayor's       question about the standardized data, because I think         that ties in nicely with many questions from the Court          about the question of burden.                 So the way that electronic claims      transactions work is not something that the State of         Vermont invented. It's part of HIPAA. It's a Federal            regulation called the Electronic Transaction Rule, and       it sets standardized coding and formatting requirements       for the transaction between the payer and the provider.                     And we ­­ we don't even have to look to the           regulation for that, although that's in C.F.R. Part         Alderson Reporting Company Official , but it's actually in the record at Joint         Appendix . This is the agreement between Blue Cross          and Liberty Mutual, which says that Blue Cross shall be          capable of transmitting electronic data for which       transaction standards have been promulgated in      compliance with HIPAA Electronic Transactions Rule and       shall, to the extent possible, transmit electronic data        in accordance with that rule.                 That is how third­party administrators work,      and that is why self­insured plans nearly always have a          third­party administrator, which is typically a health        insurer to process claims, because although it may look         on the surface as though these reporting requirements        and the ­­ the data collection seems very complicated,         it's complicated not because of anything Vermont has        done. It's because there is the standardized national         standard for how this data is collected, which is fairly          specific, fairly detailed, and they're already doing it.                    And it is generating a pool of tremendously         helpful data that has incredible potential to help        States and the Federal government figure out ways to         bend the cost curve and improve the provision of health          care delivery to everyone in the country.                   The Affordable Care Act expressly     contemplated that States would do this kind of        Alderson Reporting Company Official experimentation. It authorized the Federal government       to provide Medicare claims data to the States. It          authorized ­­ it created the Center for Medicare and         Medicaid Innovation, which then authorized States to       experiment, to develop new models for delivery, which        then need to be tested and evaluated. And the          United States has explained in its brief that those         programs depend upon the collection of all­payer data,        which is something only the States are doing.                    The promise here is enormous, and the       fact ­­ and the loss of this data to the plans would be             tremendous. I would like to address briefly one issue           that my friend raised, which is the question of provider          data. Vermont does, in fact, collect provider data, and          we've collected it for a very long time. It's called            hospital discharge data, and it was one of the first          data sets that researchers looked to. But it's not as           helpful as all­payer data, and here's why.                   Hospitals don't have information that tracks      care across an episode of care. If someone has their           knee replaced, it starts with the doctor's visit, their         surgery. There's an anesthesiologist. There's a stay          at a rehab facility. There's follow­up physical         therapy. And if you're trying to compare outcomes and          costs for a procedure like that, it's the payer, the           Alderson Reporting Company Official centralized payer, as Justice Kennedy said, who has all         that information. There's only a few of them. That is             the real power of the data, and it's not in the hospital            data.             Thank you.              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       The case is
