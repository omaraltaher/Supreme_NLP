 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We will hear argument first


4  this morning in number 02-1632, Ralph Howard Blakely, Junior,


5  versus Washington.

 Mr. Fisher.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR. FISHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


10  the Court: 


11

 The sentencing system at issue here contains exactly


12  the same infirmities that the system -- that this 


13  de-validated two years ago, in Ring versus Arizona.  Once a


14  defendant's convicted of a felony, Washington law sets a


15  statutory cap to that a sentencing Judge may not exceed unless


16  there are facts present that are not accounted for in the


17  guilty verdict.  These are called aggravating facts. 


18

 Yet in Washington, just like Arizona, a Judge makes


19  these findings.  And in Washington, it's even worse than


20  Arizona in that the standard of proof is a preponderance of


21  the evidence, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt.


22

 QUESTION:  But it's still within the statutory


23  maximum.


24

 MR. FISHER:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the statutory


3


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  maximum as Apprendi defines that term, as Apprendi and Ring


2  define that term, is the highest sentence that is allowable


3  based on the facts and the guilty verdict.  That -- that


4  sentence in this case, is the top end of the standard range,


5  it would be 53 months for Mr. Blakely.  You're correct that


6  Washington law labels an additional cap as what Washington law


7  calls the statutory maximum which is the ultimate exceptional


8  sentence, or the ultimate enhancement that could be put


9  forward.  But that is simply a second cap. 


10

 The question that this Court in Apprendi and Ring


11  asked was what is the maximum sentence to which the defendant


12  can be subjected to, based on the facts in the guilty verdict. 


13  And that is the top of the standard range. 


14

 QUESTION:  Well, I assume that if your position were


15  adopted it would invalidate the Federal sentencing scheme that


16  we have.


17

18

19

 MR. FISHER:  I don't think so, Justice O'Connor.


 QUESTION:  Why not?


 MR. FISHER:  Well, the big difference, the biggest


20  difference between the Federal system and Washington, is the


21  Federal system is a system of court rules.  Not a system of


22  Legislative mandates.  So when Apprendi and Ring use the term


23  the highest penalty authorized by the legislature, or the


24  statutory maximum that is easily applied to this case, because


25  all of the 


4


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION:  Two wrongs -- two wrongs make a right, I


2  would say right.


3

 MR. FISHER:  That can sometimes be the case. 


4  Because the sentencing system that is at issue here, is fully


5  legislated.  However, when it 


6

 QUESTION:  I can't see much difference.  Your point


7  is that if the same scheme that Washington has were adopted by


8  courts, it's okay.


9

 MR. FISHER:  Well, that may well be the case,


10  Justice O'Connor, I don't think you have to decide the Federal


11  -- that issue in this case.  But this Court's clearly held


12  Williams and lots of other cases that if a legislature leaves


13  it up to individual judges to decide what kinds of facts they


14  want to consider in meting out sentences that is fully


15  constitutional. 


16

 And as this Court described the Federal guideline


17  scheme is Mistretta, this Court in pages 395 and 396 of that


18  opinion said what we really have is just an aggregation of


19  that same individualized discretion.  Just make it a little


20  bit more formal in the Federal scheme. 


21

 QUESTION:  We did think a big deal in Mistretta, did


22  we not, about the fact that the sentencing commission is in


23  the judicial branch. 


24

 MR. FISHER:  Absolutely.  That was the crux of the


25  holding, Justice Scalia.  I realize there was some


5


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  disagreement on that issue.  However, Justice O'Connor, to get


2  back to your question, the critical distinction is, if the


3  legislature is content to leave it up to judges, or the


4  judicial branch to decide what factors matter and where lines


5  should be drawn, then Apprendi is not triggered in the same


6  way that it is when a legislature steps in and says -- as it


7  has done in this case.  We are not prepared to allow a court


8  to go above a certain threshold unless it finds additional


9  facts.  Unless additional facts are present.


10

 QUESTION:  But if the guarantee of jury trial for a


11  finding of fact in Apprendi, it is to be logical, why should


12  it make any difference whether the court or the legislature


13  sets out the scheme?


14

 MR. FISHER:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there are two


15  parts of Apprendi, one is -- footnote 16 of Apprendi, this


16  Court talked about the democratic constraints that operate on


17  legislatures vis-a-vis courts.  And when a legislature steps


18  in and says we're not prepared to let a sentence go above a


19  certain level unless certain facts are present, that's a very


20  different system, than when a legislature steps in and says we


21  will let courts operate however they like underneath a certain


22  -- underneath a certain system.


23

 QUESTION:  So are you here to say if Washington


24  State's legislature said that for a burglary conviction that a


25  judge can sentence anywhere from 10 to 20 years.  Based on the


6


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  judge's discretion, that's perfectly okay.


2

 MR. FISHER:  Yes, Justice O'Connor, I believe that


3  that's what the holding in Apprendi and Ring would dictate.


4

 QUESTION:  What about the other half.  You talked


5  about one half of Apprendi, what about the other half.  I


6  mean, the other half in effect says, when you allow fact


7  finding by judges to convert crime A into more serious crime


8  B, you're making an end run around the right to jury trial,


9  isn't the same thing going on here?


10

 MR. FISHER:  Well, I think that is what's happening


11  in this case, Justice Souter.  And what happens is, and it


12  takes us back to Apprendi 


13

 QUESTION:  Why isn't the same -- I mean, no matter


14  whether it's happening under the -- under the immediate


15  authorization of legislation setting up the guidelines or


16  legislation that sets up, or that authorizes a component of


17  judiciary set guidelines, isn't the same thing going on?


18

 MR. FISHER:  Well, from the defendant's point of


19  view you might say that it is, but there is a difference in


20  that Apprendi talks -- the baseline of Apprendi is deciding


21  what are elements.  And elements -- the wellspring of elements


22  and the definition of a crime has to flow from a legislative


23  function, a legislature or the person who makes the laws sets


24  out what facts matter, or what facts don't matter. 


25

 So it's absolutely the case of course that Winship


7


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  and the Sixth Amendment apply to courts just as much as they


2  apply to legislatures, however we need a baseline for where


3  those rights kick in, and I think that the proper baseline, or


4  a proper baseline would be the facts that the legislative body


5  or the lawmaker has set out that matter for punishment.


6

 QUESTION:  I guess the tough question is whether the


7  sentencing guidelines, or rather the Sixth Amendment are


8  unconstitutional, right?


9

 MR. FISHER:  I think the Sixth Amendment is


10  constitutional, Justice 


11

 QUESTION:  I just wonder what is the statute in the


12  guidelines case, says to the judge, Judge, you must impose a


13  sentence that the commission has written unless you depart for


14  certain reasons.  The Washington statute says, you must impose


15  the sentence, da, da, da.  Unless and it has similar kinds of


16  things, special aggravating circumstances, for example. 


17

 In neither case can you go beyond the outer limit in


18  the one case, 25 years, or 10 years in the other case, the


19  statutory max in the statute.  What again is the difference?


20

 MR. FISHER:  The difference is, in the Washington


21  scheme the legislature has in effect -- the legislature has


22  caught it by the sentencing grid.  The legislature has enacted


23  itself, all of the standard sentencing ranges. 


24

 Whereas in the Federal scheme, the legislature, or


25  the Congress has left it up to courts to decide where the


8


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  standard sentencing ranges ought to fall, so long as they're 


2  under an open 


3

 QUESTION:  You know the reason -- the difference is


4  that in sentence -- the Federal statute says, Judge, you must


5  apply the grid of sentence.  And in Washington it says you


6  must apply the word eight years, unless three years, unless -­


7  in the other words, apply what the commission said.  That's


8  the difference, right?


9

10

 MR. FISHER:  I'm not sure I 


 QUESTION:  In the Washington statute, it says,


11  Judge, if you have an ordinary case, you must sentence the


12  person to three years.  But if it's not ordinary go to 10, no


13  more than 10.  In a Federal case, it says, Judge, if you have


14  an ordinary case, you must apply the sentence, now the


15  commission fills in that blank.  But if it's not ordinary, go


16  to eight years. 


17

 So the blank is filled by the commission in one


18  case, by the legislature in the other.  The first stage blank. 


19  Why does that make a difference constitutionally?


20

 MR. FISHER:  The reason it makes a difference is


21  because in the Washington system, in the state system the


22  legislature has, as a policy choice with democratic


23  constraints operating upon it, selected a maximum that it's


24  not prepared to let judges go above.  So it's constraining the


25  discretion of judges. 


9


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 In the Federal system, Congress is -- you're right,


2  Congress is telling judges, we want you to come up with rules


3  and follow them.  But it's leaving it up to the judges, the


4  judicial branch, to come up with what the rules are.  So the


5  only significant difference that comes out of the briefing,


6  between this case and the Ring Case, is that -- is the state


7  points to the fact that unlike Ring, where you had 10


8  aggravating factors, here Washington sets out a general


9  standard, and leaves -- and says 11 -- 11 suggested


10  aggravators, but it calls those aggravators illustrative


11  rather than exclusive.  However, we believe that under a


12  proper application of Apprendi that distinction makes no


13  difference.


14

 QUESTION:  You can -- isn't the one -- isn't that


15  Washington prescription, that we talked about in the Williams


16  case, leaving it almost completely up to the judge?


17

 MR. FISHER:  It's not, Mr. Chief Justice.  You are


18  correct but if they did leave it completely up to the judge


19  that would be the Williams case, it would be a very different


20  case than this one.  However, the way that the Washington law


21  is written, and the way it's been interpreted by the


22  Washington courts is that the eleven factors are illustrative,


23  and so therefore if a court is going to depart on a factor


24  that is not one of them on the list, it has to be analogous,


25  or fairly closely tied into the factors that are on the list. 


10


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 So in the Ammons case for example which is one of


2  the first Washington State Supreme Court cases interpreting


3  their guideline system.  They said very bluntly that the whole


4  purpose of this system was to take away the unfettered


5  discretion that we had in the past and to significantly


6  constrain it.


7

 QUESTION:  So if you prevail the jury gets the list


8  of -- of all the 11 factors, plus whatever else the judge


9  thinks might come up?  During the trial do you have to prepare


10  them for that as well?


11

 MR. FISHER:  Well, in a typical system, Justice


12  Kennedy, there are one, two, maybe three aggra  proposed


13  aggravating factors.  So what we'd be proposing is that yes,


14  during the trial the prosecutor would charge an aggravated


15  crime, and simply -- just like the deadly weapon in this case,


16  they would have charged deliberate cruelty.  And the judge


17  would instruct the jury on what deliberate cruelty means.


18

 QUESTION:  Most -- most of these cases like this one


19  come up on pleas.  They don't -- they were trials, yes.  And


20  the jury would be instructed, but how would -- how would it


21  affect the typical case, where there's a plea?  Is the bottom


22  of your argument that if you enter a plea you're home free,


23  from any enhancement, there's been no jury.  You entered a


24  plea before the judge, and just as in here the prosecutor says


25  I'm going to recommend the top of the guidelines 29 to 53


11


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  months.  And you say fine I'll plead to that, and the Judge


2  says I think you deserve more, is the terminal point of your


3  argument that with a guilty plea, for the system to be


4  constitutional, no jury now, just a judge, there can't be any


5  enhancement.


6

 MR. FISHER:  So long as the guilty plea does not


7  include any stipulation to an aggravating fact, yes, the top


8  would be the standard range.  However 


9

 QUESTION:  So the defendant would have to say, yeah,


10  I stipulate to 31 more.  Otherwise it couldn't be given.


11

 MR. FISHER:  Well, I'm not sure it would work


12  exactly that way, Justice O'Connor.  I think what would work


13  would be that the defendant in this case 


14

15

 QUESTION:  Justice Ginsburg, yeah.


 MR. FISHER:  I'm sorry.  Justice Ginsburg, is that


16  in this case for example the defendant would have pled guilty. 


17  And he could have said I agree that I committed deliberate


18  cruelty in this case, which would raise the cap and the judge


19  would be able to do a sentence anywhere under that cap.


20

 QUESTION:  Well, if he didn't agree to that, there


21  wouldn't be a plea.  I mean, if the prosecutor says, look, I'm


22  claiming an aggravator here and I want the range increased


23  that would have to be part of that stipulation, the deliberate


24  cruelty would have to be part of the plea agreement.  If it


25  wasn't, there wouldn't be a plea.


12


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

2

 MR. FISHER:  Absolutely, Justice Souter.


 QUESTION:  Do judges typically impose the higher


3  penalty where there's been a plea.  It seems to me it's pretty


4  hard to do that when you haven't had a trial.  What does the


5  judge have in front of him to, you know, to enable him to make


6  the fact finding that justifies the aggravator?


7

 MR. FISHER:  Well, the way it works right now in


8  Washington, is that if the defendant enters a plea, there's a


9  presentence report that goes to the judge.  The judge can


10  also, as the judge should in this case, have the victim


11  testify for example. 


12

 However, Washington law specifically provides that


13  if the judge wants to impose an exceptional sentence, based on


14  aggravating facts, and the defendant disputes the presence of


15  those facts, Washington law already provides in Section 370,


16  the Judge has to hold a hearing.  And that's exactly what the


17  judge -- I'm sorry.


18

 QUESTION:  Are you saying that that hearing -- you'd


19  have to convene a jury specially -- in this case it was a


20  guilty plea, and the prosecutor was satisfied with 49, 53


21  months.  The judge said I'm not satisfied.  Is it your view


22  when the prosecutor is willing to make that deal, doesn't want


23  the 30 extra months, but the judge wants it, once the guilty


24  plea is made, then can the judge say, never mind, prosecutor,


25  I don't like that bargain. 


13


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 And this -- do you have to convene a jury specially


2  then, just this jury specially to hear the evidence on whether


3  there should be -- or the 


4

 MR. FISHER:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, certainly my


5  case doesn't stand or fall on the fact that the judge is the


6  one that did this hearing.  However, I think that in that


7  circumstance it seems a sensible result that if the prosecutor


8  isn't asking for an aggravated factor and nobody's contesting


9  it, then the judge ought to either be bound by the deal, or


10  the judge in the interest of justice, as he always has, can


11  say I don't think this is a fair plea.


12

13

14

 QUESTION:  That's right, he can turn down the deal.


 MR. FISHER:  Yeah.


 QUESTION:  I mean, and does he only get the


15  presentence report after the plea is accepted? 
 Or does he get


16  it before the plea is accepted?


17

18

 MR. FISHER:  I think it varies, Justice Scalia.


 QUESTION:  Well, so long as he has it in front of


19  him, before he rules on the plea, he can effectively achieve


20  what Justice Ginsburg is concerned about by simply refusing to


21  accept the plea, unless the defendant is willing to confess to


22  one of the aggravating factors. 


23

24

 MR. FISHER:  That's right, Justice Scalia.


 QUESTION:  So this moves the entire system.  I mean


25  I am now -- the light has dawned slightly -- the reason I


14


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  guess, I'd like your view, but the defense thought like


2  Apprendi and pursues these cases because 95 percent of the


3  people in prison are not there pursuant to a jury trial. 


4  Rather they're there because of plea bargaining.  And it will


5  work in the plea bargaining context, though it won't work at


6  all in the trial context. 


7

 You'd have to go and argue, my client was in


8  Chicago, but by the way I'd like to point out that he only hit


9  the person lightly not heavily as the -- so that wouldn't work


10  at all.  But you don't mind because your job everyday is plea


11  bargaining.  If I'm right about that, I want to know if I am


12  right?


13

 MR. FISHER:  Well, I think that you're right that


14  Apprendi works in plea bargaining, but with all due respect


15  I'm not sure that I accept that doesn't work in 


16

 QUESTION:  Okay.  Then let's go to the trial.  The


17  person, as you know, robbed a bank.  Used a gun, took a


18  million dollars and not just a thousand.  Brandished another


19  gun, and hurt an old lady.  All that's charged.  You want to


20  say, my client was asleep at home, yeah.  Now, how do you


21  defend yourself against all those aggravators.


22

 MR. FISHER:  Well, Justice Breyer, the same thing


23  happens for example when there's a lesser included offense in


24  the case.


25

 QUESTION:  Of course it does, but they're very


15


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  limited numbers and you can work with a few.  What you can't


2  work with is five or 10, or particularly a very important one,


3  but anyway, you explain it.


4

 MR. FISHER:  Well, as I said, the typical situation


5  in Washington is more like two or three aggravators.  I


6  understand the Federal system is more complicated, but in the


7  state system, there's typically two or three aggravators and


8  in fact Washington itself proves that this works.  Because


9  Washington has already singled out several factors they call


10  sentence enhancements.  Such as using a deadly weapon, selling


11  drugs within a 1000 feet of a school zone and some other ones


12  on the list that they already require to be treated exactly in


13  this fashion.  And then things -- and I've never seen anyone


14  complain, and with certain 


15

 QUESTION:  You know, but I'm just curious.  I


16  understand that that must be so, because you have the


17  experience.  But what I'm -- what I want to know is why is


18  that a fact.  If my client wanted to say he basically wasn't


19  guilty of the offense, then I want to say and also he wasn't


20  near the school, or also he only used, you know, the ones you


21  say.  How do you present that to a jury?


22

 MR. FISHER:  Well, Justice Breyer, one other point


23  is important here because, in many cases it's not going to be


24  such a big problem.  However, in the one state that we've seen


25  that has adopted this system essentially the fix that we think


16


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  would be the proper fix here in the State of Kansas, they've


2  said that if a defendant contests aggravating factors that not


3  -- they have to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.


4

 However, the statute also provides that in the


5  interest of justice the judge can sever the guilt phase and


6  the sentencing phase, and so if -- it puts the defendant.....


7

 QUESTION:  I don't see the problem -- I don't see


8  the problem of challenging it.  It is up to the prosecution to


9  introduce the evidence of the aggravators, right?


10

11

 MR. FISHER:  That's correct.


 QUESTION:  So the prosecution puts on one of the


12  customers in the bank who says, you know, he was using a gun.


13  The defendant is not going to be testifying anyway, unless


14  it's a very strange criminal trial.  It seems to me what would


15  happen is exactly what would happen in a normal trial.  The


16  defense counsel would seek to break down the story of the


17  witness that this person was carrying a gun.  How far away


18  were you, what kind of a gun was it, what color was it.  The


19  same thing that would happen in any trial it seems to me.


20

 MR. FISHER:  Well, I think that's generally the


21  case, and that's why I said it's just like what might happen


22  for example in a lesser included case, when murder and


23  manslaughter was charged and it was the defendant's position


24  that it wasn't him.  He wasn't around.


25

 QUESTION:  Yeah, put on the witness that says I want


17


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  to tell you -- they say he hit her with a gun and your witness


2  wants to say, oh no he only he brandished a gun, he didn't hit


3  her.  That's quite a good witness to put on at the time that


4  you're claiming that he was across the room.


5

6

8

 MR. FISHER:  Right.  Well as I said, there are 


 QUESTION:  Well, sometimes works, sometimes not?


 MR. FISHER:  Right.


 QUESTION:  The bizarre thing about this, which of


9  course I said I'm in the minority here.  The bizarre thing is,


10  it's hard for me to believe that the Constitution of the


11  United States requires, not that it doesn't permit.  But


12  requires a sentencing commission should Congress wish to take


13  discretion, total discretion away from the judge, which of


14  course your distinction leads to. 


15

 It's also very hard for me to believe that the


16  Constitution of the United States prohibits Congress from -­


17  prohibits it from saying, you know, I don't want to leave that


18  up -- to each judge to decide whether having a gun is worth


19  two years, or five years more.  I want to regularize this. 


20

 So those are the two dilemmas because you have to


21  chose A or B, if there's something unconstitutional about


22  this.


23

 MR. FISHER:  Well, Justice Breyer, I think the


24  Constitution doesn't prevent Congress or any legislature at


25  all from regularizing criminal sentencing.

2

 QUESTION:  True.


 MR. FISHER:  Sentencing guideline systems are fine,


3  and Apprendi says nothing about whether legislatures can come


4  in, and regiment out and separate all the factors.  The only


5  thing Apprendi says, is that if a sentence is conditioned on a


6  certain finding of fact, and there is a dispute about that


7  finding of fact, the defendant should have the right to have


8  the jury make that finding beyond a reasonable doubt rather


9  than have to judge.


10

 QUESTION:  Transfer that whole -- your rationale to


11  the Federal system and you have the grand jury first indict us


12  to the aggravators?


13

14

15

 MR. FISHER:  Well 


 QUESTION:  Why not?


 MR. FISHER:  Well, assuming the Federal system -- if


16  you're assuming the Federal system was covered by Apprendi.  I


17  think that 


18

 QUESTION:  I'm saying, assuming we apply your rule


19  to the Federal system, I don't know how we couldn't, quite


20  frankly.  You can get a grand jury indictment for all the


21  aggravators. 


22

 MR. FISHER:  Well, to whatever extent a grand jury


23  needs to charge aggravated crimes I think they would need to


24  charge it and then apply 


25

 QUESTION:  Well, didn't Apprendi say that all the


19


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  elements had to be charged?


2

 MR. FISHER:  Yeah.  Apprendi says that under fair


3  notice principles -- I'm going to stumble here a little bit.


4

 QUESTION:  Why don't you just say yes, what's so


5  outrageous about that.  The man's going to be sent to jail,


6  for another five years, you're saying he has a right to have a


7  jury find beyond a reasonable doubt that he did the additional


8  fact -- act which justifies the five years.  What's so


9  outrageous that that needs to be 


10

11

 QUESTION:  Can the grand juries indict him for that?


 MR. FISHER:  I'm stumbling over the grand jury


12  because this is a state case, and not a Federal one.


13

 QUESTION:  Yes.  But the question was, in the


14  Federal system.


15

16

 MR. FISHER:  Right.


 QUESTION:  Obviously we've never held the Seventh


17  Amendment grand jury requirement applied to the state.


18

 MR. FISHER:  Right.  But to the extent the grand


19  jury requirement applied it would -- the grand jury would need


20  to charge the aggravator just like anything else.  And as


21  Justice Scalia 


22

 QUESTION:  It seems to me you're -- you may not be


23  defendant friendly in all instances.  In this case, if the


24  defendant really wants to bargain for the lesser offense,


25  kidnaping II instead of kidnaping I, I suppose the prosecutor


20


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  would say that part of the bargain is that you stipulate to A,


2  B, and C.  And then he doesn't have the opportunity to argue


3  before the judge that he wasn't guilty of the aggravators.  In


4  other words, it could work both ways.


5

 MR. FISHER:  Well, it can, but I think it's


6  important to look at the injustice in this case, Justice


7  Kennedy.  He made a deal to get kidnaping II, and didn't plead


8  to any aggravators, however he got a sentence that was more in


9  line with kidnaping I, based on facts that he never


10  acknowledged and he disputed.


11

 QUESTION:  Well, the cap for the kidnaping I, was


12  much higher, and judges so often when they see aggravating


13  circumstances get close to whatever the cap is that they're


14  applying.  So I'm not sure 


15

 QUESTION:  Mr. Fisher, if you're -- if you are


16  correct here, I suppose all 50 states have sentencing schemes


17  that would fall as a result, isn't that right?


18

 MR. FISHER:  By my study, Justice O'Connor, I don't


19  think that is correct.


20

21

 QUESTION:  Why not?


 MR. FISHER:  Well, there are only about 17 states


22  that have guideline systems right now.  By my count, only


23  about 10 of them have a system like the State of Washington's. 


24  The other seven have systems where they do create standard


25  sentencing ranges, but then they leave it up to the judge to


21


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  depart from those ranges whenever they want to based on any


2  reason.  Those systems I think are just fine no matter what


3  this Court says today.  So I think we're only talking about


4  those 10 systems like the State of Washington's.


5

 QUESTION:  Setting the systems for States does not


6  seem to trouble us in other areas.  Such as capital


7  punishment, for example.


8

 MR. FISHER:  That's right, Justice Scalia, and


9  obviously this Court has thought a lot about that issue


10  already in the prior Apprendi case, as to what -- what the


11  effects of its rulings are going to be.


12

 QUESTION:  I guess I'd be afraid the effect is going


13  to be enshrine the plea bargaining system forever.  Because


14  that will be the only practical thing.  Or to say there's a


15  constitutional requirement that you have to have a sentencing


16  commission and the legislature can't do the work itself, which


17  is both undemocratic, a little hard to see why that's so -­


18  and produces just as much unfairness of the kind you're


19  complaining about.  Disabuse me, if you can, of these


20  pessimistic views. 


21

22

23

 MR. FISHER:  I'll try.


 QUESTION:  You agree that it's undemocratic?


 MR. FISHER:  What is undemocratic -- leaving it up


24  to judges?  Yes, but that's the whole point of Apprendi is


25  that the democratic constraints operate on a legislature, and


22


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  then when a legislature steps in, that different things apply. 


2  And when the legislature says something, as footnote 16 in


3  Apprendi mentioned, it's a different force than when leaving


4  it up to the judges.  If it's all right with the Court, I'll


5  reserve the remainder of my time.


6

7

 QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Fisher. 


 Mr. Knodell, would you -- am I pronouncing your name


8  correctly?

11

12

 MR. KNODELL:  You are, Your Honor.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. KNODELL, JR.


 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


 MR. KNODELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


13  the Court: 


14

 Whether the statutory maximums in the State of


15  Washington is what the legislature says it is, or the upper


16  end of the standard range, established only for the purposes


17  of enforcing legislative limitations of judicial discretion is


18  at the heart of this case.  And I would suggest to this Court


19  that the answer to that question lies in the examination in


20  the way that the statute works. 


21

 In Washington, the legislature of course like all


22  States, initially defines the elements of a crime, and sets


23  statutory maximums.  And I think if we look at the elements of


24  the crime, and look at the way they work, you will see that


25  they are substantially different, the kind of sentencing


23


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  factors that are dealt with in reaching aggravating, or 

2  mitigating sentences under the Sentence Reform Act.  The 

3  criminal elements apply equally in every case.  They are 

4  necessary and sufficient I think, as was put in the General's 

5  brief, in each and every case. 

6

 They are mandatory, and forced to consider each and 

7  every one of them, the fact finder.  And there's only one 

8  result.  Conviction -- conviction or acquittal.  There's no 

9  weighing of competing interests, there is no discretion. 

10

 Now, I offer doing this -- the Washington 

11  legislature then created the Sentencing Reform Act.  The 

12  Sentencing Reform Act, I would submit to you created a 

13  situation in the State of Washington where we have three 

14  zones.  There's first a standard range and I would suggest to 

15  you that the word standard in the sense that it's used by the 

16  Washington legislature, it's used in defense as a basis of 

17  measurement. 

18

 The standard range is a baseline.  It is a zone in 

19  which the sentencing court has absolute discretion, as you 

20  will see in the guidelines themselves, and provisions, that a 

21  sentence within these guidelines is not reviewable.  That 

22  there's absolute discretion.  Then in addition, in that 

23

 QUESTION:  Excuse me.  The sentence is not mandated 

24  in the standard zone? 

25

 MR. KNODELL:  Not 

24


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION:  Just -- you can give them up to 10 years,


2  but if you want to give them two years, that's okay.  And


3  that's not reviewable?


4

 MR. KNODELL:  That's exactly right.  There is no


5  review.  And I would just -- you know, I would just to -- try


6  to impress upon you, Justice Scalia, that the -- there is a


7  range then between the upper end of the sentencing -- of the


8  standard range, and the statutory maximum, which is the zone


9  where the limitations -- the very minor limitations I submit


10  to the Court that are imposed upon the sentencing court or


11  enforced, that's the zone of limited discretion. 


12

 This limited discretion is limited only in two ways. 


13  The court cannot -- cannot impose a sentence beyond the range


14  for reasons that the legislature considered in defining the


15  crime in the first place, and the court cannot -- cannot up


16  the statutory maximum - cannot impose a sentence because he


17  believes that the defendant committed a more serious crime


18  than the crime of which he was convicted. 


19

 One of the primary purposes of the Sentencing Reform


20  Act is to -- is to ensure that the defendant, the criminal


21  defendant is punished only for the crime of conviction.  The


22  standard range is a baseline, the statutory maximum is a


23  borderline.  The baseline and the requirement that the court


24  enunciate reasons for departure are simply -- they are not a


25  hurdle.


25


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION:  But may I ask you this.  You point out


2  that he has to enunciate reasons.  Don't the reasons have to


3  have -- don't they have to cover basically two components. 


4  First, they have to cover the component that you've alluded to


5  and that is some kind of the reasoning for engaging in the act


6  of discretion of going -- going above.  It's got to be clear


7  that this is not just, you know, more prejudice or anything


8  like that. 


9

 Doesn't it also have to have as a component the


10  identification, the finding of facts upon which this


11  discretion can be exercised.  Take this case as an example. 


12  The basis for going above was cruelty.  Unusual cruelty,


13  whatever it was.  He would have to articulate the facts I


14  suppose that a gun was used, that the woman was kept in this


15  box a great deal of the time and so on.  Which would make it


16  sensible to say, well, yeah, there's cruelty here and that's a


17  reason for doing what I'm doing. 


18

 It's a distinction in the case in which somebody


19  kidnaps a woman, forced her into a mink coat in the back of a


20  limousine that wouldn't -- that wouldn't do it.  So there -­


21  isn't there a fact finding component, even though the statute


22  does not set out in advance what those facts must be or limit


23  what they must be.  They simply must be relevant to the act of


24  discretion, but there is a fact component, isn't there?


25

 MR. KNODELL:  There is a fact component, but if we


26


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  look only at the fact component, Justice Souter, we will be


2  taking a very impoverished view of what this statute does. 


3  Obviously any sentencing decision, any discretionary decision


4  is based in some degree on facts. 


5

 But look what happens under the Washington


6  Sentencing Reform Act.  The court has a list of illustrative


7  factors from the legislature, it's true, but the court can


8  regard -- the court can select them, cannot select them, can


9  disregard some, can regard some.  It's an entirely


10  discretionary procedure. 


11

 QUESTION:  But whatever it does select, they've got


12  to be facts which at least would morally justify going above


13  the ceiling.  The -- the guideline ceiling.  Absent those kind


14  of facts, as well as a reasoned judgment based on them, the


15  ceiling governs.


16

17

 MR. KNODELL:  I disagree with that.


 QUESTION:  Well, I don't think I understand what


18  you're talking about.  No, I mean I'm missing something in the


19  description of the system, that's what I need to have.


20

21

 MR. KNODELL:  Well 


 QUESTION:  Can he be reversed if there's nothing in


22  the record that shows the fact -- I mean he says I'm giving


23  him another 10 years, because he used a gun.  There's nothing


24  in the record that shows that he used a gun.  You mean he


25  cannot go up on appeal and get that additional penalty


27


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  removed? 

2

3

4  finding. 

 MR. KNODELL:  He could. 

 QUESTION:  Of course.  Because it depends on a fact 

5

 MR. KNODELL:  No, I disagree with you, Judge, but he 

6  would be reversed for two reasons.  It would be an abuse of 

7  discretion to base the sentence -- it doesn't make it any less 

8  discretionary.  It's an abuse of discretion to overturn -­

9  excuse me, to impose a sentence that has absolutely no basis 

10  in the record. 

11

 QUESTION:  You call it an abuse of discretion, call 

12  it whatever you like.  You know, call it piggy back.  But the 

13  fact is if his judgment is not supported by the facts in the 

14  record, he is reversed.  So he is making a fact finding. 

15

 MR. KNODELL:  Two -- let me make two points about 

16  that.  Discretion lies at the heart of this case.  Discretion 

17  is the difference between a crime element and a sentencing 

18  factor.  I believe that that, when you take a look at how the 

19  statute works, that's what is at heart -- at issue here. 

20

 If the -- if the judge makes a decision that's not 

21  based upon the record, that's simply pure whim, that's a due 

22  process violation.  That's an abuse of discretion.  The second 

23  point is, I 

24

 QUESTION:  It wasn't pure whim.  He just made a 

25  mistake.  He got this record mixed up with another.  In fact 

28


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  there's not enough evidence to support that fact.  The


2  defendant is entitled to get that judgment reversed, because


3  that fact is essential to his being given the additional


4  penalty.  And as I understand what we said in Apprendi, and as


5  I understand the Constitution, when you're sent to jail for an


6  additional amount of time, on the basis of a fact that is


7  required to be found before you can be sentenced, that has to


8  be found by a jury.


9

 MR. KNODELL:  Well, no particular fact is entitled 


10  -- is required to be found.  It doesn't make 


11

 QUESTION:  No particular fact is entitled to be


12  found, but a fact which the judge can select from among, but


13  he has to select a fact.  And whichever one he selects,


14  whether it's carrying a gun, or cruelty to the woman, or


15  whatever else.  That fact has to be found by the judge and


16  there has to be support for it. 


17

 MR. KNODELL:  That process that you're describing


18  where the judge takes a look at the case -- at the individual


19  before him, and selects what facts are going to be relevant,


20  and decides what weight to give them, and weighs that fact


21  against competing interests in sentencing is exactly the kind


22  of process that the judge went on -- went through in Williams.


23  That is a constitutional process that is not rendered


24  unconstitutional 


25

 QUESTION:  Yes, but in Williams there was no


29


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  intermediate level that he couldn't go above.  There is here,


2  isn't there?  Under the standard sentencing system, are they 


3  -- did the other side misrepresenting this?  I understood that


4  given what the man admitted in the guilty plea he could be


5  sentenced to what, 53 months.  And not above that.


6

 MR. KNODELL:  I disagree with that, very


7  respectfully.


8

 QUESTION:  Without additional procedure before the


9  judge?


10

 MR. KNODELL:  There's always going to be an


11  additional procedure before the judge.  There's always going


12  to be a sentence hearing.


13

 QUESTION:  Which require the judge to find a fact


14  that had not been established previously. 


15

 MR. KNODELL:  Yes.  And I think that that  what you


16  have to remember is that fact finding process, is not like


17  finding the criminal element because the judge is 


18

 QUESTION:  But why not, if it increases the sentence


19  by five years.  Why isn't it exactly the same thing? 


20

 MR. KNODELL:  That is -- it is alike only in the


21  superficial sense, Justice Stevens, because you're -- it


22  ignores the process that leads to the selection of that fact


23  and the way that fact is weighed, and the way it's used.


24

 QUESTION:  But Martin -- did Martin?  I thought that


25  in the Washington system, if the defendant disagrees, the


30


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  judge says I think you did this cruelly, in the presence of a


2  child, the defendant is then entitled to have a hearing at


3  which evidence is presented and the judge has to make that


4  decision about the additional time on the basis of a record.


5

 And he has to -- he applies it, it's true, not


6  beyond a reasonable doubt, but preponderance of the evidence. 


7  But it is based on a finding of fact. 


8

 MR. KNODELL:  That's correct.  It's based on a


9  finding of fact, but the finding of fact is not the whole


10  picture.  After selecting the fact, making the finding, then


11  the judge has to determine whether it's substantial and


12  compelling.  Whether this crime is atypical, whether it


13  differs substantially from other crimes of the same type. 


14  That is 


15

 QUESTION:  Whatever else he does, the fact is,


16  you're being sent up the river for an additional three years,


17  on the basis of a fact finding by a judge that more likely


18  than not you were carrying a gun.  More likely than not you


19  were cruel to this woman.  That doesn't trouble you?


20

 MR. KNODELL:  It -- it's the same process, Justice


21  Scalia, that you went through in Williams.  In Williams, you


22  had the judge making the determination of fact finding that


23  went beyond the -- what was 


24

 QUESTION:  But the legislature hadn't put an


25  intermediate level on what he could do without the additional


31


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  finding, which you have here. 

2

 MR. KNODELL:  That's right.  What I want to 

3  emphasize to you, is that that limited -- that limited 

4  jurisdiction is for the purpose only of ensuring that the 

5  reasons that are multi-varied, which could be anything, do not 

6  violate the principles of Apprendi, which do not lead to the 

7  defendant being punished for some crime that he wasn't 

8  convicted of. 

9

 QUESTION:  But it is correct that that intermediate 

10  limit is something he cannot go above, unless he makes an 

11  additional finding of fact?  It's not been established at that 

12  point. 

13

 MR. KNODELL:  That's true.  And I would simply add 

14  he has to make a finding of fact, he has to select which fact 

15  is relevant and then he's got to find that fact is substantial 

16  and compelling.  In the same way that a sentencing judge in an 

17  indeterminate would do.  The 

18

 QUESTION:  This is a pretty hefty -- I mean if we 

19  look at it in practical terms, on the night of incarceration, 

20  this was 30 months added on, right?  So it was about a third 

21  of the total sentence? 

22

 MR. KNODELL:  That's correct.  By my computation 

23  however, under kidnaping, if this had been kidnaping I, it 

24  would have been more in the nature of 150 months.  It would 

25  substantially exceed the sentencing cap. 

32


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION:  But he didn't plead to -- he pled to


2  kidnaping II.


3

 MR. KNODELL:  He pled and he was specifically told,


4  Justice Ginsburg, that he could receive up to 10 years, and


5  that the court had the right to go up to that amount if the


6  court found aggravating circumstances.  And he knew that there


7  would be a hearing. 


8

 So I -- I think what's important there, is not so


9  much what the number was, but how it was reached.  If it was


10  reached in a way that basically -- and I don't think mimic,


11  but was similar to the traditional sentencing process, but it


12  was simply structured by the -- structured by the legislature


13  and require the judges to enunciate a reason solely for


14  purpose, not as a hurdle to it, not as a prerequisite to the


15  exercise of jurisdiction beyond the standard range, but more


16  as a way for reviewing courts to make sure that the trial


17  court was not infringing upon the very limited limitations of


18  the Sentencing Reform Act. 


19

 And I think it's substantially different than


20  Apprendi.  And it does not violate the Sixth Amendment and


21  that is the way that our supreme court described -- describes


22  this and interprets the Sentencing Reform Act.  I think that's


23  due -- due some deference by this Court. 


24

 If you take a look at Baldwin, for example, you see


25  Baldwin describing the process -- excuse me, as one where the


33

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  only restriction on the court's discretion is a requirement to


2  articulate a substantial compelling reason for the imposing a


3  sentence.  That the guidelines are intended only to structure


4  discretionary decisions affecting sentences that they don't


5  specify any particular result. 


6

 And that makes this, I think, substantially


7  different from the kind of enhancements that we're involving 


8  -- or even the firearm enhancement that Mr. Blakely received


9  here.


10

 QUESTION:  Are there any states, or many states,


11  where juries hear as many as 10 factors as part of their


12  determination, and then make special findings in the matters?


13

 MR. KNODELL:  I don't know of any and I would


14  suggest to Your Honor that that kind of a system is really


15  impractical for a number of reasons, we take it.  If we


16  separate the logistical problems here, there's some real


17  structural problems with that. 


18

 In a state like ours where crimes almost have to be


19  pled.  You would basically be left with a system, where the


20  prosecutor can tell the Judge, can tell the jury, dictate to


21  them what sentencing factors will or will not be considered. 


22  When you instruct the jury you have to tailor a -- some kind


23  of instruction that would somehow try to approximate the kind


24  of wide range in discretion the Judge has.  I would suggest to


25  you

 QUESTION:  I thank you, Mr. Knodell. 


 Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you. 


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DREEBEN


 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE


 MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it please


6  the Court: 


7

 Sentencing guideline systems, like the State of


8  Washington's and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines fulfil


9  valuable functions in regularizing the sentencing process, and


10  are distinctly different from the systems that this Court


11  considered in Apprendi and Ring. 


12

 QUESTION:  Do you agree that the two standards


13  together, that if this is invalid, the Federal Sentencing


14  Guidelines are invalid?


15

 MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Scalia, the United States will


16  argue if this Court applies Apprendi to the Washington


17  guideline system, that it should not be further extended to


18  the administrative guidelines that are created by the


19  sentencing commission. 


20

21

22

 QUESTION:  The answer is no, you don't agree.


 MR. DREEBEN:  The answer is 


 QUESTION:  You think it is possible to uphold the


23  sentencing guidelines and yet find this to be unlawful.


24

 MR. DREEBEN:  I think it's possible and the United


25  States will certainly contend that this Court apply

1

 QUESTION:  But you don't mean it's easily -- it's


2  not 


3

 QUESTION:  It is consistent with what we said in


4  Apprendi, isn't it?


5

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, there are some obstacles to it


6  that the Court should be aware of before it concludes that


7  Apprendi can easily be applied to Washington and not to the


8  Federal guidelines.  Under Federal law Section 3553 (b) of


9  Title 18 the sentencing courts are required to impose a


10  sentence of the kind and within the range specified by the


11  sentencing commission.  So there is an act of Congress that


12  requires that the sentencing guidelines be applied. 


13

 QUESTION:  The sentencing commission is in the


14  judicial branch.


15

16

 MR. DREEBEN:  For administrative purposes 


 QUESTION:  That was a very important part of our


17  opinion upholding the sentencing commission.  It's in the


18  judicial branch, because Congress said so. 


19

 MR. DREEBEN:  The sentencing guidelines themselves


20  are not self-operative.  They come into play for the


21  sentencing courts direction, because of an independent Federal


22  statute.  In addition, there are situations which Congress has


23  given very detailed direction to the sentencing commission


24  about the type of guidelines that Congress.....


25

 QUESTION:  How are the members of the sentencing


36


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  commission appointed?


2

 MR. DREEBEN:  They're appointed by the President and


3  confirmed by the Senate.  And they do not include only members


4  of the Article 3 branch.  In addition to that Congress has on


5  occasion 


6

 QUESTION:  But they are -- the commission is in the


7  judicial branch.  You acknowledge that.  You argued that in


8  the case, or the government argued that in the case, right?


9

10

11

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, certainly, Justice Scalia.


 QUESTION:  It is the judicial branch.


 MR. DREEBEN:  The Court held it in the judicial


12  branch but the question is, what status the guidelines have,


13  not which branch the commission is in. 


14

 QUESTION:  So what is your distinction.  Look where


15  I end up.  Apprendi rests on a perception that where a fact is


16  found that means a longer time in jail.  It's unfair, not to


17  have the jury find it.  That's a true perception. 


18

 So if you're not going to follow that across the


19  board, there has to be a good reason for not following it. 


20  And the reason is, that if you do follow it, you end up with a


21  pure charge event system, all power to the prosecutor, very


22  bad and unfair.  Or California, indeterminate sentencing where


23  people rot forever at the judge's discretion, or a multi-jury


24  system which is impossible to work with. 


25

 So that's why you can't follow the perception. 


37


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Practical reasons.  But if you're going to limit Apprendi,


2  you're then going to have to find what are  - in terms of the


3  principle, arbitrary distinction.  One such arbitrary


4  distinction is it matters whether it was a group of judges


5  called the commission or the Congress itself that set the


6  lower limit before the departure. 


7

 Another arbitrary suggestion is going to be the one


8  you're going to suggest, and that's what I want to know what


9  it is.


10

 MR. DREEBEN:  Thank you for the lead in, Justice


11  Breyer.  I think that the best way for the Court to look at


12  the problem of sentencing guideline systems is to understand


13  the penalty systems fall on a continuum.  At one end of the


14  continuum are the kinds of statutes that the Court had before


15  it, Williams versus New York, in which judicial findings about


16  fact were critical to what sentence a defendant actually


17  received and those findings were not subjected to a jury


18  trial, or proof beyond a reasonable doubt guarantee.


19

 QUESTION:  Not only that but the judge didn't even


20  have to make any findings.  He could have just said his name


21  is Smith, so I'm going to give him 20 years.


22

 MR. DREEBEN:  I think that that would probably have


23  been reversed even at 


24

 QUESTION:  I don't think so at that time, there was


25  very little appellate review of sentencing on Williams that


38


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  was decided.


2

 MR. DREEBEN:  Very little but sheer arbitrariness


3  would probably not have sufficed even under Williams.  But 


4

 QUESTION:  Well, he was foolish enough to say that,


5  you know I don't like the way you comb your hair.  But he


6  wouldn't say that.  He would just say, you know, 40 years. 


7

8

9

 MR. DREEBEN:  What he did 


 QUESTION:  He didn't have to give a reason.


 MR. DREEBEN:  But what happened in fact in Williams


10  is critical.  The judge made findings that this defendant had


11  a long arrest record, he posed a future danger to the


12  community and he therefore deserved a longer sentence.  And


13  those were facts.  They were ascertained by a judge. 


14

 And there's no dispute in this Court's jurisprudence


15  that facts that are ascertained by a judge, when the judge has


16  wide open discretion in a long range are not subject to


17  Apprendi.  The facts.....


18

 QUESTION:  Not only does he have wide open


19  discretion, but he has no obligation to make those findings. 


20  He did make them in that case, but there was nothing in the


21  statute that required him to.


22

 MR. DREEBEN:  But what the legislature expects,


23  Justice Stevens, when it gives wide ranges to judges, is that


24  they will exercise their discretion based on facts to sentence


25  the most serious offenders at the top of the range and the


39


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  least serious 


2

 QUESTION:  That's what they expect under sentencing


3  guidelines and what they expect today.  It's not what they


4  expected when Williams was decided.


5

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Stevens, what I would


6  submit to the Court is that when a legislature established a


7  wide range, say, 10 to 30 years in prison for a particular


8  offense, it expected that the judges that heard criminal cases


9  would use their experience and discretion to take into account


10  all of the circumstances of the offense and the offender and


11  determine whether rehabilitation and retribution were properly


12  served by a longer sentence, or a least harsh sentence. 


13

 And they did this, in the expectation of calling on


14  judicial wisdom based on particular facts.  What they 


15

 QUESTION:  But it wasn't just facts, you left a lot


16  of discretion to the judge.  If the judge thought that this


17  particular crime was becoming rampant in this community the


18  judge could decide we need to make an example.  And for that


19  reason give the individual the maximum.  It wasn't just fact


20  findings.  The judge had a whole lot of discretion, he had


21  sentencing discretion. 


22

 It was really up to him whether this crime, not just


23  considering the facts of the crime, but considering the needs


24  of society, should be given a longer or a shorter sentence.


25

 MR. DREEBEN:  I

1

2

 QUESTION:  It's a different system.


 MR. DREEBEN:  I agree with that, and it was a large


3  purpose of the sentencing guideline system to provide some


4  centralization for the policy decisions that are made in


5  sentencing to ensure uniformity, and proportionality.  But


6  this is what's critical for purposes of the Apprendi decision


7  here, also room for individualization. 


8

 Based on the judge's traditional perception, that


9  there are things in the record, or in the character of this


10  defendant that were not taken into account by the legislature


11  and that the judge in the exercise of his discretion will


12  determine, deserve a higher or a shorter sentence.  Now, in


13  the context of 


14

 QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, just answer me this.  I will


15  understand the government's position if you give me an answer


16  to this question.  If you do you not think that the meaning of


17  the Sixth Amendment which guarantees trial by jury, if you


18  don't think that the meaning is, that every fact which is


19  essential to the length of sentence that you receive must be


20  found by the jury, if that's not what it means, what does it


21  mean.


22

23

 MR. DREEBEN:  It means 


 QUESTION:  What is the limitation upon the


24  legislature's ability to require facts to be found and yet


25  those facts not to be found by the jury. 


41


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 MR. DREEBEN:  It means, Justice Scalia, that the


2  facts -- that the legislature itself identifies as warranting


3  the harsher punishment shall be found by the jury.  But when


4  the legislature says to the judge, impose a sentence in the


5  standard range, unless you in your discretion determine that


6  there are circumstances that take the case outside the


7  standard range, or outside the heartland. 


8

 In that event, the judge may exercise his discretion


9  to go up to what the legislature determines is the statutory


10  maximum, then what the judge's -- what the legislature has


11  attempted to do, is combine a system that will regularize and


12  provide some uniformity but at the same time import that


13  Williams discretion, the traditional discretion that this


14  Court has recognized is consistent with the Sixth Amendment.


15

 And I submit that if in the Williams era a


16  legislature had passed a law that said, judges, we are giving


17  you a range of 10 to 50 years for this offense.  We want you


18  to figure out who should be sentenced where.  We want you to


19  find facts and make judgments that are expressed in writing so


20  that we can see what you are doing.  And we want you to put


21  the worst offenders at the top and the least worst offenders


22  at the bottom. 


23

 But this Court would not have held that those sorts


24  of inroads on judicial discretion automatically mean that the


25  Sixth Amendment kicks in.  And traditional judicial discretion


42


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  is out the window. 

2

 QUESTION:  Does that mean that the facts that are 

3  elements of the crime must be found by the jury.  The facts 

4  that are not elements of the crime, that are pertinent to 

5  punishment can be found by a judge? 

6

 MR. DREEBEN:  That is exactly right, and that is 

7  exactly what Washington purported to do when it said there are 

8  illustrative factors that we are going to put in a statute 

9  that replicate what we know judges have traditionally done, 

10  but we are not eliminating your discretion to find other 

11  facts.  This is a nonexclusive list.  We want to call upon 

12

 QUESTION:  What determines whether a fact is -- it's 

13  so facile it's a wonderful solution.  What determines whether 

14  a fact is an element of the crime or not? 

15

16

 MR. DREEBEN:  Precisely what you 

 QUESTION:  You get whacked another five years, 

17  another five years for it.  But the legislature says, oh this 

18  is not an element of the crime.  It's just a sentencing 

19  factor.  What -- how do you separate the element of the crime 

20  from sentencing factors? 

21

 MR. DREEBEN:  It's not a label.  It is a consequence 

22  of the effect when the legislature says these are the facts 

23  that are necessary.  Here's the set, you use a gun, you engage 

24  in deliberate cruelty, you have a certain quantity of drugs, 

25  you have one of those facts, and nothing else can justify a 

43


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  sentence above the standard range.  That would define the


2  standard range as a statutory maximum. 


3

 But that's not what Washington does and that's not


4  what the Federal sentencing guidelines do.  What those systems


5  do is say, here are some illustrative facts for your


6  consideration.  But we are not going to cabin your discretion


7  to identify additional aggravating circumstances in the


8  exercise of the time immemorial judicial prerogative to look


9  at all of the facts of the case in the sentencing.  And go up


10  to what we have legislated as the statutory maximums. 


11

 QUESTION:  But it used to -- they have cabined it,


12  judges can be reversed.  If they give the additional penalty


13  in a manner that is not permitted by the sentencing


14  guidelines, or here by Washington's system.  Don't say they


15  haven't cabined it and they have? 


16

 MR. DREEBEN:  They have cabined.  They have cabined


17  it.


18

19

 QUESTION:  It's reversible.


 MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Scalia, but my point of the -­


20  the point of my hypothetical in which the legislature says to


21  the sentencing judge, find facts, put the worse offenders at


22  the top, apply the following three policies of sentencing. 


23  Proportionality, retribution, and rehabilitation.


24

 QUESTION:  Okay.  So it used to be that the answer


25  to the elements question was the people will decide what's an


44


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  element through their elected representatives.  But after


2  Apprendi we have to find some other way, all right.  So you're


3  saying, well, if it is a delegation from the legislature, use


4  your judgment, as judges used to do in sentencing, and find


5  those facts in the process.  It's not an element, it's


6  relevant to sentencing.  Is that the key?


7

8

9

10

 MR. DREEBEN:  That's right.


 QUESTION:  Have I got the key?


 MR. DREEBEN:  If the delegation 


 QUESTION:  Rephrase it, because I'm trying to get


11  the precise key to what -- to what it is.  I said general -­


12  I'm using general policies, that isn't the right word.  What's


13  your word?


14

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Breyer, if what the


15  legislature does is say to the judge, here's a standard range,


16  but you in the exercise of your discretion identifying whether


17  a factor takes the case outside what the sentencing commission


18  calls the heartland, what Washington calls the standard range,


19  then in that event you may go up to what we have defined as


20  the statutory maximum. 


21

 And by doing that, by calling upon judicial


22  discretion to consider unspecified factors, the legislature


23  has not erected surrogate elements, which is what the Court


24  found in Apprendi. 


25

 QUESTION:  Is that the nub of your argument?  That


45


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Apprendi is concerned with the erosion of jury trial, by the


2  combined efforts of the legislative and the executive branches


3  and we don't have to worry about the erosion of jury trial if


4  the operative determinations are left entirely within judicial


5  discretion, is that what you're argument boils down to?


6

 MR. DREEBEN:  That is what it boils down to, Justice


7  Souter, because we're starting from a spectrum at which one


8  end lies Williams versus New York, in which the Court fully


9  accepted that it is entirely constitutional for a judge to


10  say, in my courtroom if you commit a kidnaping and you engage


11  in deliberate cruelty which I'm going to find by a


12  preponderance of the evidence, you're going to get the


13  maximum.


14

 QUESTION:  All right.  If that in fact is the


15  position, then I take it, it is open to a legislature in a


16  case like this to say, instead of having a formal maximum


17  range, I forget what it is, but from zero to 10 years, we're


18  going to make it zero to 100 years, and we're going to leave


19  everything else to the discretion of the judiciary, and


20  Apprendi in effect will be a dead letter. 


21

 But your argument is that's okay, because we're not


22  worrying about the judiciary.  Is that what it is, is that


23  what it boils down to?


24

 MR. DREEBEN:  I think that follows directly from


25  Williams versus New York, and it's an additional reason why


46


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  this Court should be very reluctant to apply Apprendi to


2  sentencing guideline systems.  Washington would not have to


3  react to a decision applying Apprendi to its guidelines the


4  way Kansas did.  Washington could decide that, all right, if


5  the problem is that our standard range created a top of a


6  statutory maximum term, we're just going to do away with the


7  top of the standard range, and we'll leave it to judicial


8  discretion, with the following policy statements to give some


9  guidance to what they do.


10

 QUESTION:  I think you understated the prior -- the


11  prior system.  Because -- the Williams system, it wasn't just


12  the judge could say, if you kidnap and are cruel to your


13  victims I'll give you the maximum.  He could say I -- in my


14  court if you kidnap, you get the max.  I mean there were


15  judges around you know, known as Maximum John. 
 If you


16  committed a certain crime you would get the maximum.  That's a


17  different system than what we have now.

 QUESTION:  Thank you, Justice Scalia.  Mr. Dreeben. 


 Mr. Fisher, you have four minutes.


 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR. FISHER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  I think


23  it's important to make two points about Washington law, lest


24  the Court be left with any confusion.  The first is, the


25  Washington legislature has most definitely not left it up to


47


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Washington judges to depart upward for any reason they want.


2  They have not left it entirely up to the judges' discretion. 


3

 A judge has to find, as the judge in this case did,


4  one of the eleven listed factors or one that is analogous to


5  those eleven factors.  And there are case after case in


6  Washington, or appellate decisions saying this aggravating


7  fact is not good enough. 


8

 But if the Gore decision, and the Cardenas decision


9  both cited in my briefs.  Another example is Barnes -- the


10  Barnes decision at 818 P.2d 1088 in which for example the


11  Washington Supreme Court said future dangerous which is a


12  common aggravating factor in other contexts, it's not a valid


13  aggravating factor in Washington in most kinds of crimes


14  because the legislature did not list that out. 


15

 And in fact what the Washington Supreme Court said


16  there, is they said, if we were to find that we would be


17  giving ourselves too much discretion back for the very point


18  of the Sentencing Reform Act was to take discretion away from


19  us, to go above the standard sentencing range.


20

 The second point about Washington law is, Mr.


21  Knodell is right, that there is some discretion built into the


22  system, but that discretion kicks in only after the judge has


23  made the required factual finding.  In that respect the system


24  is just like the one in Ring where the aggravating fact is


25  necessary but not sufficient for the ultimate sentence.  The


48


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Judge still can in his discretion  - this, Justice Breyer,


2  goes to your question, the judge still once the jury or the


3  proper fact finder makes all the required factual findings,


4  the judge can still consider all the facts in the case, and go


5  anywhere below that new maximum that's been established. 


6

 So judicial discretion is still retained in Kansas'


7  system and it would be retained in Washington's system.  And


8  the final thing I'd like to say is that Mr. Dreeben's point


9  that this case is different than Ring because the fact that


10  they're illustrative rather than exclusive would lead to


11  Apprendi simply being a mere formality because all the


12  legislature would have to do, for example in the Ring case, is


13  have factor number 11 that says anything similar to the others


14  on this list. 


15

 Then you'd have people saying, well, judges can do


16  just about what they were doing, which was finding one of


17  those 10 factors, but because there's factor 11, that says


18  something similar to this is also good enough that Apprendi


19  somehow doesn't apply.  We submit that a straightforward


20  application of Apprendi as it was stated in Ring, requires a


21  reversal in this case.  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


22

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Fisher. 


23  The case is submitted.


24

 (Whereupon, at 11:08 a.m, the case in the 


25  above-entitled matter was submitted.)
