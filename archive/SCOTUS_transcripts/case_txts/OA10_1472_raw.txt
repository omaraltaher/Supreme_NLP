 Our brief lists six categories of 
12  authorities demonstrating that the work of an 
13  interpreter under 28 U.S.C. section 1920(6) is limited 
14  to spoken communication.  Primary among these is the

17  services.  When the --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I make sure that I 
18

that it's interpretation, oral interpretation, just in 
20

 MR. FRIED:  Well, Your -- Justice Sotomayor, 
22
23  I think that it's a -- that there is a textual ambiguity 
24  in the statute about the extent of covered spoken

MR. FRIED:  Court-appointed experts, Your 

Honor? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I have to say that 

1  and we don't -- I am happy to proceed under either 
2  assumption.  But what's clear is that, however far it 
3  extends within the area of spoken interpretation, 
4  document translation is --
5
6  if you read it the way you do, then what you're 
7  suggesting is that for appointed experts, they only get 
8  recompensed for the time they're testifying, because 
9  that's the only time they spend in court. 
10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes.

 MR. FRIED:  I think the -- the legislative 
14  history of that seems to indicate that that provision 
15

17  the Federal Rules of Evidence, which was a pre-existing 
18  rule addressing court-appointed experts, and simply put 
19  it into the enumeration. 
20
21

 Given that the courts for 70 years have been 

 MR. FRIED:  Of course. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I take all your 

1  question. 
2
3
4  arguments, but I read the common dictionary and there's 
no question that the primary meaning of "interpreter" is 
5
6  interpretation of oral languages.  But the dictionary is 
7  broad enough to include translation work as well. 
8
9  awarding -- most of the them except for I think the 
Seventh here.  Virtually every court over a 70-year 
10
11 
period has been awarding translation fees as -- as 
12 
authorized.  Why shouldn't that be enough for us? 
13

dictionary term is broad enough and that's what the 
15
16  courts have been doing and the world hasn't crashed 
17  despite one case where a large amount was given -- your 
18  adversary points to the fact that most of the 
19  translation fees tend to be fairly reasonable.  Why

11  who have adopted this construction of 1920(6) have 
12  considered or addressed our primary arguments in this 
13  case.  They haven't addressed the -- the uniform 
14  professional literature addressing this -- this topic, 
the dictionaries in their aggregate, the Administrative 
15
16  Office's interpretation of this statute, the consistent 
17  congressional distinction between written translation 
18  and spoken -- spoken interpretation that runs throughout 
19  the code.  And --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  There are -- there are lots 
12  of regions of the country -- Puerto Rico, for example --
13  where there are vast numbers of documents that have to 
14  be translated if you go into Federal court, not 
necessarily in the Commonwealth courts.  That's 
15
16  expensive to people.  And they might have thought for a 
17  long time, while that expense won't go away, it's at 
18  least better to have it paid by the loser than to have 
19  it paid by the winner.

language in this, which is to go back -- go back to 
Justice Sotomayor. 

That's been the common practice.  I don't

criminal defendants not understanding the spoken

elected to pay for spoken interpreter services directly 
in the first instance.

2  These provisions operate together in a uniform set of --
3  as a uniform set of policies for addressing a common 
4  subject.

civil litigation, the Congress elected not to pay for

that when the Congress was addressing written 
translation, which was part of the -- part of that 
provision, it specifically used the word "translation" 
to refer to that. 

1  document that comes into the Federal court in San Juan, 
2  you have to have it translated very often.  And so, the 
3  translation cost is at least consistent with the idea 
4  there of trying to -- well, you may -- you don't have

 MR. FRIED:  Well, Justice Breyer, there was 
7  actually a specific provision in this bill -- in a prior 
8  version of this bill that addressed the context of 
9  Puerto Rico.  And the significance of that provision is 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  between these terms in -- in statutes generally was 
17  fully applicable here, that the Congress knew the 
18  difference between these terms, used them appropriately. 
19  And the fact that having removed that -- that provision 
from the statute, the statute as passed contains only 
20
21  the words "interpreter" and "interpretation," and no 
22  forms of "translate," just again reaffirms that -- that 
23  the ordinary meaning of these terms should apply. 
24  And --
25

 And this just, again, confirms that the --

that the usual congressional practice of differentiating

proceeding. 

1  that's -- that's read out in open court and it's a 

2  document, a contract, in another language, and the 

3  interpreter -- the witness presents the document, and 

4  the interpreter interprets it? 

MR. FRIED:  Your Honor, the professional 
5
6  literature addresses this as sight interpretation or 
7  sight translation, and it's uniformly recognized to be a 
8  species of interpretation.  It occurs -- the -- the 
9  interpreter speaks aloud in the presence of the audience 
10
11 
12
13  the interpreter, being diligent, said I'm going to 
14  have to translate this document in open court, I'd like 
15
16  translation is going to be accurate?  So that in fact 
17  the interpreter looks at the document and, in -- in 
18  preparation for the trial, translates it. 
19
20
21  court would not be compensable interpretation work.  But 
22  when the -- when the interpreter returned to court and 
23  gave the oral interpretation of that document, that 
24  would constitute interpretation.  But --
25

to have it in advance so I can be sure that my 

 MR. FRIED:  Well, Your Honor, I think that

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, I misunderstood 

1  she's not interpreting it.  She's already got the thing 
2  in whatever language they're -- English, I guess.  But, 
3  I mean, she's not interpreting; she's reading the 
4  English translation. 
5
6  but the key reason why that would constitute 
7  interpretation is because the -- the interpreter is 
8  speaking aloud, communicating in the course of a spoken 
9  conversation to an audience who -- who doesn't speak

20
21 
 MR. FRIED:  Well, Your Honor, I think that 
22
23  the literature does typically class the in-court oral 
24  communication of its content as a form of 
25

situation where you've got a -- a document in -- in, 
say, French and the person translates it or interprets 
it -- I don't want to prejudge the issue -- and -- and 
then -- in English and then the person reads the English 
thing in -- in court.  That's not interpretation at any 
point, is it? 

interpretation.  But any ambiguity on this point

4
matter of common usage, when we are talking about oral 
5
6  testimony in court, we often use "interpretation" and 
7  "translation" or "interpreter" and "translator" somewhat 
8  interchangeably, but when we're talking about rendering 
9  a document into -- into a different language, we 
generally talk about that as "translation"?  This is a 
10
11  matter of common usage.  Do you think that's correct? 
12
13  correctly, yes.  I think that the ordinary meaning of 
14  "translate" applies to the context of -- of the 
communication of information in written documents.  And 
15
16  it's discrete from "interpretation," which -- which is 
17  limited to the spoken --
18
19  the question. 
20
21 
 MR. FRIED:  I'm sorry. 
22
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My point was that I think 
23
24  we say -- in fact, in a Supreme Court case, we've said 
25

in the Hernandez case, when we're talking about oral 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you didn't understand 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That wasn't quite my 

point. 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. FRIED:  Oh, I apologize, Your Honor. 


Yes, there -- you can use the word "translate" 

1  testimony in court, we tend to use "translator" or 

2  "translate" and "interpreter" or "interpret" somewhat 

3  interchangeably.  Is that correct? 

4
5
6  generically.  There's no question.  Frequently in court, 
7  and I think out of court as well, that some people can 
8  use the word "translate" in a manner that doesn't 
9  differentiate between modes.  Our point is that that --
that double meaning doesn't apply to "interpreter," 
10
11  which has a single narrow meaning limited to spoken 
12  communication. 
13
 And Kan Pacific's discussion of the 
14  dictionaries is limited to a single dictionary, 
Webster's Third.  The majority of dictionaries 
15
16  categorically exclude document translation from the 
17  scope of --
18
19  recall, is the dictionary that defines "imply" to mean 
20
21
22
23  "imply." 
24
25

 MR. FRIED:  It does, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- and "infer" to mean 

 It's not a very good dictionary.

"infer" --

 MR. FRIED:  Well, the Court in the MCI -- in 

 But in any event, the -- on its terms, that 

because it does indicate, even as to that dictionary 

interpretation, as it did in Mallard in construing the 
word "request," and in Ramsey in construing the word 
"envelope." 

1
2  the MCI v. AT&T case did indicate that. 
3
4  definition supports our reading over Kan Pacific's 
5
6  definition, that the -- that the most common meaning of 
7  the term is the meaning referring to spoken 
8  communication.  And this Court frequently looks to the 
9  most common meaning for purposes of statutory 
10
11 
12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could we get back to the 
14  issue?  In the legislative history of this provision, is 
15
16  translation work from its coverage? 
17
18  the text does.  I mean, the text --
19
20
21  congressional bill or the study --
22
23
24  statement that I'm aware of in the legislative history. 
There's a lot of provisions in the legislative history 
25

 MR. FRIED:  I'm not -- I'm sorry. 
 I'm not sure that there's an explicit 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Outside of the text.  Is 

there a statement by one of the sponsors in the

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Those are the other 

provisions that they passed with respect to --

 MR. FRIED:  Well, specifically with respect 

Rule 43(d)'s cost provision is -- is limited to spoken 
communication of interpreters.  So, there is that in the 
history as well. 

1  which plainly presuppose that.  And the Congress 
2  received professional literature from -- documents from 
3  the American Association of Language Specialists. 
4
5
6
7  to costs, the Congress -- the House Report alludes to 
8  Rule 43(f), which is now 43(d), as a relevant 
9  pre-existing rule.  And, of course, it's undisputed that 
10
11 
12 
13
 But I think that there's no doubt that in 
14  the -- under the text of the statute, subsection (k), 
the modes subsection, which appears at page 5a of the 
15
16  red brief appendix, as it was initially passed, 
17  expressly says that the interpretation under -- under 
18  this section must be done using methods that all 
19  agree are limited to spoken communication.

6  interpreter would not be communicating between live 
7  parties in the context of a real-time proceeding.

13  courtroom, but not outside. 
14
15
16
17  logical about this? 
 MR. FRIED:  Yes, Your Honor, because in the 
18
19  courtroom, in the context of a live spoken proceeding, 
that satisfies all of the ordinary definitional elements 
20
21  of interpreting.  But that's not the case in somebody's 
22  office in the presence of a single party and a written 
23  document.

indicates that the word is restricted to people who work 
in trial.  But I certainly think that it could be argued 
either way, in a case where --

1  unusual examples, this is a distinction that's 
2  absolutely clear in the vast majority of real-world 
3  incidents. 
4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let me ask you this 

MR. FRIED:  Well, Your Honor, that sort of 

that we're going to have minor cases but with huge 

discretion demonstrably does not prevent the issuance of 
these large awards, because there have been a number of 
large awards issued notwithstanding that discretion. 

1  that that's certainly -- we have no vested interest in 
2  opposing that.  I mean, that --
3
4  question:  In the background here, is there some concern 
5
6  translation costs, and it would be simply unfair?  And 
7  if the answer to that is "yes," isn't that taken care of 
8  by the statutory direction that the court "may" give 
9  costs? 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16
17  Honor.  The -- the district courts --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I mean, in other 
18
19  words, if the court sees that the cost of preparing 
documents into an English-language is quite substantial 
20
21  in light of what's involved in the case, and it's just 
22  not fair to -- to award them, can't that court in its 
23  discretion deny that, or is that not the way it works? 
24
 MR. FRIED:  That's the way it works, Your

4  after a litigant has already decided whether to bring

approaching anywhere near some of the larger document 
translation awards that have been issued.  But 
nonetheless, I am not denying that there could be large 
interpreter awards in some cases.  But the fact is that 
adding on document translation awards is additive.

cost provision.  And it notes that section 2 sometimes

12  argument I might make along these lines.  As originally

14  word "interpreter," not counting the title.  And of 
those 26 uses, 24 simply use the word "interpreter" by

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB 


 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 


 MR. HIMMELFARB:  Thank you, 


 If there are no further questions, I'll 


The word "interpreter" has two possible 
meanings that are relevant here, a broader one and a 
narrower one.  The broader meaning is a person who 
translates from one language to another.  Under this 
definition, the terms "interpreter" and "translator" are 
used interchangeably.

17  you know, translated from a foreign language, you know, 
18  "War and Peace," you know, and you're at the mercy of 
19  what we call the translator, and it says on the fly 
page, you know, "John Smith," comma, "Trans.," period. 
20
21  Does it ever say "John Smith," comma, "Int.," period? 
22
 MR. HIMMELFARB:  It's used in the narrower 
23  sense in that context, I think, Justice Scalia.  The 
24  narrower meaning of "interpreter" is member of a 
25

profession that specializes in oral translation; and in 

26
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

Our submission is that, as the great 

The first is that the basic purpose of 

translation in the litigation context is to make 
evidence intelligible to the parties and the court. 
Section 1920 reflects a congressional judgment that the 
cost of making evidence intelligible to the parties and 
the court can be borne by the losing party. 

1  that narrower sense, an interpreter is distinct from a 
2  translator, which is the sense you've just identified, 
3  which is a person who specializes in written 
4  translation. 
5
6  majority of courts who've expressed a view on this 
7  question have recognized, the broader definition makes 
8  more -- more sense in the particular context at issue 
9  here.  And we say that for a number of reasons. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, it doesn't.  It

18  "interpreter" means "translator."

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, you're begging the 
question.  You could say that the one should embrace the 
other.  But whether Congress thought that or not is 
mostly dependent on the language Congress used, isn't 
it? 

MR. HIMMELFARB:  Well, let me be as clear as

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why does your-- why does your 

statute. 


is it most likely that Congress would have intended in 

1  I possibly can.  I'm obviously not standing here saying 

2  we lose under the language, but it would be a good idea 

3  for the statute to cover written translation.  That's 

4  not a legitimate enterprise for a court interpreting a 

5
6
 What I'm saying is that the text of the 

7  statute bears two -- permissibly bears two possible 

8  meanings.  That being the case, it is a legitimate 

9  enterprise for the Court to say which makes sense, which 

10
11  this particular context? 
12
13  interpretation make sense?  Shouldn't we view this 
14  against the backdrop of the American rule on fees, that 
15
each party generally bears its own costs and only in 
16  specific circumstances does the loser pay?  Now, the 
17  taxation of costs is a very narrow concept. 
18
 What is the difference between a case in 
19  which a lot of documents have to be rendered from one 
20
language to another prior to the court proceeding and a 
21  case in which there's a mass of scientific evidence that 
22  has to be interpreted by a scientist or financial 
23  evidence that has to be interpreted by an accountant? 
24  In those instances, the losing party doesn't pay for the 
25

winner's expenses, does it?

3  essentially, as I understand it, isn't there a 

4  background principle that says costs don't get taxed?  I 

5
actually think insofar as far as tax -- costs are 
6  concerned, as distinct from attorney's fees, the 
7  background principle actually goes the other way. 
8
9  taxed, but costs are very narrow.  They are a very small 
10
11  Isn't that -- isn't that true? 
12
13  true, but I don't think that it follows -- it follows in 
14  any way that there is some sort of tie-breaking 
15
interpretive canon that says when you're interpreting 
16  the costs statute, some version of which has been in 
17  effect since the middle of the 19th century, if you're 
18  unsure about the scope of it, that you err on the side 
19  of narrowness rather than breadth.  I just don't think 
20
21
22  an interpretive principle that errs on the side of 
23  breadth rather than narrowness? 
24

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  No, we don't.

there's any such interpretive principle.  And --

6  possible ordinary definitions.  You have two possible

10
11
12  to dispute that.  We have Webster's, which, you know, 
13  Justice Scalia's view notwithstanding, is viewed by many 
14  people as an authoritative dictionary of English 
language.  We've got Black's Law Dictionary, which I 
15
16  think everyone agrees is the leading law dictionary, 
17  which provides as a definition of "interpreter" the 
18  broad definition that we advocate here.  To be sure --

things that concerns me is the impact of -- of cost 
allowance on the normal litigation incentives.  An 
interpreter in court is one thing.  When you suddenly 
get a situation where the costs could be quite large, 
particularly in a -- in a disparate way, not necessarily 
shared by both sides -- somebody goes into court; they 
know they're going to have to -- if they lose, they'll 
have to pay an interpreter this.  And the other side 
comes in and says, well, we think we need to submit this 
10,000 pages of -- of documents, which will have to be 
translated, and by the way, if you lose, you're going to 
pay for that. 

 In other words, it is a much more variable

one of --

1  true.  I think in large litigations where you have many, 
2  many days of trial and potentially pretrial proceedings, 
3  you could have very large oral translation costs.  Where 
4  there are many depositions, you could have large oral 
5
6
 But even if I were to accept the premise of 
7  your question, it seems to me that the way these costs

14
15
16  taxing costs of every sort, not just interpreter costs 
17  and not just document translation costs, are essentially 
18  thought to be necessity and reasonableness.  So, in 
19  connection with document translation costs, the Fifth 
20
21  appropriate way to tax them, might be just to tax the 
22  cost of translating headings of foreign language 
23  documents, which should be sufficient to let the lawyer 
24  know whether this is a relevant document that might bear 
25

further translation, and then only the documents that

specifically use the word "necessarily," come not from 
that term, but rather from the word "may" in the first 
sentence of the provision, which in tandem with Rule 54 
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, essentially 
make this a discretionary call for the district court. 
Necessity has long been recognized as one of the 
components of that discretionary determination.

JUSTICE BREYER:  What do you think on the --

is that, prior to '78, a serious number -- some number 
of circuits said you can get the translation paid for 
under -- as -- as being necessary to create a copy 
that's usable in court.  All right.  Then Congress 
passes this, knowing of those cases in principle.  And 
then there is a shift after Congress passes this, and 
then the majority of courts say, all right, this is the 
provision that permits it.  Is that an accurate 
statement? 

MR. HIMMELFARB:  I think that is accurate. 

Before 1978, some of the courts that taxed document 
translation costs, I believe, also relied on their 
inherent authority, which at the time was thought to be 
a permissible ground for taxing costs.

7
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, in every other case in 
8  which the U.S. Code uses the word, "interpreters" means

particular document translation should be taxed, which 
is one of the arguments on the other side.  I think the 
history of this is strong evidence that it's not 
difficult. 

1  I've been trying to think of where there was a history 
2  of doing something?  A statute comes along that makes it 
3  a little tougher for the judges to do it, and then the 
4  Court says either, sorry, too tough now, or it says let 
5

8  question of, you know, whether it's difficult for

 But I don't think it's entirely irrelevant 

courts were taxing document translation costs before 

1  way that practice has given them meaning? 
2
 MR. HIMMELFARB:  I can't think of any case 
3  off the top of my head, and I think it's true that this 
4  case is a little bit different because, insofar as 
5
6  1978, they were relying on something other than the word 
7  "interpreter."  So, it may be a stretch to say that when 
8  Congress chose to use the word "interpreter," it was 
9  necessarily incorporating what courts had previously 
10
11
12  that this has been done for a long time, and I think 
13  it's not unfair to presume that Congress would have been

An important part of Taniguchi's submission 
is that section 2 is limited to oral translators, and, 
therefore, it should follow that section 7, the 
provision at issue here, is likewise limited to oral 
translators. 

The Court Interpreters Act has two main 

provisions as relevant here.  There's section 2, which 
is really the more -- the main provision, and then 
section 7, which became 1920(6) in Title 28, which is 
the provision at issue here. 

And our main submission on that -- on that 

46
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

"Interpreters in courts of the United States" and 

"interpreters in courts of the United States," and then 
"special interpretation services." 

1  question is that Congress actually used different 
2  language in section 2 and section 7.  Section 2 added 
3  two provisions to Title 28:  section 1827 and section 
4  1828, which are titled, and which address, respectively, 
5
6  "Special interpretation services." 
7
 In section 7, which added subsection (6) to 
8  1920, Congress does not use those two phrases.  Instead, 
9  it uses the phrase "interpreters" simply, not 
10
11 
12
13  appropriate canon about the use of similar or different 
14  language in different provisions of a statute, it seems 
15
16  presume that when Congress uses different language, it 
17  intends different meanings. 
18
19  about the number of times the word "interpreter" is used 
in section 2.  And as I understand his point, is that --
20
21  it's that it's much more frequently used by itself than 
22  it is with the -- with the words "in courts of the 
23  United States." 
24
25

to us that the appropriate canon is that one should 

 What the statute actually does is add -- say 

that it's adding section 1827, which it calls

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where are you 

of the Court Interpreters Act.  And then there's 
subsection (c), flipping over to the next page -- I'm

has to certify interpreters in courts of the United 
States. 

So, what it does at the beginning of the 

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  I'm sorry.  This is the red

statute is establish this thing called a certified 
interpreter in courts of the United States.  When it 
thereafter speaks of "interpreter" simply, that's just a 
shorthand for a certified interpreter in courts of the 
United States.  So, it seems to us that as far as the 
Court Interpreters Act is concerned, even if it's true 
that section 2 uses the term in the narrower sense, it 
doesn't necessarily follow that it's used in the 
narrower sense in section 7. 

And the only point I would add about that, 

48
 

Alderson Reporting Company

And one of the main aspects, the main 

Administrative Office would publish these notices in the 

1  as we set -- point out in our brief, it's really not 
2  clear that section 2 is limited to oral translators. 
3
 Soon after the Court Interpreters Act was 
4  enacted and for approximately 16 years thereafter, the 
5
6  Federal Register notifying the public that there were 
7  going to be certification exams for interpreters under 
8  section 2 of the Court Interpreters Act.  These were 
9  pretty streamlined notices, not long at all.

12

21
22  want to make about other statutes, some of which use the 
23  term "interpreter" and "translator" together, I've 
24  already addressed that in part by saying that in many of 
those statutes, it really is pretty clearly used in the 
25

sections, of the notice, was a list of what the director 
of the Administrative Office said were the -- were the 
duties of interpreters in courts of the United States. 
And to be sure, it listed simultaneous and consecutive 
interpreting, but it -- it listed sight translation, and 
it listed document translation. 

 So, at a minimum, section 2 is not 

these notices saying otherwise. 

 I guess the -- the last point I would -- I

 The -- the only other thing I would say 

But subsection (6) of 1920 itself has a 

redundancy in it because it covers both interpreters and 
special interpretation services.  And I don't think 
anybody could dispute that anyone who carries out a 
special interpretation service is an interpreter. 

1  narrower sense because you're talking about members of a 
2  profession. 
3
4  about that is that the premise of Taniguchi's reliance 
on those statutes seems to be that it would be strangely 
5
6  redundant for Congress to speak in other statutes about 
7  interpreters and translators together, if, in fact, the 
8  two terms could be used interchangeably, and that
