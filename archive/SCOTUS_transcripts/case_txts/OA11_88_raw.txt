P R O C E E D I N G S 

(11:06 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

next in Case 11-88, Mohamad v. The Palestinian 
Authority. 

Mr. Fisher. 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY FISHER 
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. FISHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Unlike the previous case, this case does not 

involve the need to formulate Federal common law or to 
survey customary international law.  Here Congress has 
expressly created the cause of action at issue in a 
statute.  And we know that in every single other Federal 
tort statute that Congress has ever enacted, it has 
provided for organizational liability.  As, 
Justice Kennedy, I think you put it earlier, it's a 
simple concept in our country. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We usually like --
MR. FISHER:  Of course, the question --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We usually like to 

begin with the language of the statute. 

MR. FISHER:  That was my next sentence, Your 

Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then go ahead. 
(Laughter.) 
MR. FISHER:  Thank you.  But, of course, the 

question arises in this case why did Congress use the 
word "individual"?  And we think the answer comes from 
the Tel-Oren case, which is the case, of course, from 
the D.C. Circuit that gave rise to the TVPA.  And in 
that case, Judge Edwards wrote a lengthy concurrence 
where he again and again used the word "individual 
liability" and "individual" to describe the PLO, which 
was the very defendant in that case, against the 
backdrop of international law, which uses the term 
"individual" to differentiate anyone from the state. 

After Nuremberg, starting with the 

discussions were recited most prominently in our reply 
brief at pages 6 to 8, Professor Jessup and many others 
discussed whether international law applies simply 
against states or whether it applies to, quote, 
"individuals."  And the word "individual" was used again 
and again to mean anyone but the state.  And as 
Professor Jessup and many others said, it includes 
organizations and juridical persons. 

And this is the usage that Judge Edwards 

used in his opinion in Tel-Oren.  He uses the word 
"individual" 43 times in that opinion.  And if you look

at nothing else --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought Justice --

Judge Edwards' opinion was about politically motivated 
terrorists not coming within the Alien Tort Statute. 

MR. FISHER:  No.  What Judge Edwards 

concluded, Justice Ginsburg, was that, as he understood 
the Alien Tort Statute at the time against the backdrop 
of international law, that any private actor acting 
under color of law could be held liable.  And what Judge 
Edwards decided in that particular case is that the PLO 
as it then existed was not a state actor.  But the rule 
that Judge Edwards prescribed -- and this is at page 
793, I believe, of his concurrence -- was that 
individuals acting under color of law should be held 
liable.  That's the precise language that the TVPA uses. 

So, if you want to know where Congress got 
the word "individual" and what it probably thought it 
meant, the best place to look is Judge Edwards' opinion. 
Now, what --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why isnâ€™t the place --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Really?  Congress got it 

from Judge Edwards?  Gee, I -- my goodness. 

MR. FISHER:  Well, I think --

Justice Scalia, I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'll bet you none of

them -- none of them even read that opinion. 

MR. FISHER:  Well, I think Judge -- Judge 

Edwards' opinion was quite prominently read by the 
Congress then.  It's cited throughout the legislative 
history in the Senate Report, in the House Report, again 
and again in the hearings. 

And this Court -- I think in Skilling, a 
couple terms ago, this Court said we have a statute 
before us dealing with honest services.  And what did 
Congress mean when it used particular language?  Well, 
it probably meant what lower court judges had used that 
language to mean, that it was --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That is a strange phrase, 

"honest services," as -- you know, as a crime, 
deprivation of honest services.  But the word 
"individual" is not a strange --

MR. FISHER:  Well, it's a strange --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- word at all.  It's used 

all the time. 

MR. FISHER:  No, Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It means an individual. 
MR. FISHER:  I think it's a strange -- it's 
a very strange phrase in the context of a tort statute 
because we know that Congress always provides for 
organizational liability, and it has never used, to our

knowledge, the word "individual" in a tort statute.  So, 
it is odd that it appears here. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that -- is that better 

for you or worse for you? 

MR. FISHER:  Well, I think it's better for 

us in that it shows that Congress -- something is amiss. 
And I think Judge Edwards' opinion explains what is 
going on. 

Now, what my opponents want this Court to do 

is to look at other places in the U.S. Code where the 
word "individual" is used outside of international law, 
outside of tort regimes.  And we concede --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The problem --
MR. FISHER:  -- often the word 

"individual" --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The problem is I don't 
even look there.  I look to the TVPA, section 2(a)(2), 
which uses the word "person."  So, it wasn't as if in 
writing the statute Congress forgot the word "person." 

MR. FISHER:  No, it didn't. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They appear to be 

using "person" in the organizational way that "person" 
is defined in the Dictionary Act and elsewhere.  So, 
isn't that a textual clue that they were using the word 
"individual" in a different sense?

MR. FISHER:  No, Justice Sotomayor, for two 
reasons:  One is because, for reasons I'll explain, the 
word "person" as it appears in the TVPA actually only 
applies to natural persons.  Well, let me start with 
that.  The argument the other side has is that the 
word --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Individuals, legal 

representative, or to any person who may be a claimant 
in an action for wrongful death.  I'm not quite sure. 
Legal representative is often -- can be a person but can 
often also be a -- a corporate entity. 

MR. FISHER:  Well, I think the -- I think 

the argument is that the word "person" somehow contrasts 
with "individual." 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes. 
MR. FISHER:  And, as we've shown in our 
brief, only natural people can bring wrongful death 
actions.  They -- they claim -- in the D.C. Circuit 
argued that an estate could.  As we've shown in our 
brief and this Court has squarely held, only natural 
people acting as administrator or executor of a -- of an 
estate can bring an action. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Fisher --
MR. FISHER:  So, the word "person" refers to 

natural person.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You know, it's obvious that 

"individual" doesn't usually mean what you want it to 
mean.  Now, you have a theory that they all just read 
Judge Edwards, and they came in and used "individual." 
But it seems actually that we know where "individual" 
came from in this statute.  The statute started out by 
saying "person," and then there was this moment where 
one Congressman said I don't want this to apply to 
corporations, and the staff member said I have a great 
idea to make sure it doesn't apply to corporations; 
let's change the word "person" to "individual."  So, 
that's the way "individual" got into the statute, and it 
got in specifically to address this question. 

MR. FISHER:  We don't disagree with that's 

how the word gets into the statute, but the question, as 
this Court has always looked to legislative history, is 
what does that -- what light does that shed on 
Congress's understanding of the law it ultimately 
passed?  So, two Congresses later, 4 years later, 
Congress passed the statute with the word "individual." 
And the problem with that --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And "individual" means what 

it means. 

MR. FISHER:  And the problem with that 

theory, Justice Kagan, is it squarely is contradicted by

the committee reports contemporaneous with the statute 
that say we're using the word "individual" to make 
crystal clear that foreign states and their entities 
cannot be sued.  And that's the reason --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So, what else should I look 

at?  Because I've looked at the -- I did really -- I 
know I have to go through legislative history.  I've 
said it's meaningful, and so I do it. 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE BREYER:  And, so far -- so far, I 

think I have to say that you're on a weak wicket. 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE BREYER:  The -- the word "persons" 
-- when was there -- I found lots and lots of instances 
and by people in the civil -- international civil rights 
community who are testifying, where I look at what they 
say, and over and over they say a limited statute, the 
person won't often be in the United States.  Well, the 
PLO had a presence in the United States.  The person 
won't be in the United States very often.  I know, but 
sometimes he may come over here; it's important to take 
a -- make a symbolic step.  And not a word could I find, 
when they're talking even about the word "person," that 
suggested they meant even the PLO at that time.  In 
fact, they thought, well, it would be a nice thing, but,

but, but, but.... 

MR. FISHER:  Yes. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, that's the tenor of 

what I seem to have found so far.  So, I mention that 
because you will point out to me the things that I have 
accidentally skipped. 

(Laughter.) 
MR. FISHER:  Yes, pages 46 through 49 of our 

blue brief, Justice Breyer.  There are numerous 
references to the word "organization," "group."  "It" is 
a word used. 

And, I think, Justice Kagan, this is also 

responsive to your question.  Two years after the change 
you described was made, there was a hearing held before 
the Senate Judiciary Committee where both bills were 
being considered.  The one bill from the House that used 
the word "individual" and the word -- and the Senate 
bill which used the word "person." 

And one would expect that if people thought 

the word "individual" meant something different and 
limited the class of defendants, that that would have 
come up or somebody would have expressed some awareness 
of it.  But to the contrary --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, suppose I'm a member 
of the House or of the Senate, and I'm not a member of

the committee that engages in all of this legislative 
history.  And I -- I see the word "individual" in this 
statute, and that's the basis on which I vote for or 
against a statute.  Why should I be saddled with 
whatever sayings by members of the committee or by 
experts testifying before the committee occurred?  It 
was out of my hearing.  I voted for "individual." 

And "individual" -- well -- if Congress 
wanted "individual" to mean what you say it doesn't 
mean, what word would they have used instead?  I mean, 
if "individual" is a code word for person, what's the 
code word for individual? 

(Laughter.) 
MR. FISHER:  Natural person, Justice Scalia. 

And -- and we've cited many statutes in our blue brief 
that use the word "natural person" in the U.S. Code. 
And this goes to the question -- I think 

this is also responsive to Justice Sotomayor:  Why did 
they use the word "individual," instead of "person"? 
Why did they say in the committee reports that the word 
"individual" made it crystal clear that states and their 
entities could not be sued? 

And the reason why is because "person" would 

have left some residual ambiguity as to whether 
something like a foreign city or a foreign county --

think of a foreign county jail that tortured somebody. 
Under section 1983 law, which uses the word "person," 
counties and cities are liable.  However, under the 
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and under established 
international law sovereign immunities principles, 
they're not. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, they did this 

to --

MR. FISHER:  The word "individual" --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They chose that word 
to avoid any residual ambiguity.  But they thought there 
was no ambiguity at all as to whether the term 
"individual" meant natural persons or organizational 
entities? 

MR. FISHER:  Well, I -- I respectfully 

submit they didn't think about that question, which is 
why I'm standing here today.  What they were really 
concerned with was avoiding sweeping in foreign states 
and their -- and their -- and their entities. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there were --
MR. FISHER:  And they just didn't think. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There were witnesses who 

testified, were there not, Mr. Fisher, that the TVPA 
would take care of a Filartiga type case, that when the 
torturer shows up physically -- those were the words

that were used -- the torturer comes into the state, 
into the United States, is physically present in the 
United States.  That was the model that at least those 
witnesses had in mind, and some of them were quite 
distinguished witnesses. 

MR. FISHER:  There are statements to that 
effect.  And, of course, the TVPA does cover natural 
persons if they happen to be in the United States.  But 
the comment that Justice Kagan pointed out is the only 
comment that the other side can find anywhere in the 
legislative history. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But let's suppose that is 

true, Mr. Fisher.  Let's suppose that aside from 
Congressman Leach, nobody thought about this question. 
But we know what the normal meaning of "individual" is, 
and you're suggesting -- let's suppose that they just --
the -- the question of individual versus corporate 
liability was not on their mind, but they chose a word 
that means something.  And you're suggesting that we 
should resort to background norms that -- you know, what 
Congress generally does when it imposes liability, 
rather than the words in the statute that they passed. 
And why should we do that? 

MR. FISHER:  Well, if the word "individual" 
could only mean natural person, I agree.  The case would

be over.  But we've cited many dictionary definitions, 
many usages in the U.S. Code, and many holdings from 
this Court and others that have actually found that a 
secondary meaning of the term is singularity. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you found no tort --
MR. FISHER:  A single unit or entity. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- no tort statute uses 

the "individual" to include organizations. 

MR. FISHER:  Right.  No tort statute uses it 
one way or the other, Justice Ginsburg, which we think, 
if anything, gets you back to the background norms and 
the secondary meaning.  And let me say two things 
about --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you have the --

you have the additional problem, though, that your 
reading gives a different meaning to "individual" in two 
sentences that are right -- actually it's in the same 
sentence:  an "individual" who does the torturing, 
subjects an "individual" to torture. 

Now, I understand your argument that you can 
Have an organization doing the -- the subject thing, but 
how do you subject an organization to torture? 

MR. FISHER:  You don't. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You don't. 

MR. FISHER:  And I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, "individual" in 

the one clause you say means "organization"; 
"individual" in the other necessarily does not. 

MR. FISHER:  I don't think it's that they 
have different meanings, but you're certainly correct 
that they refer to different things.  But that's no 
different than numerous other statutes we cite at page 
28 and 29 of our brief that use the word "person" to 
mean a plaintiff when it can be just -- be a natural 
person and a defendant when it can be an entity.  And, 
indeed, I think, if I don't get ahead of my --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In the same sentence? 

In the same sentence? 

MR. FISHER:  Yes.  Yes. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Those statutes you --
MR. FISHER:  Yes.  Go to page 28 and 29 of 

the blue brief.  And, indeed, their whole argument --
and, Justice Kagan, this goes back to your point.  Their 
whole argument is when the word "person" was used 
throughout the statute, then it -- then it changed 
meanings in the same way, that it covered organizational 
entities, but -- so, if the word "person" can do the 
same work, the word "individual" can certainly do the 
same work. 

So, the question is why -- I think the

question that you end up with is, given that 
"individual" does have this secondary meaning, does have 
this customary usage that Congress may well have been 
aware of, at least that as this Court often says that if 
there's a customary usage of a term, we'll assume 
Congress was aware of it, why would Congress have done 
what it did and limit this act, unlike any other Federal 
tort statute in the U.S. Code, to natural persons?  And 
we submit there is no good reason. 

Justice Ginsburg, you talked about 

statements in legislative history to the effect that 
individual people who are torturers may be found in the 
United States, and that's true.  But the TVPA is a tort 
statute.  Congress already had on the books immigration 
laws and criminal laws that refuse safe haven to such 
people. 

The only purpose of the TVPA is to provide 
compensation.  And in every tort regime of which we are 
aware in Federal law -- and they haven't even pointed to 
anything to the contrary in State law or in 
international law -- the way that you get compensation 
in tort regimes is you hold agents liable and you hold 
corporations liable for the acts of their agents.  It's 
absolutely understood.  And there's no good reason -- if 
you think of the three things that a tort statute is

supposed to accomplish -- compensation, deterrence, and 
accountability -- on all three of those stands, the TVPA 
utterly falls flat if it cannot reach organizations, and 
this is the perfect case that shows you how that is. 

Just to start with remedies --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe organizations opposed 

it. 

MR. FISHER:  Not --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe organizations opposed 
the extension of the legislation to themselves.  Is that 
conceivable? 

MR. FISHER:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And is Congress ever 

influenced by -- by such lobbying? 

(Laughter.) 
MR. FISHER:  That may -- in other cases, 

perhaps, but you don't find anything in this legislative 
history suggesting that organizations were --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't find lobbying in 

the legislative history. 
(Laughter.) 
MR. FISHER:  Well, I can't prove something 

that I don't have a piece of paper for, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it's an explanation. 

You say there's no possible explanation.

MR. FISHER:  But if --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I can imagine that 

corporations would have been quite upset by this notion. 

MR. FISHER:  Justice Scalia, one would 

expect to have found, over the 4 years this was debated 
and the hundreds of pages of legislative history, some 
clue that that's -- that that's what Congress was 
reacting to and thinking about.  This would -- this 
would be an extraordinarily unusual statute, and you'd 
think that one person in the Congress that voted for it 
or in the committee reports that are contemporaneous 
would mention that. 

The House -- the Senate Report has a section 
called "Who can be sued."  And what it says -- I quoted 
it to you earlier.  One would expect to find in that 
section that, unlike every other tort statute, we're 
restricting the people that can be sued, but they said 
instead --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  This is the dog that did 
not bark, right?  Legislation cannot mean what it says 
unless the legislative history says that it means what 
it says.  Right? 

MR. FISHER:  No, Justice Scalia, I agree 

that if the word "individual" can have no other meaning 
than that which my opponent suggests, that I lose.  But

I'm suggesting to you, and we've cited plenty of 
authority, that there's a secondary meaning both 
accepted in the U.S. Code and in cases, and in â€“ and in 
international law. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But Congress -- as 
you've indicated, Congress focused on the very question 
of whether organizations would be covered or not in the 
context of whether a state would be covered.  It seems 
to me that the legislative history cuts strongly against 
you, putting even aside Congressman Leach.  The issue 
was there.  And if they meant to say, well, let's find a 
term that leaves some types of organizations out, 
states, but not others, we'll just say "individual," and 
people will understand, oh, we don't mean a state, but 
they'll also know but we do mean another type of 
organization, a corporation. 

MR. FISHER:  I think, Chief Justice, that 
that's exactly the thought process that Congress went 
through.  And I can't do any better than to point you to 
pages --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- but it's at 

least ambiguous, and you're saying, well, we want a term 
that's going to include individual persons and 
organizations but not state organizations.  And the only 
term that fits perfectly is "individual."

MR. FISHER:  Exactly.  That's our argument. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Really? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. FISHER:  And page 6 to 8 of our reply 


brief explains why that is so.  I know -- I know it 
might be surprising, but if you read --

(Laughter.) 
MR. FISHER:  If you read -- if you read the 

discourse --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you've been 

saying all along "individual" has a secondary meaning. 

MR. FISHER:  It does. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, why would they 
have picked the secondary meaning of a word rather than 
try --

MR. FISHER:  Because it's more precise word 

in international law discourse than the word "person" 
for the reason I described before.  If you look Judge 
Edwards' opinion --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  How about non-state actors? 

MR. FISHER:  Pardon me? 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Non-state actors. 

MR. FISHER:  Well, except for -- remember, 


there's a state action requirement in the statute saying 
non-state actors --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Individuals and 

organizations. 

MR. FISHER:  I mean, maybe there's other 

ways that Congress could have done it, but the way that 
Judge Edwards did it and the way that international law 
scholars and people having this conversation about 
whether people other than states ought to be liable 
under international law was the term that they always 
used.  And it's not just -- you don't just -- you know, 
we're not running a West Law search looking for wherever 
we can find it.  There in the titles of the articles is 
whether individuals are subject to liability. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Fisher, you -- it seems 
to me you misrepresent our jurisprudence when you insist 
that "individual" has to have only that meaning.  That's 
not what our jurisprudence says.  We say that we give 
words their usual meaning, their common meaning.  Even 
though they may sometimes be used in a different 
fashion, it's the usual or common meaning that we apply. 

MR. FISHER:  There are obviously cases to 

that effect, but I'm --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Many cases to that effect. 
MR. FISHER:  I'm aware of other cases --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  We say it all the time.

Justice Scalia, of the jurisprudence where I had an 
argument in this Court.  It's about the second or 
successive petition rule under habeas law.  And this 
Court has said "second" -- even though where "second" 
has an obvious ordinary meaning, it doesn't actually 
mean that.  It has a specialized usage that accumulated 
in the law; and when Congress used that term, we 
incorporate that usage. 

And so, there is case after case where this 
Court has said -- the Morissette principle as a backdrop 
against common law, where this Court has said that you 
do look to usage in prior opinions, prior case law, 
prior discourse, as a way of infusing statutes with 
meaning. 

And if I could just go back to the question 
that I posed, which is why would Congress have done this 
when it -- it just doesn't have an answer for why 
Congress would do this in this particular statute.  Now, 
the other side has given a few reasons why Congress 
might have --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it doesn't really need 
an answer.  Suppose we think there is no answer to that 
question because Congress didn't think about it, other 
than Congressman Leach who appears to have thought about 
it and --

MR. FISHER:  Yes. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- reached the opposite 

result.  Most of them just didn't think about it.  But 
there you are.  The statute says what it says. 

MR. FISHER:  Well, if you find the statute 

at least somewhat ambiguous for the reasons I've 
described, then what Meyer and other cases say is you 
assume if Congress didn't think about it, but they 
wanted ordinary tort and agency principles, in the --
the -- in Title VII and many other cases, this Court has 
said, of course, Congress doesn't think about all these 
things; and when they don't, and absent evidence to the 
contrary --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe they did.  You see, I 

might as well be honest with you, page 26 of the 
Government's brief did have an impact on my thinking. 
It's Father Drinan, and Father Drinan says in the 
hearing, "I think it would be best to stay with that and 
just avoid all of the problems about the PLO and related 
groups."  And then Michael Posner testifies, it says, 
the Government, to the same effect. 

So, there the great advocates of this thing 
are sitting there saying we don't think it should cover 
the PLO; let's not take that step at this time.

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean -- and you have 

Congressman Leach, and you have the word "individual." 

MR. FISHER:  The question that Father Drinan 

was responding to was whether or not the TVPA ought to 
be extended to private entities that do not act under 
color of law. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but he's taking 

that --

ahead. 

MR. FISHER:  And at the time --
JUSTICE BREYER:  He's taking that -- oh, go 

MR. FISHER:  Yes.  If you look at that 

quote, remember, that hearing was held before the Oslo 
Accords, before the PLO became in our view a state 
actor.  So, what he's saying, if you look at the quote 
in context, Justice Breyer, is that the TVPA shouldn't 
be drawn to sweep in groups that don't act under color 
of law. 

And that issue is not before this Court 
today.  We've argued that the PLO now does act under 
color of law, and that's a question for remand.  But 
that's --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I find it hard enough 

to parse the statute without having to parse Father 
Drinan's testimony.  I mean --

(Laughter.) 
MR. FISHER:  Well, of course, I was just 

responding to Justice Breyer's question as to that 
context. 

But -- but if you go even beyond 

compensation, you know, for compensation you have to 
identify somebody, you have to bring him into a court, 
and you have to enforce a judgment.  That's virtually 
impossible against only natural people.  Of course, 
Congress would have expected the ordinary rule of 
organizational liability.  For deterrence, the 
Respondents' argument is that even if Pirates, Inc. --
and for this case we'll make it Torturers, Inc. -- were 
created for a policy of torturing people abroad, 
torturing American citizens who travel abroad, their 
argument is you could not hold that corporation liable, 
even under its express policy and purpose. 

There's no good reason under deterrence 

grounds why you'd let corporations or other 
organizations cycle individual actors in and out with 
impunity. 

And, finally, in terms of accountability, 
just think about the backdrop, again, with which this 
statute was created.  There are some pretty horrible 
groups in the world that actually claim credit and 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

27 

responsibility in the world stage for torturing or 
killing American citizens; and the idea that Congress 
would have passed a statute that these organizations can 
stand proud in their view and say we've done this, and 
that our statute in the U.S. Code would -- would somehow 
only get their agent, and not the organization or entity 
itself, we submit it just doesn't make any sense. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the TVPA is an 

extraordinary step in terms of exposing liability, and 
it doesn't seem to me to be an odd idea that Congress 
would want to proceed carefully before establishing a 
situation where the use of the American tribunal is as 
broad as it is under this situation. 

MR. FISHER:  Well, I don't -- I don't 

disagree that it's an unusual statute.  It's not unheard 
of; just that we've cited in our briefs many other U.S. 
statutes that apply extraterritorially.  But remember 
that all the arguments for and against foreign policy 
friction that you heard in the first case don't apply 
here.  Congress expressly --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, the obvious thing which again 

they said is, look, just -- this is going to bring in 
suits against the Palestinian Authority.  That's a very 
touchy issue in foreign affairs, and we don't want to 
have to go that far.  And some of the things that are

said seem to bear that out.  That's -- that's what's 
pulling --

MR. FISHER:  With respect, Justice Breyer, I 

would just say if you look back at the legislative 
history, the only conversation that was had is should we 
reach non-state actors.  That was the only conversation 
that was had, and that's the conversation you referred 
to earlier.  Nobody suggested that if you apply this 
extraterritorially if you enacted this statute, that you 
somehow ought to shirk from the ordinary rules of -- of 
organizational liability.  Nobody suggested that. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Fisher, one case that 
you seem to have on your side -- you don't have very 
many, but you have this one -- is Clinton, which --
which does read "individual" in the way that you say and 
does it in order to avoid an absurd result, what the 
Court thought of as an absurd result.  Do you think that 
this statute is absurd if not read your way? 

MR. FISHER:  I don't think -- if I could beg 
your indulgence for one moment, I don't think I need to 
argue that because I think that for all the reasons I've 
given, there's enough ambiguity and there's good enough 
reasons why we would assume Congress meant the ordinary 
rule.  But if I had to make that argument, I think I 
could because the only arguments that have been advanced

in the papers are reasons for not having this 
extraterritorial statute in the first place.  There's no 
good reason once you have it not to apply it to 
organizational actors. 

And, Justice Breyer, this goes back to your 

comment.  It's still a mystery to me how it's more 
problematic in international relations to hold an 
organization accountable -- to not -- to hold 
organization accountable than to hold its -- its board 
of directors on a personal basis or to hold, indeed, a 
high official of a foreign government.  Nobody's made 
that argument. 

And if I could say one thing and I'll 

reserve my time, take a good look at the United States' 
two briefs.  Their -- the only argument they provide in 
of the Kiobel case is that there's no good reason --
that's -- that's the United States' terms -- why 
Congress would want to have a statute that applies only 
to judgment-proof individual actors and not to agents on 
whom they're acting on behalf of.  And we think that's 
exactly right, and that's why Congress wouldn't have 
wanted that here. 

If I could reserve the remainder. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
Ms. Ferguson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURA G. FERGUSON 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MS. FERGUSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Congress enacted the Torture Victim 

Protection Act to create a cause of action against 
individuals who commit acts of torture or extrajudicial 
killing under color of law against other individuals. 
Petitioners attempt to inject ambiguity into what is a 
very unambiguous term in U.S. legal usage by referring 
in their reply brief to a supposed subtle definition of 
"individual" in international law.  But "individual" is 
not a term of art that has a specialized meaning in 
international law different from its ordinary meaning in 
-- in U.S. legal usage. 

Petitioners' reply brief cites two secondary 

sources spanning a 60-year period, while other 
international law sources, including the Restatement, 
international conventions, and other scholars, emphasize 
the distinction between individuals and private 
organizations. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. -- Mr. Fisher 
ended by saying there's no reason Congress would draw 
this line.  Why would they want to hold the individual 
controlling officers of an organization liable for

torture, but not the organization itself? 

MS. FERGUSON:  Congress was proceeding very 
cautiously and incrementally in enacting a statute with 
extraordinary territorial reach over executive branch 
opposition.  It decided to focus on the personally 
responsible wrongdoers who subject victims to torture or 
extrajudicial killing, and it did not go beyond that to 
reach another class of organizations that could be held 
secondarily liable.  Congress --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the Chief Justice's 
question was why did Congress do that?  What were the 
reasons for that? 

MS. FERGUSON:  Congress was focused very 

much on the Filartiga case, where the Second Circuit had 
found that there was a norm prohibiting public officials 
from engaging in torture or extrajudicial killing; and 
Congress wanted to avoid the scenario where you have a 
torturer who comes to our shores; and Congress agreed 
with the Second Circuit in Filartiga that if the 
torturer comes here, he should not be able to escape 
accountability from his victim.  If his victim finds him 
in our -- in our country, there should be a cause of 
action. 

But Congress had every reason to proceed 
very cautiously and incrementally.  It put its toe in

the -- in the extraterritorial waters when it extended 
universal civil jurisdiction to violations of certain 
international law norms.  It did not dive in.  As we 
heard this morning in the Kiobel argument, this is a 
very complex area as to what norms are actionable under 
international law and --

JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't understand that. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How many judgments 

under -- I don't know whether it's Filartiga or Filartiga 
-- that -- that pattern, where the individual torturer 
is found in a U.S. jurisdiction? 

MS. FERGUSON:  There have --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There have been many 

judgments; how many have collected? 

MS. FERGUSON:  Petitioners identified one 
case, the Jean v. Dorelien case -- excuse me -- where 
there was a collection.  There may be other cases where 
there ultimately is a satisfaction of the judgment.  But 
it's inherent in a statute that reaches foreign 
defendants that often they do not have assets in the 
United States. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, wouldn't -- if 
Congress really wanted to have this, why wouldn't it 
include entity liability?  The corporation is likely to 
have more money than -- than an individual torturer.

MS. FERGUSON:  The -- the situation Congress 
had in mind in enacting the TVPA was adjusting the norm 
against state-sponsored torture and extrajudicial 
killing, where the agent is -- is almost invariably 
acting on behalf of the state; and yet, it didn't create 
an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act for 
state sponsors of torture and extrajudicial killing. 

It was concerned with this Filartiga 

scenario, where the U.S. wanted to take a position:  We 
will not give torturers a safe haven in our country. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the 

point that the immigration law takes care of that?  They 
wouldn't be able to get into the country. 

MS. FERGUSON:  The immigration laws were not 

as robust in 1991 as they perhaps are now.  We -- we 
know that the TVPA is premised on the fact that the 
torturer is, in fact, found in the United States 
because, otherwise, the United States couldn't assert 
personal jurisdiction over the torturer. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not sure that the 

immigration officials conduct a thorough investigation. 
I mean, is there a box on the immigration form, you 
know -- have you tortured people?  Yes/No.

Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You know, I really don't 

think they investigate that at all. 

MS. FERGUSON:  It's not a -- it's not a 
perfect screen because, of course, torturers don't 
announce themselves at the border as a torturer.  So, in 
fact, that's why we have situations where we've had 
these gross human rights violators that end up in the 
United States, even -- in one of the cases we heard, won 
the Florida lottery.  So -- so, they do find their way 
to our country.  And --

JUSTICE ALITO:  I still don't understand 

your explanation of the reason why Congress would draw a 
distinction between an individual and an organization. 
You keep saying that the -- in the case of the 
individual, the individual was here.  But the 
organization can be here, too. 

MS. FERGUSON:  The organization that 

Congress had foremost in mind was the state.  This is 
state-sponsored torture, state-sponsored extrajudicial 
killing.  The -- the problem it described regarding 
torture and extrajudicial killing was one of states. 
The legislative history talks about how one-third of the 
states are -- have been engaged in sponsoring torture 
and extrajudicial killing.  So those were the

organizations they had foremost in their mind; and yet, 
the statute doesn't impose liability on those 
organizations.  It's addressed to the very personal 
wrong of a torturer avoiding accountability to their 
victims in their home country and coming to our country 
and seeking safe haven. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, it's okay to keep 

out individuals who subject others to torture, but 
corporations -- we want their money so they should 
invest here --

(Laughter.) 
MS. FERGUSON:  I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- because we're going 

to protect them from liability to -- for people that 
they torture. 

MS. FERGUSON:  I think -- I think the 

question is whether there was a plausible reason why 
Congress would have taken this incremental approach and 
focused first on those personally responsible versus 
extending liability more broadly under secondary 
liability theories.  And because the statute is so clear 
on its face because "individual" carries its ordinary 
meaning and the surrounding statutory text confirm that

from the plain-text meaning of the statute. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't have to prove 

it's an intelligent statute, do you?  Maybe it's a 
stupid statute.  Is that possible? 

MS. FERGUSON:  It -- it --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it possible? 
MS. FERGUSON:  It could be stupid, but it's 

clear. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it possible that it's 

just -- that it's a stupid statute? 

MS. FERGUSON:  Yes.  It is possible, but it 

was clear enough. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's also possible it's not 

a stupid statute. 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE BREYER:  I took -- I took -- the 

reason I say that is because if you want to elaborate on 
this -- because I purposely asked it, but I -- one of 
the things in the Government's brief that did, as I 
said, have an impact was Father Drinan is asked, 
shouldn't we have here -- this is before it reads 
"individual"; it reads "person" at this time --
shouldn't we have another definition for including 
organizations like the PLO?  He responds, "I think that 
we should exclude non-governmental organizations."

MS. FERGUSON:  Right. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  "I think it would be best 

to stay with that and just avoid all of the problems 
about the PLO and related groups." 

Now -- but you heard the response to that, 

which really was, if I look at the context, I'll see 
that's less relevant than I think -- than I did think. 

So, what do you think? 
MS. FERGUSON:  I think that even the human 
rights supporters who were strong advocates of getting 
this legislation enacted understood that this was an 
incremental approach, that where there was some 
certainty within international law within this area of 
official torture carried out by public officials under 
color of state law, and it provided a cause of action 
for this Filartiga scenario, and even the human rights 
supporters understood that it was important to proceed 
cautiously and incrementally. 

This -- the United States does not tread 

lightly when imposing its jurisdiction over the acts of 
foreign defendants for foreign conduct under color of 
foreign law.  That's an intrusion on other nations' 
jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Ms. Ferguson --
MS. FERGUSON:  And we don't do that lightly. 

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Your story makes it sound as 
though everybody was really focused on this question and 
made a determination to proceed incrementally and not to 
include corporations.  And isn't it, if you -- if you 
look at what happened here, more likely that other than 
Congressman Lynch -- Leach -- in fact, nobody was 
focused on this question.  But because of Congressman 
Leach's intervention, the words changed, and the word 
was continued throughout the legislative process, and 
that's the word that was voted on. 

MS. FERGUSON:  Well, Representative Yatron 

was the sponsor of both the bill that was marked up 
where "person" was changed to "individual," and then was also 
the sponsor of the bill that was ultimately enacted. 
So, he was certainly aware that "individual" was 
selected for this reason of excluding corporations. 

But, more importantly, "individual" almost 
invariably carries the meaning of "natural person."  If 
Congress had wanted the statute to reach nonsovereign 
organizations, it very easily could have used the term 
"person," as section 1983 does.  And the notion that 
they couldn't use "person" because it would encompass 
foreign states is not the case when you're dealing with 
"person" to describe a potential class of defendants 
because we presume that Congress does not intend to

abrogate the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. 

And the Dictionary Act tells us that 

"person" is the term Congress uses when it wants to 
refer to natural persons and artificial persons, but not 
sovereigns.  So, if the Congress wanted to do what the 
Petitioners claim, they had a very useful term that 
Congress uses all the time to reach that category, and 
it's the term "person."  But, instead, they used 
"individual," and elsewhere in the same sentence, they 
used "individual" to refer to who shall be liable.  They 
used "individual" four more times in a way that can only 
mean a human being. 

Now, granted, there are exceptions to this 

canon of consistent usage, but they have no fair 
application here.  Those canons apply when you have a 
term that has more than one ordinary meaning, and you 
can use them interchangeably without being confusing. 
Here, the ordinary meaning of "individual" is to exclude 
organizations.  We regularly use "individual" to mean 
we're not talking about corporations; we're not talking 
about organizations. 

So, in -- so, in the same sentence of the 

statute, to use "individual" to mean -- oh, let's assume 
we know it normally means corporations, and then 
immediately just switch and -- and use it to refer to

human beings would be very confusing. 

And yet, we see Congress very deliberately 
and carefully then switch to the broader term "person" 
when it wanted to sweep in a broader class of potential 
plaintiffs.  They wanted to make sure they were sweeping 
as broadly as possible to allow persons who have 
wrongful death claims to be able to bring a suit where 
the victim has died.  So, they use the term "person." 
And Petitioners' interpretation gives no 
separate meaning to "individual" and "person," but we 
assume that when Congress uses those terms distinctly, 
they intend to give them different meanings. 

I would just return to the plain text of the 
statute.  It's very clear.  The only situation in which 
the Court has found that "individual" should be 
interpreted inconsistent with its ordinary meaning is 
upon a showing of absurd results.  And here, there 
simply is no absurd result.  Congress had every reason 
to proceed cautiously and incrementally in extending 
U.S. jurisdiction over conduct that has no nexus to the 
United States.  And it proceeded by focusing on this 
Filartiga scenario, ensuring that the U.S. would not 
become a safe haven for torturers. 

I would ask that the Court give the statute 
its plain-text meaning and affirm the court of appeals.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
Mr. Gannon. 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON 
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. GANNON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

By using the term "individual" when 

describing who shall be liable for damages under the 
Torture Victim Protection Act, Congress chose to limit 
the statute's scope to natural persons.  That's the 
ordinary meaning of the term "individual," especially in 
legal usage.  And, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, 
this statute uses the term "person" in addition to the 
term "individual." 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Gannon, suppose two 

people are tortured, and one is an alien who has never 
been within 10,000 miles of the United States, and the 
other is a U.S. citizen. 

The position of the United States is that 

the alien can sue, but the U.S. citizen can't? 

MR. GANNON:  The position of the United 
States is that the alien may be able to sue.  And I 
think that that's going to depend ultimately on this 
Court's construction of the ATS.  There are always going

to be differences in application between the ATS and the 
TVPA so long as the ATS is still on the books and has 
any vitality. 

That, of course, wasn't clear to Congress 

when it enacted the TVPA in 1992.  It wasn't sure 
whether the ATS was going to be a going concern in light 
of Judge Bork's opinion in Tel-Oren.  But rather than 
amend the ATS, Congress in the TVPA decided to create a 
separate statute which provided an express right of 
action both to aliens and to U.S. citizens for two 
specific norms. 

It's broader than the ATS in several ways, 
but it's narrower that the ATS in several ways.  So, if 
your hypothetical involved piracy, two victims of 
piracy, then it's quite clear after this Court's 
decision in Sosa --

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, but two victims of 
torture -- you don't find that to be an incongruous 
result? 

MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that is 

ultimately going to depend upon what happens under this 
Court's ATS jurisprudence.  And so, it does seem that 
the Court --

JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm asking about your 

position, the position of the United States; not how --

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

MR. GANNON:  The position of the United 

States in the other case today is that the ATS does not 
include a categorical bar on corporate liability and 
that that -- that has no regard for the theory of 
liability, the locus of the acts, the citizenship of the 
parties, and the character of the international law norm 
at issue. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose Mr. Rahim had never been 

naturalized.  I guess that was a mistake. 

MR. GANNON:  Well, in -- in this instance 
then -- then that would present a different question 
that this Court has not yet been presented with under 
the ATS; and, ultimately, maybe an alien will be able to 
bring a suit under the ATS that he can't bring -- that a 
U.S. citizen could not bring under the TVPA, but that is 
a product of the fact that there are still two different 
statutes. 

The Alien Tort Statute will always give more 

rights to aliens than to U.S. citizens because by 
definition it is only available to aliens. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, what's the good 

reason --

MR. GANNON:  Well, I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- for the U.S. to have 
limited liability to natural persons in the TVPA but not

in the ATS context? 

MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that there are 
several reasons that Congress could have had in mind, 
although I think that if you read the legislative 
record, that Justice Kagan is probably correct, that 
most members of the Congress weren't thinking precisely 
about this question.  Representative Leach appears to 
have been.  I think that in the other passage cited on 
page 25 of the United States' brief involving Father 
Drinan that Justice Breyer was looking at before, 
there's an earlier passage that we cite where Father 
Drinan seems to indicate that there may be a distinction 
between the two bills that are pending before the Senate 
at that point because one refers to persons and one 
refers to individuals. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But they were thinking 

about that in 1797.  I mean, you're saying in the later 
statute --

MR. GANNON:  No, I think that in --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They were a much more 

perceptive Congress in 17 --

MR. GANNON:  No, I think the difference is 

that the ATS has not even attempted to speak to this 
question, whereas the TVPA does.  As this Court noted in 
Amerada Hess, the ATS does not define a class of

defendants.  Here Congress did define a class of 
defendants, and I think that there are several reasons 
why they ended up with this result, the chief of which 
is that all of the cases that they were thinking about 
at that time had involved natural persons.  The 
Filartiga case was -- was the flagship case --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's why they're thinking 
of it.  His argument the other way, which I see now, is 
that -- is that, look, Father Drinan and the others are 
not talking about individual versus person; they're 
talking about whether, say, the PLO falls under color of 
law of a foreign state.  And so, they're not thinking of 
that question. 

MR. GANNON:  It's true --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And if -- and if, in fact, 
it does fall under color of law there, they don't care 
about whether it's individual or person.  They've never 
really thought about that. 

MR. GANNON:  Well, but the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  In fact, the only one who 

thought about it was Congressman Leach, and that was 
four bills earlier.  And --

MR. GANNON:  No, but the reason that they're 
not thinking about it is because the paradigm that they 
were thinking about was the -- the torturer who is found

in the United States who is -- who is walking on the 
streets.  There's an individual moral accountability 
that -- that everybody understood needed to -- to happen 
there. 

To the extent that the legislative history 
is referring to groups -- my friend Mr. Fisher referred 
to references in the legislative history to groups and 
organizations.  They basically are references to things 
like death squads.  And, as a practical matter, even 
today, none of the cases in the Eleventh Circuit that 
are being brought under the TVPA are being brought 
against death squads.  They -- the case that Petitioners 
cite in their reply brief, the Drummond case, was not a 
case where the Colombian paramilitary was a defendant. 
The defendants there were actually two corporations and 
a CEO. 

And so, I think as a -- as a practical 

matter, although it is natural for us to think that if 
an individual is liable, then so too is the -- is the 
organization that it may have been acting -- he may have 
been acting on behalf of; but it is not natural to think 
that these type of clandestine shadowy organizations 
that would claim responsibility for such acts, such 
heinous acts, overseas would have a jurisdictional 
presence in the United States.

And I think if you -- as Respondents' 

counsel already noted, because the TVPA requires state 
action, the organizational entity here is usually going 
to be the state, but Petitioners acknowledge that no 
state entity is going to be liable here. 

And, indeed, the result here is not that 

dissimilar to some of this Court's 1983 jurisprudence. 
Petitioners mentioned the question of whether Congress 
was concerned that the term "person" might pull in 
something like municipalities because it could be read 
to bring in sovereigns, but in -- in the context of 
municipalities, under Monell this Court has concluded 
that there's no respondeat superior liability and that 
superiors or supervisors are not liable for the torts of 
their agents; they're only liable for their own 
individual wrongs. 

And so, I do think that there are policy 

reasons why Congress could have said something different 
here, but -- and they may well be encouraged to do that 
by 20 years of ATS precedent that has now, for the first 
time since the TVPA was enacted, started to raise the 
question of whether corporations should be held liable 
under the other statute. 

If Congress wants to disagree with the types 
of policy concerns that were behind this Court's Monell

decision, Congress could reach a different result, but 
we don't -- we don't think that that's a decision that 
ought to be reached through statutory construction. 

Here, Congress used the term "individual." 
It spoke about an individual who subjects an individual 
to torture or extrajudicial killing.  It separately 
referred to "person."  And Petitioners' reading of the 
-- of the statute actually gets the relationship between 
person and individual, which is quite clear as an 
ordinary question of Federal statutory construction in 
the Dictionary Act, precisely backwards because under 
their reading, "individual" means any nonsovereign 
natural or artificial person, but "person" can mean only 
natural person. 

And so, we think that that is -- is a 

particularly odd reading of the statute in light of the 
Dictionary Act and the statutory structure. 

If there are no further questions, I'd urge 

the Court to affirm.

Gannon. 

Mr. Fisher, you have 4 minutes remaining. 
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY FISHER

may, Your Honor. 

First, when asked again and again why 

Congress would have done this, I think all I heard was 
that Congress wanted to adopt an incremental approach. 
And then Mr. Gannon said, well, maybe we also wanted to 
have moral accountability. 

Well, an incremental approach doesn't make 

any sense.  Yes, Congress did so in the context of 
requiring exhaustion and a limitations period.  And so, 
it treaded softly there.  But there are numerous Federal 
statutes -- RICO, the Sherman Act, the Antiterrorism 
Act, which is quite similar to this act in many ways --
that apply to events abroad.  And they all apply to 
organizations.  So, if Congress was going to do this, 
there's no reason to think it wouldn't have wanted to do 
it. 

Ms. Ferguson pointed to the Dorelien case as 
the one example she could point of where a TVPA judgment 
was able to be enforced.  And the only reason why that 
was able to be enforced is because that guy happened to 
win the Florida lottery.  He had hidden all of his other 
assets abroad and won the Florida lottery. 

And is that the statute that Congress meant 
to pass?  We don't think so.  Moral accountability was 
already taken care of in the U.S. Criminal Code.

There's an express provision of the U.S. Criminal Code 
that holds torturers liable for torturing abroad.  And 
we've cited that in our briefs. 

I know some of you are going to look at the 

legislative history.  So, let me say two quick things 
about the legislative history. 

First, Justice Kagan, with respect to 

Representative Leach's comment, if anyone after that 
hearing wanted to know what that committee thought the 
change it had made meant and what the bill meant, it 
would have looked at its report.  And if we've cited --
we've cited the committee reports from the Foreign 
Relations Committee, and it says the TVPA allows 
liability for any person that commits torture.  It uses 
the word "person" utterly interchangeably with the word 
"individual."  So, that -- whatever -- whatever moment 
happened 4 years before the enactment was long since 
lost. 

And the reason it used ultimately the word 

"individual" and not "person," as I've described before, 
was to steer clear, I think, of any possibility of state 
entities. 

Mr. Gannon points to Monell, but Monell 
favors us.  Monell holds that organizations can be 
liable.  Now, there's a separate question that you

talked about in the earlier argument, too, as to what 
the mens rea would be, whether it would have to be 
according to a policy or practice or whether it would be 
pure respondeat superior.  But Monell is on our side in 
this case, and we've alleged a policy in our complaint 
in this case. 

Thirdly, in the U.S. Code, where the word 

"individual" is used, it obviously means natural persons 
lots of times.  But when it does, it almost always uses 
the -- contrasts it in that very sentence with an entity 
or organization. 

And so, in discourse, when you say 

"individuals" or "corporations," yes, you mean a natural 
person.  But as the United States points out in footnote 
3 of its own brief, the word "individual" when it's used 
alone is a less favored usage that actually gives rise 
to ambiguity because of the secondary meaning I've 
described before. 

And then, finally, let me say -- the 

questions were asked about the relationship between this 
case and the Kiobel case.  And I think it's absolutely 
clear -- and this goes again to one of Justice Kagan's 
questions on absurdity -- if this Court holds that the 
Alien Tort Statute would have let a torturer right by 
Mr. Rahim, someone who is tortured, that is, bring a

cause of action, I think it would indeed be absurd to 
imagine Congress stepping in and passing a statute 
saying if you're an American citizen, I'm sorry, you're 
out of luck; but if you happen to be lucky enough to be 
an alien and never having tried to be a citizen in this 
country, go ahead and bring a case in our courts.  We 
think that would be absurd. 

So, with those points, if the Court has any 
further questions around the submissions I've made -- I 
guess the last thing I would say is, at the end of Mr. 
Gannon's argument, he referred to the interplay between 
the word "individual" and "person" in the briefs, and I 
can assure you from have having worked on this during 
the case, it is an incredible sideshow as to whether or 
not estates are people and all the ways that that works. 
But it's laid out in our brief, and we think that it's 
quite clear, that there is no disjoint between the word 
"individual" and "person."  If you look at our brief, it 
will explain why. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel, 

counsel. 

The case is submitted.
