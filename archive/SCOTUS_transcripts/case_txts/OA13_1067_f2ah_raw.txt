CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning,  first  this  term,  in  Case  13­1067, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

OBB  Personenverkehr  v.  Sachs. 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Basombrio. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  JUAN  C.  BASOMBRIO 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

            

This  personal  injury  action  is  based  upon  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accident  that  occurred  in  Austria.  If  this  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

agrees,  there's  no  need  to  reach  the  other  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

related  to  agency,  so  I  will  start  first  with  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based­upon  issue. 

 

            

In  Nelson,  this  Court  set  forth  a  framework 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to  analyze  the  based­upon  question.  And  this  Court  held 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  courts  must  begin  their  analysis  by  identifying  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  conduct  on  which  the  action  is  based.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  uses  words  such  as  basis,  foundation,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gravamen.  So  here  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  in  ­­ in  that  case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  a  distinction  between  State  activity  ­­ that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  police  activity  ­­ and  the  commercial  activity  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hiring  the  plaintiff.  Here,  I  think  it's  conceded  that

the  activity  ­­ running  a  railroad  ­­ that's  commercial. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  we  don't  have  the  commercial/State  action  division. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Yes,  Your  Honor,  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

correct.  Here,  there  are  two  alleged  commercial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

activities.  One  of  them  is  the  sale  of  the  ticket  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States,  and  the  other  one  are  the  acts  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

omissions  that  resulted  in  the  accident  in  Austria. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  what  I  would  suggest  is  that  we  look  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  complaint  and  see  what  it  is  that  the  plaintiff  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleged. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Just  as  a  matter  of 

   

  

 

 

 

background,  suppose  a  hypothetical  case  ­­ no  foreign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign.  It  was  a  private  corporation  in  Austria. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Would  there  then  be  jurisdiction  under  the  Due  Process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause  in  your  view?  You  don't  have  to  prevail  on  ­­ on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  issue,  but  as  a  background  issue,  what  ­­ do  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  position? 

   

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Our  position  is  that  if  OBB 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  private  entity,  there  would  not  be  jurisdiction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  OBB.  There  would  not  be  general  jurisdiction  after 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  holding  in  Daimler  and  there  would  also  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  Daimler  is  your  best 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case  for  that  proposition? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Do  ­­ do  you  think  that  it's

the  same  test?  In  other  words,  is  the  test  a  specific 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  test  here,  based­on,  arising­from,  that  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  basically  asking  the  same  question  as  we  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking  if  this  were  a  ­­ a  foreign  corporation? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  I  don't  believe  so,  Your 

    

 

 

 

 

Honor.  Let  me  explain,  if  I  may,  why  not.  Congress 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

could  have  chosen  that  wording  in  the  personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  analysis  in  the  case  law,  but  they  decided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  another  phrase,  based­upon,  instead.  So  I  believe 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  what  this  Court  needs  to  do  is  give  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidance  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  but  why  ­­ I  mean,  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  seem  to  me  that  that  wording  is  very  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  wording  that  we've  used  in  specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  cases.  The  wording  here  is  "based  on"  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've  used  "arising  out  of."  Sometimes  we've  used 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"related  to."  In  some  respects  ­­ I  mean,  it's  pretty 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  that  the  FSIA  is  meant  to  ensure  that  when  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  government  is  acting  as  a  commercial  actor,  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

gets  treated  like  a  foreign  corporation.  And  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

language  here  is  very  similar,  right?  There's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

insistence  on  a  sufficient  contact,  a  minimum  contact, 

   

   

 

 

 

and  then  there  is  the  insistence  on  a  particular  kind  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship  between  that  contact  ­­ contact  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.

So  it  seems  ­­ I  guess  the  question  is:  Why 

   

  

 

 

 

 

should  we  think  of  these  two  questions  as  at  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different?  And  I  don't  know,  by  the  way,  I  mean,  that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  would  hurt  you  if  they  were  the  same,  because  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  just  be  there  would  be  no  specific  jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  you  know?  But  I  guess  I'm  having  trouble  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinking  why  it  is  that  there  ­­ that  there  would  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  test. 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  The  reason  why  is  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  FSIA  takes  place  of  the  ­­ both  the  subject  matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  analysis  and  the  personal  jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis.  Both  are  combined  into  one  test.  So  although 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  would  agree  certainly  that  some  aspects  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal  jurisdictional  analysis  are  part  of  that  test, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  goes  beyond  that.  It  also  goes  into  subject  matter 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  which  is  a  different  set  of  policy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

determinations  that  Congress  made  that  are  in  some  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overlapping  of  the  personal  jurisdiction  questions,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  don't  think  they're  completely  aligned. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  ­­ I'm  sorry. 

  

 

 

 

 

I'm  ­­ I  don't  even  understand  why  we're  talking  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based­upon. 

            

As  Justice  Ginsburg  said,  there's  no  dispute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  that  whether  the  based­upon  is  the  ticket  sale  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  operation  of  the  train,  both  of  them  are  commercial

activities. 

            

Isn't  the  work  in  substantial  contact  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States?  Isn't  that  what  we  should  be  looking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  instead?  Was  this  commercial  activity  substantial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

enough?  The  operation  of  the  train  and  the  ticket  sale 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  did  it  have  a  substantial  contact  with  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States? 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  There's  a  three­step 

   

  

 

analysis,  Your  Honor,  in  Nelson.  First,  you  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identify  the  particular  conduct,  the  actions,  not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causes  of  action,  which  is  what  the  en  banc  court  did. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  focused  on  the  legal  claims. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  Court  said  you  have  to  focus  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acts.  Here,  the  acts  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  we  did  that  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  of  deciding  when  something  was  a  sovereign  act 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  opposed  to  a  commercial  act.  We  know  this  is  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial  act. 

 

            

So  ­­ and  we  ­­ I'm  just  confused.  Why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  the  work  ­­ why  shouldn't  the  work  be  done  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial  contact  with  the  U.S.? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  It's  a  three­step  analysis. 

   

  

 

 

First,  you  identify  the  activity.  Secondly,  you  decide 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it  is  commercial  or  not.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ commercial  or 

  

 

 

 

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  So  there  are  three  steps. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

What  I'm  saying  is  that  the  Ninth  Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

erred.  They  didn't  look  at  the  conduct  first.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked  at  the  legal  claims.  If  you  look  at  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Even  if  they  had  looked 

  

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  conduct,  it's  commercial. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  It's  commercial.  But  if  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

look  at  the  conduct  and  you  identify  it  as  the  accident 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Austria  ­­ which  is  what  the  plaintiff  claimed.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JA  15,  paragraphs  3  to  8,  they  alleged  that  there  was  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unsafe  boarding  platform,  a  gap  at  the  platform, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

et  cetera,  et  cetera. 

 

 

 

            

            

All  of  these  things  happened  in  Austria  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  how  do  you  propose  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  do  you  propose  that  we  determine  whether  it's  based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  commercial  activity? 

 

 

            

Take  their  failure­to­warn  claim.  Why  isn't 

  

 

 

 

 

that  based  on  something  that  occurred  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States?  You're  just  ­­ are  you  just  asking  us 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ to  step  back  and  say,  well,  in  that  case  we  ­­ we

in  the  Complaint  that  the  failure  to  warn  was  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  happened  in  the  United  States.  It's  found  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  set  of  paragraphs,  3  through  8,  that  relate  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acts  and  omissions  in  Austria. 

 

 

 

 

            

It  also  would  make  no  sense  to  argue  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  a  failure  to  warn  in  the  United  States  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  mean  that  the  Eurail  Pass  itself  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  warn  about  all  conditions  at  hundreds  of  potential 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

railroad  stations  in  Europe. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  it  might  be  ­­ it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  be  a  claim  that  couldn't  prevail,  but  why  does 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  answer  the  question? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Well,  the  failure  to  warn 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  alleged  relates  to  the  facts  that  arise  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Austria,  and,  therefore,  the  cause  of  action  arises  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Austria  because  that's  where  the  acts  or  omissions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurred  if  ­­ if  one  looks  at  what's  alleged  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Complaint  itself. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Would  ­­ would  you  agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and,  as  you've  been  doing,  take  out  the  agency

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  ­­ and  the  breach  ­­ the

based  upon  an  activity  in  Austria  because  it's  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Austria  that  that  ticket  got  honored. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  In  Austria,  even  though  she 

  

 

 

 

 

 

bought  the  ticket  in  the  United  States?  You  think  even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  breach  of  contract  case  could  not  be  brought  in  the

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Correct,  because  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

wrongful  act,  the  breach,  arises  in  Austria.

Your  Honor,  if  I  may. 

   

 

 

            

My  answer  to  Justice  ­­ Justice  Kagan  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  I  believe  that  a  breach  of  contract  claim  for 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

dishonor  of  the  ticket  in  Austria  has  to  be  brought  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Austria. 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Because  ­­

  

 

 

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Justice  ­­ because  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

where  the  breach  occurred  that  gives  rise  to  the  cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  action. 

 

            

Justice  Kennedy  said  to  me,  suppose  that  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagree  with  you,  can  you  still  win  the  case?  And  my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer  was,  I  could  still  win,  I  believe,  under  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

agency  alternative  argument. 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  But  not  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  about  apart  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ not  under  ­­ under  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  you're  ­­ you're  first  making? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Not  if  the  Court  ruled 

  

 

 

 

 

 

against  me,  no.  But  I  believe  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  On  that  ­­ why?  Why?  I 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

mean,  couldn't  ­­ couldn't  you  make  the  argument  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  ought  to  be  decided  not  ­­ not  by  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ where  the  contract  was  breached  but  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  was  made?  I  mean,  we  could  hold  ­­ we  could 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hold  that,  and  that  would  not  affect  your  case.

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  That's  true.  I  ­­ I  do  not 

    

   

  

 

 

 

believe  that  a  breach  of  contract  claim  under  the  fact 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scenario  that  you  provided,  Your  Honor,  would  give  rise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  a  claim  in  the  United  States  because  the  breach 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened  ­­ would  have  happened  in  Austria. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Counsel,  I  want  to  come 

   

  

 

 

 

back  to  Justice  Kagan's  speculation  of  ­­ of  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based­on  is  ­­ is  nothing  more  than  due  process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  seems  to  me  that  the  definition  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial  activity  carried  on  in  the  United  States  by  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  state  is  the  due  process  test.  The  definition 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  "A  commercial  activity  carried  on  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  by  a  foreign  state  means  commercial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

activity  carried  on  by  such  state  and  having  substantial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contact  with  the  United  States."  That  sounds  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  ­­ like  the  due  process  test. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  what  is  required  here  is  not  just  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial  activity  carried  on  in  the  United  States,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  be  based  on  a  commercial  activity  carried  on  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States.  And  it  seems  to  me  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  ­­ something  added  to  the  ­­ to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  test. 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  And  that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

why  I  started  my  discussion  by  referring  to  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

holding  ­­ the  holding  of  this  Court  in  Nelson  which  has

to  look  at  the  particular  conduct. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  particular  conduct  at  issue  is  not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sale  of  the  ticket,  it's  the  acts  and  omissions  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resulted  in  the  accident  in  Austria. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  ­­ what  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  acts  or  omissions  in  two  ­­ let's  say  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  flight  from  New  York  to  Vienna.  And  in  New  York, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone  negligently  sets  or  whatever  they  do  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

landing  gear,  okay? 

 

 

            

So  then  the  plane  takes  off,  and  then  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Vienna,  because  of  the  negligence  in  New  York,  it's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rough  landing,  somebody  gets  a  concussion. 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Uh­huh. 

  

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Where  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

gravamen  of  the  action  in  that  case?  Can  you  bring  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ in  the  United  States? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Potentially,  you  could  bring 

  

 

 

 

 

it  in  the  United  States.  And  the  difference  between 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  scenario  and  this  case  is  that  in  that  scenario, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  service  was  provided,  started  in  ­­ starting  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States.  There's  contact  with  the  United  States 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  foreign  airline  came  here  and  conducted  a

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  ­­ a  typical  tort.  If 

   

  

  

 

 

the  negligence  occurs  in  one  place,  and  the  impact  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other,  you  could  bring  the  suit  in  either  place,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

far  as  our  notions  of  personal  jurisdictions,  either 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury  in  the  state  or  conduct  in  the  state  causing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury  outside  it.  Those  are  typical  long­arm  bases  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions. 

            

So  the  Chief's  hypothetical  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

negligence  occurred  in  the  United  States,  that  you  agree 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  a  case  that  could  be  brought  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  because  the  relevant  conduct  occurred 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there. 

            

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Correct,  in  that  case  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  correct.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

don't  understand,  then,  what  gravamen  means  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nelson  decision.  Gravamen  means  one  place,  right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Right. 

  

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Or  do  you  think  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  have  a  lot  of  different  ­­ I  mean,  if  it's  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gravamen  of  your  complaint,  I  think  you  have  to  choose, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  you,  one  or  the  other? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Well,  I  would  ­­ I  was  ­­ I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

would  understand  your  example,  Chief  Justice,  to  mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  act  that  caused  the  injury  was  whatever  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  do  upon  takeoff  to  the  plane,  or  ­­ or  ­­ as  I

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  can  you  have  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  one  place  under  the  based­upon  analysis  in  Nelson, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  has  you  ­­ have  you  got  to  decide  there's  only  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place  where  you  could  bring  the  action? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Well,  the  airline  example  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  this  is  something  I  thought  about.  It's  somewhat  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

complicated  example  because  we  have  conventions, 

 

 

 

 

 

international  treaties  that  deal  with  ­­ with  airline 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases. 

              

I  would  imagine  that,  theoretically,  there 

 

 

 

 

could  be  one  more  ­­ more  than  one  location,  but  not  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  facts  of  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  In  the  Chief  Justice's 

  

 

 

 

 

example,  he  ­­ he  stated  that  there  was  negligence  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States.  But  what  if  there's  no  evidence  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that? 

            

There's  a  ­­ there's  a  problem  with  the 

   

   

 

 

 

landing  gear  when  the  plane  lands  in  Austria,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  is  that  there  was  a  failure  to  inspect  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States,  or  a  failure  to  do  proper  maintenance  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States.  Would  that  be  different? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  That  may  be  different.

United  States  geographically,  there  ­­ there  is  no  doubt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  that  question  that  commercial  act  was  carried  on  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States  by  the  airline.  And  that's  different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  suppose  it's  ­­ it's  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

it's  proper  to  say  that  where  you  have  negligence  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causes  an  injury,  the  ­­ the  complaint  is  based  on  both. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  ­­ you  don't  have  liability  without  the  negligence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  don't  have  liability  without  the  injury.  So  why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  you  say  based­on,  in  ­­ in  that  situation,  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enable  either  one  to  ­­ to  sustain  the  cause  of  action? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  In  the  airplane  example, 

  

 

 

 

 

perhaps  either  jurisdiction.  In  this  example,  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  the  Complaint  ­­ and  we're  guided  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegations  of  the  Complaint,  it  is  ­­ the  acts  are  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleged  to  have  happened  and  the  omissions  to  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Getting  back  to  our 

  

 

 

 

 

earlier  discussion,  questions  from  me  and  from  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kagan,  it  seemed  to  me  you  have  to  say  the  due  process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis  is  insufficient  under  this  statute  because  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  fill  in  the  blank.  And  Justice  Scalia  was  asking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  the  same  question. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Yeah. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  One  ­­ one  answer  might  be

because  otherwise  there  would  be  no  necessity  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  Due  process  applies  anyway.  But  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

counterargument  is,  well,  there  has  to  be  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  makes  the  distinction  between  sovereign  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial  and  so  it  has  a  real  purpose. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Right.  The  due  process 

  

  

 

 

 

analysis  is  incorporated  into  the  statute,  but  it's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  only  thing  to  think  about.  For  example  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You  did  answer,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

think  ­­ you  did  answer,  rendering  Justice  Kennedy's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  somewhat  academic,  that  there  would  be  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific  jurisdiction  in  the  United  States  if  all  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened  here  was  a  ticket  purchase  from  an  agent  where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  injurious  conduct  occurred  abroad  and  the  railroad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operates  solely  abroad. 

 

 

            

You  answered  that  whether  it  were  the  due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  specific  jurisdiction  inquiry  or  the  Foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sovereign  Immunities  Act,  the  answer  would  be  the  same, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  ticket  sale  in  the  United  States  was  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough. 

            

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But,  of  course,  my 

  

 

 

 

 

question  was  suppose  that  the  due  process  analysis  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient  to  sustain  jurisdiction.  Then  what?  Then 

  

  

 

 

 

 

does  based­on  still  have  a  separate  meaning  as  a

separate  requirement  that  has  to  be  met  and  has  not  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

met  here?  And  if  so,  why? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  It  has  not  been  met  here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  from  a  general  jurisdictional  perspective  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  not  general 

  

 

 

 

jurisdiction. 

            

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  was  really  talking  about 

    

 

 

 

 

specific  jurisdiction. 

 

            

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And,  of  course,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Scalia  is  absolutely  right  with  respect  to  general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction,  that  all  you  look  at  is  the  contacts.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  specific  jurisdiction  ­­ this  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

company  that  doesn't  have  pervasive  contacts  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ it's  critical  to  the  due 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  analysis  that  there  be  a  relationship,  and  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

real  relationship  between  the  particular  contact  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States  and  the  lawsuit  in  the  exact  same  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  statute  focuses  on. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so,  again,  I  don't  know  if  it  hurts  you. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  might  be,  as  Justice  Ginsburg  says,  that  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  be  specific  jurisdiction  here  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporation.  But  ­­ but  ­­ but  why  shouldn't  we  treat

those  two  things  exactly  the  same  way? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  There  is  ­­ there  is  ­­ if  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  answer  that  two  parts  of  your  question.  First, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  no  specific  jurisdiction  if  OBB  were  a  private 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entity  because  the  Respondent  is  not  suing  for  breach  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ticket;  it's  not  alleging  that  it  was  not  honored. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

She's  suing  for  something  that  happened  in  Austria.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific  acts  happened  outside  the  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yes.  Well,  that's  an  answer 

  

  

 

 

 

 

for  why  there  is  no  specific  jurisdiction  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  you  can  make  the  exact 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  answer  in  the  completely  private  context.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­

 

            

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ could  well  be  right.  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  ask  Mr.  Fisher  about  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  it's  not  an  answer  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  the  tests  should  be  different. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  The  test  ­­ the  test  ­­ my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

belief  is  that  the  test  should  incorporate  due  process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis.  But  because  we  are  also  dealing  with  subject 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  jurisdiction,  which  is  a  different  analysis  than 

   

 

 

 

 

 

personal  jurisdiction,  there  are  other  policy

considerations. 

            

The  policy  considerations  decisions  that 

 

 

 

 

Congress  made  were  based  on  territory.  If  one  want  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  one  looks  at  the  first,  the  second,  and  the  third 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause,  they're  all  territory­based  distinctions.  In  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  case  Amerada  Hess,  this  Court  held  that  tort 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions  are  meant  to  be  encompassed  by  the  second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

section  of  the  ­­ of  the  exception,  the  non  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

noncommercial  torts  exception.  That  requires  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

tort  happened  in  the  United  States  in  order  to  be  ­­ to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  subject  matter  on  personal  jurisdiction.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  fit  here. 

 

 

            

Justice  Ginsburg  referred  to  direct  effects. 

 

 

 

 

 

That  would  come  under  the  third  clause,  which  deals  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial  activity  outside  of  the  U.S.;  again,  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

territorial  line,  having  an  effect  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  first  clause  draws  the  territorial  line 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  and  says  that  commercial  activity  has  to  happen  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  side  of  the  line  within  the  United  States.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what  we  don't  have  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  would  like  to  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  What  provision  are  you  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  provision  are  you  referring  to? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  I'm  pro  ­­ referring  to  the

it  requires  that  the  commercial  activity  be  conducted, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carried  out  in  the  United  States.  That  means  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  territory  of  the  United  States.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reached  that  conclusion  by  comparing  it  to  the  third 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause,  which  refers  to  commercial  activity  outside  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States  having  a  direct  effect  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  see. 

    

 

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Now  if  I  may  just  say  one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

point  about  agency.  There  is  no  dispute  here  that  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  definition  in  the  Act  applies,  RP  doesn't  fit  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it. 

            

Now,  this  Court  has  recently  held  that  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  guided  by  the  language  of  the  statute.  I  understand 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  arguments  have  been  made  by  my  colleagues  and  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  Ninth  Circuit  that  there  is  a  difference  between 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invocation  of  immunity  and  attribution.  This  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  I  want  to  make.  Section  1604  is  the  invocation 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

section.  That's  the  section  that  states  that  certain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

people,  those  defined  as  the  foreign  state,  can  invoke 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity. 

            

Section  1605  is  an  attribution  section.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

says  whose  acts  deprive  you  of  immunity.  And  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  state  is  a  defined  term,  we  are  limited  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations  in  the  FSIA.

In  the  alternative,  if  this  Court  were  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

move  away  from  the  definition,  I  believe  we  would  all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree  that  there  has  to  be  some  element  of  control.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test  that  this  Court  develops  for  agent  has  to  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either  the  degree  of  control  in  Bancec  or  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lesser.  But  all  agency  law  requires  control,  and  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  the  en  banc  court  missed  the  mark.  They  didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require  any  control.  And  if  one  requires  control,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  be  reversed  because  there  was  no  control  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  there  are  no  pending  questions,  I  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

appreciate  reserving  the  balance  of  my  time  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rebuttal.

statute  in  that  way.  It  enacted  specific  statutory 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms.  And  it's  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  is  it  the  based­upon 

  

 

 

 

 

 

language  or  the  substantial­context  language? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KNEEDLER:  It's  both.  It's  both  and  in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ in  the  United  States,  which  is  an  important  point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  want  to  make.  The  ­­ one  of  the  reasons  it's  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  from  just  due  process  is  because  this  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FSIA  governs  subject  matter  jurisdiction  and  personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  to  be  sure,  but  based  ­­ based  upon  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  of  immunity  of  a  foreign  state.  And  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

does  that  by  drawing,  as  was  mentioned  before,  a  strict 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

territorial  line  that  runs  throughout  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions.  For  example,  the  intentional  ­­ the  tort 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception  applies  only  to  torts  in  the  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  property  exception  concerns  property  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States.  And  the  focus  of  the  commercial  activity 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception  is  also,  at  least  under  clause  one  ­­ well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  them  ­­ but  clause  one  is  commercial  activity  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States  that  also  has  a  substantial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

connection,  but  the  action  has  to  be  based  upon,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Scalia  pointed  out. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  but  how  is  based­upon 

  

 

 

 

 

 

different  from  the  language  we  routinely  use  in  specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  cases?  In  other  words,  it  just  seems  as

foreign  government  engaging  in  commercial  activity  in

the  context  of  distinguishing  between  commercial 

 

 

 

 

 

activity  and  sovereign  activity. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KNEEDLER:  In  ­­ in  Nelson  ­­ actually, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  pertinent  paragraph  in  Nelson  that  discusses

start  with  what  is  the  conduct  that  ­­ that  the  suit  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  upon.  And  the  Court  said  the  conduct  there  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  conduct  that  took  place  in  Saudi  Arabia.  And  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  had  a  discussion  that  said,  to  be  sure,  there  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recruitment  that  ­­ that  preceded  that,  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recruitment  put  the  employee  in  the  position  to  be  in

But  the  focus  was  on,  as  the  Court  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  torts  in  Saudi  Arabia,  not  the  ­­ not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

antecedent  commercial  activity  in  the  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  discussion  in  the  Court's  opinion  preceded  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussion  of  the  distinction  between  commercial 

 

 

 

 

 

activity  and  ­­ and  sovereign  activity.  It  had  to  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  ­­ with  what  is  the  focus  of  the  claim.  And  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  was  focusing  on  tort  claims  that  happened 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside  the  United  States.  And  we  think  it's  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  in  this  case  to  distinguish  between  tort 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  and  contract  claims. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  if  you  have  a  tort 

   

  

 

 

 

 

claim  that  has  one  element  in  the  United  States?  How 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  ­­ how  does  a  court  determine  whether  the  gravamen  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  claim  is  in  the  United  States  or  elsewhere? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KNEEDLER:  I  think  ­­ I  think  focusing 

    

   

 

 

 

on  what  ­­ on  what  the  defendant's  conduct  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  caused  the  injury.  And  here,  the  ­­ the  only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  between  this  case  and  Nelson  is  the  argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  purchase  of  the  ticket,  which  is  the  ­­ by  the

Anything  that  would  arise  in  the  operation  of  a  railroad

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  If  we  want  to  give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

based­upon  a  separate  substantive  effect  in  this  statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and  so  that  it  means  something  more  substantial  than

MR.  KNEEDLER:  Well  ­­ well  ­­ and  Nelson 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself,  I  think,  is  very  instructive  on  this  because, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  of  all,  the  Court  in  Nelson  did  not  ­­ did  not

And  it  ­­ again,  it  ­­ it  focused  on  the  particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  ­­ and  this  goes  to  Justice  Alito's  question  as

MR.  KNEEDLER:  On  ­­ on  a  contract  claim,  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  there  well  ­­ may  well  be  a  contract  claim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  But  I  think  it's  important  to  recognize  that  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

breach  of  contract  claim,  just  because  there  is  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

connection  with  the  United  States,  does  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

automatically  ­­ even  for  due  process  purposes,  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

connection  of  a  contract  to  the  forum  is  not  enough. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Court  made  that  point  in  Burger  King  about  contracts

Mr.  Fisher. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  JEFFREY  L.  FISHER 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

I'd  like  to  start  with  Justice  Sotomayor's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  which  I  think  has  been  asked  a  couple  of  other 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

times  today,  which  is,  what  would  the  answer  be  if  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  a  private  defendant?  And  in  footnote  11  of  our 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief  on  page  33,  we  explain  why  the  answer  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  would  be  specific  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  in  the  Gibson­Dunn  amicus  brief  at  pages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25  to  29  they  give  a  fuller  explanation.  No  response  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Why  ­­ why,  Mr.  Fisher? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

There  is  one  contact  with  the  United  States.  A  pass  is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bought  from  a  travel  agent  in  Massachusetts,  a  pass 

   

   

 

 

 

 

covering  30­odd  railroads.  That's  all  that  happened  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States.  All  of  the  relevant  conduct,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tortious  conduct  occurred  abroad. 

 

 

 

              

I  don't  know  of  a  single  case  where  we  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  specific  jurisdiction  can  be  based  on  a  connection 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  injurious  conduct. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  But,  Justice  Ginsburg,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

there  are  plenty  of  cases  that  support  the  proposition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  when  a  company  markets  and  sells  a  product  in  a

jurisdiction,  that  creates  specific  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

That's  what  OBB  did  through  its  agent,  RPE,  is  market 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  sell  its  product. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  No,  but  not  for  everything. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  let's  assume  this.  Let's  assume  that  I  get  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brochure  from  the  Vienna  Opera  Company,  and  I  send  back 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  order  form,  I'd  like  to  buy  tickets,  okay?  Now,  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure,  if  the  Vienna  Opera  Company  refused  to  honor  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tickets,  I  have  a  claim,  and  it  arises  out  of  the  fact 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  have  marketed  my  tickets  in  the  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  now  they  honor  my  tickets,  and  I  go  up 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  stairs,  and  I  slip  in  a  puddle,  and  I  injure  myself. 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

What  does  that  have  to  do  with  the  only  contact  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they've  in  the  United  States?  I  mean,  at  that  point, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  just  saying  it's  a  but­for  test,  and  everything 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  included.  But  I  don't  know  of  a  sensible 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

specific  jurisdiction  analysis  that  would  ­­ that  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

run  like  that. 

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  I  agree  with  everything  you 

    

 

 

 

 

said.  But  this  case  is  different  because  our  lawsuit  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  on  the  duty  of  safe  passage  that  gave  rise  in  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sale  ­­ in  that  ticket  sale.  So  we're  suing  based  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  promise  and  the  offer  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  In  the  ­­ in  the  Austrian

Opera  is  fit  for  the  purposes  ­­ the  opera  house  is  fit

Not  too  hard  to  draft  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  I'm  not  sure.  And  if  somebody 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

did  draft  that,  it  would  certainly  be  subject  to  a

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What's  the  difference 

  

 

 

 

between  saying  that  they  have  to  warrant  their  product, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  an  opera  house,  to  be  safe,  to  say  that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  warrant  their  trains  safe  for  ­­ for  passage?  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  see  a  difference.  And  it  seems  to  me  it's  very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

normal  in  a  contract  to  say  that  the  seller  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

product  is  implicitly  warranting  fitness.  Isn't  it? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  Well,  all  I  can  say  is  in  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  we're  suing  on  the  exact  warranty  that  gives  rise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  this  ticket  sale,  Justice  Breyer.  And  I  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  ­­ that's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

problem.  I  take  it  to  go  back  to  the  questions  you  were 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked,  from  your  answer,  you  have  found  no  case  in  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country  where  a  waiver  of  sovereign  immunity  based  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial  activity  supports  you.  And  if  so,  what  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  case?  Switzerland  and  Britain  ­­ or  rather, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Netherlands,  say  no.  The  EU  Treaty  says  no.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

UN  Charter  says  no.  And  they  have  all  these  lists  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  which,  while  not  absolutely  against  you,  leans

against  you. 

 

            

So  I  want  to  know  what  is  there,  in  the  law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  sovereign  immunity  particularly,  that  argue  ­­ leans 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  your  favor. 

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  So,  Justice  Breyer,  to  ­­ let 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  be  clear  about  what  is  and  is  not  in  that  brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  are  no  cases  that  I  don't  think  any  party  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cited.  What  the  ­­ what  that  brief  says  is  that  based 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  language  in  various  conventions,  that  this  claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  be  able  to  be  brought  somewhere  else.  But  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  in  those  conventions  are  things  like  arise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under,  based  upon,  and  so  you  basically  end  up  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  situation  as  you  are  here  which  is  having  to  decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  this  claim  can  be  brought. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Remember  that  brief  also  alleges  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  spends  more  time  alleging  that  there  is  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper  principle­agent  relationship,  which  I  think  is  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  has  probably  realized  is  not  a  very  credible 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument.  So  I  think  you  should  be  careful  about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

putting  too  much  weight  on  a  brief  that  simply  cites 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  treaty  language. 

 

 

            

But  I  think  the  point  I  want  to  make,  and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

this  ­­ for  the  hypotheticals  and  to  bring  it  back  to  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  and  I  also  tie  in  the  contract  ­­

answer  to  my  question  being  we  have  none. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  We  have  none,  and  they  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

none.  I  have  not  found  ­­

    

 

 

 

            

right. 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  Okay.  All 

  

  

  

 

 

MR.  FISHER:  You  can  ask  him  on  rebuttal. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Could  you  tell  me,  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

adversary  claims  you've  been  trying  to  change  what  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  is.  Is  it  based  on  the  ticket  sale?  Or  is  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  on  the  operation  of  the  train? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  I  think  the  better  reading  of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

the  word  "activity"  in  the  statute  for  the  reasons  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

describe  in  our  brief  is  the  overall  integrated  activity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  running  the  railway  train  enterprise,  which  includes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

selling  the  product  and  delivering  the  product. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  see  our  interests,  but 

    

 

 

 

 

I'm  thinking  there  are  190­some­odd  countries  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world.  Many  of  them  do  have  governments  that  run 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

various  kinds  of  enterprises.  When  they  come  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States,  perhaps  not  being  totally  conversant  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

American  law,  they  might  think  if  my  commercial  activity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  United  States  really  gives  rise  to  some  problem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  United  States,  I  expect  to  be  sued.  But  where 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  really  gives  rise  to  it  ­­ you  see,  I  have  to  use

MR.  FISHER:  Well,  I  don't  know  why  any 

   

  

 

 

 

 

country  would  have  thought  that  about  this  country's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law,  because  before  this  ­­ you  know,  up  until  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point,  the  law  in  the  lower  courts,  the  D.C.  Circuit  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Second  Circuit,  and  most  ­­ most  specifically,  have

jurisdiction. 

            

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  maybe  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  FISHER:  And  Justice  Breyer  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  ­­ they  would've 

  

 

 

 

 

read  ­­ if  they  had  read  our  opinion  in  Nelson,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  given  them  a  good  inclination  to  read 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  immunity  the  way  Justice  Breyer  suggests. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  No.  I'm  glad  you  asked  about 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Nelson,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  because  the  paragraph  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nelson  that  Mr.  Kneedler  is  referring  to  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguishing  sovereign  activity  from  commercial 

 

 

 

 

activity.  The  Court  in  Nelson  did  not  have  before  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  was  not  concerned  with  the  geographic  nexus,  and  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  that  because  in  that  paragraph  where  it  lists  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  upon  which  the  Nelsons'  claim  is  not  truly  based,

Nelsons  in  the  United  States.  They  entered  into  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  in  the  United  States.  The  Nelsons  are  heard 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aborad.  I  take  it  that's  the  basis  of  it,  and  this 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

helps  you. 

 

            

But  he  says  before  even  taking  each  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nelsons'  allegations  about  the  recruitment  and 

 

 

 

 

 

employment  is  true,  those  facts  entitle  the  Nelsons  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  under  their  theory  of  the  case,  which  isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract.  But,  he  goes  on  to  say,  it's  these  torts, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  happened  in  the  hospital  abroad  and  not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguably  commercial  activities  that  preceded  their 

 

 

 

 

 

commission  that  formed  the  basis  for  the  Nelsons'  suit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

And  so  ­­

 

 

            

            

MR.  FISHER:  So  ­­

MR.  FISHER:  Justice  Breyer  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ that's  why  I'm  thinking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  does  not  help  you. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  When  the  Court  said  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

arguable  commercial  activities  that  preceded  it,  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  talking  not  only  about  the  recruitment  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  but  also  the  employment  itself  in  Saudi 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Arabia.  And  they  were  distinguishing  that  from  the

police  activity  of  seizing  somebody  and  holding  him  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jail,  which  was  what  the  case  was  really  about  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  sovereign  activities. 

 

 

            

So  the  Court  in  Nelson  ­­ Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  clear,  I'm  not  saying  Nelson  supports  me.  I  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nelson  simply  doesn't  answer  this  question  because  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  concerned  in  that  case  with  sovereign  versus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial,  not  geographic  nexus. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  in  line  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussion  we  had  earlier  about  specific  jurisdiction, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  your  argument  that  general  jurisdiction  is  enough  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

support  based­upon  under  the  statute? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FISHER:  No,  Your  Honor.  I  ­­

    

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I  thought  you 

   

  

 

 

 

talked  about  just  all  of  the  different  commercial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activities  that  the  Austrian  airline  engaged  in  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States.  And  if  it's  all  of  the  different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial  activities,  that  sounds  like  general 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction,  not  the  specific  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  No.  I  think  OBB  is  subject  to 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  under  the  ­­ or  ­­ I'm  sorry,  I  should  say

train  operation  of  selling  tickets  and  getting  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rides  on  the  trains.  It  wouldn't  be  subject  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  if  it  had  some  ­­ if  it  had  a  mining

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  suppose  ­­

  

 

 

 

MR.  FISHER:  So  the  activity  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yes.  But  in  point  of  fact, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  all  OBB  does.  So,  effectively,  your  argument  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  argument  that  OBB  is  subject  to  jurisdiction  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  jurisdiction  kind  of  way  with  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  that  they  do.  And,  you  know,  I  think  what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Chief  Justice  is  suggesting  is,  like,  that  seems 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong. 

            

MR.  FISHER:  Well,  let  me  say  two  things, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan. 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  FISHER:  Thank  you.  I  think  that  is  the 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

fairest  reading  of  the  statute,  and  Mr.  Kneedler  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  the  House  Report.  One  of  the  examples  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  House  Report  of  a  commercial  activity  was  running  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

airline.  It's  hard  to  distinguish  running  an  airline 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  running  a  train  system. 

   

 

 

            

            

cover  that. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  suppose  ­­

  

 

 

 

MR.  FISHER:  So  the  terms  of  the  statue  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  ­­ Justice  Alito,  may  I  ­­ may  I  just  say

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Sure.  Finish  your  answer. 

  

  

 

 

 

MR.  FISHER:  Which  is  if  you  didn't  agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

that  the  term  "commercial  activity"  covered  the  entire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enterprise,  then  you  would  ask  the  question  whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity  of  selling  tickets  is  enough  to  create  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based­upon  argument  in  a  specific  jurisdiction  since  we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

went  back  to  the  conversation  we've  been  having. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Suppose  Ms.  Sachs  was 

  

 

 

 

 

Australian,  and  she  bought  this  ticket  on  the  Internet 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Australia.  Would  you  say  that  there  would  be  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  immunity  in  the  suit  in  the  United  States? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  Well,  there  wouldn't 

  

 

 

 

necessarily  be  sovereign  ­­ there  may  not  be  sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity  under  the  terms  of  the  Act.  But  obviously, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  would  be  a  number  of  reasons  why  that  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  be  brought  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  there  would  be  ­­ there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  ­­ there  would  not  be  immunity  because  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  on  the  running  of  the  railroad. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  Right.  Which  ­­ which  ­­ on 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ taking  everything  else  the  same,  has  substantial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contact  to  the  United  States.  But  all  the  ­­ all  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  in  this  case  is  immunity.  Section  1330, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  it  has  jurisdiction  over  foreign  states, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  ­­ says  that  that  jurisdiction  has  to  be  in

personam.  And  obviously,  that  would  carry  with  it  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements  for  in  personam  jurisdiction  which  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require  a  contact  in  this  country. 

   

 

 

 

            

And  this  is  one  thing  I  want  to  make  sure, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  Court  understands  to  bring  us  back  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypotheticals  we  were  talking  about  earlier  and  to  tie 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  contract  hypothetical,  it's  important  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  to  understand  there  are  all  manner  of  cases  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  duty  is  created  in  this  country  by  way  of  a  foreign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state's  commercial  activities,  and  then  injuries  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

breaches  occur  a  broad.  In  fact,  this  is  rather  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

oddball  case. 

 

            

The  more  typical  case  is  a  high­finance  deal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

like  the  bonds  case  in  the  Weltover  case,  other  kinds  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international  finance  and  loans.  There  are  many 

  

 

 

 

 

 

employment  cases  where  United  States  citizens  sign  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employment  contract  or  are  lured  abroad,  study  abroad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

programs  in  the  educational  sphere,  all  kinds  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations  where  a  duty  is  created  in  this  country,  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  all  of  the  events  that  the  lawsuit  turns  out  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  happen  abroad.

this  ­­ you  can  call  it  a  question  of  first  impression. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  ­­ you  said,  I  believe,  based  on  ­­ the  meaning  of

And  if  it  is  an  open  question,  why  should  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow  a  foreign  carrier  to  be  sued  in  the  United  States

in  the  United  States? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  For  all  the  reasons  I  was  just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

saying,  Justice  Ginsburg,  because  it  is  utterly  common 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  duties  to  be  created  in  this  country  ­­ here,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duty  of  safe  passage  and  of  utmost  care  ­­ and  then  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

breach  to  occur  a  broad. 

   

 

 

            

My  ­­ my  friend  on  the  other  side  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct  to  say  this  case  is  indistinguishable  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  cases.  There  are  ­­ there  are  all  kinds  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  where  duties  are  created  in  this  country  and  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

breached  abroad. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  if  that's  true  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  FISHER:  The  lower  courts  have  always

thought  you  said  that  there  would  not  be  jurisdiction  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue  in  the  United  States  when  I  slip  and  fall  in  Vienna. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ but  you  could  make  the  same  argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Well,  there  was  a  duty  created  in  the  United  States,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what  I'm  suing  on. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  I  think  when  I  answered  your 

    

   

 

 

 

question  I  was  imagining  there  wasn't  a  duty  created. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

Maybe  as  Justice  Breyer  amended  the  hypothetical,  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  be  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  there's  ­­ I  mean,  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

only  thing  that's  happened  in  the  United  States  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I've  purchased  a  ticket  there.  That's  ­­ that's  what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

I've  done. 

 

            

            

MR.  FISHER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  I  take  it  that  your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

argument  is  that  purchase  of  a  ticket  gives  rise  to  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duty  which  is  then  violated  when  I  slip  and  fall  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  country. 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  I  would  say  if  the  plaintiff 

    

 

 

 

 

 

alleges  that  in  the  lawsuit,  then  there  would  not  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  immunity.  And  then  Justice  Alito's  ­­ I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

as  he  was  saying  earlier,  you  would  have  a  ­­ perhaps  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  strong  12(b)(6)  argument  that  there's  no  such  State

the  train  in  Vienna,  and  you  buy  your  ticket  in  Vienna 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  you  get  on  the  train  in  Vienna,  there  is  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

train  operator  some  duty  of  care,  isn't  there? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Without  regard  to  ­­ in  other  words,  there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  special  about  buying  a  ticket  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  that  gives  rise  to  a  unique  duty  of  care 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  any  different  from  the  duty  of  care  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

railroad  owes  its  passengers  in  Austria. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  I  think  that's  right,  Mr.  Chief 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Justice,  but  ­­ as  long  as  you're  talking  about  buying  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ticket  one  place  to  the  other.  But  of  course  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true  of  any  seller  of  any  product  that  they  ­­ that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stand  ­­ you  know,  they  offer  the  same  thing  depending 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  where  you  buy  it. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  critical  thing  is  where  did  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sell  their  ticket?  They  reached  out  to  this  country  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  is  worth  answering  your  question  with  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  point,  which  is  the  product  that  they  sold  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ms.  Sachs  is  not  available  to  Austrian  citizens.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  specially­tailored  product  available  only  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  understand.  But 

    

  

 

 

there's  nothing  unique  about  the  standard  of  care  based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon  whether  it's  a  Eurail  Pass  or  something  else,  is

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  It  makes  no 

  

 

 

 

 

difference  to  what  standard  of  care  she  would  allege  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  were  some  other  basis  for  jurisdiction  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States? 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  That  might  be  correct,  but  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  important  not  to  lose  sight  of  the  fact  that  she 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  buy  her  ticket  there.  OBB  reached  out  into  this

And  just  going  back  to  this  Court's  ordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due  process  cases,  when  a  business  purposefully  avails 

   

 

 

 

 

 

itself  of  the  protections  and  the  opportunities  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  jurisdiction  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Fisher,  the 

  

 

 

 

purposefully­availed­of  test  relates  to  specific 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction,  and  there  has  to  be  an  instant  connecting. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  there  is  that  connection,  then  you  must  have,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addition,  purposefully­availed­of. 

 

            

But  purposefully­availed­of,  standing  alone, 

 

 

 

doesn't  give  you  general  jurisdiction,  and  it  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  you  specific  jurisdiction.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  you  also  have  to  have  a

MR.  FISHER:  And  you  have  to  have  a

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  let's  say  that  I  don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

accept  that  argument,  okay?  Let's  just  for  a  moment 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

assume  that  on  a  straight  negligence  claim,  the  idea 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  negligence  claim  arising  from  an  accident  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Austria  arises  ­­ let's  say  I  think  it  arises  from  the

purchase  of  a  ticket  in  the  United  States,  okay? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FISHER:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Now,  I  guess  there's  still  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

question  as  to  whether  your  warranty  claims  ought  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treated  differently.  And  I  take  it  what  Mr.  Kneedler 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

has  said  about  that  is,  no,  they  shouldn't  be,  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  fancy  pleading,  it's  just  a  way  of  converting  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negligence  claim  into  a  contract  claim.  It's  the  same 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  thing  that  happened  in  Nelson  that  we  refused  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow.  Why  isn't  that  right? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  It's  not  right  because  what  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  worried  about  in  Nelson  is  artful  pleading  to  get

around  true  sovereign  immunity;  in  other  words,  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge  sovereign  acts  dressed  up  as  something  else. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Here  there's  no  allegation  that  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

challenging  sovereign  acts.  Everybody  agrees  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

challenging  commercial  acts.  There's  only  the 

  

 

 

 

 

geographic  nexus  question.  So  we  can  plead  a  tort 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

however  we  like  subject  to  Rule  12(b)(6),  which  they  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  on  remand. 

 

 

            

And,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  maybe  I  could  turn 

   

 

 

 

 

 

back  to  one  of  yours  questions,  because  I  think  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further  highlights  the  difficulty  with  the  other  side's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test. 

            

It  has  to  be  enough  for  a  duty  to  create  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause  of  action,  we  say,  because  otherwise  you're  left 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  this  gravamen  test.  And  either  ­­ gravamen  test 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  mean  one  of  two  things:  Either  it  has  to  mean 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  only  one  particular  place  can  be  the  gravamen, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  the  way  I  understood  it  from  their  briefing. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  as  the  Court,  I  think,  is  figuring  out  from  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument,  you  get  into  all  heaps  of  troubles  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts,  employment,  all  kinds  of  other  things  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  injuries  occur  abroad,  and  how  on  earth  is  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  determine  where  the  gravamen  is. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

On  the  other  hand,  if  gravamen  is  sort  of  a

consisted  of  a  failure,  for  example,  to  deliver  goods  to

MR.  FISHER:  Well,  all  I  can  do  is  honestly 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

answer  that  I've  never  seen  this  test  used  in  any  choice

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  If  we're  dealing  with

based  on  ­­ the  allegation  is  the  boarding  protocol  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negligently  designed,  or  the  platform,  the  space  between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  train  and  the  platform,  negligently  designed.

was  negligently  designed,  whether  the  boarding  protocol, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operating  protocol  was  negligent? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  In  all  candor,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg,  there'd  be  a  pretty  good  argument  that  Austria 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  should  apply.  And  it  is  important  for  the  Court  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  that  simply  holding  that  a  suit  under  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

FSIA  can  be  brought  in  this  country  does  not  mean  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S.  law  applies.  There's  a  separate  choice  of  law 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

analysis  that  can  be  made.  And  so  OBB  had  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity  to  make  choice  of  law  arguments  and  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided  not  to. 

 

 

            

But  remember,  they  can  do  choice  of  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis  not  only  in  terms  of  ordinary  common  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles  that  might  apply  in  a  court,  but  there's  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  ways  that  a  defendant  in  OBB's  position  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protect  itself  in  a  case  like  this. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

First  of  all,  they  can  put  a  choice  of  law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  in  the  ticket,  or  in  the  contract,  or  whatever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  be  at  issue. 

 

 

 

            

Second  of  all,  even  as  to  forum,  forum 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

selection  clauses  can  be  put  into  tickets  like  this,  and

contracts,  and  in  fact  they  are.  As  the  United  States 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

told  the  Court  at  the  cert  stage  of  this  case,  all  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  tickets  now  are  governed  by  a  forum  selection 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause  provision,  so  you'll  never  see  a  case  like  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again,  not  only  in  the  railroad  context,  but  even  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

airline  industry. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  that  ­­ and  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

works,  even  though  it's  an  adhesion  contract,  and  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

small  print  ­­

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  Under  Carnival  Cruise  Lines, 

  

 

 

 

 

this  Court's  decision,  those  kinds  of  forum  selection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clauses  are  perfectly  enforceable. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That  ­­ that  was  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

admiralty  case,  though. 

 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  Well,  I  don't  know  why  it  would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

be  different  in  this  context,  Justice  Kennedy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Certainly  the  government  says  that  these  are  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governed  by  forum  selection  clauses  now.  We  think  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are,  too. 

 

            

So  what  you're  really  deciding  in  this  case,

like  finance,  like  contracts.  That's  why  Gibson­Dunn 

  

 

 

 

 

 

has  filed  a  case  on  behalf  of  a  ­­ of  a  large  hedge  fund 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  says,  we  do  business  all  the  time  with  foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereigns  and  we're  very  worried  that  if  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopts  this  gravamen  based­upon,  we  will  not  be  able  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforce  contracts  and  duties  in  this  country  that  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  rise  under  negotiations  in  this  country  and  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  breached  abroad. 

 

 

            

Employment  situations,  like  the  hypothetical 

 

 

 

 

we  give  in  our  brief,  where  a  United  States  citizen  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hired  as  an  engineer  to  go  do  oil  and  gas  exploration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  then  something  happens  abroad. 

 

 

 

 

            

Those  cases  have  always  been  brought  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country.  And  if  this  Court  adopts  the  gravamen  test, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  you'll  be  saying  is  the  courts  now  have  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amorphous  test  that  would  seem,  especially  if  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  a  single  gravamen,  that  would  seem  to  bounce  all  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  cases  out  of  the  United  States  courts,  which  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  dramatically  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Well,  suppose  ­­ suppose 

  

 

 

 

 

the  Court  simply  said,  buying  a  ticket  from  an  agent  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States  is  not  enough,  period.  We  don't  adopt 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  gravamen.  The  question  is,  what  does  based­on  mean. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  Court  could  say  based­on  is  not  based­on  if  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  happened  in  the  United  States  is  the  purchase  of

the  ticket.  We  don't  have  to  buy  any  gravamen  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  else. 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  Well,  I  think  there  is  two 

   

  

 

 

 

 

reasons  why  you  couldn't  just  limit  it  to  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg.  First,  as  a  legal  matter,  our  claim 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

depends  on  the  duty  that  arose  when  that  ticket's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchase  was  made.  And  I  don't  see  any  legal  way  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguish  duties  that  arose  in  a  ticket  sale  from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  kinds  of  duties  that  arise  and  all  kinds  of  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marketing  and  contract  settings. 

 

 

 

            

And  second  of  all,  just  as  a  matter  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  sense,  remember  ­­ let's  go  back  to  where  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

began  ­­ this  is  a  commercial  activity  exception.  If 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  weren't  selling  tickets,  it  wouldn't  even  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial  to  begin  with.  So  it  would  be  a  highly  odd 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holding  to  say  that  the  one  thing  that  makes  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial  is  what  prevents  it  from  being  brought  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  makes  it  commercial 

  

 

 

 

 

is  it's  a  railroad  doing  the  same  thing  a  private 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

railroad  would  do.  It's  in  ­­ its  business  is  operating 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  railroad. 

 

            

MR.  FISHER:  That's  right,  Justice  Ginsburg. 

  

 

 

 

 

And  if  you  want  us  to  ask  the  question  in  terms  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  a  private  company  would  be  subject  to

jurisdiction  under  the  same  settings  here,  at  least  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  to  hold  is  that  OBB  should  be  in  the  same  shoes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  private  company. 

   

 

            

Now,  we  say  in  our  brief  and  in  the  Gibson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief  in  more  detail,  why  due  process  wouldn't  stand  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  way  of  jurisdiction  there.  But  if  you  have  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt  about  that,  you  can  note  that  OBB  has  made  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal  jurisdiction  argument  in  the  district  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  district  court  never  reached.  And  so  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available  on  remand. 

 

 

            

The  only  thing  before  this  Court  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  immunity  and  whether  OBB  is  entitled  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  immunity  for  commercial  acts  in  this  country 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  teeth  of  a  congressional  statute  that  says  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  declaration  of  purpose  in  Section  1602  that  foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

states  doing  commercial  activities  in  this  country 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  not  be  entitled  to  sovereign  immunity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

to  do  is  ­­

 

 

 

            

And  then  in  Section  1606  says:  What  we  want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  we  say,  look,  did  ­­

MR.  FISHER:  Pardon  me? 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Are  they  liable  for 

  

 

 

 

 

activity  that  took  place  in  this  country?  They  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liable  for  the  breach  of  the  contract.  The  breach  of

separating  the  torts  from  the  contractual  claims  here  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case,  implied  warranty  claims.  Let  me  tell  you  why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  believe  it's  a  bad  idea  to  split  claims  on  causes  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action.  This  Court  decided  recently  a  case  called

Pimentel  in  which  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  immunity.  But  there  were  also  a  number  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

other  defendants  that  did  not  enjoy  sovereign  immunity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  this  Court,  taking  into  consideration  important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues  such  as  international  comity,  decided  that  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule  19,  the  entire  lawsuit  had  to  be  dismissed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including  as  to  nonsovereign  entities,  in  order  to  give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

full  effect  to  the  sovereign  immunity  of  the  Republic  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Philippines. 

 

            

In  light  of  that  holding,  it  would  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little  sense  that  when  the  defendant  has  the  right  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invoke  immunity,  that  we  would  split  the  causes  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  so  that  some  of  them  would  proceed  in  Austria  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  of  them  would  proceed  in  the  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Are  you  suggesting  the

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Yes,  exactly,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

And  the  circuit  courts  and  the  State  courts  have  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood  what  gravamen  means.  They  know  what  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

means.  And  if  we  just  took  anybody  off  the  street  here

person  would  say,  because  she  was  injured  in  a  terrible 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accident  in  Austria. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  what  if  the  only  claim 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  the  breach  of  warranty  claim? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  Then  we  would  have  to  ask 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  did  the  breach  occur.  As  in  Justice  Kagan's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  I  would  answer,  if  the  breach  occurred  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Austria,  then  the  claim  would  arise  in  Austria. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  the  warranty,  in  terms  of  the  duty  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

care,  there  is  no  duty  of  care  until  she  arrives  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

station  and  tries  to  board  that  train.  And  even  if  she 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  have  a  ticket  at  all,  the  record  establishes  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  would  still  owe  her  a  duty  of  care. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  if  she  also  had,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

addition  to  the  claims  she's  asserted,  a  conventional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

breach  of  contract  claim?  She  said  that  when  they  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  she  tried  to  get  on  the  train,  they  said  no,  your

an  additional  amount? 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BASOMBRIO:  That  would  have  said  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  We  look  to  the  gravamen  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  whole  thing  and  we  say,  well,  the  tort  claims  are  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Austria  and  therefore  she  can't  bring  this  breach  of
