CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 02-241, Barbara Grutter v. Lee Bollinger. 


Mr. Kolbo.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF KIRK O. KOLBO


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


THE WITNESS:  Mr. Chief Justice and May it


please the Court: 


Barbara Grutter applied for admission to the


University of Michigan Law School with a personal right


guaranteed by the Constitution that she would not have her


race counted against her. That race -- that the


application would be considered for free from the taint of


racial discrimination. The law school intentionally 

disregarded that right by discriminating against her on


the basis of race as it does each year in the case of


thousands of individuals who apply for admission.


The law school defends its practice of race


discrimination as necessary to achieve a diverse student


body.  With the loss -- with the diversity that the law


school is committed to ensuring and meaningful numbers or


critical mass, is of a narrow kind defined exclusively by


race and ethnicity.


The constitutional promise of equality would not

be necessary in a society composed of a single homogenous


mass.


It is precisely because we are a nation teeming


with different races and ethnicities -- one that is


increasingly interracial, multiracial, that it is so


crucial for our Government to honor its solemn obligation


to treat all members of our society equally without


preferring some individuals over others.


QUESTION:  Well, of course, you -- I mean, a


university or a law school is faced with a serious problem


when it's one that gets thousands of applications for just


a few slots.  Where it has to be selective.  And inherent


in that setting is making choices about what students to


admit.


So you have an element here that suggests that 

there are many reasons why a particular student would be


admitted or not.  And a lot of factors go into it.


So how do you single this out and how are we


certain that there's an injury to your client that she


wouldn't have experienced for other reasons?


MR. KOLBO:  Well, Your Honor, first of all, race


is impermissible because of the constitutional command of


equality.  The university is certainly free to make many


different kinds of choices in selecting students.


And to look for all kinds of different

diversity, experiential diversity, prospective diversity


without regard to race, but race because, Your Honor, of


the constitutional command of equality, must be beyond the


bounds --


QUESTION:  You say that's not -- it can't be a


factor at all.  Is that it?  Is that your position that it


cannot be one of many factors?


MR. KOLBO:  Our view, Your Honor, is that race


itself should not be a factor among others in choosing


students because of the Constitution.


QUESTION:  Well, you have some -- some


precedents out there that you have to come to grips with,


because the Court obviously has upheld the use of race in


making selections or choices in certain contexts, for


instance, to remedy prior to discrimination in other 

contexts.


We are --


MR. KOLBO:  Oh, absolutely, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  All right.


MR. KOLBO:  And I want to be clear about that. 


QUESTION:  Well, but you are speaking in


absolutes and it isn't quite that.  I think we have given


recognition to the use of race in a variety of settings.


MR. KOLBO:  And we absolutely agree, Justice


O'Connor.

 QUESTION:  Is it cause for concern with your --


if you're the dean of the law school or the president in


the university or the Governor of the State that minority


students, particularly from the Black and Hispanic


community are underrepresented by a large factor,


according to their -- their share of the population.


Suppose you have a law school with two or three


percent Hispanic and -- and black students, is that a


legitimate concern for the university and for the State


officials?


MR. KOLBO:  We believe not, Your Honor, for the


reason that we need to get away from the notion that


there's some right number for each racial group.


QUESTION:  So if year after year after year


there's an underrepresentation, there is no cause for the 

State or the Government or its educational experts to be


concerned whatsoever?


MR. KOLBO:  I wouldn't say not to be concerned,


Your Honor, I think the mere fact of underrepresentation,


that is that say, blacks are not represented as they are


in the population is not a concern that would justify


racial preferences.  It certainly would justify perhaps


broad social and political concerns.


QUESTION:  Well, it's a broad social and


political concern that there are not adequate members of

-- of a profession which is designed to protect our rights


and to -- and to promote progress.  I would -- I should


think that's a very legitimate concern on the part of the


State.


MR. KOLBO:  The current concern there, Your


Honor, ought to be addressed by -- by addressing the


problem.  If there is some reason that -- that particular


minority groups are not participating as fully in the


fruits of our society such as being represented at the


schools, we need to address those problems.


But racial preferences don't address those


problems.


QUESTION:  Mr. Kolbo, may I call your attention


in that regard to the brief that was filed on behalf of


some retired military officers who said that to have an 

officer corps that includes minority members in any


number, there is no way to do it other than to give not an


overriding preference, but a plus for race.  It cannot be


done through a percentage plan, because of the importance


of having people who are highly qualified.  What is your


answer to the argument made in that brief that there


simply is no other way to have Armed Forces in which


minorities will be represented not only largely among the


enlisted members, but also among the officer cadre?


MR. KOLBO:  Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe we

have an adequate record in this case from which to


conclude that we wouldn't have representation of


minorities.  The military in the absence of --


QUESTION:  Suppose that were true.  Let's take


that as the fact, would you still say nonetheless even if


it's true that there will be very few, if any, minority


members admitted to the military academies, still you


cannot use race?


MR. KOLBO:  I believe race could not be used,


Your Honor.  I think that other solutions could be looked


at addressing the problem why they are not minorities in


the military.  I note that the United States has not taken


a position.  We have the brief as Your Honor has mentioned


from several individuals, the United States has not taken


a position in this case, the military academies have not 

taken a position.


QUESTION:  Yes, they have, if the brief is


accurate about the regulations, the academies have taken a


position?


MR. KOLBO:  As I understand it, Justice Stevens,


the briefs are filed on the behalf of individuals.


QUESTION:  I understand that.  But they are


quoting material that the academies have distributed,


which indicate they do give preferences.


MR. KOLBO:  Well, Your Honor --

 QUESTION:  Do you challenge the fact -- that


that is a matter of fact?


MR. KOLBO:  We don't challenge what they say,


Your Honor.  We're just suggesting -- we don't have a


record in this case.


QUESTION:  No, but do you challenge the fact


that they are giving the preference?


MR. KOLBO:  We don't have enough information on


it to know whether --


QUESTION:  Are you serious that you think there


is a serious question about that?  That we cannot take


that green brief as a representation of fact?


MR. KOLBO:  I just don't know, Your Honor, what


the facts are with respect to the military because this


case was --


QUESTION:  It depends on what factor you're


talking about, doesn't it?  You accept the fact that


they're giving preferences, but that doesn't convert to


the fact that if they didn't give preferences, there is no


other way to get an officer corps that includes some


minority people, does the brief say that?


MR. KOLBO:  It does not, Your Honor.  We have no


evidence as to what the extent of representation is.


QUESTION:  The issue as I understand it is not


whether without preferences there can be a military

academy population with some minorities, the question is


whether without the -- the weighting of race that they do


in fact give, they can have an adequate number of


minorities in the academies to furnish ultimately a


reasonable number of minorities in the officer corps,


that's the issue, isn't it?


MR. KOLBO:  Well, Your Honor, again, the -- the


terms you've used, reasonable and adequate, we have no


information in this record on which I can make those --


QUESTION:  More than what would happen if they


did nothing?


MR. KOLBO:  And that number, Your Honor, I don't


know what it is.  Again, because it wasn't part of this


case.  I think it's more --


QUESTION: 


More than what would happen if they 

did something else, such as making special provision for


all people of economically disadvantaged background.  We


don't know whether that would have produced the same


number, either.


MR. KOLBO:  That's correct, Your Honor.  As the


Court --


QUESTION:  Do you believe that that would be an


adequate -- at least means of experimenting here -- take


it as an alternative?


MR. KOLBO:  Taking race neutral alternatives

into consideration?


QUESTION:  Well, taking for example economic


disadvantage?


MR. KOLBO:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Do you seriously believe that that


would be anything but a surrogate to race?  It would take


the word race out of the categorization of the label that


we put on it, but do you believe it would function in a


different way but as a surreptitious approach to race?


MR. KOLBO:  It certainly functions differently,


Your Honor.  Race controls --


QUESTION:  Do you think it would?


MR. KOLBO:  Certainly, yes --


QUESTION:  Is there any reason to believe that


it would?


MR. KOLBO:  I do, Your Honor, because it's not


just minorities that are socioeconomically disadvantaged


in this country.  That happens with respect across racial


lines.  So race neutral alternatives --


QUESTION:  The object -- but the object I would


have assumed given the dialogue, the object is to increase


the racial number of the percentage of minorities.  If


that is the object, than whatever it is, it's not a race


neutral measure.


MR. KOLBO:  Well, I would disagree, Your Honor,

because I think if you have a race neutral means that


accomplishes many purposes, and one of them is race, that


is not necessarily under this Court's precedents


unconstitutional.  The Court --


QUESTION:  Well, let me ask you this, it's about


the military brief that you didn't come here to argue


about, but it will maybe get you back to your case.


MR. KOLBO:  Sure.


QUESTION:  The military brief tells us -- the


green brief -- that there are preparatory schools that the


academies have and 40 percent of the registration in those


preparatory schools are racial minorities.


And they -- suppose the Government does this and


expends money for the purpose of recruiting and helping


racial minorities apply to the academies and succeed 

there.


Is that a proper constitutional purpose?


MR. KOLBO:  I see no constitutional objection


there, Justice Kennedy.  For the reason I think it -- it's


quite permissible in principle to draw a line between


casting a wider net, recruiting and -- and the point of


competition where people -- where people -- where the


decision must be made whether people are going to be


treated on the basis of the same --


QUESTION:  Would you allow recruiting targeted

at minorities?


MR. KOLBO:  I don't see the constitutional


objection with that, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Fine.  If you can use race as a


criterion for spending money, I take it one argument on


the other side, which I'd like you to address, is that we


live in a world where more than than half of all the


minority -- really 75 percent of black students below the


college level are at schools that are more than 50 percent


minority.  And 85 percent of those schools are in areas of


poverty.


And many among other things that they tell us on


the other side is that many people feel in the schools,


the universities, that the way -- the only way to break


this cycle is to have a leadership that is diverse.  And


to have a leadership across the country that is diverse,


you have to train a diverse student body for law, for the


military, for business, for all the other positions in


this country that will allow us to have a diverse


leadership in a country that is diverse.


Now, you're familiar with that argument. But if


it is reasonable to use race as a criterion, as a plus for


spending money, why isn't it also reasonable to use it as


a plus to see that -- to obtain that set of objectives


that I've tried to summarize in a second that you're very

familiar with.


MR. KOLBO:  Because very simply, Justice Breyer,


the Constitution provides the right of -- individuals with


the right of equal protection.  And by discriminating on


the basis of race at a point of competition, innocent


individuals are being injured in their constitutional


rights.  That's the distinction between that and simply


trying to cast a wider net, recruiting spending money on


outreach efforts, a very principal line it seems to me can


be drawn between those two things.


QUESTION:  The reason that the injury is more


severe to the white person who doesn't get in when that


white person doesn't get in because she's not an athlete


or he's not a -- he's not a alumnus or he's not any of the


other things that fits within these other criteria?  What


is the difference there is?


MR. KOLBO:  The difference is the Equal


Protection Clause, Your Honor.  It does not apply to


alumni preferences in scholarships.  It applies to race.


QUESTION:  That's the legal conclusion. But the


reason if I thought, for example, that there is a


difference under the Equal Protection Clause, between a


system that says to the discriminated-against people, the


law does not respect you, and a system that says the law


does respect you, but we are trying to help some others,

19

20

21

22

23

24

25

suppose I thought that that is a sound legal distinction


as reflected in this Court's cases, you would reply that?


MR. KOLBO:  Sound and reasonable, Your Honor, is


not enough when it comes to race.  It must be a compelling


purpose.  And that is the difference. There are many


policy choices a university can make that I may disagree


or agree with, and that I have no legal standing or no


client has a legal standing to challenge, because they


don't implicate important constitutional rights.  There is


something special about race in this country.  It's why we


have a Constitution about it.  It's why we have a


constitutional amendment about it.


QUESTION:  Why -- why do you draw the line at --


you said you can recruit -- you can use a race criterion,


if I understood you correctly, to recruit, you could have 

minority students only given the benefit of scholarships


to go to these preparatory schools.  You were surely


recognizing the race criterion there.  Why is that


permissible?


MR. KOLBO:  Because it doesn't prevent someone


from applying.  The key is to be able to compete on the


same footing at the point of competition.


QUESTION:  These preparatory schools -- do you


concede that they're only for minority students? I'm


familiar with those preparatory schools, familiar or not?

 MR. KOLBO:  Certainly not --


QUESTION:  The majority of the people that


attend them are young men and women who really want to get


into the service academies, but don't have the grades for


it.  And the service academy tells them whether they're


black, white or anything else, go to these preparatory


schools and you'll have a better chance next time around.


MR. KOLBO:  That --


QUESTION:  It isn't just for minorities.


MR. KOLBO:  They're not, Your Honor.  They are


open to -- accessible to all.


QUESTION:  I was asking you about your answer to


the question, not -- the fact may very well be, but I


thought you had answered the question, yes, you could have


special preparation for minorities only, yes, you could 

have recruitment for minorities only.  I thought that that


was your answer.


MR. KOLBO:  I believe you can -- as part of a


broad program, I believe you could.  You could seek


outreach for minority students, because it's very simple


it seems to me to draw a principal distinction between


outreach, casting a wider net and applying the same


standard at the point of -- at the point of competition.


QUESTION:  Including at the point of giving the


benefit of going to one of these preparatory schools.  You

wouldn't allow one of these preparatory schools to be for


minority only, would you?


MR. KOLBO:  No, of course not, Your Honor.  And


I'm not suggesting that outreach would be limited to


minorities only.  I'm just suggesting that -- I don't


understand why there would be a constitutional objection


to trying to cast a wider net by focusing as part of a


broader effort of outreach in recruiting minority students


and it can be quite -- it's quite easy to draw the line


between that and -- and the point of competition.


QUESTION:  May I ask --


QUESTION:  If you're right -- if you're right


about what equal protection requires and we have also two


statutes that incorporate the equal protection principle,


then there could be no affirmative action, I take it, in 

employment?


MR. KOLBO:  There could be, Your Honor, to


remedy past identified discrimination, but not to exceed


diversity and there is not today as I understand it any


compelling interest in the employment context with respect


to --


QUESTION:  So, for example, if we have a prison


that was largely minority population and the state wanted


to give a preference so that it would have a critical mass


of correction officers of the minority race, that would be

impermissible?


MR. KOLBO:  It would be impermissible, Your


Honor, unless based upon a compelling interest and the


only one that has been recognized in the employment


context is identified discrimination.  And I don't see


that in your hypothetical.


QUESTION:  No, it's not in my hypothetical.


MR. KOLBO:  Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  Can I ask you one question about the


extent of your position?  There's a brief applied, I think


it's by the Potawatomi tribe.  If Michigan had made -- the


governor of Michigan many years ago had made a commitment


to an Indian tribe to allow three persons into the


University of Michigan every year, three tribemen, and


nothing else, would that be constitutionally permissible? 

MR. KOLBO:  I don't believe so Your Honor.


Again, it's a distinction drawn on the basis of race.


QUESTION:  Or just one, still would be a -- that


would exclude an impermissible number of slots for --


MR. KOLBO:  If it's slots on the basis of race,


Your Honor.  And if there are no further questions, if I


may reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Kolbo.

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

GENERAL OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it


please the Court:


The Michigan law school admissions program fails


every test this Court has articulated for evaluating


governmental racial preferences.


First, it is --


QUESTION:  General Olson, just let me get a


question out and you answer it at your convenience. I'd


like you to comment on Carter Phyllip's brief. What is


your view of the strength of that argument?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I'm not sure --


QUESTION:  That's the one about the generals and


about the military academies.


GENERAL OLSON:  I understand -- the -- our


position with respect to that is we respect the opinions


of those individuals, but the position of the United


States is that we do not accept the proposition that black


soldiers will only fight for -- black officers or the


reverse that race neutral means should be used in the


academies as well as other places.


And that to the extent that there's any


difference in analysis, the Court might consider its


position, the position it articulated in connection with

the military in Rostker v. Goldberg.  But our position


with respect to that brief is that --


QUESTION:  Your suggestion is that the military


has broader latitude than the private university?


GENERAL OLSON:  No, I'm suggesting that --


QUESTION:  Well, you're pointing to Rostker


suggests that.


GENERAL OLSON:  Yes, I'm suggesting that the


Court will want to look at each of these individual


situations according to the circumstances and that may be


a factor in that context.  But I started my answer,


Justice Stevens, by saying you do not accept the


proposition that race neutral means should not be used and


employed fully to -- to make sure that the academies are


accessible and open and -- and offer opportunities for as 

many people as possible.


QUESTION:  But you recognize, General Olson,


that here and now, all of the military academies do have


race preference programs in admissions?


GENERAL OLSON:  The Coast Guard does not. It's


prohibited by Congress from doing so.  I do acknowledge,


Justice Ginsburg that the other academies are doing so. 


It's the position of the United States --


QUESTION:  Is that that's illegal what they're


doing?

QUESTION:  Is it -- that it is illegal, a


violation of the Constitution?


GENERAL OLSON:  We haven't examined that and we


haven't presented a brief with respect to the specifics of


each individual academy.  And we would want to take into


consideration any potential impact suggested by the Court


in the Rostker case.


QUESTION:  What do you -- what do you think is


the -- is the principal race neutral means, that the


academy should use?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well --


QUESTION:  Without criticizing necessarily what


they're doing now, what would be the -- in your judgment,


the best race neutral way for them to go about reaching 

your objective?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, there are a variety of


race neutral means and narrowly tailored methods by which


academies and universities can reach out to people of all


backgrounds to make sure that they've eliminated --


QUESTION:  No, no.  I realize your position. 


But specifically, which -- which of the race neutral


suggestions that have been considered do you think would


be, you know, most adaptable to the academy situation?


MR. KOLBO:  Widespread recruiting, making sure

that there's opportunities for education and advancement


in the -- in the academies.


QUESTION:  Recruiting with an objective of


minority students?


GENERAL OLSON:  Not limited, a race neutral


system of broad scale recruiting that this Court has


always supported the proposition that efforts may be made


by governmental institutions to eliminate barriers that


have existed where artificial barriers --


QUESTION:  Okay.  But my question is, if they


don't do it with a racial objective, how does the


recruiting respond to the position taken in -- in Mr.


Phillips's brief that without the kind of -- of racial


weighting and admissions that is given now, they simply


will not reach a -- a -- a substantial number of -- or be 

able to attain a substantial number of minority slots in


the class?


GENERAL OLSON:  That is the opinion of certain


individuals.  It is -- we do not accept that conclusion


based upon those opinions.  And this Court has repeatedly


held that race neutral means must be demonstrated and will


be accepted, and will not -- and the Court will not accept


the proposition that race neutral means will not be


successful unless they've been attempted and demonstrated.

School fails every one of the Court's tests.  First, it's


a thinly disguised quota which sets aside a significant


portion of each year's entering class for preferred ethnic


groups.


Secondly, it overtly employs stigmatizing and


divisive racial stereotypes, what the law school calls


diversity-relevant characteristics.  It identifies persons


by diversity-relevant characteristics.


QUESTION:  Well, what they do is they use race.


GENERAL OLSON:  Exactly.


QUESTION:  I know.  But they have a reason for


it.  The reason for it is they want to produce a diverse


class and the reason they want to do that, using it as a


plus, they say, is to do the things I said before.  They


think it breaks down stereotypes within the class.  They


think it's educationally beneficial.  They think it


supplies a legal profession that will be diverse and they


think a legal profession like business and the military


that is diverse is good for America from a civics point of


view, et cetera, breaks the cycle.  Those are the


arguments which you well know.


So what is your response?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, a response to those many


arguments is that they've -- they're using stereotypes to


in an effort, they say to break down stereotypes, they're

using race as a -- a surrogate for experience.  And if


they want to look at experience, they can look at


experience.  If they want to improve the educational


opportunities of minority groups, one of the biggest


problems --


QUESTION:  That's not what they say.  They say


they're not using race as a surrogate for anything,


because if you have a person who went to Exeter who's very


rich and happens to be black and is a conservative


Republican, it's great for the class to know that, too. 


And that's why they want a certain number.


GENERAL OLSON:  But that person -- that person


if he went to Exeter and he has a great GPA and so forth


gets an extra opportunity either a portion of the class is


set aside for that individual solely on the basis of race, 

irrespective of his experience.  And the -- and the


application isn't examined for the type of experience or


the type of viewpoint that race-diversity characteristic


is used as a substitute for any examination of the


individual on the individual.


QUESTION:  General Olson, do you -- do you agree


with the articulated proposal of Justice Powell in the


Bakke case of using race as a plus factor as he -- as he


saw the use of it.  Do you disagree with that approach?


GENERAL OLSON:  We disagree with that approach

in the sense that we -- we -- in the first place, contrary


to what our opponents have said, we would not believe that


that single opinion, which was the only opinion, to


examine the issue of diversity under a compelling argument


--

QUESTION:  I don't think it commanded a court. 


I'm just asking if you agreed with that approach.


GENERAL OLSON:  We're reluctant to say never,


Justice O'Connor.  But this test -- every test that


Justice Powell applied in that opinion, the law school


program here fails.  It's a stereotype.


QUESTION:  But General Olson, is race different


from sex in that regard?  I thought we have -- we have


disapproved using sex as just a plus factor?  That is one


factor among many, but, you know, when you get down to it, 

this is -- this person is a male and therefore we'll put


that into the mix and that'll favor the person.  We've


disapproved that with regard to sex discrimination,


haven't we?


GENERAL OLSON:  I don't disagree with that.


QUESTION:  Why would race discrimination be any


different?


GENERAL OLSON:  I'm suggesting that the programs


here, without getting to the point of whether are there


any other circumstances whether they be remedial, which

this Court -- a factor of the Court has recognized before,


or something else in an unusual situation, where it could


be appropriate.  I don't know what that might be.  But


this test --


QUESTION:  I think Santa Clara -- I think what


Justice Scalia said bears modification, because in fact in


Santa Clara, the highway dispatcher, there was a plus for


sex, although there was no proven discrimination against


that particular woman and this Court approved that.


GENERAL OLSON:  I would also say that it's


conceivable if you're constructing -- the National


Institutes of Health is constructing this study of


diseases that focus on particular races, the race may be a


factor but the fact is that the law school program here,


not only is a set aside and a quota, but it -- but it --

--

QUESTION:  General Olson, I'm not sure you


answered Justice O'Connor's question.


Do you agree with Justice Powell's suggestion


that race could be used as a plus in something like the


Harvard program?


GENERAL OLSON:  No, the Harvard program A wasn't


examined according to to any compelling governmental


interest.  It was examined only --

GENERAL OLSON:  We would not based upon any what


we see in that opinion, which is --


QUESTION:  Would you disagree with his use of


the term diversity as being a permissible governmental


goal?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, the only way to answer


that Justice Kennedy is that the word diversity means so


many things to so many different people.  It means both a


means to get experience and a diversity of experience.  It


also means, I think what the law school has done, it's an


end in and of itself.  If it's an end in and of itself,


obviously it's constitutionally objectable that this Court


--

QUESTION: 


So is the Texas plan constitutional? 

If it's designed solely in order to have a diverse mix in


the colleges they take 10 percent, but their motive stated


and their purpose is to have diversity in the college?


GENERAL OLSON:  Justice Breyer, I don't believe


that that is the stated motive of the Texas plan or the


California or the Florida plan.  Those are intended to


open up those institutions to a broader selection, one of


the ways in which this Court has accepted the institution


such as universities may operate is to make sure that


barriers are broken down, accessibility is made more

available and that is one very race neutral means of


accomplishing that legitimate objective.


QUESTION:  General, what do you say to the


argument that the only reason accomplishes it is because


it depends on segregation at the lower level of the


schools, otherwise it would not accomplish that?


GENERAL OLSON:  No, there is no evidence that it


depends upon segregation of the schools in Texas or in any


other place.


It is a diverse selection of the high schools in


that state.


QUESTION:  Thank you, General Olson.


Ms. Mahoney, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN MAHONEY


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MS. MAHONEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The Solicitor General acknowledges that


diversity may be a compelling interest but contends that


the University of Michigan Law School can achieve a


diverse student body through facially race neutral means.


His argument ignores the record in this case.


QUESTION:  I'm not sure -- in his brief does he


acknowledge that can be a compelling interest?


MS. MAHONEY:  The brief says that it is one of

the paramount interests of government to have diversity in


higher education.  And it has certainly been the


consistent position of the Department of Education for the


past 25 years that Bakke is the governing standard, that


schools are encouraged to use programs to achieve


diversity, because of the important interests it serves


for students of all color.


QUESTION:  Ms. Mahoney, supposing that after our


Bakke decision came down, whereas Cal. Davis set aside 16


seats for disadvantaged minorities, and Cal. Davis said


we're going to try to get those 16 seats in some other


way, we're going to try high school graduates, we're going


to try socioeconomic and none of the -- none of those


methods get the 16 seats that they want.


Can they then go back and say we've tried 

everything, now we're entitled to set aside 16 seats?


MS. MAHONEY:  I don't think so, Your Honor. I


think what the Court's judgment in Bakke said and


certainly what Justice Powell's opinion said is that it's


simply not necessary to do a set aside because a plan like


the Harvard plan, which takes race into account as one


factor can be used as an effective means to --


QUESTION:  But my hypothesis was, they wanted 16


seats and that plan just won't give it to them?


MS. MAHONEY:  Well, if -- if the program was

designed to have a fixed 16 seats, no matter what the


qualifications of the applicant pool, no matter what the


disparities between the minority and majority students


would be, then I think it's fair to say that that would be


a quota.


If that is the nature of the program.  But here


the record indicates that the -- the law school's program


is nothing of the kind.


That what has occurred over the years with this


program is that there have been offers that have ranged


from 160 to 232 over the course of eight years there have


been enrollments that went from 44 to 73.  It has been a


very flexible program.


QUESTION:  Ms. Mahoney, I -- I find it hard to


take seriously the State of Michigan's contention that 

racial diversity is a compelling State interest,


compelling enough to warrant ignoring the Constitution's


prohibition of discrimination on the basis of race.


The reason I say that is that the problem is a


problem of Michigan's own creation, that is to say, it has


decided to create an elite law school, it is one of the


best law schools in the country.  And there are few State


law schools that -- that get to that level.


Now, it's done this by taking only the best


students with the best grades and the best SATs or LSATs


30

knowing that the result of this will be to exclude to a


large degree minorities.


It is -- it's not unconstitutional to do that,


because it's -- that's not -- not the purpose of what


Michigan did, but it is the predictable result. 


Nonetheless, Michigan says we want an elite law school.


Now, having created this situation by making


that decision, it then turns around and says, oh, we have


a compelling State interest in eliminating this racial


imbalance that we ourselves have created.


Now, if Michigan really cares enough about that


racial imbalance, why doesn't it do as many other State


law schools do, lower the standards, not have a flagship


elite law school, it solves the problem.


MS. MAHONEY: 


Your Honor, I don't think there's 

anything in this Court's cases that suggests that the law


school has to make an election between academic excellence


and racial diversity.  The interest here is having a --


QUESTION:  If it claims it's a compelling State


interest.  If it's important enough to override the


Constitution's prohibition of racial discrimination, it


seems to me it's important enough to override Michigan's


desire to have a super-duper law school?


MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, the question isn't


whether it's important to override the prohibition on

discrimination.  It's whether this is discrimination.


Michigan -- what Michigan is doing benefits --


QUESTION:  No, no.  No.  The question is whether


or not there is a compelling interest that allows race to


be used.


MS. MAHONEY:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And Justice Scalia's question is


designed to put to you the fact that this isn't a


compelling interest, because it's a choice that the


Michigan law school has made to be like this.


MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, the issue is whether


it is sufficiently compelling to allow Michigan to take


race into account in this limited fashion in order to


provide a much better education for students of all races. 


The benefits are race neutral, Your Honor, and the burdens 

are really quite limited.


What we're talking about here --


QUESTION:  But the question put to you is


Michigan has designed its school in a particular way and


it doesn't have to do that.


MS. MAHONEY:  But Your Honor there is a


compelling interest in having an institution that is both


academically excellent and richly diverse, because our


leaders need to be trained in institutions that are


excellent, that are superior academically, but they also

need to be trained with exposure to the viewpoints, to the


prospectives, to the experiences of individuals from


diverse backgrounds.


QUESTION:  But -- but that brings us to the


question of the use of race, which is being used here.


Let me ask you this:  Suppose there's a


reasonable disagreement as to whether or not the so-called


critical mass is, in fact, a disguised quota, you would


say it is not.  Suppose there's a reasonable disagreement


on that point, if that's so, you lose, is that not


correct.


MS. MAHONEY:  No, Your Honor, because the


district court did not make any factual findings that


would support the conclusion that this is a disguised


quota.


QUESTION:  Is it beyond this Court's capacity to


say that?  It certainly at a minimum a mixed question of


law and fact.  You're arguing here that it isn't.  I'm


certainly -- at least open the possibility that we can


disagree with you.


MS. MAHONEY:  Well, Your Honor, the -- there has


to be evidence in the record that would support the


conclusion that it's a quota.  And what this Court has


said that means is a fixed number -- that is sufficiently


rigid that no matter what the qualifications of the

applicant pool, the law school is going to adhere to a


fixed minimum and I think it's important to say what the


judge found on this issue, at 230A of the position of


appendix, the judge says in conclusion, the Court finds


that the law school wants, 10 to 17 percent of each class


to consist of African Americans, Native Americans and


Hispanics.  Wants.  That's an aspiration.


QUESTION:  It says wants or wants Maureen?


MS. MAHONEY:  Wants.  Wants.


QUESTION:  Wants.  Okay.


MS. MAHONEY:  Wants, Your Honor.  That's an


aspiration, that is not a fixed minimum.  He made no


findings that there was a fixed minimum.


QUESTION:  Is there in fact a difference between


the Michigan plan and the Harvard plan that the Harvard 

plan is tauted in Bakke, it seems to me, that they were


pretty close and is there any suggestion that Michigan is


looking for critical mass that Harvard didn't look for?


MS. MAHONEY:  Absolutely not, Your Honor. The


evidence indicates that the Harvard plan works in exactly


the way the Michigan plan does.  In fact, Harvard's brief


in this case indicates that under their plan over the last


four years, they enrolled eight to 9 percent African


Americans which is a stable range.  In the last four years


of the record evidence here, the University of Michigan

QUESTION:  Excuse me.  Did Bakke hold that the


Harvard plan was constitutional?


MS. MAHONEY:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  If adopted by -- by a State


institution?


MS. MAHONEY:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  It held that it was constitutional?


MS. MAHONEY:  Yes.  What we --


QUESTION:  We didn't even -- we didn't even have


the details of the Harvard plan before us?


MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, in fact, the Court


appended -- or Justice Powell appended the Harvard plan to


his opinion in this case and there were five votes that


the reason that the mandate of the California Supreme 

Court should be reversed was because there was an


effective alternative for -- for enrolling minorities and


that effective alternative was a plan like the Harvard


plan.


And the -- the dissenting --


QUESTION:  Did -- did the Court know what --


what social scientists have later pointed out and many


people knew before it that when the Harvard plan was


originally adopted, its purpose was to achieve diversity

that were -- that were -- that were getting into Harvard

case?


QUESTION:  Did that come up in the course of the


MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, I don't think that's


the purpose of the Harvard plan that was attached.


QUESTION:  Not today, I'm sure.  But -- but --


but that was its origin.


MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, there is -- there is


certainly a major difference between an educational policy


that is motivated by an intent to exclude people based on


racial animus and one like the Law School's policy and the


Harvard plan, which is designed to include students of all 

races, so that the education of all students will be


enriched as a result.


QUESTION:  But not too many of any race?


MS. MAHONEY:  Well, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  Or not too many of any religion, I


assume?


MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor it is not a question of


not too many.  It's that the law school has attempted to


take race into account in a very modest limited fashion,


no more than necessary to achieve the goal of trying to

have sufficient numbers of minorities that there can be an


excellent educational experience for everyone.


QUESTION:  But -- but without a quota? Just


sufficient numbers, but that's not a quota?


MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor it is not a quota.


QUESTION:  When you say sufficient numbers,


you're -- I mean that suggests to me that there is --


there is some minimum.  Now, you don't name it.  But there


has to be some minimum.  But you say there isn't a


minimum?


MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor there is not a minimum.


QUESTION:  Well, then you have to eliminate the


word sufficient.


MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, it -- it can be


related to numbers without being a quota. 


In fact, the 

Department of Education in 1979 after Bakke came out,


issued a policy interpretation at 44 Federal register


58510 which specifically says authorizes schools to


establish and pursue numerical goals, end quote, as long


as they don't set aside a fixed number of places or make


race the sole criterion for eligibility.  That was the


Department of Education's interpretation.


QUESTION:  Certainly they don't interpret the


Constitution?

that is what Bakke held.  That was -- that was the -- what


was at issue in that case, that that was the difference


between the program that U C Davis had used and the


program that was at issue in the Harvard plan.


QUESTION:  Is it fair to say that the -- what


the -- what -- what Justice Powell and the five who agreed


or the four who agreed on the Harvard plan were getting at


was that there is a permissible zone between a purely


token number and a quota or a set aside and you can shoot


for something in that zone? Is that a fair --


MS. MAHONEY:  Absolutely Your Honor.  What


Justice Powell's opinion says when paraphrasing the


Harvard plan is that there needs to be an awareness of the


necessity for more than token numbers.  And that's because


the educational benefits of diversity can't be achieved. 

QUESTION:  It's hard to see that that's --


that's true here, when every day the admission staff looks


to see what the numbers are based on race?


MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, that's not correct. 


The -- there is a report which is called The Daily.  But


it is not looked at everyday.  The evidence was clear that


it is simply something that can be printed out.


QUESTION:  You just have a daily report that


they look at once a week?

a daily is that it is a running database that allows for


the report to be printed at any time.


And -- and the evidence indicated that --


QUESTION:  To show how well they're doing in


getting the so-called critical mass which is just a


synonym for a number?


MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, the dailies actually


track a whole variety of admissions information including


deposits, they're trying to see how they're doing in terms


of whether --


QUESTION:  They -- they don't track, as I


understand it, the other pluses that the University talks


about?


MS. MAHONEY:  Well, they track -- they track


residency, they track gender, they don't track, for 

instance, socioeconomic status which is a plus or, in


fact, the evidence is uncontradicted that the University


takes any racial background, any ethnic background, any


unusual characteristic that would add to the diversity of


the class into account, but it doesn't find a need to


track that, because of the nature of the applicant pool.


QUESTION:  Is two percent a critical mass, Ms.


Mahoney?


MS. MAHONEY:  I don't think so, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Okay.  Four percent?

you?


MS. MAHONEY:  Well, actually what --


QUESTION:  Like eight, is eight percent?


MS. MAHONEY:  Now, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Now, does it stop being a quota


because it's somewhere between 8 and 12, but it is a quota


if it's 10?  I don't understand that reasoning. Once you


use the term critical mass and -- you're -- you're into


quota land?


MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, what a quota is under


this Court's cases is a fixed number.  And there is no


fixed number here.  The testimony was that it depends on


the characteristics of the applicant pool.


QUESTION:  As long as you say between 8 and 12,


you're okay?  Is that it?  If you said 10 it's bad you but


between 8 and 12 it's okay, because it's not a fixed


number?  Is that -- that's what you think the Constitution


is?


MS. MAHONEY:  No, Your Honor, if it was a fixed


range that said that it will be a minimum of 8 percent,


come hell or high water, no matter what the qualifications


of these applicants look like, no matter what it is that


the majority applicants could contribute to the benefits

of diversity, then certainly that would be a quota, but


that is not what occurred here.  And in fact the testimony


was undisputed, that this was not intended to be a fixed


goal.


QUESTION:  Ms. Mahoney may I shift focus away


from this to another point before you're finished, that I


am concerned about.  In all programs which this Court has


upheld in the area of -- you want to label it affirmative


action, there's been a fixed time period within which it


would operate. You could see at the end -- an end to it,


there is none in this, is there?  How do we deal with that


aspect?


MS. MAHONEY:  What the policy says, of course,


is that it will only take race into account as long as it


is necessary in order to achieve the educational 

objectives.


I don't think that this Court should conclude


that this is permanent, because there are two things that


can happen that will make this come to an end.  The first


is that the number of high-achieving minorities will


continue to grow and that law school will be able to


enroll a sufficient number to have a critical mass or


meaningful numbers or substantial presence without having


to take race into account.


The second thing that can happen, Your Honor, is

that we could reach a point in our society where the


experience of being a minority did not make such a


fundamental difference in their lives, where race didn't


matter so much that it's truly salient to the law school's


educational mission.


While that I can't say when that will happen, we


certainly know that as a nation, we have made tremendous


progress in overcoming intolerance. And we certainly


should expect that that will occur with respect to


minorities.


QUESTION:  We approved any other affirmative


action program with such a vague distant termination base?


MS. MAHONEY:  Well, in Bakke itself, Your Honor. 


In Bakke itself, there were five votes to allow the


University of California Davis to use a plan modeled on 

the Harvard plan.  It's been in effect for about 25 years. 


It has reaped extraordinary benefits for this country's


educational system.


And I think it's far too soon for this Court to


include that --


QUESTION:  Can -- can we tell from the


statistics whether things have been improved say, more and


more minorities are getting in on their own to the


University of Michigan Law School without the quotas?


MS. MAHONEY:  Yes.

Honor.


QUESTION:  The critical mass?


MS. MAHONEY:  We do know -- aspirations --


QUESTION:  Aspirations.


MS. MAHONEY:  -- but we do know Your Honor that


there has been improvement, in fact, Justice Powell cited


to a study, it was done by Manning it's in footnote 50 of


Justice Powell's opinion and it gives the number of


minorities who had achieved a 165 and a 3.5 on the LSAT.


QUESTION:  How about say the last 15 years, at


the University of Michigan, which wasn't being under


consideration which Justice Powell's opinion?


MS. MAHONEY: 


I think the answer would be that 

we do know that in 1964 when there was a race-blind


policy, there were no blacks admitted, and under a


race-blind policy today, probably six blacks would be


admitted without consideration of race.


So there has not been enough progress to allow


for meaningful numbers at this point, but there has been


progress.


QUESTION:  Do we know what's happened in the law


schools in California since it was determined by State law


affirmative action?

 MS. MAHONEY:  Yes, Your Honor.  We know that for


the first -- I think, 4 or 5 years, both only enrolled


about -- between I think zero and 7 African-American


students.  They do better on Hispanics because of the


demographics of that State, where it's virtually 50


percent Hispanic at the college-age level.  But what we


have learned is that in the -- they changed their program


2 years ago and this fall they succeeded in enrolling 14


African-American students, but what we know from talking


to the law school admissions counsel with Boalt's


permission is that the African-Americans who were enrolled


under that program have a 9 point LSAT score gap from the


whites who have been enrolled, so the same gap --


QUESTION:  Well, there are other law schools in


California, too, are there not?


MS. MAHONEY:  Yes, UCLA, well, this is mainly a


problem Your Honor for the highly selective schools


because of the nature of the pool.


QUESTION:  You have some good law schools, you


have UCLA, you have USC?


MS. MAHONEY:  UCLA.


QUESTION:  SC is private?


MS. MAHONEY:  Yes.

graduatiing this year, for instance, I believe had five


blacks in it.  So I believe last fall they did better and


we have been told that that's because they were able to


recruit some additional numbers of black students because


of a special critical race studies program they're


offering but that's not a solution to the pool problem,


Your Honor.


The pool problem is that if we look at the


ranges of LSATs where the University of Michigan takes its


students, there are literally about 30 in the entire


country, three or four per top 10 schools.


So some kind of, you know, race-conscious


recruiting that schools are using doesn't solve that


problem.


And if I could go back to Boalt for just another 

minute, because that is something that the petitioners


raised in their reply brief, is that given that we know


that they have exactly the same nine-point LSAT gap that


Michigan gets under its program, there is no reason to


think that what they are doing would satisfy the


petitioner's conception of the Equal Protection Clause.


QUESTION:  That's difficult when it's not in the


record.


I do have one more question on this quota point.

Justice Scalia was in -- in all respects complete. You


said well, if -- if there were a program that no matter


what you used a somewhat different phrase, no matter what,


there would be people taken regardless of qualifications


-- that would be a quota.


Suppose the pool is large enough so that you can


find minorities to fill your 15 percent aspiration. Why


isn't that a quota even if they're qualified?


MS. MAHONEY:  Because, Your Honor I think --


QUESTION:  It seems to me that that was a -- a


really a false -- or an improper qualification that you


gave to your answer?


MS. MAHONEY:  I don't think so, Your Honor.


Because I think -- certainly if it's a fixed number that


you're going to take no matter what, then that is a quota, 

but I think the difference between a quota and a goal is


the flexibility.


And what this Court, for instance, said in


Johnson when talking about, they authorized the use of a


goal and they said that the line between a goal and a


quota is in fact whether or not you have to automatically


and blindly promote people in order to meet the goal or


whether it is a factor that is taken into account and


that's exactly what occurs here.

from one year to the next, you say some years it'll come


out eight percent, some year nine percent, do they make a


conscious decision?


MS. MAHONEY:  No, Your Honor, the evidence shows


--

QUESTION:  Just toss a coin?


MS. MAHONEY:  No, it's not tossing a coin, but


it is not a fixed number.  What they do is, they look --


it's responsive to the applicant pool.  They look at the


applicants, they are looking at a variety of factors on a


holistic basis and they find the applicants that they


think are going to bring the most in toto to the law


school class, but it is not measured against a specific


numerical target.  And the district court did not find


otherwise.


It is simply looking at that pool and what


Michigan is --


QUESTION:  Ms. Mahoney, do you know any quota


program that would take somebody to fill the quota no


matter what?  All the quota programs I know start off by


saying we will only take qualified applicants, but then


setting the level of qualified low enough that they can


fill the quota.  I don't know any program that said no


matter what we're going to fill this quota.

 QUESTION:  To establish that kind of a standard


for quota is -- is to -- is to just eliminate the -- the


whole purpose of -- of that aspect of our law.


MS. MAHONEY:  Actually, Your Honor, the way that


in Bakke it worked, it wasn't the situation that they


would take someone no matter what, but they did have a


rule, that you could not be considered for the spaces that


had been set aside if you were white. And so it works in a


very different way, Your Honor.


There -- Bakke applied, there were four spaces


available in the special admissions program, but he


couldn't be considered for them, because of his race.


That doesn't happen at the University of


Michigan.  When someone applies, whether they're white, it


doesn't matter how many minorities have been accepted or 

rejected.  They are considered on their merits just like


every other applicant.  That's the defining difference


between what happened in the UC Davis program.


QUESTION:  But they aren't just like every


applicant.  Some applicants are given a preference because


of their race.


MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, they are given extra


weight in the process, because they have something unusual


and important to bring to the class.  That's what every --


that's the way every applicant is considered and --

 QUESTION:  Which you say automatically follows


from race?


MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, they also write essays


about diversity.  Every applicant is given the chance to


write an essay about diversity.  The law school does --


QUESTION:  Ms. Mahoney, how does the Michigan


plan differ or the Harvard plan, for that matter, from


what was familiar, that is, highly selected schools will


reject a certain number of people, take a number of people


as automatic acceptance and in the large middle will say,


well, we'll -- we'll take people because they're


different, because they play the bassoon, because they


belong to a minority race?  Because in the days that when


I went to law school, they are female, because we want the


class to be diverse and so they used race, they used sex, 

they used --


MS. MAHONEY:  That's exactly what the University


of Michigan Law School plan does.  It looks at all


potential contributions to diversity. And what the


evidence shows in this case is that it is common for white


applicants to be admitted with lower grades and test


scores than even minorities who are rejected because --

QUESTION:  Does it prohibit discrimination on


the basis of alumna status?


MS. MAHONEY:  No, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  But it does prohibit disrimination on


the basis of race?


MS. MAHONEY:  But the question is whether this


is prohibited discrimination.  And the answer that we


would ask this Court to give is that a minority applicant


brings something special.  They are not similarly situated


to the white applicant who has the exact same grades and


test scores.


QUESTION:  Ms. Mahoney, may I ask you a question


that is really prompted by Justice O'Connor's question


about the terminal point in all of this? 


And we're all 

hoping some day race will be a totally irrelevant factor


in all decisions.  One of the arguments on the other side


of your case is that there's actually -- these programs


actually generate racial hostility particularly on the


part of the excluded members.  And that in turn delays the


ultimate day we are all hoping for.


What is your comment about that?


MS. MAHONEY:  The record certainly does not


support that inference under this program.  And the reason


is this:  The program -- one of the ways to prevent that

from happening is to have a narrowly tailored program to


have very limited consideration of race and not to, for


instance, have two great a disparity between the


qualifications of the white students who are admitted and


the minority students who are admitted under the program. 


Here it's actually quite limited.  In fact, you know, the


vast -- the most -- the most of the minorities who are


admitted are in the top 16 percent of all LSAT takers in


the country.  So we're talking about a really exceptional


group of students.


By keeping the relative qualifications fairly


close, like that, you really minimize the potential for


any kind of stigmatizing or hostility, that sort of thing.


And what the record shows is that in the Orfield


study which was done of Harvard and University of 

Michigan's students, it's in the record at Exhibit 167,


that there is overwhelming support by the students at


Harvard and Michigan Law Schools for maintaining the


diversity program, because they regard it as so positive. 


That's --


QUESTION:  Sure, they're in already.


MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor that's for the --


QUESTION:  The people you want to talk to are


the high school seniors who have seen -- who have seen


people visibly less qualified than they are get into

prestigious institutions where they are rejected.  If you


think that is not creating resentment, you are just wrong.


MS. MAHONEY:  Well, Your Honor, certainly the


minorities who have been admitted under the program are


not feeling stigmatized by it.  If they continue to


support the program in the ways that they do.  In


addition, the whites who are seeing their performance in


the class and who are confirming that they find it highly


beneficial to have the -- the chance to share the


experiences of the minority students when they are


learning about the law, has to be given substantial weight


in considering whether this is somehow stigmatizing or


perpetuating historic stereotypes, which is really the


test that this Court used in VMI to determine whether or


not something really should be condemned because of its 

potential to stigmatize.


QUESTION:  If Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke


can be viewed as, yes, you can use race as a plus factor,


where the program is not against anyone, but you cannot go


too far, and it says individualized consideration is


necessary there, what in your opinion would be going too


far, other than quotas?  How would this be maintained


within limits?


MS. MAHONEY:  I think there are really three


things other than a quota to look for.  The first is

whether there is flexible consideration of the diversity


contributions of every potential student, which Michigan


program clearly satisfies, whether the minorities who are


being admitted are well qualified, because you don't want


to have a situation where they can't contribute to the


class and can't succeed, and the third is the degree of


the burden on the rejected applicants, that's certainly


relevant under any narrow tier learning program.  And


here, what the record tells us is that 95 percent of all


the admissions decisions that are made each year are not


affected by the consideration of race.


That the chance -- that there are about 2500


students who are rejected each year probably only 80 of


them would have been -- would have gotten an offer of


admission from Michigan under a race-blind system. 

That is a very small and diffuse burden. It's


not one to be minimized.  It's certainly something that


the Court has to pay attention to, but this is extremely


limited in scope and relative to the benefits to students


of all races and to our Nation.  It has to be weighed in


the balance and this Court certainly should conclude that


the interests that are being served, the legitimate


interests that are being served are sufficiently


compelling to allow this kind of limited consideration of


race.

of the named Plaintiffs, the increase in their chance of


admission, were there no affirmative action programs?


MS. MAHONEY:  I don't know what the increase for


the -- for Barbara Grutter would have been, for instance,


we do know that across the class, it would have been


approximately 5 percent.


One might say that that could vary, you know, by


individual.  The record evidence would indicate, however,


that Barbara Grutter would not have been admitted under a


race-blind program, although that issue has not been


litigated to conclusion.


QUESTION:  I don't know any other area where we


-- where we decide the case by saying well, there are very


few people who are being treated unconstitutionally. 

I mean, if this indeed is an unconstitutional


treatment of -- of this woman, because of her race,


surely, it doesn't make any difference whether she is one


of very few who have been treated unconstitutionally.

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


THE WITNESS:  Thank you, if I may follow-up on


the last question.


Counsel's answer to the last couple of


questions, I think, really crystallizes the difference


between their position and ours.  The University of


Michigan sees this as a question of group rights.  There


are rights on the part of minorities.  And there are


rights -- there are rights on the part of whites and


Asians and other -- other groups.


We see it very differently.  The Constitution


protects the rights of individuals, not racial groups.


The Bakke case opening up 16 spaces in the class


when that system was struck down meant that about 2,500


students, 2,500 to 3,000 students who had previously been 

discriminated against now had an opportunity to compete


for those seats.


So it seems to me the question is not answered


by how many have been discriminated against.


The question is whether in fact discrimination


is occurring against the individual and it certainly is in


this particular case.


Counsel was asked some questions about the


open-ended nature of the policy at issue here.  And I


think it's very critical that we understand that if the

interests that they are asserting here to be compelling is


upheld as compelling by this Court, we have in fact the


first indefinite, ongoing, unlimited compelling interest.


The Court previously has confined its analysis


to remedying -- remedying identified discrimination.  A


remedy based on societal discrimination or a role-model


theory for example in Wygant.  A couple of the reasons


that the Court struck down those rationals was because


they were so unlimited, so amorphus, indefinite with


respect to time.


That certainly is the case with the interest


that is being urged here today.


And it seems to me that that is -- it becomes


very clear in the University's argument that what they've


done -- and they didn't argue so much this in the lower 

court, but they made it very clear that their


justification for the preferences is based in effect on


remedying societal discrimination.


Their argument and their briefs and in this


Court has been that when the day comes, someday and maybe


it will come someday, we hope that it will, that someday


that we will be able to stop using race for these


purposes.


And the opinion that accepted that rationale it


seems to me would be a dramatic step backward from this


56 

Court's precedents which have rejected the notion that


something as amorphus as societal discrimination would be


sufficient.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you Mr. Kolbo. 


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
