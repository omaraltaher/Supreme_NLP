ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE


            8                    

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


            9              

MR. GARRE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


           10    

may it please the Court:


           11              

For decades Federal employers and the Merit


           12    

Systems Protection Board have engaged in the common sense


           13    

practice of considering an employee's prior disciplinary


           14    

record in deciding what punishment is appropriate for


           15    

subsequent misconduct.  The settled practice has long been


           16    

to do so, even when a prior disciplinary action is subject


           17    

to a pending labor grievance, although in that context,


           18    

the board permits the employee to collaterally attack the


           19    

prior actions in proceedings before it. 


           20              

In this case, the Federal circuit --


           21              

QUESTION:  If there is a collateral attack, the


           22    

employee says, look, I filed a grievance and it's pending,


           23    

what then is the burden of proof by the Government


           24    

employer?


           25              

MR. GARRE:  The Government employer bears the

            1    

burden of proving the action by a preponderance of the


            2    

evidence.  That's the standard that's set out in the


            3    

statute.  Now, that -- that burden of proof -- the


            4    

evidentiary focus of the hearing is on whether the


            5    

Government has proved the charges resulting in the adverse


            6    

action.  Here those charges --


            7              

QUESTION:  But what -- what is it with regard to


            8    

the prior offenses, if you will, that have -- for which


            9    

grievance procedures have been filed?  How is that then


           10    

addressed? 


           11              

MR. GARRE:  Under the longstanding framework,


           12    

which is established by the board's Bolling decision, the


           13    

employer has to prove the fact of the prior action, and he


           14    

has to -- and the employer has to prove that it was


           15    

preceded by certain procedural protections:  first, that


           16    

the employee received advance notice of the action;


           17    

second, that the employee had an opportunity to respond to


           18    

the charges before the supervisor, as well as by a higher


           19    

authority within the agency; and third, that there was a


           20    

record --


           21              

QUESTION:  Does that just mean somebody higher


           22    

up the ladder in the employing agency? 


           23              

MR. GARRE:  It does, and that's -- and that's


           24    

the same type of challenge that is framed in the early


           25    

stages of the grievance process.  It's an independent

            1    

authority than the supervisor. 


            2              

In this case, the notice of removal was -- the


            3    

proposed notice was made by the respondent's supervisor,


            4    

but the -- the actual notice of decision was entered by a


            5    

labor relations specialist who -- who was in a different


            6    

district, independent from the supervisor. 


            7              

QUESTION:  Well, what if the final action, the


            8    

decision to terminate the services of the employee -- what


            9    

if it had been based on the commission of some prior


           10    

failure as an employee and the grievance procedure had


           11    

proceeded and it had been determined that it was invalid?


           12              

MR. GARRE:  In that circumstance, the board has


           13    

held that it would be inappropriate to rely on that action


           14    

to defend the subsequent action.  However, until or unless


           15    

a prior action is proved to be unreliable, there's no


           16    

basis for the Federal circuit's rule which presumes that


           17    

prior disciplinary actions are unreliable and effectively


           18    

presumes that employers act in faith when they take


           19    

important disciplinary actions --


           20              

QUESTION:  What happens --


           21              

QUESTION:  There was, in fact, here three


           22    

preceding incidents, as I recall, and a grievance was


           23    

filed on all of them.  As to one, it had already been


           24    

determined that the grievance -- that the disciplinary


           25    

action was improper.

            1              

MR. GARRE:  That's correct.  And -- and that can


            2    

happen, but it doesn't undermine the legitimacy of prior


            3    

actions that have not been overturned. 


            4              

And in addition, the board has a reopening


            5    

mechanism which permits employees to bring to the


            6    

attention of the board any new evidence, including any


            7    

evidence that a prior disciplinary action has been set


            8    

aside. 


            9              

The grievance is not a step in the decision


           10    

making of the prior disciplinary action.


           11              

QUESTION:  What about Justice O'Connor's


           12    

example?  And let me add one thing, that the prior


           13    

disciplinary actions are being grieved.  Now, in this


           14    

case, the later event leads the board to fire the person


           15    

in light of the prior disciplinary matters.  Then after


           16    

the person is fired, the board attorney goes to the


           17    

grievance person, the arbitrator, and says, there's no


           18    

need to continue this because the person doesn't work for


           19    

us anymore.  Now, what's supposed to happen in that


           20    

situation? 


           21              

MR. GARRE:  Well, first of all, there's --


           22    

grievances can be pressed before, during, and after


           23    

appeals before the Merit Systems Protection Board.  The


           24    

Merit Systems Protection Board, after all, has come up


           25    

with a practice which allows it to decide appeals before

            1    

it, and it chooses to consider the prior disciplinary


            2    

actions, whether or not they're -- they're subject to a


            3    

pending grievance. 


            4              

If a grievance does proceed and it proves


            5    

successful, then the board has a procedure by which it can


            6    

reopen an appeal and reconsider the appeal --


            7              

QUESTION:  What's the answer to my question?  My


            8    

question was -- should I repeat it or you have it? 


            9              

MR. GARRE:  My understanding is that even when a


           10    

grievance is proceeding, the board would -- would proceed


           11    

with the processing of its appeal. 


           12              

QUESTION:  My question is take the present


           13    

situation.  Let's call it bad thing A.  All right?  Now,


           14    

they're going to fire the person because of bad thing A


           15    

because there are previous disciplinary things, X, Y, and


           16    

Z.  X, Y, and Z are all in the process of being grieved. 


           17    

Now, they fire the person because of A, and then they go


           18    

to the arbitrator who's doing X, Y, and Z, and the board


           19    

says, arbitrator, stop everything, cancel the proceeding,


           20    

don't continue because she doesn't work for us anymore.  I


           21    

want to know how -- how we deal -- how you deal, how the


           22    

-- how someone deals with that situation. 


           23              

MR. GARRE:  I'm sorry.  I misunderstood your


           24    

question. 


           25              

The board doesn't have the authority to go to an

            1    

arbitrator and tell the arbitrator to stop the proceeding. 


            2    

What sometimes happens is the union chooses to withdraw


            3    

grievances when an employee -- employee's removal has been


            4    

affirmed by the board.  That's a decision that the Civil


            5    

Service Reform Act and the collective bargaining agreement


            6    

leave to the prerogative of the union.  The union's


            7    

decision to withdraw a grievance, after an employee has


            8    

been removed, provides no more basis for --


            9              

QUESTION:  So, your answer is, to my


           10    

hypothetical, it can't happen. 


           11              

MR. GARRE:  The board can't go to an arbitrator


           12    

and tell him to stop. 


           13              

QUESTION:  Well, can the -- what about the


           14    

employer?  Can the postal department say, well, you know,


           15    

she's not an employee here anyway, you don't need to


           16    

continue this?  Or is it -- you -- you leave me with the


           17    

impression, rightly or wrongly, that this -- that this is


           18    

just at the option of the union.


           19              

MR. GARRE:  It's --


           20              

QUESTION:  The union can proceed if it wants or


           21    

doesn't have to proceed.


           22              

MR. GARRE:  That's a matter covered by the


           23    

collective bargaining arrangement.  The Civil Service


           24    

Reform Act provides for the creation of a negotiated


           25    

grievance procedure.  The union and the employer have

            1    

reached a memorandum of understanding, under which once,


            2    

in this case, in the -- in the collective bargaining


            3    

arrangement in this case governing Postal Service


            4    

employees, once an employee is removed for disciplinary


            5    

reasons, the union typically withdraws the grievances. 


            6    

When the employee is not removed for disciplinary reasons,


            7    

the union chooses to press the grievances.  Those are


            8    

matters covered by the collective bargaining agreement,


            9    

and they provide no basis for upholding the Federal


           10    

circuit rule which creates a categorical rule that


           11    

employers can't --


           12              

QUESTION:  Well, but -- but what we're trying to


           13    

establish -- and I think you would have to concede -- that


           14    

there are some instances in which once the employee is


           15    

terminated, the grievance proceedings as to other matters


           16    

must stop. 


           17              

MR. GARRE:  That can happen and it happens


           18    

because of --


           19              

QUESTION:  And it -- and it's not just because


           20    

it's the option of the union other than what the union


           21    

agreed to in the collective bargaining agreement.


           22              

MR. GARRE:  The arrangement is the -- the


           23    

grievances are withdrawn by the union or they're withdrawn


           24    

under the arrangement that's been worked out under the


           25    

collective bargaining agreement.

QUESTION:  -- the collective bargaining

terminate?  And the arbitrator could then do it? 


            7              

MR. GARRE:  That -- that would be a decision


            8    

left to the arbitrator under the framework of the


            9    

negotiated grievance.  It can happen.


           10              

QUESTION:  All right.  Then once again, if it's


           11    

covered by the collective bargaining agreement, there's no


           12    

choice in the matter, the grievance is stopped.  If it's


           13    

not covered by the collective bargaining agreement, it may


           14    

still be stopped at the option of the arbitrator, and


           15    

there's nothing the employee can do about it.  Now, this


           16    

may not be fatal to your case, but if this happens, I


           17    

think we should confront it.  And Justice Breyer --


           18              

QUESTION:  Mr. Garre, I assume that this would


           19    

happen.  Does the ability of the union to terminate a


           20    

grievance exist even if the employee is fired the first


           21    

time?  When event X occurs, the employer says, this is


           22    

serious enough, you're fired after a proper hearing.  It's


           23    

up to the union whether to grieve that or not, isn't it?


           24              

MR. GARRE:  That's right. 


           25              

QUESTION:  And the union could say, you know, I

            2    

proceed any further.


            3              

MR. GARRE:  That's correct.  The -- the act


            4    

leaves to the --


            5              

QUESTION:  So, this injustice is not an -- if --


            6    

if that -- if that's what it is, is not an injustice


            7    

peculiar to this arrangement.  It -- it's a necessary


            8    

effect of leaving the prosecution of the grievance up to


            9    

the union. 


           10              

MR. GARRE:  That's right.  And -- and the act


           11    

does leave the prosecution of the -- of the grievance up


           12    

to the union and --


           13              

QUESTION:  Mr. Garre?


           14              

MR. GARRE:  -- through the arbitration. 


           15              

QUESTION:  In civil litigation generally, when


           16    

there -- when there's a proceeding that's dependent on a


           17    

prior proceeding that's on appeal, the standard operating


           18    

procedure is for the second proceeding to be held at


           19    

abeyance pending the appeal of the first.  Now, if we


           20    

followed that model, then we could say, yes, the employer


           21    

could take the disciplinary step, but while that's being


           22    

challenged, the MSPB must hold its case in abeyance until


           23    

the grievance goes through the process. 


           24              

Now, why isn't that solution, which applies in


           25    

civil litigation generally, applicable here?

            1              

MR. GARRE:  It's -- it's very problematic.  But


            2    

first of all, the general rule applied by the Federal


            3    

courts in the collateral estoppel effect is the fact that


            4    

a prior case is on appeal doesn't prevent a court from


            5    

giving the underlying case collateral estoppel effect. 


            6    

But --


            7              

QUESTION:  It doesn't -- doesn't prevent it, but


            8    

it is the standard proceeding to hold the second one in


            9    

abeyance. 


           10              

MR. GARRE:  But --


           11              

QUESTION:  So that you don't have the -- the


           12    

anomaly of giving effect to a judgment that has been


           13    

overturned.


           14              

MR. GARRE:  There are several problems with the


           15    

abeyance rule adopted by the Federal circuit, which is


           16    

essentially the narrow rule which is hypothesized by


           17    

respondent. 


           18              

First and most fundamentally, the Civil Service


           19    

Reform Act limits the Federal circuit's scope of review to


           20    

whether a legal ruling of the board is arbitrary,


           21    

capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise contrary


           22    

to law.  So, it's not enough for the Federal circuit to


           23    

come up with a rule that it thinks is fair or makes more


           24    

sense.  It has to come up with a rule which it thinks is


           25    

compelled by a provision of law.  And the Federal circuit

            1    

did not cite any provision. 


            2              

Secondly, as a policy matter, the abeyance rule


            3    

is very problematic.  The abeyance rule, first of all,


            4    

would frustrate Congress' intent to streamline the


            5    

administrative appeals process --


            6              

QUESTION:  Why -- why, if the agency action goes


            7    

into effect immediately?  What I'm presenting to you is


            8    

the -- the thing goes through the agency.  The agency says


            9    

you're out, and the person is out.  So, you have the


           10    

efficiency concern.


           11              

If, as, and when the prior grievances are


           12    

overturned so that the MSPB would no longer have those to


           13    

rely on, then the remedy could be reinstatement with back


           14    

pay.  But that example, if that's how the Federal circuit


           15    

decision works, meets your efficiency concern.  In the


           16    

interim, the employee is out. 


           17              

MR. GARRE:  Well, first of all, although the


           18    

employee is placed in a non-duty/non-pay status when she's


           19    

removed by the agency, she continues to fill a permanent


           20    

slot on the agency's rolls, and if the abeyance rule is


           21    

going to require agencies to keep the employee in that


           22    

position for months, if not years, on end, that's


           23    

problematic from the employer's perspective. 


           24              

Second and more generally, the abeyance --


           25              

QUESTION:  Well, if that's -- would you explain

            1    

that if to me?  Two, why would the -- why if the firing is


            2    

-- is okay, at least until it's overturned, why couldn't


            3    

the -- the agency fill the vacancy?


            4              

MR. GARRE:  The -- the employee is placed --


            5    

under the practice followed by the Postal Service and I


            6    

believe other employers as well, the employee occupies the


            7    

full-time slot, and until her removal is affirmed by the


            8    

board, she continues to fill that slot.  Now, the employee


            9    

can replace her position with -- with temporary workers,


           10    

but nevertheless, from the employer's standpoint, he's


           11    

prevented -- the employer is prevented from filling that


           12    

-- that full-time slot. 


           13              

The abeyance rule creates other problems.  It --


           14    

it leaves the most important disciplinary decisions,


           15    

including a removal and -- hanging limbo for months, if


           16    

not years, on end. 


           17              

QUESTION:  Well, when you speak of months --


           18              

MR. GARRE:  It also --


           19              

QUESTION:  May I just ask you to get into this


           20    

problem of months and years?  The months and years problem


           21    

I -- I understand is simply a function of what you claim


           22    

to be the slow pace of arbitration.  It may take months


           23    

and years to do it.  But if the arbitration, in effect, is


           24    

a creature of the collective bargaining agreement, why


           25    

isn't it open to the Government and the -- the union

            1    

simply to come up with a streamlined arbitration procedure


            2    

so instead of taking months and years, it's going to take


            3    

a month? 


            4              

MR. GARRE:  I think they have tried, but the


            5    

fact is that in the Postal Service, there's currently


            6    

126,000 grievances pending in that process, backlogged. 


            7    

And the fact is that grievances are taking as long as


            8    

years, not in every case, but certainly in many cases,


            9    

they're taking years to be processed through arbitration. 


           10    

And this is the situation --


           11              

QUESTION:  Well, I guess we need more


           12    

arbitrators.


           13              

MR. GARRE:  Well, this is the situation that


           14    

exists, and the board isn't required to hold its appeals


           15    

in abeyance while that procedure is played out. 


           16              

QUESTION:  No, but my -- my -- I guess my point


           17    

is that you say this is the situation that exists.  There


           18    

are a number of reasons why it exists, but -- but one of


           19    

the responsible parties, it seems to me, is your client,


           20    

is the Government.  And why -- why isn't it the


           21    

Government's responsibility, along with the union, to come


           22    

up with a grievance procedure, whether it calls for more


           23    

arbitrators or different procedural rules?  I have no


           24    

idea, but why isn't it the -- the responsibility of the


           25    

parties to come up with a procedure that's not going to

            1    

take years? 


            2              

MR. GARRE:  Well, first of all, the inherent


            3    

informality of the grievance and arbitration process is


            4    

always going to invite delay.  That's not new to this


            5    

case.


            6              

And second of all --


            7              

QUESTION:  Well, litigation invites delay.  But


            8    

if a judge takes charge of a case, the delay is reduced,


            9    

and the case moves forward expeditiously.  Why not in


           10    

arbitration? 


           11              

MR. GARRE:  Well, that hasn't happened, and I


           12    

don't think it's unique to the Postal Service arbitration


           13    

context. 


           14              

There are also mechanisms in place, as this


           15    

Court recognized in the Cornelius case, which can address


           16    

that, and that's that either side can file an unfair labor


           17    

practice charge.  Either side can seek to compel


           18    

arbitration.  Either side can file a grievances. 


           19              

QUESTION:  Mr. Garre, do you think that for


           20    

purposes of either collateral estoppel or for purposes of


           21    

whether a criminal court can use a prior conviction in


           22    

deciding the sentence -- do you think it's accurate to


           23    

analogize the grievance procedure as a prior case pending


           24    

on appeal?  Or would you rather characterize it as a


           25    

collateral attack --

            1              

MR. GARRE:  I think it's --


            2              

QUESTION:  -- upon final action by the employer?


            3              

MR. GARRE:  I think it's the latter.  I think


            4    

that the grievance is a collateral proceeding.  It's not


            5    

-- it's not an appeal in itself.  It's -- it's a


            6    

collateral proceeding --


            7              

QUESTION:  And -- and what happens to collateral


            8    

attacks when you have a final criminal conviction and


            9    

there is a collateral attack on that criminal conviction,


           10    

although the conviction itself is final?  When a


           11    

sentencing court has that conviction before it, does it


           12    

not use that conviction? 


           13              

MR. GARRE:  Absolutely.  In fact, I think the


           14    

sentencing guidelines direct the court to take that


           15    

into --


           16              

QUESTION:  And if the collateral attack is later


           17    

successful, what is -- what is the remedy for the person


           18    

who's been convicted? 


           19              

MR. GARRE:  Then they can bring it to the


           20    

attention of the court and ask for relief. 


           21              

QUESTION:  To reopen -- to reopen the


           22    

proceeding. 


           23              

MR. GARRE:  That's correct.  And that -- and


           24    

that --

            1    

case here where, as I understand it, there were three


            2    

prior complaints by the employer that resulted in some


            3    

form of disciplinary action.  Grievances were filed in all


            4    

three.  With the discharge proceeding, the employee then


            5    

appealed to the board.  And before the board acted, one of


            6    

the grievances pertaining to the first infraction was


            7    

found in the employee's favor. 


            8              

Now, what should we do?  It's been remanded, as


            9    

I understand it, now by the court of appeals to the board. 


           10    

Does it need to be?  Because the termination relied in


           11    

part on all three of these things.


           12              

MR. GARRE:  Well, we think that this Court


           13    

should decide the question presented, reverse the decision


           14    

below, and remand for further proceedings, allow the


           15    

Federal circuit --


           16              

QUESTION:  What happened to the other two


           17    

grievances filed? 


           18              

MR. GARRE:  The other two grievances were


           19    

withdrawn by the union when the board affirmed the -- the


           20    

removal.  The union has -- has tried to reassert those,


           21    

and the Postal Service's position is that this Court ought


           22    

to decide this case, and then we can consider what should


           23    

happen there. 


           24              

Now, this Court should decide the question


           25

This -- the Federal circuit --


            2              

QUESTION:  Why is the remand necessary?  What --


            3    

if we agree with -- with you on the merits, what -- what


            4    

remains to be decided by the Federal circuit?


            5              

MR. GARRE:  The -- the issue that -- that


            6    

remains open is the question of what effect the grievance


            7    

that has been set aside should have on the board's


            8    

decision affirming the removal. 


            9              

Now, we think that an argument could be made


           10    

that the Federal circuit could affirm since the respondent


           11    

did not bring that grievance to the attention of the


           12    

Federal -- to the Merit Systems Protection Board, although


           13    

she indisputably could have, and she raised it for the


           14    

first time in the Federal circuit.  But we don't think


           15    

that this Court needs to address --


           16              

QUESTION:  You say if we reverse on the question


           17    

presented, we should leave it to the Federal circuit to


           18    

decide whether to direct reopening of the proceedings or


           19    

to affirm the MSPB? 


           20              

MR. GARRE:  We -- we -- that's what we would ask


           21    

this Court to do. 


           22              

We're concerned about the Federal circuit's


           23    

categorical rule that Federal employers and the Merit


           24    

Systems Protection Board can't consider these prior


           25    

disciplinary actions, engage in what is, for public

            2    

practice --


            3              

QUESTION:  There's a disagreement between you


            4    

and the respondent, is there not, about whether the


            5    

agency, the Postal Service, is bound or whether it's only


            6    

the MSPB.  I -- I think that you say the Federal circuit


            7    

has said nobody can take account of these prior


            8    

infractions.  And the respondent says, the MSPB can't but


            9    

the employing agency can. 


           10              

MR. GARRE:  We -- we think that the fairest


           11    

reading of the court of appeals decision, as it applies


           12    

both to Federal employers and the Merit Systems Protection


           13    

Board, the holding of the court is unqualified.  It says


           14    

that consideration may not be given to these prior actions


           15    

as long as there are grievances.  The remand order of the


           16    

court indicates that the court of appeals viewed that rule


           17    

as limiting the -- the prior actions that the agency could


           18    

consider in this case based on whether or not they're


           19    

subject to further proceedings. 


           20              

QUESTION:  Okay.  Their -- their point on that


           21    

particularly is -- the particular point I think on this is


           22    

that the Federal circuit really just said the -- the MSPB. 


           23    

And normally by the time something gets to the MSPB, all


           24    

the prior grievances will be resolved because that takes a


           25    

very long time to get there.  And then if the occasional

            1    

case comes up where it wasn't resolved, the MSPB can just


            2    

postpone deciding it, I guess, during which time the


            3    

employee is out of work.  So, there's no harm done through


            4    

that narrow interpretation of the circuit. 


            5              

What's your response to that? 


            6              

MR. GARRE:  Well, first of all, we don't -- we


            7    

don't think that's the fairest interpretation of the court


            8    

of appeals decision.  But even assuming this Court were to


            9    

adopt that interpretation, there are several problems with


           10    

the Federal circuit's abeyance -- with respondent's


           11    

abeyance rule. 


           12              

The first is -- is that it frustrates Congress'


           13    

intent to streamline the administrative appeals process. 


           14    

Congress placed a duty upon the Merit Systems Protection


           15    

Board to expedite its proceedings to the extent


           16    

practicable because one of the factors that led to the


           17    

enactment of the Civil Service Reform Act in 1978 was the


           18    

concern that the overly elaborate procedural protections


           19    

which had developed under the prior Civil Service regime


           20    

had -- had prevented employers from taking the most


           21    

effective disciplinary measures because of concerns that


           22    

things would be subjected to drawn-out appeals.  Employers


           23    

simply weren't taking the most effective disciplinary


           24    

action.  That's one of the problems --


           25              

QUESTION:  Mr. Garre, does the Government

            1    

acknowledge that the MSPB can determine that it is


            2    

arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion for the


            3    

agency to decline to reopen a proceeding after a grievance


            4    

has gone forward and has found one of the convictions on


            5    

which the dismissal is based to have been invalid? 


            6              

MR. GARRE:  The -- the board's regulations


            7    

permit the board to reopen any case at any time to


            8    

reconsider it in light of a grievance which may have


            9    

proved successful.  And our position is that employees


           10    

have the opportunity to request --


           11              

QUESTION:  Excuse me.  The board's regulations


           12    

permit that? 


           13              

MR. GARRE:  Yes. 


           14              

QUESTION:  Is it a matter of the board's right? 


           15    

Doesn't the board have to find that the agency action, in


           16    

refusing to reopen, is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse


           17    

of discretion?  I mean, the board can say when it will


           18    

reopen it's own cases, but -- but the board can't tell the


           19    

agency when the agency must reopen its cases, can it,


           20    

unless the failure to reopen is arbitrary or capricious?


           21              

MR. GARRE:  No.  That's correct.  That's


           22    

correct.  I'm -- I'm sorry.  I thought you were asking


           23    

about the board's reopening rule. 


           24              

QUESTION:  I'm not talking about the board's


           25    

reopening.  I'm talking about ultimate success in the

            1    

grievance and then -- then the employee comes back to the


            2    

agency and says, look, you -- you goofed.  I really wasn't


            3    

guilty of that.  Would you reopen it?  And the agency says


            4    

no. 


            5              

MR. GARRE:  Well, certainly in that --


            6              

QUESTION:  Can the board find that to be an


            7    

abuse of discretion? 


            8              

MR. GARRE:  That's -- the typical practice is


            9    

that the employee will go to the board and say, reopen my


           10    

appeal because this grievance has proved successful.  If


           11    

the employee went to the employer first and asked it to


           12    

reconsider it, then I suppose the employee could appeal


           13    

from another decision, if there were another decision, on


           14    

the discipline.  But the more common practice is for the


           15    

employee to go to the Merit Systems Protection Board and


           16    

say, reopen my case because of this subsequent action. 


           17    

So, typically --


           18              

QUESTION:  And that's the MSPB rule, that if --


           19    

if while the MSPB thing is still going on, one of the


           20    

grievances -- the MSPB, if the person hasn't been fired,


           21    

will reconsider.  So, the employee is instructed to go to


           22    

the MSPB, not back to the employing agency.


           23              

MR. GARRE:  The employee may do that, and the


           24    

board may do that.  And the reopening procedure is


           25    

available under the board's regulations at any time.

QUESTION:  But it's discretionary, isn't it? 


            2    

The board doesn't have to reopen if it doesn't want to.


            3              

MR. GARRE:  It is discretionary, and that's


            4    

really no different than any other reopening procedure


            5    

which would exist to enable a court or other body to


            6    

reconsider something in light of subsequent evidence.


            7              

The -- the respondent's basic position and the


            8    

Federal circuit's basic position is predicated on the


            9    

notion that prior disciplinary actions are unreliable and


           10    

that Federal employers act in bad faith when they impose


           11    

discipline.  And we respectfully take issue with that.


           12              

QUESTION:  Also on the proposition that they are


           13    

not final in -- in the sense that -- that a -- a judicial


           14    

determination is final.  It seems to me that's -- that's


           15    

important to the -- to the analysis. 


           16              

MR. GARRE:  We think that they are final.


           17    

They're preceded by the procedural protections set out in


           18    

the act, and they're final enough to warrant the


           19    

imposition of discipline in a minor case.  If they're


           20    

final enough to warrant the imposition of discipline,


           21    

they're final enough to warrant collateral effect in


           22    

appeal before the board.  And here we're talking about the


           23    

minor actions. 


           24              

QUESTION:  I don't want to consume your rebuttal


           25    

time, but there's one question that still hasn't been

On remand, what would your position be as to the


            3    

two unadjudicated grievances? 


            4              

MR. GARRE:  We think that the board can take


            5    

those into account under the Bolling framework, which


            6    

allows the board to consider the prior disciplinary


            7    

actions under a procedural framework which looks to the


            8    

procedural protections provided in those proceedings and


            9    

then considers whether those actions --


           10              

QUESTION:  What would your position be before


           11    

the Postal Service as to the union's request to reopen


           12    

those? 


           13              

MR. GARRE:  To reopen the?


           14              

QUESTION:  Those -- or to continue those --


           15    

those pretermitted grievance proceedings. 


           16              

MR. GARRE:  Those arbitrations could go forward. 


           17    

Again, there's nothing that --


           18              

QUESTION:  And you have no objection to those


           19    

going forward? 


           20              

MR. GARRE:  The --

QUESTION:  I thought -- I thought the union was


           22    

wanting to go forward, and the Postal Service didn't. 


           23              

MR. GARRE:  Under the memorandum that's in


           24    

place, if the respondent's removal were affirmed by the


           25    

board, then under the memorandum in place, the union's

            1    

practice is to withdraw those agreements under the


            2    

collective bargaining arrangement.  That could be


            3    

renegotiated or reconsidered, but that's the practice in


            4    

place, and that's something that the act permits the


            5    

parties to agree to under the negotiated grievance


            6    

framework.


            7              

QUESTION:  Mr. Garre, apropos of the remand, you


            8    

mentioned that the respondent had not brought to the


            9    

board's attention the fact that the arbitrator had ordered


           10    

the first disciplinary action vacated.  Did the Government


           11    

have any responsibility to bring that to the attention of


           12    

the board?


           13              

MR. GARRE:  Ordinarily we would bring that to


           14    

the attention of the board.  It was not brought to the


           15    

attention of the board in this case because different


           16    

parties were -- were governing the different proceedings. 


           17    

But the fact is, is that it was not brought to the


           18    

attention of the board.  It could have been brought to the


           19    

attention of the board and still could be today. 


           20              

If there are no further questions --


           21              

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Garre.

please the Court:


            2              

What I would like to do is I would like to start


            3    

by responding to Mr. Garre's suggestion that our proposed


            4    

rule may be a good idea but is not required by the


            5    

statute.  We think it most certainly is, and this also


            6    

picks up on a question from Justice O'Connor. 


            7              

5 U.S.C., section 7701(c)(1)(B), which is copied


            8    

at page 51 in the appendix to the petition, provides that


            9    

the decision of the agency shall be sustained -- and that


           10    

is by the MSPB -- only if the agency's decision is


           11    

supported by a preponderance of the evidence.  That


           12    

provision calls for de novo review in the MSPB, in which


           13    

the agency bears the burden of proof to prove -- of proof


           14    

by a preponderance of the evidence. 


           15              

And it's important to understand that that


           16    

applies not only to the conduct charged in the particular


           17    

charge before the MSPB -- here, for example, the conduct

charged to have taken place on September 13, 1997 -- but


           19    

also to aggravating facts to which the agency points in


           20    

support of its choice of punishment.  The MSPB --


           21              

QUESTION:  You're talking now about review


           22    

before the MSPB, not before the Federal circuit.  Is that


           23    

correct? 


           24              

MR. BRANDS:  That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice. 


           25    

The MSPB has held that whenever the agency comes before

            1    

the MSPB and relies on aggravating facts, not necessarily


            2    

the particular charge before the MSPB, but other things,


            3    

for example, the employee is simply not very good or


            4    

something like that, that has to be proven as well by --


            5    

by a preponderance de novo in the MSPB.  That was held in


            6    

Douglas v. Veterans Administration in 1981, a seminal


            7    

decision in 1981, with which I do not --


            8              

QUESTION:  You mean even if a grievance is not


            9    

pending, the board would have to review the prior


           10    

disciplinary action to be sure that that was supported by


           11    

a preponderance of the evidence?  Surely it doesn't mean


           12    

that.


           13              

MR. BRANDS:  Well, Justice Scalia, I think that


           14    

the burden of proof is always the same.  The statute


           15    

says --


           16              

QUESTION:  Yes, but the burden of proof is this


           17    

employee has been convicted of prior disciplinary


           18    

violations in the past. 


           19              

MR. BRANDS:  And --


           20              

QUESTION:  Q.E.D., proven.


           21              

MR. BRANDS:  Certainly when --


           22              

QUESTION:  You're saying that's not enough.  The


           23    

-- the board has to inquire as to whether that prior


           24    

conviction, even if it was not grieved, was a valid one.


           25              

MR. BRANDS:  No, Justice Scalia, we're not

            1    

saying that.  In the situation you posit, namely where


            2    

there was a past disciplinary action which either was not


            3    

taken to the board or which became final after it was


            4    

taken to the board -- in that situation it may well be


            5    

reasonable to assume that the prior is supported by a


            6    

preponderance of the evidence.  And in fact, if it was


            7    

taken to the board or to an arbitrator and the arbitration


            8    

has become final, then one would think that ordinarily it


            9    

would become collateral estoppel.  But that is not --


           10              

QUESTION:  Isn't that same presumption still


           11    

valid even though the -- the action is being grieved?


           12              

MR. BRANDS:  Well, two things --


           13              

QUESTION:  It's not as though it were unilateral


           14    

employer action without a hearing and procedural


           15    

guarantees.  There's a whole -- you know, a whole series


           16    

of procedures that the employer has -- the Federal


           17    

employer has to go through, and -- and when those


           18    

procedures are followed, there is a judgment by the


           19    

employer.


           20              

MR. BRANDS:  That is certainly --


           21              

QUESTION:  And I gather that judgment is final


           22    

until -- what you're grieving is employer action, and --


           23    

and that action is final until a grievance overturns it.


           24              

MR. BRANDS:  Justice Scalia, I think that the


           25    

analogy that the Government would like to draw is to an


29

            1    

agency action that is subject to section 706 review under


            2    

the APA, but that is not the right analogy, we


            3    

respectfully submit. 


            4              

The right analogy would be to on-the-record


            5    

adjudication under section 554 and 556 of the APA, the


            6    

situation where an agency simply levels charges.  If you


            7    

don't do anything about them, those charges will become


            8    

final, but if you put the agency to the burden of -- of


            9    

proof, then you become the defendant in -- in the MSPB. 


           10    

You -- you have the ability to put the Government to the


           11    

burden of -- of proof. 


           12              

For example, in Jackson v. Veterans


           13    

Administration, a Federal circuit decision of 1985, the --


           14    

the Federal circuit described it as follows:  by seeking


           15    

review, an employee places the agency in the position of a


           16    

plaintiff who has the burden of proof, who must come


           17    

forward with evidence to establish the fact of misconduct,


           18    

and the ultimate burden of persuasion is on the


           19    

Government.


           20              

QUESTION:  Well, what we're reviewing here, Mr.


           21    

Brands, is not the Merit Systems Protection Board's


           22    

action, but the action of the Federal circuit.  And I


           23    

think it's agreed that the board decision before it must


           24    

stand unless it's arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of


           25    

discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.

            1              

MR. BRANDS:  Right. 


            2              

QUESTION:  As I understand it, the Federal


            3    

circuit here said this was not in accordance with law. 


            4    

And I was puzzled at that because they didn't seem to


            5    

point to any law. 


            6              

MR. BRANDS:  Well, that is true, and perhaps the


            7    

brevity of the -- of the discussion by the court of


            8    

appeals can be explained on the ground of the fact that


            9    

the Government did not respond to any of respondent's


           10    

arguments in the court of appeals. 


           11              

But the basic answer here is that what is not in


           12    

accordance with law about how the MSPB treats prior


           13    

disciplinary actions is that it disregards -- it


           14    

arbitrarily disregards the burden of proof. 


           15              

QUESTION:  Well, but you -- you say it's not in


           16    

accordance with law, and then in the same sentence, you


           17    

say it arbitrarily disregards the burden of proof.  Now, I


           18    

would think those are two separate things under that


           19    

statutory language.  If it's contrary to law, I think you


           20    

have to point to some provision of law --


           21              

MR. BRANDS:  And that's --


           22              

QUESTION:  -- which I don't think the Federal


           23    

circuit did. 


           24              

But you also say it's -- it's arbitrary.  And


           25    

why -- why -- the Federal circuit didn't say that.

MR. BRANDS:  That is correct, but nevertheless,


            2    

its judgment, we think, is -- is right on the money. 


            3              

We think that there are two things wrong with


            4    

the way the MSPB does -- does -- treats prior disciplinary


            5    

actions.  One is it ignores the statutory burden of proof


            6    

standard, section 7701(c)(1)(B).  Secondly --


            7              

QUESTION:  Now, that's -- that's the standard


            8    

you say governs the Merit Systems Protection Board?


            9              

MR. BRANDS:  That is correct.  Whenever the --


           10    

whenever an agency comes before the MSPB, it cannot say


           11    

you have to defer to what we did because there was a


           12    

hearing and because there was notice and so on and so --


           13              

QUESTION:  But that wasn't the basis for the


           14    

Federal circuit's decision here. 


           15              

MR. BRANDS:  We think it actually was, Your


           16    

Honor, because under --


           17              

QUESTION:  Where -- where do you find that? 


           18              

MR. BRANDS:  We find that at the petition


           19    

appendix 7a where the court of appeals said that its rule


           20    

is necessary because the foundation of the board -- of the


           21    

MSPB's Douglas analysis would otherwise be compromised. 


           22    

That may be a little telegraphic, but what the court of


           23    

appeals meant by that is --


           24              

QUESTION:  Telescopic.

MR. BRANDS:  And again, we would -- we would


            2    

suggest that the telegraphic nature of that may -- may


            3    

also be blamed on the Government's conduct of the


            4    

litigation in the court of appeals. 


            5              

QUESTION:  Well, why -- why should it be blamed


            6    

on the Government? 


            7              

MR. BRANDS:  Well, let -- let me just explain


            8    

real quick what we think that the court of appeals meant


            9    

by that.  The court of appeals meant to say this.  Under


           10    

Douglas v. Veterans Administration, the MSPB in any given


           11    

case will conduct a -- an inquiry to ensure that the


           12    

penalty fits the crime, so to speak.  It will make sure


           13    

that the punishment is not disproportional, is not


           14    

unreasonable, and so on and so forth. 


           15              

In the course of that, it is well established,


           16    

also under Douglas, the -- the agency may point to


           17    

aggravating facts.  It may, for example, say this is not a


           18    

good employee or, as in this case, the employee has a


           19    

prior disciplinary record.  It may do that, but in


           20    

Douglas, the MSPB held those facts must be supported by a


           21    

preponderance of the evidence. 


           22              

QUESTION:  I thought you already conceded in --


           23    

in response to an earlier question of mine that -- that


           24    

the -- that the board does not have to establish by a


           25    

preponderance of the evidence the accuracy of any prior

disciplinary conviction. 


            2              

MR. BRANDS:  I don't think I said that, Your


            3    

Honor.


            4              

QUESTION:  I thought you did.  If you didn't,


            5    

then --


            6              

MR. BRANDS:  I would -- I would draw a


            7    

distinction --


            8              

QUESTION:  -- then why isn't it true?  Suppose


            9    

there had been no grievance.  Is it possible that the


           10    

board has to go back and decide whether the prior


           11    

disciplinary conviction was supported by a preponderance


           12    

of the evidence? 


           13              

MR. BRANDS:  Well, the -- the statutory burden,


           14    

of course, always applies.  The burden is on the agency.


           15              

QUESTION:  So, your answer is yes. 


           16              

MR. BRANDS:  No, it's not necessarily yes.  I


           17    

would -- I would distinguish between three factual


           18    

scenarios.


           19              

One, the situation where a punishment is imposed


           20    

and it simply becomes final because the employee never


           21    

grieves it or never goes to the MSPB.  If it then comes up


           22    

in a later case before the MSPB, I think it is certainly


           23    

reasonable for the agency to say, here are the documents


           24    

that show that this employee was -- was disciplined.  She


           25    

or he never grieved it or never took it before the MSPB,

and therefore, I have sustained my burden of proving --


            2              

QUESTION:  But it's not up to he or she.  It's


            3    

up to the union. 


            4              

MR. BRANDS:  No, that's actually not entirely


            5    

true.  In a case like this, where a major penalty is at


            6    

issue, the employee actually can take it to the MSPB and


            7    

has the right to do that. 


            8              

QUESTION:  But still that isn't this case.  We


            9    

could disagree with you and you'd still have a second


           10    

argument I take it.  If we disagree with you on that, do


           11    

you lose the case?  No, because this -- in this case we


           12    

have a grievance that was not fully determined.


           13              

MR. BRANDS:  That's -- that's precisely correct,


           14    

Your Honor.  We have in this particular case --


           15              

QUESTION:  And -- and frankly, I have trouble


           16    

with the proposition you just stated, but this case is


           17    

with -- with an unadjudicated grievance or a grievance


           18    

that had not been fully determined. 


           19              

MR. BRANDS:  Precisely.  That's exactly correct. 


           20    

And --


           21              

QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Brands, as I understand it,


           22    

the board, MSPB, applies its so-called Bolling rule. 


           23    

That is a case that the board itself decided, I guess. 


           24    

Now, if the board finds the factors in the Bolling case


           25    

satisfied is that enough to meet the statute?

in a situation like this situation where the prior is

being grieved, and here's why.

QUESTION:  Did you challenge the Bolling rule?

MR. BRANDS:  Well, the Bolling rule is squarely


            7    

before the Court.  The Government relies on it, and what


            8    

we're saying is that the Federal circuit held essentially


            9    

that the Bolling rule is not right.  It's not so much the


           10    

Bolling rule that is wrong --


           11              

QUESTION:  But do you assert that if -- if the


           12    

board applies its Bolling standard, that is not enough to


           13    

satisfy the statutory burden of proof? 


           14              

MR. BRANDS:  We think it is enough in a


           15    

situation where the prior has become final on its own


           16    

steam.  We think it is not enough in a situation where the


           17    

prior is still being grieved, and here is why. 


           18              

If the prior is being grieved, the Government's


           19    

decision does not get any deference.  It -- the Government


           20    

always bears the burden. 


           21              

QUESTION:  Well, but if you view the prior


           22    

disciplinary action taken by the employer as final,


           23    

subject only to some kind of collateral attack in a


           24    

grievance procedure, then it is final unless, at the end


           25    

of the day, the grievance procedure is successful.

MR. BRANDS:  That is not how we would


            2    

characterize it.  Justice -- Your Honor, this morning the


            3    

word collateral estoppel was first mentioned by Mr. Garre,


            4    

and that is remarkable because --


            5              

QUESTION:  I think not collateral estoppel. 


            6    

Viewing it -- the grievance as a collateral attack --


            7              

MR. BRANDS:  Well, we --


            8              

QUESTION:  -- on an otherwise final action.


            9              

MR. BRANDS:  We would not view it as a


           10    

collateral attack.  What happens if -- you either go to an


           11    

arbitrator or to the MSPB, if you place the Government in


           12    

the position of being a plaintiff who has the burden of


           13    

proof, who has the burden of proving de novo that what it


           14    

alleges actually happens.  It is interesting that the


           15    

Government is -- is now saying that collateral attack


           16    

somehow applies to the agency's decision, and Justice


           17    

Ginsburg asked --


           18              

QUESTION:  Mr. Brands, it wasn't the Government. 


           19    

It was Justice Scalia who said this is not comparable to


           20    

an appeal for my suggestion that you would hold the second


           21    

proceeding in abeyance would apply.  It is not an appeal. 


           22              

MR. BRANDS:  Very well. 


           23              

QUESTION:  I'm -- I'm guilty. 


           24

(Laughter.) 


            2              

QUESTION:  But why did -- but when you answer


            3    

the question, would you tell us why it would make any


            4    

difference whether it is -- whether there's the collateral


            5    

proceeding going on, whether there's a direct attack going


            6    

on?  Why isn't there a presumption of regularity that


            7    

attends the Government's action until it is, in fact,


            8    

overturned as a result of the arbitration process? 


            9              

MR. BRANDS:  We think there's no presumption of


           10    

regularity because when the action comes before the board


           11    

or before an arbitrator itself, it is not entitled to any


           12    

presumption of regularity.


           13              

QUESTION:  That's for purposes of the


           14    

arbitration proceeding.  But for purposes outside the


           15    

arbitration proceeding itself, why isn't there a


           16    

presumption of regularity until it is overturned and


           17    

vacated? 


           18              

MR. BRANDS:  Simply for this reason, Justice --


           19    

Justice Souter.  Whenever the Government comes before the


           20    

board and points to aggravating circumstances, it must


           21    

prove those by a preponderance of the evidence. 


           22              

QUESTION:  But that's the -- but I mean, that


           23    

gets us back to the question we keep going back and forth


           24    

on.  Do they have to prove the fact of the determination


           25    

that there was in fact some prior infraction or do they

            1    

have to prove the existence of the infraction in substance


            2    

just as if they were proving it as part of the current


            3    

charge?  And it seems odd to me to say that they would


            4    

have to prove it just as much as if it were part of the


            5    

current charge. 


            6              

MR. BRANDS:  Well, I would -- I would


            7    

distinguish between three situations.  If it has been


            8    

adjudicated and has become final before an arbitrator,


            9    

then collateral estoppel will apply.  If, however, it is


           10    

being challenged, collateral estoppel should not apply. 


           11    

It is hornbook law that collateral estoppel does not apply


           12    

when a decision --


           13              

QUESTION:  Well, I'm not saying that collateral


           14    

estoppel applies.  The -- the -- you know, the employee


           15    

may be able to attack it.  I'm simply saying that if it is


           16    

-- it is not somehow shown to be invalid affirmatively,


           17    

why shouldn't a presumption of regularity attach.  And I


           18    

think you're saying that no presumption of regularity


           19    

attaches, that the Government has the burden as an initial


           20    

matter. 


           21              

MR. BRANDS:  That is correct, although that


           22    

burden will be very easy to discharge in a case where a


           23    

prior has already become final or, for that matter, where


           24    

a prior was never attacked.


           25              

QUESTION:  Okay.  And you're saying the reason

            1    

it isn't easy, when it is attacked, is that there is no


            2    

presumption of regularity. 


            3              

MR. BRANDS:  There is --


            4              

QUESTION:  And I want to know there should be no


            5    

presumption of regularity. 


            6              

MR. BRANDS:  Presumption of regularity are


            7    

applied to a Government action that itself is entitled to


            8    

deference when it is reviewed by a court.  The kind of


            9    

Government action that we're talking about --


           10              

QUESTION:  But that's my question.  Is it


           11    

entitled to enough deference so that all you have to do is


           12    

prove the fact of the Government action, that being


           13    

sufficient, unless it is affirmatively shown that the


           14    

Government action was wrong or invalid?  That's the


           15    

question. 


           16              

MR. BRANDS:  The Government action, if it is


           17    

taken to the MSPB, is not entitled to any deference at all


           18    

because the Government bears the burden of proving de novo


           19    

that what happened actually occurred.  Therefore, if


           20    

there's no deference -- if the Government is not entitled


           21    

to --


           22              

QUESTION:  Then -- then what you're saying is


           23    

that the -- that the aggravating fact is subject to


           24    

exactly the same burden of proof that the specific


           25    

instance of -- of later conduct is -- is subject to, the

            1    

-- the instance that gets us before the board on appeal


            2    

anyway. 


            3              

MR. BRANDS:  That's precisely correct, although


            4    

as I said, in two situations that is a burden of proof


            5    

that should be very easy to discharge. 


            6              

QUESTION:  Yes, and I understand. 


            7              

MR. BRANDS:  It's only in that third situation. 


            8    

And note that the Government cannot rely on collateral


            9    

estoppel in that situation because it is well established


           10    

-- it's hornbook law -- that -- that when something is


           11    

reviewed de novo, it is not subject to collateral review. 


           12    

For example, Wright and Miller say that in section 4433.


           13              

QUESTION:  Well, but if -- if you're talking


           14    

about judicial proceedings, I don't think those rules


           15    

would necessarily carry over to this sort of rather low


           16    

level administrative proceeding. 


           17              

MR. BRANDS:  Your Honor, far be it for me, of


           18    

course, to -- to argue that collateral estoppel should


           19    

apply, but the MSPB, for example, has applied collateral


           20    

estoppel to prior final arbitral orders, and we don't


           21    

necessarily see anything wrong with that.  And we think


           22    

that if the Government later comes before the MSPB and


           23    

points to a prior that was upheld by an arbitrator, it


           24    

thereby -- it thereby discharges its burden of proving


           25    

that the prior conduct actually happens.  We don't think


41

            1    

that in a situation where that prior is being reviewed de


            2    

novo it makes sense to simply assume that the conduct


            3    

charged in that prior disciplinary action actually


            4    

occurred.


            5              

QUESTION:  Well, but to say that the prior is


            6    

reviewed de novo, I'm not sure that that is an entirely


            7    

accurate statement because it was a prior that was left


            8    

unchallenged, I take it, at the time. 


            9              

MR. BRANDS:  No, Your Honor.  All three priors


           10    

here were, in fact, under review at the time that the


           11    

Government pointed to them as -- as --


           12              

QUESTION:  So, your statement then is limited to


           13    

the sort of prior which is under review. 


           14              

MR. BRANDS:  That's -- that's precisely correct. 


           15    

We're not saying that the Government, when -- when


           16    

charging an employee with misconduct, may not point to


           17    

that prior, but when it comes before the MSPB, it must


           18    

discharge its burden of proof.


           19              

QUESTION:  What is --


           20              

QUESTION:  What -- what if the employer says


           21    

there is a prior here, as well as the current conduct,


           22    

that has never been grieved, never been challenged? 


           23              

MR. BRANDS:  Well, in that situation, it would


           24    

ordinarily be reasonable for the Government to argue and


           25    

the MSPB to -- to agree that it's reasonable to assume

that a preponderance of the evidence exists in such a


            2    

situation because if the -- if the employee thought that a


            3    

preponderance did not exist, then he or she would probably


            4    

have taken it to the MSPB or to an arbitrator.


            5              

QUESTION:  The board has to assume that.  But as


            6    

I understand your case, the agency itself doesn't. 


            7              

MR. BRANDS:  Well, the agency is not -- is not


            8    

-- the question of whether or not the agency may simply


            9    

level a charge is not subject to this burden of proof. 


           10    

This burden of proof applies before the MSPB.


           11              

QUESTION:  Do you know of any other situation in


           12    

which the -- the review of agency action is conducted on a


           13    

basis more demanding than the agency action itself?


           14              

MR. BRANDS:  Your Honor --


           15              

QUESTION:  That is to say, if the agency ignored


           16    

the fact that -- that a grievance was pending, you assert


           17    

that would have been entirely lawful.  The agency could


           18    

say, I don't care if a grievance is pending.  He's been


           19    

convicted.  On the basis of that, you're fired.  And


           20    

that's perfectly okay, you say, for the agency to do.


           21              

MR. BRANDS:  Well, that --


           22              

QUESTION:  But then when it's on appeal to the


           23    

Merit Systems Protection Board, you say the Merit Systems


           24    

Protection Board can reverse the agency because at that


           25    

stage, suddenly the fact of the prior disciplinary action

is not determinative.  That's -- it's very strange.  I


            2    

don't know any other instance in administrative law where


            3    

what the agency does is right, but on appeal it's wrong.


            4              

MR. BRANDS:  I would not characterize it as an


            5    

appeal.  It's -- it's different from that.  It is much


            6    

more like when, for example, the FTC or the SEC staff


            7    

charges a defendant with misconduct, it has to prove that


            8    

to an administrative judge.  When the administrative judge


            9    

hears the case, the burden rests on the agency to prove


           10    

that by a preponderance.  However, when the --


           11              

QUESTION:  But -- but -- go on. 


           12              

MR. BRANDS:  When the agency levels its charges,


           13    

brings its charges in the first place, it does not have to


           14    

worry, do we -- can we sustain the burden of proof.  It


           15    

can simply say we think there's probable cause of


           16    

misconduct here.  It is much more like a prosecutor who


           17    

charges misconduct. 


           18              

QUESTION:  Well, of course, it has to worry


           19    

about the burden of proof.  It's arbitrary, capricious, or


           20    

contrary to law if it isn't supported by the evidence. 


           21              

MR. BRANDS:  I don't think so, Your Honor.


           22

            2              

MR. BRANDS:  Well, it's not bad evidence.  It's


            3    

simply that before the MSPB, the -- the Government agency


            4    

has to prove his case by a preponderance.  Now, at the


            5    

time that it charges, presumably the agency thinks that


            6    

those priors are good even though they're being grieved,


            7    

otherwise it wouldn't have imposed them in the first


            8    

place.  But that doesn't mean that it doesn't have the


            9    

burden of proving by a preponderance when it comes in the


           10    

MSPB.

QUESTION:  Mr. Brands?


           12              

QUESTION:  Throughout the -- the proceedings


           13    

before the Merit Systems Protection Board, in the initial


           14    

decision of the administrator, the petitioner is referred


           15    

to -- the respondent is referred to as the appellant.  I


           16    

mean, certainly the Merit Systems Protection Board thought


           17    

it was an appeal.


           18              

MR. BRANDS:  Well, Your Honor, it -- that is


           19    

true.  It is termed an appellant, but again, what -- what


           20    

Jackson v. Veterans Administration, a Federal circuit case


           21    

from 1985, says about that is that the employee, while


           22    

denominated the appellant, has the advantageous


           23    

evidentiary position of a defendant.  So, it is much


           24    

like --


           25              

QUESTION:  Where did the Federal circuit get

that from? 


            2              

(Laughter.) 


            3              

MR. BRANDS:  That is simply because before the


            4    

Federal -- before the MSPB, the burden is on the


            5    

Government agency to prove its charges and review is de


            6    

novo.  The burden of proof is on the Government. 


            7              

QUESTION:  Where is -- where is section 7701(b)


            8    

in the material before us in the briefs? 


            9              

MR. BRANDS:  It's in the appendix to the


           10    

petition, page 51, and we refer to it in our -- our claim


           11    

rested on the -- on this burden of proving --


           12              

QUESTION:  Well, in your opinion, a woman who


           13    

works for an agency is late for the 20th time.  19 priors


           14    

are under grievance.  Her boss, fed up, says, you're


           15    

fired.  All right?  Now, what's supposed to happen? 


           16              

MR. BRANDS:  The Government can fire her. 


           17    

There's no question about that.  However, if those priors


           18    

are all being grieved in those grievance proceedings, the


           19    

Government will have to prove its case. 


           20              

QUESTION:  All right.  Now, that -- that -- of


           21    

course, then the -- as I read the Federal circuit, it says


           22    

just what you say.  We hold that as a matter of a law,


           23    

consideration may not be given to prior disciplinary


           24    

actions that are the subject of ongoing proceedings


           25    

challenging their merits.  So, what you're saying is they

can't use those.


            2              

MR. BRANDS:  The Government --


            3              

QUESTION:  The Government cannot use them.


            4              

MR. BRANDS:  No, I'm not saying that.  The


            5    

Government agency is entitled to rely on them.  The


            6    

Government agency is allowed to say, you were late today. 


            7    

By itself, that would not be enough to fire you.  However,


            8    

you did it 19 times before, and because you did it 19


            9    

times before, we're firing you today.  We know that your


           10    

19 priors are still being grieved, but we think that all


           11    

of those 19 are good. 


           12              

QUESTION:  Right. 


           13              

MR. BRANDS:  Now, however, when that removal


           14    

comes to the MSPB, in the ordinary case, those 19 priors


           15    

will have become final.  Either they will have been


           16    

sustained or they will have been overturned by an


           17    

arbitrator or by the MSPB. 


           18              

In the very unusual situation, the white


           19    

elephant that we have here, the case where somehow the


           20    

MSPB proceeding goes faster than the prior grievances, in


           21    

that very unusual situation, we have a problem.  What we


           22    

have there is that the Government would have to prove its


           23    

case by a -- by a preponderance, but those priors are


           24    

still -- have not become final yet. 


           25              

QUESTION:  All right.  So, the -- the opposite

            1    

side is that would be a reasonable approach.  The agency


            2    

says, we have another reasonable approach.  Our reasonable


            3    

approach is that we -- we just let them take account of


            4    

the fact that they've already been -- you know, they're


            5    

already finished, the 19, but the individual can ask us to


            6    

see if they're supported or clearly erroneous. 


            7              

MR. BRANDS:  What we think is --


            8              

QUESTION:  That's Bolling.  So -- so, that's


            9    

their approach.  So, why is yours more reasonable?  Theirs


           10    

-- they see yours as reasonable.  They say we have a


           11    

different one. 


           12              

MR. BRANDS:  It's not a question of


           13    

reasonableness, Your Honor.  We think it's a question of


           14    

what the statute says. 


           15              

QUESTION:  Well, yes, but that -- that statute


           16    

seems to be talking about cross referencing B.  It seems


           17    

to be talking about this proceeding.  There has to be a


           18    

preponderance of evidence in this proceeding.  And so, the


           19    

issue is not resolved by the statute.  It's up for grabs. 


           20    

I mean --


           21              

MR. BRANDS:  Your Honor --


           22              

QUESTION:  -- the question is, is this piece of


           23    

paper, which says you were convicted 19 times before --


           24    

there are 19 pieces of paper, okay -- whether that counts


           25    

as evidence towards the preponderance to support what they

did now.  And you could make the argument either way.


            2              

MR. BRANDS:  Respectfully, Your Honor, that is


            3    

not how the MSPB itself has interpreted section


            4    

7701(c)(1)(B).  It reads that the burden of proof as


            5    

applying not only to the particular charge before the


            6    

board, here case number 4.  It reads it also as applying


            7    

to any aggravating circumstance, and in our view, it


            8    

couldn't really be any other way. 


            9              

QUESTION:  Well, now, Mr. Brands, we're


           10    

reviewing the Federal circuit's decision here, not the


           11    

MSPB's decision.  Now, did the Federal circuit incorporate


           12    

that, the view you're expressing --


           13              

MR. BRANDS:  Yes. 


           14              

QUESTION:  -- now, into its opinion? 


           15              

MR. BRANDS:  Yes, it did, Your Honor. 


           16              

QUESTION:  Whereabouts?


           17              

MR. BRANDS:  And this is what I was referring to


           18    

when I was referring to that phrase on page 7 of the


           19    

appendix to the petition.  It said, the Douglas analysis


           20    

would otherwise be compromised.  And here's what it meant


           21    

by that. 


           22              

QUESTION:  Well, how can you tell --


           23              

MR. BRANDS:  The Douglas --


           24              

QUESTION:  How can you tell that one cryptic


           25    

phrase -- how can you tell that's what it meant by that?

            1              

MR. BRANDS:  Well, it actually said it twice,


            2    

Your Honor.  But the reason why we believe that's what it


            3    

said is the Douglas analysis means that the MSPB in any


            4    

given case must ensure that there is a fit between the


            5    

punishment and the crime.  And the way it does that is it


            6    

looks at the gravity of the particular offense, but it


            7    

also looks at other aggravating circumstances.  That


            8    

analysis would be undermined, would be nullified if the


            9    

Government could simply come in and say, we got this one


           10    

little charge, and then we have these 19 others.  Now,


           11    

these 19 others have never been proven, but you have to


           12    

take them as a given and you can only review them for


           13    

clear error even though --


           14              

QUESTION:  They have been proven.  I mean,


           15    

that's the fallacy in that.  There was a proceeding before


           16    

the board in which the board adjudicator found that they


           17    

had been proven. 


           18              

MR. BRANDS:  That's actually not correct, Your


           19    

Honor.  What -- what happens in a disciplinary action is


           20    

that the Government -- a supervisor will simply charge the


           21    

misconduct, and then from there, it goes through these


           22    

grievance steps that are simply nothing other than another


           23    

supervisor saying, yes, it looks right to us.  And


           24    

finally, it will go to an arbitrator, and that is the


           25    

first place where the Government is actually put to its

burden of proving its charges by a preponderance.


            2              

QUESTION:  Is that right?  I mean --


            3              

MR. BRANDS:  Oh, absolutely.  These priors have


            4    

never gone --


            5              

QUESTION:  The agency adjudicator can say, well,


            6    

it wasn't proven, but you know, I think we ought to put


            7    

this on your record anyway.


            8              

MR. BRANDS:  Well, the agency adjudicator --


            9              

QUESTION:  Surely the agency has to find, by a


           10    

preponderance of the evidence, that the employee was


           11    

guilty of the alleged infraction. 


           12              

MR. BRANDS:  But the question is whether --


           13    

whether there's any reason for the MSPB to defer to that,


           14    

and we submit no.  And here's why.  If that action itself


           15    

were appealed to the MSPB, that action itself would not be


           16    

entitled to any deference.  It's sort of like a prosecutor


           17    

-- prosecutor coming before a trial court.  Nobody would


           18    

argue that somehow the jury, or -- or in a bench trial,


           19    

the trial court, is supposed to defer to the prosecutor. 


           20    

And we think that just -- just that those charges have


           21    

been leveled in the past rather than now before the agency


           22    

-- before the MSPB doesn't mean that any more deference --


           23              

QUESTION:  But what we're talking --


           24

QUESTION:  -- sentencing. 


            3              

QUESTION:  -- then you should say that even when


            4    

there is no grievance, the board should not take account


            5    

of the prior -- of the prior disciplinary conviction.  If


            6    

you really believe that --


            7              

MR. BRANDS:  Well, respectfully --


            8              

QUESTION:  -- you would say even if it's not


            9    

being grieved.


           10              

MR. BRANDS:  Justice Scalia, I -- I wouldn't --


           11    

I wouldn't put it right that way or precisely that way.  I


           12    

would think that the burden of proving that the prior


           13    

conduct, the misconduct, happened is still upon the


           14    

agency.  However, it is very easy to prove it because


           15    

ordinarily what the Government will simply be able to do


           16    

is say, look, we have here a piece of paper that said she


           17    

did it and she never went to the MSPB or to an arbitrator. 


           18    

So, therefore, she probably did it.  If in that


           19    

situation --

QUESTION:  Mr. Brands, before you finish, I'd

like you to answer the Government's assertion that your


           22    

neat solution, which is, agency, you can fire this person,


           23    

but MSPB must abide the grievance.  And then if the


           24    

grievances are successful from the employee's point of


           25    

view, there would be reinstatement, back pay, I take it,

            2              

Mr. Garre told us that the Government is stuck


            3    

because it can't fill that slot in the meantime because


            4    

the employee may come back.  How do you answer that? 


            5              

MR. BRANDS:  Well, it's an argument that's


            6    

raised for the first time today here at the lectern.  But


            7    

I -- I don't think that that is -- that -- that doesn't

justify saying, well, in that case, we're going to say to

the Government, you don't have -- you don't have to meet


           10    

your burden of proof.  The burden, of course, is --


           11              

QUESTION:  But it does -- it does weaken your


           12    

argument that the Government serves its purpose.  It can


           13    

fire this person.  It can replace the person.  And then at


           14    

the end of the day, if the grievances are overturned, that


           15    

person simply gets reinstated.


           16              

MR. BRANDS:  Well, I don't think it quite


           17    

weakens our argument, Your Honor, because we're talking


           18    

about letter carriers in this particular case, for


           19    

example.  It's not as though the particular route that was


           20    

previously served by Maria Gregory is not -- is not


           21    

getting mail at this moment.  What happens, of course, is


           22    

that other letter carriers are -- are put to work on that


           23    

route, and things march along just fine, which I assume is


           24    

why the --

there are 126,000 pending grievances in the postal system?


            2              

MR. BRANDS:  The short answer is no, if the


            3    

allegation is that those are disciplinary grievances. 


            4    

There are 126,000 cases pending, but the vast majority of


            5    

those are contract grievances and not disciplinary


            6    

grievances.  Disciplinary grievances march through the


            7    

process in about a year or less, as in fact happened in --


            8    

in the two cases to which the -- the Government points in


            9    

-- in that footnote 3 in its reply brief.

Mr. Garre, you have 2 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE


           13                    

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


           14              

MR. GARRE:  The Federal circuit ruling in this


           15    

case is not based in any way on the burden of proof


           16    

applied in board proceedings.  And respondent didn't even


           17    

argue before the board that the -- that the board was


           18    

applying the wrong burden of proof in challenging or


           19    

considering her prior actions. 


           20              

Respondent's reliance on the Douglas case is a


           21    

little bit odd because that case was followed by the


           22    

Bolling case and scores of other precedents which


           23    

established the framework by which the Merit Systems


           24    

Protection Board considers prior disciplinary actions,


           25    

even when they're subject to grievance.  The board allows

            1    

-- it requires the employer to prove the fact of the prior


            2    

action, and then it -- it allows the employee -- in


            3    

addition to the fact of the prior action, that certain


            4    

procedural protections were present.  And then it allows


            5    

the employee an opportunity to collaterally attack that


            6    

action. 


            7              

That -- that comports with the employer's burden


            8    

of proof under the statute.  It's supported by decades of


            9    

administrative practice, and the Federal circuit had


           10    

absolutely no basis for invalidating that practice without


           11    

citing to any provision of -- of law or anything else.


           12              

Now, to follow up on a question by Justice


           13    

Kennedy, I want to make clear that we would not object to


           14    

the continuance of the grievance.  The employers would not


           15    

object if this Court reverses the decision below.


           16              

If there are no further questions. 


           17              

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Garre.


           18              

The case is submitted. 


           19              

(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the


           20    

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
