 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TERENCE J. CASSIDY


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


 MR. CASSIDY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


10  please the Court:


11

 The daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance


12  to the flag by millions of school children across our


13  country does not violate the Establishment Clause. 


14  Petitioners submit that the decision of the Ninth Circuit


15  Court of Appeals was incorrect for two reasons.  First,


16  respondent lacks standing to assert the claims in this


17  case, and second, the school district policy of willing


18  students reciting the pledge with the words, one nation


19  under God, is a patriotic exercise that is part of an


20  unbroken history of official government acknowledgment of


21  the role of religion in American life.


22

 The issue of standing in this case is one of


23  first impression for this Court.  Respondent seeks to


24  invoke the aid of a Federal court to override the state


25  family law court in an ongoing custody dispute.  We look


3


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  to the state law to define the rights of parents involved


2  in custody disputes.  The state court custody order in


3  effect both at the time this matter was pending before the


4  Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, as well as before this


5  Court -­


6

8

 QUESTION: Counsel -­


 MR. CASSIDY: -- has limited -­


 QUESTION: Counsel, on the standing issue,


9  normally, I guess, we defer to the courts of appeals in


10  deciding issues of state law.  Now, I guess the California


11  Supreme Court hasn't really weighed in on this question


12  and the Ninth Circuit seems to have relied on some court


13  of appeals decisions in making its decision about


14  standing.


15

 Now, normally we would just defer to that,


16  wouldn't we, and move on to the merits?  Is there some


17  reason why we shouldn't do that here?


18

 MR. CASSIDY: Well, it is our position, Your


19  Honor, that the Ninth Circuit made an incorrect analysis


20  in -­


21

 QUESTION: Well, maybe they did, but is it not


22  the case that we normally defer to courts of appeals on


23  questions of state law on issues of standing?


24

 MR. CASSIDY: I would say the Court does defer at


25  times.  However, the Court has the right, and in this case


4


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  the obligation, to reassess the rights when those are


2  incorrectly decided by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 


3  In this -­


4

 QUESTION: Is this just a question of Article III


5  standing or would it be open to us under our precedents to


6  say that we think there's Article III standing, but this


7  really involves rights of third parties, and as a


8  prudential matter, we do not think it's appropriate to


9  exercise jurisdiction -­


10

11

 MR. CASSIDY: I think, Justice -­


 QUESTION: Because, as I understand certainly the


12  Government's brief, and I think yours, you don't argue


13  prudential standing, it's just a question, an Article III


14  question.  Would you -­


15

 MR. CASSIDY: Well, I would say both, Your Honor,


16  that the respondent is not a stakeholder within the


17  meaning of Article III. However, we would likewise submit


18  that I think that prudential argument was vis-a-vis the


19  Rooker-Feldman doctrine.  We have requested that this


20  Court not interfere with the state court ongoing custody


21  dispute on that basis, because essentially this is one of


22  a collateral attack of a state court proceeding.


23

 QUESTION: Well, I -- I saw the Rooker-Feldman


24  cite.  I just wonder if you have any other authority for


25  the fact that there's a prudential standing problem here


5


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  and then you cite us a case other than Rooker v. Feldman,


2  would be Craig and Boren or Rescue Army or something?


3

 MR. CASSIDY: I don't know that it -- this case


4  fits precisely in either the Rooker-Feldman or other


5  prudential cases, but we do have a case that certainly


6  merits that type of consideration.  We believe this Court


7  should defer and not interfere with what amounts to the


8  mother's rights and interests in the upbringing,


9  educational upbringing of the daughter.  Second -­


10

 QUESTION: Well, then that gets us to Article


11  III, the father says that it's not a level playing field,


12  that he has a right under state law and he might even have


13  a constitutional right to have some access to the -- to


14  the child and to try to affect the child's development,


15  and that the state is tilting the balance,


16  unconstitutionally he could say.


17

 MR. CASSIDY: Well, we would certainly disagree


18  with that position, Your Honor. 


19

 QUESTION: Well, but I mean, that's -- it's just


20  a question of standing.  Does -- does -- he has no


21  standing to make that claim?


22

 MR. CASSIDY: Well, I think it's -- the best way


23  to approach this is whether respondent has a legally


24  protected interest, which he does not.  He does not have a


25  legally protected right.  Therefore, he is not a


6


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  stakeholder within the meaning of Article III, and -- and


2  I would suggest -­


3

 QUESTION: Well, he's -- he's -- may I ask you on


4  the question of legally protected right to zero in on


5  this.  Put Rooker-Feldman aside for a moment, put next


6  friend standing aside for a moment.  As I understand it,


7  and you correct me if I'm wrong, as I understand it, he's


8  saying, look, simply as the father of this child, I have


9  an interest which is in fact being infringed here.  Even


10  though under state law the mother of the child has the


11  right to cast the final decision on matters of morals,


12  education, religion, I nonetheless have an interest as a


13  father, and that interest is in seeing that my child is


14  not subjected to what I believe is an unconstitutional


15  religious interest or religious influence.


16

 What is your answer to his claim that that is


17  enough to give him personal standing?


18

 MR. CASSIDY: I have to answer that question,


19  Justice Souter, based upon how the school district


20  perceives respondent's rights, and in this case, the


21  school district must look to only a single decision-maker. 


22  It's the only way a school district can function.  It's


23  the same way this Court should approach, we would suggest,


24  the standing issue.


25

 QUESTION: Well, the mother isn't a decision­


7


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  maker for the school district, neither is the father a


2  decision-maker.  If there's going to be a decision-maker,


3  it's ultimately going to be a judicial decision-maker on


4  the constitutional question.  He is simply saying, I have


5  a right to raise that question by virtue of my interest as


6  a father, even though at the present time under state law


7  I cannot control her presence or absence at the school.


8

 MR. CASSIDY: We would submit, Justice Souter,


9  that the question is truly what is in the best interest of


10  the child.  That's ultimately the determination made when


11  we look to parents' rights in custody disputes under state


12  law.


13

 QUESTION: But aren't -- aren't you basically


14  answering the question as if I were asking you a next


15  friend standing question?  Who should stand for the child


16  in court as next friend is between these two parents.  I'm


17  asking the question simply about his interest, not as next


18  friend but as father, admittedly with limited rights.


19

 MR. CASSIDY: With limited rights, his rights


20  become on a more abstract level.  They are certainly not


21  of the degree that provide a legally protectable interest


22  in asserting those rights.  His right to redress -­


23

 QUESTION:  California says otherwise.  It says


24  he has the right to have an equal shot at trying to


25  influence and raise this child and that this is his right.


8


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 MR. CASSIDY: The reason, Justice Kennedy, that


2  we look to the state law to define those rights is that


3  because when there are custody disputes, the court directs


4  which parent gets the ultimate decision-making


5  responsibility and authority.  In this case -­


6

 QUESTION: Yes, but the judge didn't tell him to


7  -- to discontinue the litigation, did he?  The judge has


8  tolerated the prosecution of the case?


9

 MR. CASSIDY: We would submit, Justice Stevens,


10  that the state judge cannot determine an Article III


11  standing.  The judge -­


12

 QUESTION: Well, he could certainly tell the


13  father, this is not in the best interest of the child,


14  discontinue the litigation.  He would have authority to do


15  that, at least to say, you can't bring this suit


16  purporting to represent the best interests of the child.


17

 MR. CASSIDY: But when the respondent bypasses


18  the state court, the respond -- the record reflects that


19  respondent and the mother met with the principal and the


20  kindergarten teacher of the daughter and respondent wanted


21  to -­


22

 QUESTION: But that doesn't go to the question of


23  whether he can maintain the litigation. 


24

25

 MR. CASSIDY: But -­


 QUESTION:  That's a standing issue as to whether


9


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  he can bring this lawsuit.


2

 MR. CASSIDY: But certainly if he bypasses the


3  state court and never has a determination made as to


4  whether this is in the best interest of the daughter,


5  you're correct.  You would not have that decision.


6

 QUESTION: But she never asked for a relief along


7  that line.  She -- as I understand it, the mother never


8  asked to tell him to discontinue the lawsuit.


9

 MR. CASSIDY: Well, she certainly sought


10  dismissal in a -- in a manner of speaking from the Ninth


11  Circuit Court of Appeals, and/or to intervene to -- to


12  demonstrate to the -­


13

14

 QUESTION: And I think -­


 MR. CASSIDY: -- Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals


15  as to what was in the best interest of her daughter.


16

 QUESTION: Yeah, but the judge said the daughter


17  could go hear him argue the case as I understand it.


18

 MR. CASSIDY: But likewise in this Court the


19  judge said she could not.  So we have a situation where we


20  have to defer in a custody dispute like this to the state


21  court's judgment as to what's ultimately in the best


22  interest of the child.  When -- when we go back and look


23  at the rights as defined, the ultimate decision-making


24  authority is with the mother in this case, and the reason


25  that the courts adopt that is consistent with the


10

 California education code for school districts, because


 under the California education code, the school districts


 have to have only one decision-maker.  Otherwise, they


 couldn't function properly when there are disagreements


 with parents that are involved in custody disputes.


 In referencing that code section, California


 education code section 51100 sub D, in relation to the


 rights of parents to participate in the education of their


 children, the California education code specifically


 provides, this section does not authorize a school to


 permit participation by a parent in the education of a


 child if it conflicts with a valid order for custody


 issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.


 With that, I would like to reserve the remainder


 of my time, Mr. Chief Justice.


 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Cassidy.


 General Olson, we'll hear from you.

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


 MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


 the Court:


 Respondent has no right to bring this case in


 his daughter's name and no independent, legally protected


 right to challenge in Federal court the conditions of his

 daughter's education.  A California domestic relations


 court with specialized expertise and continuing


 jurisdiction has determined that the best interests of the


 child require that decisions with respect to the


 conditions of the child's education are matters that


 should be made -- those decisions should be made by the


 child's mother.


 QUESTION: Well, he says, I have my own rights. 


 He says -- I'll -- I'll characterize his argument.  He's


 saying, you may be right about that, I have my own rights. 


 I have a right as a father to -- to try to influence this


 child -­


 MR. OLSON: Well, it's -­


 QUESTION:  -- in -- consistent with her going to


 school and with her mother and that's -- and the state set


 up an unfair playing field.


 MR. OLSON: Well, we submit, Justice Kennedy,


 that a fair reading of what -- what the domestic relations


 court, which considered the best interests of the child,


 focused in on the legally protected rights of the -- with


 respect to this child's education.  He's claiming a right,


 a legally protected right to challenge the conditions in


 the public school with respect to how the child shall be


 educated. 


 This record is relatively clear, not only with

 respect to affidavits from the child's mother, but also


 with respect to the decisions, the transcript of the


 September 11, 2003, decision of this domestic relations


 court, and the order that the court issued on January 9 of


 this year with respect to what was damaging to the


 interests of the child.  In fact, when the respondent


 brought this case when he had joint custody without


 consulting with the mother, the trial court found here


 that it was unconscionable to bring this case, especially


 when he knew that it might adversely affect the interests


 of the child.


 We submit that, under this Court's rulings with


 respect to, even in connection with the right of the


 father under Stanley v. Illinois, that may be trumped when


 there is a powerful interest of the child, a powerful


 countervailing interest under Stanley v. Illinois and -­


 QUESTION: One -- one more question on standing. 


 Am I correct that you don't argue this is a prudential


 standing case and you don't -­


 MR. OLSON: We -- we do also, Justice Kennedy.


 QUESTION: What's your best authority?


 MR. OLSON: Well, I -- first of all, there's two. 


 It's Rooker-Feldman in the sense that what -- recognizing


 standing here will have the effect of disturbing and


 upsetting the effect of the trial court, of the domestic

 relations court's decision with respect to the best


 interests of the child.


 Secondly, with respect to the Ankenbrandt case


 where the Court has decided that the Federal courts don't


 have jurisdiction with respect to domestic, the so-called


 domestic relations exception, and that was specifically


 referred to include divorce, alimony, and custody.  So


 there are those -- those factors all come together with -­


 with respect to describing the legally protected interest


 of the -- of the defendant -- of the respondent in this


 case with respect to the matters involving the child.


 QUESTION: Is this your argument, Mr. Olson?  In


 -- in determining whether we should recognize his next


 friend standing, we should take into consideration the


 state custody arrangements and the state judgments about


 what is in the best interests of the child.  When we go to


 the second question, should we recognize his individual


 standing, if we do recognize his individual standing, but


 we don't recognize his standing as next friend, we will


 undercut the interests which are being protected by


 refusing to recognize his standing as next friend.  We've


 got to go, in effect, we've got to come to the same


 conclusion in each case or we will undercut our conclusion


 on -- on next friend standing if it's adverse.


 MR. OLSON: That's -- that's absolutely correct,

 Justice Souter, and I think that's consistent with the so­


 called domestic relations exception, the -- and the -- and


 the court in that case recognized the special expertise of


 family courts with continuing jurisdiction with respect to


 sensitive matters.  With respect to that, this Court would


 collide with those concerns.


 If I might turn to -­


 QUESTION: But the -- the merits here certainly


 have nothing to do with domestic relations.


 MR. OLSON: The -- well, and they do in the sense


 that they -- the -- the matters that are before this Court


 with respect to the Pledge of Allegiance in the public


 school has to do with the child's education and impacts


 with respect -- and there is in the record, Mr. Chief


 Justice, affidavits from the mother expressing her concern


 about the effect on the child of being thrust into the


 vortex of this constitutional case. 


 One decision-maker has to make decisions with


 respect to the best interests of the child and the


 collision of those interests, and that comes into play


 because the child is the one that -- it's interesting that


 the respondent's brief are full of references to the


 interests of the child, the alleged coercive effect of the


 Pledge of Allegiance, the impact on the child's rights and


 so forth, though -- therefore, although the respondent

 talks about this separate independent right of his


 interest when his -- when it comes to his brief, the


 issues that he's articulating throughout the brief don't


 support that standing.  They support the standing of the


 next friend on behalf of the child.


 If I might turn to the merits, this Court has


 repeatedly noted that the Pledge of Allegiance is a


 ceremonial, patriotic exercise that acknowledges, and as


 this Court has repeatedly held -­


 QUESTION: Do you mean repeatedly held or


 repeatedly said?


 MR. OLSON: Repeatedly said and in the -- in the


 -- in the sense of Seminole Tribe, Justice Stevens, this


 is more than dicta.  It is -- it is explanations by the


 Court for the holdings in those -- in those cases by the


 Court.  Indeed, I found, and this -- it's a -- this is a


 calculation that's capable of being made by reference to


 the cases cited in the brief, 14 separate Justices


 articulating that there was a significant difference


 between a purely religious exercise, such as in the prayer


 cases, and the ceremonial reference in solemn public


 occasions of -- with respect to the Pledge of Allegiance.


 Fourteen Justices of this Court since the Pledge


 of Allegiance was amended have indicated that the Pledge


 of Allegiance is not a religious exercise, it is something

 different of a ceremonial nature.


 QUESTION: Without benefit of brief and oral


 argument.


 MR. OLSON: Well, they -- there were references


 to the case in -- of -- of course in the briefs and -- and


 in connection with the case, but the fact is that the


 Court was distinguishing, and the Court repeatedly said


 that, that there is a major distinction between those


 purely religious exercises such as prayers or recitation


 of the Ten Commandments, or in the evolution cases.  The


 respondent cites nine cases that he says support the


 proposition that he's articulating.  He left out a number


 of other cases where the Court has considered the issue of


 religion in public schools, but those very cases,


 including the -- the Lee v. Weisman case involved a Pledge


 of Allegiance at the same time that the prayer was being


 uttered.  Those -- all of those cases refer to the


 difference in significant constitutional respects.


 QUESTION: Do you think the state or the school


 district has the obligation to excuse from the classroom a


 child whose parents disagree with the pledge?


 MR. OLSON: Yes, and it does.  There's no


 question about that.


 QUESTION: There -- there is that -- that -- that


 constitutional right?

 Virginia v. Barnette that persons of conscience being


 concerned about expressing allegiance to -- and that case


 occurred at a time before the pledge was amended.


 QUESTION: Well, that was not a prayer either. 


 That was saluting the flag.


 MR. OLSON: That was the Pledge of Allegiance to


 the flag, but -- but that's the same thing that's


 happening here, Mr. Chief Justice, that the child are


 excused from reciting the -- the Pledge of Allegiance to


 the flag.  What I'm referring to in these other cases, as


 I indicated, 14 individual Justices have expressed a

 QUESTION: They've expressed the view it's just a


 ceremonial matter.  Do you think that the pledge has the

 words, under God, were inserted into the prayer, into the


 pledge?

 language of the Justices of this Court have expressed that

 QUESTION: -- forget the, forget all that dicta


 for just a moment.  Do you think in -- is it the


 Government's position that the words, under God, have the


 same meaning today as when they were first inserted in the


 pledge?


 MR. OLSON: Yes and no, and I would like to


 answer, explain if I may.


 (Laughter.)


 QUESTION: Because it's a terribly important


 question.


 MR. OLSON: It's an important question because


 the reference to under God in the pledge, as numerous


 decisions of this Court have indicated in dicta, what as a


 part of a -- of a thought process of coming about to the


 conclusion that it -- it is an acknowledgment of the


 religious basis of the framers of the Constitution, who


 believed not only that the right to revolt, but that the


 right to vest power in the people to create a government


 became -- came as a result of religious principles.  In


 that sense, the Pledge of Allegiance is today, that has


 that same significance to this country as it did in 1954


 when it was amended.


 But as this Court has also said, and that's the

 other part of my answer to your question, this Court has


 also said the ceremonial rendition of the Pledge of


 Allegiance in context repeatedly over the years has caused


 -- would cause a reasonable observer familiar -- as this


 Court's First Amendment Establishment Clause jurisdiction


 points out -- would cause a reasonable observer to


 understand that that is -- this is not a religious


 invocation.  It is not like a prayer, it is not a


 supplication, it's not an invocation.  It is -­


 QUESTION: Your -- your argument is that there's


 a stronger case now than there would have been 50 years


 ago?


 MR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and that is


 for many reasons, for -- because of the reason that I just


 made, but also because the Congress revisited this issue


 in 2002 after the decision below in this case.  There are


 findings in the record which are a part of the brief, with


 respect to what the -- what the pledge means, the context


 of the pledge in its historical context, in the connection


 with its civic invocation, its ability to invoke certain


 principles that are indisputably true, which gave rise to


 the institutions which have given us freedom over all this


 period of time. 


 It's in -- it is significant that the Court in,


 the Congress, in making those findings, specifically

 referred to the decisions that I was referring to before,


 which have been characterized as dicta, but very important


 dicta, because they explain how the Court came to its


 conclusions. 


 So those are differences.  The other difference


 that should be made is that the challenge here too is not


 directly to the Pledge of Allegiance, but it's to the


 invocation or the -- the articulation of the Pledge of


 Allegiance in the Elk Grove School District. The State of


 California requires those patriotic exercises in that


 school district under the phrase, patriotic


 responsibilities of the schools, or words to that effect,


 and that -- and the school district itself puts this in


 the category of a patriotic exercise.


 And to go back to what this Court has taught us


 with respect to the Establishment Clause and the


 endorsement prong of the Establishment Clause, it's the


 entire context.  It's the nation's history, it's a Pledge


 of Allegiance to the flag and to the nation for which it


 stands, and then a descriptive phrase, under God,


 indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  So -­


 QUESTION: Well, why not have it like oath or


 affirmation?  That is, give people a choice, don't say


 it's got to be all one way or all the other, but say


 children who want to say under God can say it and children

 who don't, don't have to say it.


 MR. OLSON: Well, they don't.  They don't have to


 say it.  They don't -­


 QUESTION: But they can be -- take part in the


 pledge. 


 MR. OLSON: They can take part in the pledge -­


 QUESTION: In their own way.


 MR. OLSON: -- without saying any words.  They


 can decide not to participate in the pledge at all, and I


 think that's covered by the West Virginia v. Barnette


 decision of this Court.  The -- the -- and I want to make


 this point before my time elapses, is that the respondent


 makes a point of saying, this is the same as requiring the


 pledge to say one nation under Jesus.  That is completely


 different.  It's not supported by the history where the


 framers of our Constitution repeatedly referred to God,


 Lord, the creator, and there's a very interesting piece of


 history with respect to that.


 When the Virginia bill of establishing religious


 freedom was articulated, they -- they used the phrase, the


 holy author.  Thomas Jefferson in his autobiography, which


 was published in 1811, said there was a motion to amend to


 refer to the holy author, Jesus Christ, and he said in his


 autobiography that that was rejected because the framers


 of the Virginia Bill of Rights, or act establishing

 religious freedom, which is a precursor to the


 Establishment Clause, was intended not to include any


 particular sect, but to -- to apply to Jews, Hindus,


 Mohammedens, and it even says the word infidels in Thomas


 Jefferson's explanation for the background of that act.


 In -- in summary, the state -- the Pledge of


 Allegiance is not what this Court has said the


 Establishment Clause protects against, that is to say,


 state-sponsored prayers, religious rituals or ceremonies,


 or the imposition or the requirement of teaching or not


 teaching a religious doctrine. 


 The Establishment Clause does not prohibit civic and


 ceremonial acknowledgments of the indisputable historical


 fact of the religious heritage that caused the framers of


 our Constitution and the signers of the Declaration of


 Independence to say that they had the right to revolt and


 start a new country, because although the king was


 infallible, they believe that God gave them the right to


 declare their independence when the king has not been


 living up to the unalienable principles given to them by


 God.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


 MR. NEWDOW: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


 the Court:


 Every school morning in the Elk Grove Unified


 School District's public schools, government agents,


 teachers, funded with tax dollars, have their students


 stand up, including my daughter, face the flag of the


 United States of America, place their hands over their


 hearts, and affirm that ours is a nation under some


 particular religious entity, the appreciation of which is


 not accepted by numerous people, such as myself.  We


 cannot in good conscience accept the idea that there


 exists a deity.


 I am an atheist.  I don't believe in God.  And


 every school morning my child is asked to stand up, face


 that flag, put her hand over her heart, and say that her


 father is wrong. 


 QUESTION: Well now, let's -- let's talk first


 about standing.  You only give it two pages in your brief. 


 It -- it seems to me important to recognize that these


 aren't just technical rules that we lawyers are interested


 in, but that there's a common sense component to it.  And


 you are asking the Court to exercise the extraordinary,

 the breathtaking power to declare Federal law


 unconstitutional, and the common sense of the matter, it


 seems to me, is that your daughter is -- is the one that


 bears the blame for this.  She's going to face the public


 outcry, the public outrage, and we take the case, I think,


 on the assumption that even at her tender years she


 probably doesn't agree with that and that her mother


 certainly doesn't.


 And it seems to me that your insisting on


 standing here contradicts that common sense core of the


 standing rule, which is -- and I'm just talking about her


 standing, I'm not talking about yours -- that the common


 sense core of the standing rule is, when a citizen wants


 the courts to exercise this awful power, that they take


 the consequences, and you're putting that on her.  That's


 the common sense of the matter to me, Mr. Newdow.


 MR. NEWDOW: I would answer that in two ways. 


 First of all, Palmore v. Sidoti says that we shouldn't


 look at the harms that occur to people as a result of


 prejudices of our society.  If, in fact, the Constitution


 is being violated, if in -- and there are consequences


 from people trying to uphold the Constitution, that just


 happens to happen.  I'm not convinced that there are going


 -- going to be adverse consequences to my daughter.  My


 daughter's going to be able to walk around and say that my

 father helped uphold the Constitution of the United


 States.


 QUESTION: Maybe so, maybe no, but the rule of


 standing is that the person who brings the suit has to


 affirm that they have that stake now when the suit is


 brought, and she doesn't.


 MR. NEWDOW: Correct, but I'm not bringing this


 in her behalf, that was taken out.  I'm bringing this in


 my behalf, and my child -­


 QUESTION: That's -- that's a different point


 altogether, but if she has no standing, then it seems to


 me the next question is whether or not the rights that you


 assert, and I understand what they are, do seem to


 undercut her position.


 MR. NEWDOW: They may well do that, but she's a


 separate entity.  I have a right of standing, and the


 question that this Court has is merely, do I have that


 right.  And my daughter is told every morning -­


 QUESTION: Yet -- but see, then -- then you're


 getting back to your daughter.  It seems to me this case


 has to be about your rights, and you began this argument


 by talking about your daughter and you're talking about


 her now.  I think she has, at least we'll say, I have


 serious concerns about her standing, and so it seems to me


 that her position is irrelevant.

 MR. NEWDOW: And I agree with that, Your Honor. 


 I am saying I as her father have a right to know that when


 she goes into the public schools she's not going to be


 told every morning to be asked to stand up, put her hand


 over her heart, and say your father is wrong, which is


 what she's told every morning.  That is an actual,


 concrete, discrete, particularized, individualized harm to


 me, which gives me standing, and not only gives me


 standing, demonstrates to this Court how the -­


 QUESTION: Well, she does have a right not to


 participate.


 MR. NEWDOW: She has a -- yes, except under Lee


 v. Weisman she's clearly coerced to participate.  If there


 was coercion in Lee v. Weisman -­


 QUESTION: That was a prayer.


 MR. NEWDOW: Well, I'm not sure this isn't a


 prayer, and I'm -- I am sure that the Establishment Clause


 does not require prayer.  President Bush, and this is in


 the Americans United brief, stated himself that when we


 ask our citizens to pledge allegiance to one nation under


 God, they are asked to participate in an important


 American tradition of humbly seeking the wisdom and


 blessing -­


 QUESTION: Yeah, but I suppose reasonable people


 could look at the pledge as not constituting a prayer.

 MR. NEWDOW: Well, President Bush said it does

 QUESTION: Well, but he -- we certainly don't


 take him as the final authority on this.


 (Laughter.)


 QUESTION: What -- what you say is, I pledge


 allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and


 to the republic for which it stands.  So that certainly


 doesn't sound like anything like a prayer. 


 MR. NEWDOW: Not at all.


 QUESTION: Then why isn't General Olson's


 categorization of the remainder as descriptive, one nation


 under God, with liberty and justice for all?  You can


 disagree it's under God, you can disagree that it's -- has


 a liberty and justice for all, but that doesn't make it a


 prayer.


 MR. NEWDOW: First of all, I don't think that we


 want our -- that the purpose of the Pledge of Allegiance


 is to disagree that it's liberty and justice for all.  I


 think the whole purpose of the pledge is to say that, and


 this Court has stated it's an affirmation of belief, an


 attitude of mind when we pledge, and I think you have to


 take all the words.  It says under God.  That's as purely


 religious as you can get and I think it would be an


 amazing child to suddenly come up with this knowledge of

 the history of our society and -- and what our nation was

 QUESTION: What -- what -- Mr. Newdow -- what if,


 instead of the Pledge of Allegiance, the school required


 the children to begin their -- their session by singing


 God Bless America?  Would that make your case weaker or


 stronger?


 well, if it -­


 MR. NEWDOW: I don't think so.  If it was -­


 QUESTION: Well, you don't think weaker or you


 don't think stronger?


 MR. NEWDOW: I -- I think that if -- if they


 stood up the child and they said, stand up, face the flag,


 put your hand on your heart and you say God bless America,


 I think that would clearly violate the line as well, just


 as in God we trust. 


 QUESTION: Well, what I -- my -- my hypothesis is


 that they ask the children to stand and to sing the -- the


 patriotic song, God Bless America.


 MR. NEWDOW: I think the Court would have to go


 through its -- its normal procedures and say, was this


 done for religious purpose?  Does it have religious


 effects?  Is it  attempting to endorse religion?  We would


 look at the text -­

 prayer than under God, God bless America.


 MR. NEWDOW: I -- I don't -- I don't think so.  I


 mean, we're saying that this -­


 QUESTION: You're -­


 MR. NEWDOW: -- nation is under God.  I mean,


 Congress told us itself when it passed the law.


 QUESTION: And if children who say God bless


 Mommy and God bless Daddy, they think they're saying a


 prayer.


 MR. NEWDOW: They think they're saying God bless,


 yes, and when they say, if Daddy and Mommy were under God,


 they'd be also assuming that there was a God there if they


 said that, and especially if they're stood up in the


 public schools.  If they did that -­


 QUESTION: It's two words sandwiched in the


 middle of something and the child doesn't have to say


 those words. 


 MR. NEWDOW: But the Government is not allowed to


 take a position on that.  Government is saying there's a


 God. Certainly the child doesn't have to affirm that


 belief if there weren't the coercion that we see in -­


 QUESTION: The child doesn't have to if it


 doesn't want to.  That's not an issue in this case.


 MR. NEWDOW: The issue is whether or not


 government can put that idea in her mind and interfere

 with my right.  I have a absolute right to raise my child


 as whatever I see.  Government is weighing in on this


 issue.


 QUESTION: No, you don't, you don't.  You -­


 there is another custodian of this child who makes the


 final decision who doesn't agree with you.


 MR. NEWDOW: Well, first of all, I'm not


 convinced about her making the final decision.  I think it


 was shown when I tried to get my child to attend the Ninth


 Circuit that she certainly does not have the final


 decision-making power.  She has a temporary final


 decision-making power, which is good for about three days


 until we get to court. 


 But more importantly is the issue that


 government is weighing in here.  The mother has no right


 to tell Elk Grove Unified School District how to run their


 morning exercises.  There is nothing in the custody order


 that is affected by what I am asking.  If, in fact, this


 Court grants the relief that I suggest and that we take


 out the words, under God, or at least tell the Elk Grove


 Unified School District they can no longer do that, then


 nothing in the custody order will be affected in any way.


 The mother can still advocate to have God and she can do


 all the things she wants.


 QUESTION: Of course, we have -- we have so many

 asked to stand up, place their hand on their heart and


 affirm this belief.  This Court stated in West Virginia v.

 MR. NEWDOW: And no child was required to be at

 QUESTION: That was a prayer.


 MR. NEWDOW: And -- then we're back to the idea


 of why did Congress -- Congress told us why they stuck


 this in their -- their -- into the pledge.


 QUESTION: Well, let's -- we have to be careful


 about the facts here.  Your -- your daughter is not


 required, and of course, I have a serious problem about


 your daughter's standing, but your daughter is not


 required to put her hand over her heart and face the flag. 


 That's a misstatement.  She is not required to do that.

 coerced.  She is standing there.  She's a 6-, 7-year-old


 kid at the time, and she -­

 the Ten Commandments on the wall was not a prayer yet this


 Court said that violated the Establishment Clause.  To

 teach evolution or not teach evolution doesn't involve


 prayer, but that can violate the Establishment Clause. The


 issue is is it religious, and to say this is not religious


 seems to me to be somewhat bizarre. 


 And as a matter of fact, we can look at the


 standing argument and we can look at Elk Grove Unified


 School District's brief, in which eight times they mention


 that this is the mother involved with religious


 upbringing, they keep talking about religious upbringing,


 18 times they spoke about religious education, religious


 training, religious interest.  All of this has to do with


 religion, and to suggest that this is merely historical or


 patriotic seems to me to be somewhat disingenuous.


 QUESTION: I mean, it's pretty, it's a pretty


 broad use of religion sometimes.  I -- does it make you


 feel any better, and I think the answer's going to be no,


 but there is a case called Seeger, which referred to the


 Constitution -- to the statute that used the word, supreme


 being, and it said that those words, supreme being,


 included a set of beliefs, sincere beliefs, which in any


 ordinary person's life fills the same place as a belief in


 God fills in the life of an orthodox religionist.  So it's


 reaching out to be inclusive, maybe to include you, I


 mean, to -- because many people who are not religious


 nonetheless have a set of beliefs which occupy the same

 place that religious beliefs occupy in the mind and woman


 of a religious -- of a religious mind in men and women. 


 So do you think God is so generic in this


 context that it could be that inclusive?


 MR. NEWDOW: I think -­


 QUESTION: And if it is, then does your objection


 disappear?


 MR. NEWDOW: I don't think so, because if I'm not


 mistaken with regard to Seeger, Seeger -- the Government


 was saying what Seeger thought about religion and what's


 occupied in Seeger's mind.  Here it is the Government and


 there's a crucial difference between government speech


 endorsing religion, which the Establishment Clause


 forbids, and -- and private speech endorsing religion,


 which the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses protect.


 And in that case we're talking about protecting that


 individual's right for him to say in his view that this


 occupies the same thing as God.


 Here we're talking about government, everybody


 on the way here is government.  It's Congress that stuck


 the two words, under God, into the pledge, clearly for a


 religious purpose.  It's the State of California that


 says, go ahead, use the Pledge of Allegiance, which is now


 religious.  It is the city of Elk Grove that says, now


 we're going to demand -­

 QUESTION: But what I'm thinking there is that


 perhaps when you get that broad in your idea of what is


 religious, so it can encompass a set of religious-type


 beliefs in the minds of people who are not traditionally


 religious, when you are that broad and in a civic context,


 it really doesn't violate the Establishment Clause because


 it's meant to include virtually everybody, and the few


 whom it doesn't include don't have to take the pledge.


 MR. NEWDOW: You're referring to the two words,


 under God?


 QUESTION: Yeah, under God is this kind of very


 comprehensive supreme being, Seeger-type thing.


 MR. NEWDOW: I don't think that I can include


 under God to mean no God, which is exactly what I think. 


 I deny the existence of God, and for someone to tell me


 that under God should mean some broad thing that even


 encompasses my religious beliefs sounds a little, you


 know, it seems like the Government is imposing what it


 wants me to think of in terms of religion, which it may


 not do.  Government needs to stay out of this business


 altogether.  And this Court has always referred to -­


 QUESTION: How about what the ending of every


 executive order, in the year of our Lord, so and so?  Now


 that, it seems to me, on your scale would be more


 problematic because it's a specific Lord and not a generic

 God.


 MR. NEWDOW: Well, I would note that this Court


 in its bar certificates when it passes those out has in


 the year of the Lord, and actually it gives an exemption


 for people who find that offensive.  And it would seem to


 me that we ought to be -­


 QUESTION: As -- as -- but it doesn't take away


 in the year of our Lord, which is what you would like to


 do.  There's an option here too.  The child does not have


 to say it at all, can say it except for the words, under


 God, or can say the whole thing.


 MR. NEWDOW: I think that's a huge imposition to


 put on a small child.  Imagine you're the one atheist with


 30 Christians there and you say to this child, let's all


 stand up, face the flag, say we are one nation under God


 and we're going to impose on a small child the -- this


 immense amount of power, prestige, and financial support ­


 ­


 QUESTION: Now, I just -- I just want to point


 out that once again you're arguing based on the child, and


 I -- I think there's a serious standing problem.


 MR. NEWDOW: I think the argument I'm trying to


 make, and I may not be making it well, is that government


 is doing this to my child.  They are telling her, they're


 putting here in a milieu where she says, hey, the

 QUESTION: When -- when you put it the way you


 just did, that we are -- the school district is making her


 an atheist, you're -- you're certainly overstating the


 case, I think.


 atheist.


 MR. NEWDOW: I'm not -­


 QUESTION: There's no indication that she is an


 MR. NEWDOW: I'm not saying either.  I'm -- I'm


 saying that she -- that my right to inculcate my religious


 beliefs includes the right to know that government will


 not in the public schools influence her one way in -- or


 the other.  And government is coming in here every morning


 to start off the morning, say put your hand on your heart,


 pledge to that flag and incorporate in that Pledge of


 Allegiance that there exists this purely religious dogma


 that your father has told you doesn't exist, and


 government may not do that.


 QUESTION: What -- what do you make of -- of this


 argument?  I will assume, and I -- I do assume, that -­


 that if you read the pledge carefully, the -- the


 reference to under God means something more than a mere


 description of how somebody else once thought.  We're


 pledging allegiance to the flag and to the republic.  The

 republic is then described as being under God, and I think


 a fair reading of that would -- would be I think that's


 the way the republic ought to be conceived, as under God. 


 So I think -- I think there's some affirmation there.  I


 will grant you that.


 What do you make of the argument that in actual


 practice the -- the -- the affirmation in the midst of


 this civic exercise as a religious affirmation is -- is so


 tepid, so diluted then so far, let's say, from a


 compulsory prayer that in fact it -- it should be, in


 effect, beneath the constitutional radar.  It's -- it's


 sometimes, you know the phrase, the Rostow phrase, the


 ceremonial deism. 


 What -- what do you make of -- of that argument,


 even -- even assuming that, as I do, that there is some


 affirmation involved when the child says this as a


 technical matter?


 MR. NEWDOW: I think that that whole concept goes


 completely against the ideals underlying the Establishment


 Clause.  We saw in Minersville v. Gobitis and West


 Virginia v. Barnette something that most people don't


 consider to be religious at all to be of essential


 religious value to those Jehovah's Witnesses who objected. 


 And for the Government to come in and say, we've decided


 for you this is inconsequential or unimportant is -- is an

 arrogant pretension, said James Madison.  He said in his


 memorial -­


 QUESTION: Well, I think the argument is not that


 the Government is -- is saying, we are defining this as


 inconsequential for you.  I think the argument is that


 simply the way we live and think and work in schools and


 in civic society in which the pledge is made, that the -­


 that whatever is distinctively religious as an affirmation


 is simply lost.  It -- it's not that the -- that the


 Government is saying, you've got to pretend that it's


 lost.  The argument is that it is lost, that the


 religious, as distinct from a civic content, is close to


 disappearing here.


 MR. NEWDOW: And again, I -- I don't mean to go


 back, but it seems to me that is a view that you may


 choose to take and the majority of Americans may choose to


 take, but it doesn't -- it's not the view I take, and when


 I see the flag and I think of pledging allegiance, I -­


 it's like I'm getting slapped in the face every time, bam,


 you -- you know, this is a nation under God, your


 religious belief system is wrong.


 And here, I want to be able to tell my child


 that I have a very valid religious belief system.  Go to


 church with your mother, go see Buddhists, do anything you


 want, I love that -- the idea that she's being exposed to

 other things, but I want my religious belief system to be


 given the same weight as everybody else's.  And the


 Government comes in here and says, no, Newdow, your


 religious belief system is wrong and the mother's is right


 and anyone else who believes in God is right, and this


 Court -­


 QUESTION: If you had her in this courtroom and


 she stood up when the Justices entered and she heard the


 words, God save the United States and this honorable


 Court, wouldn't the injury that you're complaining about


 be exactly the same, so you would have equal standing on


 your account of things to challenge that as you do to


 challenge what the school district does here?


 MR. NEWDOW: I don't think the injury would be


 even close to the same.  She's not being asked to stand


 up, place her hand on her heart, and say, I affirm this


 belief, and I think that can easily distinguish this case


 from all those other situations.  Here she is being asked


 to stand and say that there exists a God.  Government


 can't ever impose that -­


 QUESTION: If she's -- if she's asked to repeat


 or to sing, as the Chief Justice suggested, God Bless


 America, then she is speaking those words.


 MR. NEWDOW: Again, if it were a situation where


 we said, let's only do nothing else in this classroom, all

 right, we'll say God bless America and let's just say


 those words or something, I think that would violate the


 Constitution as well.  If it's just, let's sing one song a


 day and once a month we get God Bless America, no, that


 would be certainly fine.  We don't want to be hostile to


 religion.


 But here we're not -- it's not a question of


 being hostile to religion.  It's -- it's indoctrinating


 children and Congress said that was the purpose.  This


 Court is supposed to give credence and --


 QUESTION: Do we think of that, God Bless


 America, as religion?  It's not exactly like a hymn that


 you'd sing in church?


 MR. NEWDOW: No, and again, if it were used for


 the purpose to say that there exists a God, then I think


 it would violate the Constitution.  If it's merely a song


 and this is one of many songs, then it would be fine.  But


 here there's nothing else in the Pledge of Allegiance,


 there's no other view here.  There's one view being


 enunciated, that is that there exists a God, and


 government may not take a view.  This Court has all -­


 every Justice here -­


 QUESTION: Well, we're -- I don't know.  I mean,


 that's the point where -- I have no doubt that it offends


 you and I respect the fact that you're -- your right to be

 offended.  I understand that.  But the question is whether


 Congress, whether -- whether the -- whether the Government


 has the power to work that kind of offense.  And on that,


 because you say, well, it doesn't have the right.  Well,


 why doesn't it have the right?  It isn't that divisive if,


 in fact, you have a very broad understanding of God.  It's


 not a prayer, it's in a ceremonial context, and it has a


 long history of being evoked for civic purposes.  Of


 course, some people will be offended, but those people who


 are offended can in fact ask the child, where they have


 custody, to be excused or not to say the words, under God.


 So it's not perfect, it's not perfect, but it serves


 a purpose of unification at the price of offending a small


 number of people like you.  So tell me from ground one why


 -- why the country cannot do that?


 MR. NEWDOW: Well, first of all, for 62 years


 this pledge did serve the purpose of unification and it


 did do it perfectly.  It didn't include some religious


 dogma that separated out some -- and I don't think there's


 anything in the Constitution that says what percentage of


 people get separated out.  Additionally, again, we can use


 that example that I raised before with one nation under


 Jesus.  That would also separate out just a few people


 relatively in our country.  There's not that many more. 


 It's about 86 percent to 93 percent, somewhere in that

 vicinity, so we're separating out another amount of


 people, but again, the principle is the same.  We are


 separating out people.  We don't need to. 


 Again, the Pledge of Allegiance did absolutely


 fine and with -- got us through two world wars, got us


 through the Depression, got us through everything without


 God, and Congress stuck God in there for that particular


 reason, and the idea that it's not divisive I think is


 somewhat, you know, shown to be questionable at least by


 what happened in the result of the Ninth Circuit's


 opinion.  The country went berserk because people were so


 upset that God was going to be taken out of the Pledge of


 Allegiance.


 QUESTION: Do we know -- do we know what the vote


 was in Congress apropos of divisiveness to adopt the under


 God phrase?


 MR. NEWDOW: In 1954?


 QUESTION: Yes.


 MR. NEWDOW: It was apparently unanimous.  There


 was no objection.  There's no count of the vote.


 QUESTION: Well, that doesn't sound divisive.


 (Laughter.)


 MR. NEWDOW: It doesn't sound divisive if -­


 that's only because no atheist can get elected to public


 office.  The studies show that 48 percent of the

 population cannot get elected.


 (Applause.)


 QUESTION: The courtroom will be cleared if


 there's any more clapping.  Proceed, Mr. Newdow.


 MR. NEWDOW: The -- there are right now in eight


 states in their constitutions provisions that say things


 like South Carolina's constitution, no person who denies


 the existence of a supreme being shall hold any office


 under this constitution.  Among those eight states there's


 1328, I believe the number of legislators, not one of


 which has tried to get that -- those phrases out of their


 state constitutions, because they know, should they do


 that, they'll never get re-elected, because nobody likes


 somebody to stand up for atheists, and that's one of the


 key problems, and we perpetuate that every day when we


 say, okay class, including Newdow's daughter, stand up,


 put your hand on your heart and pledge, affirm that we are


 a nation under God.


 QUESTION: You have a clear free exercise right


 to get at those laws, wouldn't you, that you recited that


 said atheists can't run for office, atheists can't do this


 or that?  That -- that would be plainly unconstitutional,


 would it not?


 MR. NEWDOW: That would be, yes.  Those clauses


 are clearly nullities at this time in view of Torcaso v.

 QUESTION: And is -­


 MR. NEWDOW: However, they still exist.  And the


 fact that those clauses, I mean, we saw what happened to


 the -- to -- when the Confederate flag was over the


 statehouse in South Carolina, they had a big, you know,


 everyone got, you know, very upset and said, let's get


 that out.  That was a flag that can mean anything to


 anyone.  Could we imagine a clause in the South Carolina


 constitution that said no African-American shall hold any


 office under this constitution, no Jew shall hold any


 office under this constitution?  That would be there for


 two seconds maybe.  But no atheists?  Hey, let it stick


 around, it's been there, in eight states right now today


 in 2004.


 QUESTION: Well, if anyone challenged that -­


 QUESTION: May I ask you the same question I


 asked just General Olson?  Do you think that the words,


 under God, in the pledge, and I think of things like, in


 God we trust, on the dollar bill, which nobody really


 cares very much about anymore, but do you think the words,


 under God, in the Pledge of Allegiance have the same


 meaning today that they did to the country when the words


 were inserted in the -- in the pledge?


 MR. NEWDOW: I would merely note that 99 out of

 99 Senators stopped what they were doing and went out on


 the front steps of the Capitol to say that they want under


 God there.  The President of the United States in a press


 conference with Vladimir Putin decided the first thing


 he's going to talk about was this decision.  It was on the


 front page of every newspaper.  This is supposed to be one


 of the major cases of this Court's terms.  I think clearly


 it has enormous significance to the American public and


 that's why this is important.  That's why this case is so


 critical.


 QUESTION: And that's why you would not take the


 same position with regard to the words, in God we trust,


 on the dollar bill?


 MR. NEWDOW: I -- I think this Court can easily


 distinguish that situation from here, where we're asking


 children to stand up, being coerced in the setting, hold


 your hand over your heart and pledge your own personal


 affirmation to some religious entity.  Government is not


 even supposed to be anywhere near this question. 


 Government's supposed to stay out of the religion


 business, and here it came into it, it was completely


 unnecessary, and Congress said in 1954, in House Report


 1693, the inclusion of God in the pledge, therefore -- and


 they didn't use the phrase, under God, they said the


 entity God -- the inclusion of God in the pledge,

 therefore, would further acknowledge the dependence of our


 people and our Government upon the moral directions of the


 creator and we'll note it wasn't a creator, it was the


 creator, the Christian creator and we know that because


 when they put the flag up the flagpole, they played Onward


 Christian Soldiers Marching as to War. 


 I mean, this is -- clearly we know what was


 going on here.  It was to get religion in our government,


 and the outcry that came when the Ninth Circuit issued its


 opinion shows that people still want their religious


 beliefs in our government.  And the Free Exercise Clause


 is fine, they can do anything they want in the public


 schools, they can go into class, they can do whatever they


 want, but the Free Exercise Clause has never meant that a


 majority may use the machinery of the state to practice


 its beliefs, and that's precisely what we have in this


 situation.


 Again, I would point out that this Court, every


 member of this Court has demanded neutrality.  Seven


 members of this Court, six sitting today, have said that


 we need -- that have authored their own opinions that say


 that we need neutrality, and here we have the


 quintessential religious question, does there exist a God? 


 And government has come in, yes, there exists a God.  That


 is not neutrality by any means.

 QUESTION: What -- what -- is there any merit to


 the argument that there's a difference in a religious


 exercise and a pledge -- in the pledge -- or has that been


 your whole point here that there is no difference?


 MR. NEWDOW: I think there is a difference when


 the pledge doesn't have religious dogma as part of the


 religious -­


 QUESTION: But when it doesn't.


 MR. NEWDOW: -- when it doesn't have a religious


 creed or religious doctrine inserted.


 QUESTION: No, no, I mean this pledge.


 MR. NEWDOW: This -- this pledge -­


 QUESTION: You say this is the same as the prayer


 in Lee v. Weisman?


 MR. NEWDOW: No, not at all.  I'm saying it's a


 religious exercise, and clearly the whole idea, the intent


 of Congress was -­


 QUESTION: You're saying both as a religious -­


 are religious exercises?


 MR. NEWDOW: Well, I think religious exercise is


 a larger set, prayer is a subset.  I would say again the


 President of the United States considers the pledge in


 that subset.  Whether or not you do or I do is -- is


 somewhat, I think irrelevant, because the question --

 Lee v. Weisman.


 MR. NEWDOW: Correct.


 QUESTION: Which -- which clearly there was in


 MR. NEWDOW: Correct.


 QUESTION: Why -- why is this a religious


 exercise, or -- or is it?


 MR. NEWDOW: I think it definitely is, and it is


 because the two words are, under God, and I can't see of


 anything that's not religious under God, and again, I


 would point out in the standing argument made by the Elk


 Grove Unified School District, they repeatedly reference


 the fact it's the whole issue here with the mother is

 MR. NEWDOW: That -- that's one of the issues


 that -- that gets confusing.  The question is, when you


 look at what it -- the religious part, and then the


 question is, what are you going to define that as being


 encompassed in?  In Lee v. Weisman, it was the prayer


 within the context of the graduation and I think it was


 like an hour and a half for the graduation and two minutes


 for the prayer.


 So here we have, I think, if you actually


 multiply and look at the ratio, the ratio of the two


 words, under God, to the Pledge of Allegiance is greater


 than the ratio of the time spent on prayer versus the


 graduation exercise in Lee v. Weisman.  You can do that


 with anything.  We have Allegheny County showing, you


 know, we -- if you talk about the staircase and just


 being, you know, this individual thing, we could say,


 well, the staircase is this -- this transportation mode


 just like here the pledge is this patriotic mode. 


 But the question is, why did you stick the


 creche in the middle of this grand staircase?  The


 question is here, why did you stick these two purely


 religious words, under God, in the middle of the Pledge of


 Allegiance?  So I would say that it's clear here there is


 a purely religious purpose, we have purely religious


 effects, it fails the endorsement test, it fails the

 outsider test.  Imagine you're this one child with a class


 full of theists and you -- you're -- you have this idea


 that you want to perhaps at least consider and you have


 everyone imposing their view on you, it fails every test


 this Court has ever come up with, and there's a principle


 here and I'm hoping the Court will uphold this principle


 so that we can finally go back and have every American


 want to stand up, face the flag, place their hand over


 their heart and pledge to one nation, indivisible, not


 divided by religion, with liberty and justice for all.


 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Newdow.


 Mr. Cassidy, you have five minutes remaining.


 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TERENCE J. CASSIDY


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


 MR. CASSIDY: I would like to take this


 opportunity to respond to several points.  First, under


 Lynch we know that acknowledgment of the role of religion


 in American society is not exercising religion, nor is it


 endorsing religion.


 Second, respondent has stated his daughter is


 being required to stand up and say the pledge.  His


 daughter is not required to stand up and say the pledge. 


 It is the parents' choice, the parent chooses whether the


 child recites the pledge.  In this case, the mother has


 exercised her legal right under the state custody order

 and we have discussed that previously, but therefore, Mr.


 -- respondent's recourse is to object to the mother's


 decision, to seek his recourse in state court for the


 mother's decision, because there is a lack of a causal


 relationship with respect to his not having a legally


 protectable right to assert what he seems to be asserting


 in this case, that it is his daughter who is affected by


 the pledge.


 Third, following Barnette, schools across the


 country, including the Elk Grove Unified School District,


 have developed a number of procedures to accommodate


 students who wish to opt out of the pledge exercise.  They


 do so by consulting with the teachers and the principals,


 who are in the best position to know how to adopt that to


 the various class members.  In particular, there may be


 several ways that a child could opt out and exercise the


 rights that were developed post-Barnette.


 Equally important to the opt-out procedure or


 the voluntary requirement is the fact that teachers now


 instruct the students about mutual respect, respect of


 other belief systems, of all persons' belief systems. 


 Third, I would like to go back to the issue that


 was presented in this case, which was whether the school


 district policy violates the Establishment Clause. 


 Respondent conceded at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals

 that the school district policy had a secular purpose. 


 There's nothing in the record to show that the school


 district policy was adopted solely for religious purpose,


 nor is there anything in the record that shows there was


 any religious purpose in adopting, in adopting, the school


 district policy.


 Moreover, the Pledge of Allegiance in grammar


 schools, in public schools, is part of a teaching program,


 and that's what we're here about, to talk about the


 educational upbringing of a child, and it has to do with


 national unity and citizenship of our young students.


 QUESTION: May I ask you just one question?  I


 hate to take your rebuttal time, but one of the amicus


 briefs filed in this case has this sentence in it. I'd


 like you to comment on.  If the religious portion of the


 pledge is not intended as a serious affirmation of faith,


 then every day government asks millions of school children


 to take the name of the Lord in vain.  Would you comment


 on that argument?


 MR. CASSIDY: I would disagree, because we feel


 that the use of the term, one nation under God, reflects a


 political philosophy, and the political philosophy of our


 country, as set forth in the Declaration of Independence,


 is one is -- that ours is one of a limited government, and


 that is the philosophy that's now more enhanced, more

 reflected in the 1954 act. 


 But back to our school district policy, which is


 what is being challenged in this case, I would point the


 Court to the joint appendix at page 149, which sets forth


 not only that the pledge is recited in grammar school, but


 also that the pledge is then -- also can be recited in


 secondary schools, and likewise, that policy provides that


 school children are to look at all the different


 components of our history, speeches, historical documents,


 whether they be state constitutions, the Declaration of


 Independence, the Bill of Rights, and likewise, that's


 incorporated into the history and social sciences content


 standards for California, specifically at grade one level.


 Not only are the students learning the Pledge of


 Allegiance and singing songs such as My Country 'Tis of


 Thee, but likewise they're learning about the Declaration


 of Independence, so they are learning about our country's


 nationalism and civic unity at a very early stage.  They


 don't say the Pledge of Allegiance and go home.


 Likewise, I would submit that the Pledge of -­


 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Cassidy. 


 The case is submitted.


 (Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the


 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
