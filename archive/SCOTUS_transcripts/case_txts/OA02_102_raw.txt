CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-102, John Geddes Lawrence and Tyron Garner


v. Texas. 


Mr. Smith. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. SMITH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court. 


The State of Texas in this case claims the right


to criminally punish any unmarried adult couple for


engaging in any form of consensual sexual intimacy that


the State happens to disapprove of. 


It further claims that there's no constitutional 

problem raised by a criminal statute that is directed not


just at conduct, but at a particular group of people, a


law that criminalizes forms of sexual intimacy only for


same-sex couples and not for anyone else in the State who


has -- has the right to make a free choice to engage in


the identical conduct. 


Petitioners are two adults who were arrested in


a private home and criminally convicted simply because


they engaged in one of the forms of sexual intimacy that


is on the banned list in the State of Texas for same-sex

couples. 


They bring two constitutional claims to the


Court today.  First, among the fundamental rights that are


implicit in our concept of order of liberty, must be the


right of all adult couples, whether same-sex or not, to be


free from unwarranted State intrusion into their personal


decisions about their preferred forms of sexual


expression.  Second, there's no legitimate and rational


justification under the Equal Protection Clause for a law


that regulates forms of sexual intimacy that are permitted


in the State only for same-sex couples, thereby creating a


kind of a second class citizenship to that group of


people. 


QUESTION:  On your substantive due process


submission, Mr. Smith, certainly, the kind of conduct 

we're talking about here has been banned for a long time. 


Now you point to a trend in the other direction, which


would be fine if you're talking about the Eighth


Amendment, but I think our case is like Glucksberg, say,


if you're talking about a right that is going to be


sustained, it has to have been recognized for a long time. 


And that simply isn't so.


MR. SMITH:  The Court's cases, Mr. Chief


Justice, say that history is a starting point, not the end


point of the analysis.  And I think that it's important to

look at history as a whole and one of the errors that I


think that the Court made in Bowers v. Hardwick was only


looking at the issue in terms of homosexual sodomy and not


looking at the issue in general terms, which is the right


of everyone to decide for themselves about consensual


private sexual intimacy.  If you look at the history as a


whole, you find a much more complicated picture.  First of


all, you find that sodomy was regulated going back to the


founding for everyone and indeed the laws in the 19th


century didn't focus on same-sex couples, they focused on


particular --


QUESTION:  Well, you're getting to your equal


protection argument now.  Let's -- let's separate the two. 


The first is, your -- your -- your fundamental right


argument, which has nothing to do with equal protection? 

MR. SMITH:  Well, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  So the same-sex/other-sex aspect


doesn't come into it --


MR. SMITH:  I think it does come into it,


because if you're going to suggest that the state of the


law on the books in the 19th century is the touchstone you


have to take into account that in the 19th century at


least on the face of the law married couples were


regulated in terms of their forms of sexual intimacy that


were created for them.

 QUESTION:  It may well be, but so were same-sex


couples. 


MR. SMITH:  Indeed, they all were, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  So all same-sex couples could not --


could not perform this act lawfully.  What more do you


need than that?  It was prohibited.  When you go beyond


that and say, oh, but it was also prohibited for -- for


other sex couples, you're getting into an equal protection


argument, it seems to me, not a fundamental right


argument. 


MR. SMITH:  I guess I'm suggesting Mr. --


Justice Scalia, that it's been conceded here by this


State, it was conceded by the State of Georgia 17 years


ago, that married couples can't be regulated as a matter


of substantive due process in their personal sexual 

expression in the home.  That means that the state of the


law on the books in the 19th century can't be the deciding


factor. 


it. 


QUESTION:  They conceded it.  I haven't conceded


MR. SMITH:  Your Honor.  That may well be true. 


I was -- I was working with the assumption that there may


be Justices who -- of the view that married couples do


have such a right and I am suggesting that the real issue


here is whether that fundamental right extends outside the

marital context into other unmarried couples who form


bonds and have -- and -- for whom sexual intimacy plays an


equally important role in their lives. 


QUESTION:  Were you talking specifically about


this Eisenstadt against Baird where there was an unmarried


couple -- while there was an unmarried person and the


conduct in question would have been perhaps in the 19th


century, early 19th century, criminal?  Are you talking


about fornication? 


MR. SMITH:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  I think the


Court in -- has moved from Griswold to Eisenstadt -- has


moved in the contraception area outside of the marital


context to the unmarried context, certainly the right --


the qualified right to abortion applies to unmarried


people, as well as married people. 


And I think that the 

Court in -- in looking at this issue of the scope of the


fundamental right to make choices about sexual intimacy


ought to take into account not just the state of law on


the books in the 19th century but a couple of other


factors, one the change in enforcement in the last 50


years because the Court's fundamental rights cases all do


look at current laws, as well as 19th century law and also


even in the 19th century, the fact that there's no record


of active enforcement of these laws against conduct -- of


adults consensual occurring in the private setting and

that's true for married couples, it's true for different-


sex couples who weren't married, it's true for same-sex


couples.  The enforcement of the sodomy laws of this


country going back to the founding involves coercion, it


involves children.  It involves public activity.  It


doesn't involve the kind of conduct that's at issue here. 


So you really have a tradition of respect for


the privacy of couples in their -- in their home, going


back to the founding and I think then what began to happen


in 1960 was a recognition that we should take that


tradition and -- and turn it into positive law on the


books. 


And so you now had three quarters of the States


who no longer regulate this conduct for anyone based on a


recognition that it's not consistent with our basic 

American values about the relationship between the


individual and the State. 


QUESTION:  Well, it depends on what you mean by


our basic American values, to revert to what the Chief


Justice was suggesting earlier.  Really what's at issue in


this case is whether we're going to adhere to -- in the


first part of the case, not the equal protection aspect. 


It's whether we're going to adhere to what -- what we said


in -- in Glucksberg, mainly that before we find a


substantive due process right, a fundamental liberty, we

have to assure ourselves that that liberty was objectively


deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition. 


That's what we said in Glucksberg and we've said


it in other cases.  Or are we going to depart from that


and go to the approach that we've adopted with regard to


the Eighth Amendment, which is it evolves and changes in


-- in social values will justify a new perception of what


is called unusual punishment. 


Now, why should we -- why should we slip into


the second mode?  I'm -- I mean, suppose all the States


had laws against flagpole sitting at one time, you know,


there was a time when it was a popular thing and probably


annoyed a lot of communities, and then almost all of them


repealed those laws. 


Does that make flagpole sitting a fundamental 

right? 


MR. SMITH:  No, Your Honor, but the Court's


decisions don't look just at history, they look at the --


at the function that a particular claimed freedom plays in


the lives of real people.  That's why contraception became


an issue.  That's why abortion became an issue. 


QUESTION:  I don't know what you mean by the


function it plays in the lives of real people. 


MR. SMITH:  The Court has said that --


QUESTION:  Any law stops people from doing what

they really want to do. 


MR. SMITH:  The Court has said that it's going


to use reasoned judgment to identify a realm of personal


liberty that involves matters of central and core to how a


person defines their own lives, and relates to key other


people. 


It's about moral upbringing of children in the


home.  It's about procreation or nonprocreation in your


sexual relations with your mate.  It's about basic


questions of what kind of a family you're going to live


with and other intimate associations. 


QUESTION:  Well, you say it's about procreation


or nonprocreation, but none of the cases that you have


talked about involved nonprocreation, did they? 


MR. SMITH: 


They certainly involved the right to 

decide to engage in sexual relations with -- while


preventing procreation, that's what -- that's what


Griswold and Eisenstadt and Carey all say you have a right


to do.  That there's a right to decide whether to bear and


beget children and then that right resides with unmarried


people as much as it resides with married people. 


And I submit to you that it's illogical,


fundamentally illogical to say that an unmarried couple


has a right free of State intrusion to decide whether or


not to have procreative sex or nonprocreative sex, but

doesn't have the right to be free from State intrusion --


free from a law that says you can't have any sexual


intimacy at all. There's a -- there's a jagged piece


missing from the edifice of this Court's substantive


fundamental rights jurisprudence. 


QUESTION:  It doesn't say you can't have -- you


can't have any sexual intimacy.  It says you cannot have


sexual intimacy with a person of the same sex. 


MR. SMITH:  This particular law does that, yes,


Your Honor, but certainly our -- our submission is that


fornication laws and -- and laws involving sodomy


regulation more broadly would be equally unconstitutional,


because they involve --


QUESTION:  But your position, as I understand


it, is even if you take the narrowest view of Glucksberg 

and even if you say there's got to be a positive


historical sanction, that in fact there is no historical


-- no substantial historical evidence to the contrary


because, A, the -- the sodomy laws were not enforced


against consensual activity historically and B, they were


not aimed at homosexual as opposed to sodomy in general? 


MR. SMITH:  Right. 


QUESTION:  Is that -- your historical point, you


say even if I accept your argument, I should win? 


MR. SMITH:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think first of

all that the positive law, the law on the books proves too


much because it intruded right into the marital bedroom


and that the record of enforcement which may be more


informative actually supports us rather than supporting


the notion that this is something that can be regulated. 


QUESTION:  What do you mean by the record of


enforcement, that there were -- that what happened in this


case was an accidental intrusion of the police?  They


didn't come into the bedroom looking for people conducting


illicit sexual relations?  They were there for another


reason and happened to discover these -- these men in that


conduct. 


What do you mean by lack of enforcement? The


police have not gone around knocking on bedroom doors to


see if anyone -- I mean -- this is not the kind of a crime 

that the police go around looking for, but do you have any


evidence to show that when they -- when they found it


being committed, they turned a blind eye to it and did not


prosecute it? 


MR. SMITH:  The evidence we have is the -- is


the absence of reported cases discussing arrests for that


kind of conduct. 


QUESTION:  Well, that's because it's -- it's an


act committed in private, and -- and the police respect


the privacy of -- of one's home, of one's bedroom, and so

they don't investigate and find it. 


But it seems to me what you would need is


evidence that when the police discovered this matter, they


said, oh, well, these are not laws that we enforce.  I


don't see any evidence of that sort. 


MR. SMITH:  Certainly it seems to us there's a


significance to the fact that it has never been treated


as, for example, drug use in the home has been treated. 


And people do -- the police obviously do actively seek to


infiltrate homes to find that kind of activity, it's been


treated in a categorically different way.  But perhaps --


QUESTION:  To what extent can you characterize


it?  I mean, the ACLU brief has a lot of evidence along


this line.  I -- and it seemed to me they want to


characterize it as saying that the history has gone 

exactly the opposite direction than what's been suggested. 


But if you go back to colonial times really, the laws not


only were different but look at the prosecutions.  And


they did prosecute people for sex crimes.  But they didn't


prosecute people for same-sex crimes.  And then if you go


across the history, it's only recently that people have


been prosecuted for same-sex crimes.  Is that a fair


characterization?  What is the real record? 


MR. SMITH:  The argument about 19th century


enforcement is that they didn't prosecute anyone for

private and consensual crimes involving adults, that they


worried about children, they worried about public


activity, they worried about coercion, but that they


didn't worry about same-sex or different-sex sodomy.  Now


as to the equal protection point which I think I should


get to in my remaining time.  This is a statute which in


addition to intruding into that area of important


fundamental protections, limits its focus just to one


small minority of the people of the State of Texas.  It


says that these specified forms of sexual intimacy called


deviate sexual intercourse are illegal only for same-sex


couples and not for anyone else in the State of Texas. 


QUESTION:  Well, what about a statute that


covered both? 


MR. SMITH: 


Well, I think that would be 

unconstitutional under my first point, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Right. 


MR. SMITH:  I think there is a multiple --


multiply unconstitutional statute, because it does the


second thing as well, it says that --


QUESTION:  Well, if the statute covered both,


would there be an equal protection argument? 


MR. SMITH:  If there was a record of enforcement


almost exclusively as to same-sex couples, I think there


would be potential constitutional problems there, but the

statutory language itself would not involve an equal


protection problem of the same sort that we're dealing


with here.


QUESTION:  Mr. Smith, aren't there a lot of


statutes like that?  Aren't there statutes in many States


about adultery that don't cover sexual relations of one of


the married couple with someone else of the same sex?  Are


they unconstitutional because of denial of equal


protection? 


MR. SMITH:  I don't know whether statutes


actually are written that way, Your Honor.  The point I


would make is that when a statute --


QUESTION:  What about rape laws?  There are --


there are rape laws that -- that only apply to -- to


male/female rape.


MR. SMITH:  That may be as well.  I think --


QUESTION:  You think that they're


unconstitutional? 


MR. SMITH:  I didn't suggest that they're


unconstitutional.  My point is that when a statute is


limited to one particular group of people, particularly a


minority of people in the State, that that limitation


itself has to be justified under equal protection, that


that's a classification of people, not merely a definition


of conduct.  And that if the -- if the justification of

the line that was drawn here is -- is insufficient as a


matter of mere rationale basis analysis.  Because --


QUESTION:  I don't understand that. Suppose the


State has a rape law that -- that, you know, that really


requires the penetration of the female sex organ by --


which is the classic common-law definition of rape, and it


has no -- no law of -- about homosexual rape.  You think


that that law would be unconstitutional? 


MR. SMITH:  I think it would have to be


justified by the State.  They may well come in with


evidence that this is not a problem that needs to be


addressed or that the victims are more able to protect


themselves, they may have -- they may have --


QUESTION:  One step at a time?  This is more


common? 


This is -- or this is something that we find 

more -- more -- more -- more odious? 


MR. SMITH:  Well, the one thing that I submit,


the Court, the State should not be able to come in to say


is we are going to permit ourselves the majority of people


in our society full -- full and free rein to make these


decisions for ourselves but there's one minority of people


don't get that decision and the only reason we're going to


give you is we want it that way.  We want them to be


unequal in their choices and their freedoms, because we


think we should have the right to commit adultery, to

commit fornication, to commit sodomy and the State should


have no basis for intruding into our lives but we don't


want those people over there to have the same right. 


QUESTION:  I mean you you can put it that way,


but society always -- in a lot of its laws makes these


moral judgments, you can make it sound very puritanical,


the -- you know, the laws -- the laws against bigamy, I


mean, who are you to tell me that I can't have more than


one wife?  You blue-nose bigot.  Sure.  You can make it


sound that way, but these are laws dealing with public


morality.  They've always been on the book, nobody has


ever told them they're unconstitutional simply because


there are moral perceptions behind them.  Why is this


different from bigamy? 


MR. SMITH: 


First of all, the first law that's 

appeared on the books in the States of this country that


singles out only same sex sodomy appeared in the '60s and


the '70s and it did not -- and it does not go way back,


this kind of discrimination.  Now, bigamy involves


protection of an institution that the State creates for


its own purposes and there are all sorts of potential


justifications about the need to protect the institution


of marriage that are different in kind from the


justifications that could be offered here involving merely


a criminal statute that says we're going to regulate these

peoples behaviors, we include a criminal law which is


where the most heightened form of -- of people protection


analysis ought to apply.  This case is very much like


McLaughlin, Your Honor, where you had a statute that said


we're going to give an specially heightened penalty to


cohabitation, but only when it involves a white person


with a black person.  That interracial cohabitation is


different, and the State there made the argument we're


merely regulating a particular form of conduct, and that's


a different form of conduct than -- than intro racial


cohabitation.  And this Court very clearly said no. 


You're classifying people.  And that classification has to


be justified. 


And this Court at many times said a mere


disapproval of one group of people, whether it be the 

hippie communes in Moreno or the mentally retarded in


Cleburne, or indeed gay people. 


QUESTION:  But all -- almost all laws are based


on disapproval of either some people or some sort of


conduct.  That's why people legislate. 


MR. SMITH:  And what this Court does under the


equal protection clause is -- is -- standard as a bull


work against arbitrary government when the -- when there


is no rational justification for the line that is drawn. 


QUESTION:  Well, do you -- do you -- in order to

win under an equal protection argument, do you have to


apply some sort of heightened scrutiny? 


MR. SMITH:  We certainly do not think we do,


Your Honor.  We think this fails rational basis scrutiny,


just as the law did in Romer, in Cleburne, in Moreno, in


Eisenstadt, all of those laws were thrown out under


rational basis scrutiny, because the State basically


didn't come up with anything other than we want it that


way.  We want these people to be excluded.  We'd had


distaste for them.  We disapprove of them.  It's mere


disapproval, or hostility, however historically based, is


not sufficient.  And certainly even applying the rational


basis --


QUESTION:  We said the opposite in Bowers,


didn't we? 
 Overrule bounds essentially on that point? 

MR. SMITH:  Well, certainly Bowers is not an


equal protection case and it didn't involve this kind of


discrimination. 


QUESTION:  The equal protection and on to the --


MR. SMITH:  No I was still talking about the


level of scrutiny under equal protection, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Maybe you ought to hold up one hand


so I'll know which? 


MR. SMITH:  It's hard when you have these two


points to shift back and forth.

 QUESTION:  I understand.  We had the same


problem in the last case --


MR. SMITH:  Three weeks ago, yes, Your Honor. 


The -- but the Court in applying even the


rational basis standard has not been insensitive to the


reality of what the world is like, and to the fact that


some groups of -- some classifications tend to be


involving minorities that have had histories of


discrimination against them and that the overall effect of


some line-drawing can be very harmful.  In Romer itself,


the Court looked at the actual effects of the -- of the


amendment in the Constitution and all of the many ways in


which it caused harm.  Here you have a statute that while


it -- while it purports to just to regulate sexual


behavior, has all sorts of collateral effects on people. 

People in the States who still regulate sodomy everyday


they're denied visitation to their own children, they're


denied custody of children, they're denied public


employment.  They're denied private employment, because


they're labeled as criminals merely because they've been


identified as homosexuals.  And that we submit --


QUESTION:  If you prevail, Mr. Smith, and this


law is struck down, do you think that would also mean that


a State could not prefer heterosexuals to homosexuals to


teach kindergarten?

 MR. SMITH:  I think the issue of -- of


preference in the educational context would involve very


different criteria, Your Honor, very different


considerations, the State would have to come in with some


sort of a justification. 


QUESTION:  A justification is the same that's


alluded to here, disapproval of homosexuality. 


MR. SMITH:  Well, I think it would be highly --


highly problematic, such a -- such a justification. 


QUESTION:  Yes, it would? 


MR. SMITH:  If that were the only justification


that could be offered, there was not some showing that


there would be any more concrete harm to the children in


the school. 


QUESTION: 


Only that the children might -- might 

be induced to -- to follow the path of homosexuality.  And


that would not be -- that would the not be enough? 


MR. SMITH:  Well, I -- I think the State has to


have a greater justification for its discrimination than


we prefer pushing people towards heterosexuality.  That


amounts to the same thing as disapproval of people's


choices in this area and there has to be a more -- more


reasons and justifiable distinction than simply we prefer


this group of people, the majority, instead of this group


of people, the minority.

 Justice Jackson in the railway express case said


very eloquently that the equal protection clause is an


important bulwark against arbitrary government because


it's there to make sure that legislators don't avoid


political retribution by imposing onerous burdens only on


one minority, but that in fact the majority will live by


the same rules as purports to impose on everybody else. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Smith before you continue down to


the equal protection line.  Your first argument was the


right of personal privacy in one's most intimate sexual


relations, you were asked and you didn't get a chance to


answer because you went back on your equal protection


track, you are asking the Court to overrule Bowers against


Hardwick.  I thought that was very --


MR. SMITH:  Yes, Your Honor. 


We're asking you to overrule it and we think


that the right of -- of the fundamental right of unmarried


people to make these choices about private adult


consensual intimacy applies for different sex couples as


well as same sex couples and that Bowers was wrong for


essentially three reasons, first it posed the question too


narrowly by focusing just on homosexual sodomy, which is


just one of the moral choices that couples ought to


have -- that people ought to have available to them. 


And second in its analysis of history, which I

think I explained already and third, and perhaps most


importantly, in the assumptions that the Court made in


1986 about the realities of gay lives and gay


relationships, the Court simply asserted in the Bowers


case that there's no showing that has been demonstrated


between the opportunity to engage in this conduct and


family. 


And certainly while it may not have been shown


in that case or even apparent to the Court in 1986, I


submit it has to be apparent to the Court now that there


are gay families that family relationships are


established, that there are hundreds of thousands of


people registered in the Census in the 2000 census who


have formed gay families, gay partnerships, many of them


raising children and that for those people, the 

opportunity to engage in sexual expression as they will in


the privacy of their own homes performs much the same


function that it does in the marital context, that you


can't protect one without the other, that it doesn't make


sense to draw a line there and that you should protect it


for everyone. That this is a fundamental matter of


American values. 


So those are the three reasons we ask you to


overrule Bowers v. Hardwick as to the fundamental rights


aspect of the case and that we think that that is an area

where the Court should go -- should go back and reconsider


itself. 


The Court has now left open for nearly 30 years


the question of whether anybody outside has a right -- has


a privacy right to engage in consensual sexual intimacy in


the privacy of their home. 


And I submit to you, you know, while the Court


has left that unanswered, the American people have moved


on to the point where that right is taken for granted for


everyone. 


Most Americans would be shocked to find out that


their decision to engage in sexual intimacy with another


person in their own home might lead to a knock on the door


as occurred here and a criminal prosecution. 


And that -- that reality is something that the 

Court needs to take into account and certainly in so


doing, it shouldn't -- in constructing its fundamental


rights edifice draw distinctions between gay couples and


other couples. 


QUESTION:  You probably say the same about


adultery, you think adultery laws are unconstitutional? 


MR. SMITH:  I think that the state has --


QUESTION:  I mean think people probably feel the


same way about that, you know.  It may not be a nice thing


to do, but I certainly don't expect a knock on the door

and go to jail for it. 


MR. SMITH:  Your Honor, adultery is a very


different case.  It involves the State interests in


protecting the marital contract which people voluntarily


take on.  And -- and so in assessing. 


QUESTION:  Why is the marital contract important


to the State?  Because it's the source of -- of the next


generation, right? 


MR. SMITH:  Sure, the State is --


QUESTION:  And you think that there's not some


of the same thinking behind the conscious choice of the


State to favor heterosexual and marital sex over


homosexual sex? 


MR. SMITH:  Well, I can understand a law which


says we're going to attempt to channel heterosexuals 

towards marriage by making them -- making it illegal for


them to have sex without marriage.  I can't understand


that law under -- under that kind of rational which only


regulates same sex couples and says you can't have sex but


everyone else has a right to do that. 


As for adultery and all of the other parade of


horribles which people have raised in their briefs, it


seems to me you've got to look at the individual interests


and the State interests and their dramatically different


in all of those cases incest, prostitution, all of

these -- bestiality, all of these things either there's


very little individual interests or there's very


heightened State interest or both, in all of those cases,


so the idea that by recognizing the right of all adult


couples to make choices like this in their own home the


Court is going to open up a whole can of worms, I submit,


is correct. 


If I could reserve the balance of my time, Your


Honor. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Very well, Mr. Smith. 


Mr. Rosenthal, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROSENTHAL, JR.


ON BEHALF OF TEXAS


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Give me just a moment. Mr. Chief


Justice, and may it please the Court. 


The State humbly submits that enforcement of


Texas Penal Code Statute 21.06 does not violate the 14th


Amendment of the Constitution because this Court has never


recognized a fundamental right to engage in extramarital


sexual conduct and because there is a rational basis for


the statute sufficient to withstand equal protection


scrutiny. 


I'd like to begin with a brief discussion of


substantive due process.  From a practitioner's


standpoint, it appears that the jurisprudence of this

Court appears to resolve the means by which the Court


entertains a claim of novel protected liberty interests.


Since the Constitution does not expressly


address the issue of privacy or of sexual conduct, we look


to the Court's precedents and to the history of our


people.


If a historical, traditional analysis applies,


it then serves as objective guideposts to guide this


Court, as long as those ideals and laws do not infringe on


fundamental rights. 


The Court has maintained that designation of a


liberty interest is done -- not done with impunity.  But


only those interests that appear to be carefully


identified asserted rights should be drawn and should be


considered as liberty interests. 


The record in this case 

does not particularly show which rights the petitioners


are asking to uphold.


QUESTION:  I -- I don't understand what you mean


by that.  Aren't we clear what right they're seeking to


uphold? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  No, sir, they're -- they're


asking for the right of homosexuals to engage in


homosexual conduct. 


QUESTION:  Right. 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  But there's nothing in the

record to indicate that these people are homosexuals. 


They're not homosexuals by definition if they commit one


act.  It's our position that a heterosexual person can


also violate this code if they commit an act of deviate


sexual intercourse with another of the same sex.


QUESTION:  Why aren't -- why aren't they seeking


to vindicate the right of either homosexuals or


heterosexuals to commit homosexual act?  What difference


does that make?


MR. ROSENTHAL:  The difference it makes is as


the -- as the record is set out, it does not really define


the issues such that the Court can actually give the


petitioners a -- a specific form of relief. 


QUESTION:  But the -- the -- the statute, Texas


has already decided that for us. 


It has called this 

homosexual conduct, so whether it's a heterosexual person


or a homosexual person, the crime is engaging in


homosexual conduct. 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  You don't even have to get to the --


as I understand it, you don't even have to get to the


characterization of homosexual.  The statute clearly


defines certain acts committed by or together with


individuals of the same sex and that's your class, isn't


it?

 MR. ROSENTHAL:  Yes, it is. 


QUESTION:  What more do we need? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  We're -- the class actually is


people who violate the act, not classes of individuals


based upon sexual orientation. 


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I can see that your point


may have some relevance on the equal protection side of


the equation, some relevance, I don't think it may be


controlling.  It -- it doesn't seem to meet the arguments


that's made under the substantive liberty part of the


argument with reference to Bowers.


MR. ROSENTHAL:  I beg your pardon? 


QUESTION:  It doesn't meet the petitioners'


argument with respect to Bowers versus Hardwick, which


they say should be overruled. 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, of course we -- we believe


that Bowers versus Hardwick is -- is good law.  It's


substantial law and that this Court should not overrule


Bowers --


QUESTION:  But that question is certainly


clearly before us.  I mean this is your statute.  You


convicted the people for these acts and you have to be --


you have to defend it. 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Yes, sir.  And it's our position


that Bowers versus Hardwick is still good law, that

there's nothing that's changed about the fundamental


liberties or the -- or the history or traditions of our


country that should make the analysis in Bowers incorrect


any longer. 


The petitioner also claims that the mores of our


nation have changed to the point where physical homosexual


intimacy is now part of the fabric of American values. 


And it's our position this cannot be correct.  Even if you


infer that various States acting through their legislative


process have repealed sodomy laws, there is no protected


right to engage in extrasexual -- extramarital sexual


relations, again, that can trace their roots to history or


the traditions of this nation.


QUESTION:  Their basic argument, I think --


QUESTION:  I -- I'm sorry. 


I didn't get that 

argument.  I thought you were going to say -- you were


responding to the argument that the morals haven't


changed, or that the morals have changed so that


homosexuality is now approved.  And you respond to that by


saying that there's no tradition?  I mean, that's --


that's a totally different argument from tradition.  I


mean, the -- the argument is tradition doesn't matter. 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, history -- tradition does


not matter in terms of whether or not it -- it can be a


protected liberty interest.

 QUESTION:  Why -- why do you think that the

MR. ROSENTHAL:  The public perception of it? 


QUESTION:  Yes, yes.  Do you think there's


public approval of it? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Of homosexuals, but not of


homosexuality activity.


QUESTION:  What do you base that on?


MR. ROSENTHAL:  I beg your pardon? 


QUESTION:  What do you base that on? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, even --


QUESTION:  I mean I think there ought to be some


evidence which -- which you can bring forward? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Sure. 


QUESTION:  Like perhaps the failure of the


Federal Congress to add the sexual preference to the list


of protected statuses against which private individuals


are not permitted to discriminate, that addition has been


sought several times and it's been rejected by the Federal


Congress, hasn't it? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Yes, sir, and -- and in


addition, what I was trying to say by the fact that


various States have changed their position on sodomy,


they've done it through the legislative process.  And

that's where we believe this belongs, is in the State


House of Texas, not this Court. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but I thought you were


responding to the argument that the public perception


hasn't changed.  That there still is -- is a public


disapproval of homosexual acts. 


And you can't establish that by saying that the


States have repealed their homosexual laws.


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, I think it goes back to


whether the -- where -- whether people in Texas and people


in the other States that had this law on their books


actually accepted through their representative government. 


I think it comes down to the -- the actual people who --


who determine the consensus and mores of the State or


the -- or the elected legislators. 


QUESTION:  Might there be a difference between


the people's willingness to prosecute something criminally


and the people's embracing of that as a fundamental right?


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, certainly.  And just


because someone has decriminalized sodomy doesn't mean


that they embraced that practice as something that ought


to be taught in the schools as was mentioned before.


QUESTION:  But the argument of -- of Bowers, to


overrule Bowers is not directly related to sodomy.  It's


related, but not directly.  It's that people in their own

bedrooms, which have their right to do basically what they


want, it's not hurting other people.  And they -- the


other side -- says Bowers understated the importance of


that.  It got the history wrong.  It didn't understand the


relationship of the sodomy to families and in addition,


Bowers has proved to be harmful to thousands and thousands


and thousands of people, if not because they're going to


be prosecuted, because they fear it -- they might be,


which makes it a possible instrument of repression in the


hands of the prosecutors.  Now, that's the kind of


argument that they're making.  Harmful in consequence,


wrong in theory, understating the constitutional value.


MR. ROSENTHAL:  All right --


QUESTION:  All right, now how do you respond to


that? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Okay.  First of all, let me --


let me correct something that -- that's very minor at this


point, but the allegation was made in petitioners'


argument that people can -- convicted of homosexual


conduct are banned from jobs and housing and all -- and


all that kind of thing.  In Texas, homosexual conduct is a


class C misdemeanor.  That is, it is the lowest


misdemeanor -- or the lowest prohibition that Texas has. 


QUESTION:  That I didn't bring in in my


question.

QUESTION:  -- because on their face, they're --


I mean, I'm not -- not a criticism, I mean, directly


responding, directly responding to the -- to the -- to the


question. 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, it's our position that the


line should be drawn at the marital bedroom, through which


we can -- through the law enforcement or anyone else


cannot pass unless something illegal happens inside that


bedroom. 


QUESTION: 


Well, if this is drawing the line at 

the bedroom door, this case is inside the bedroom, not


outside.  That's the statute makes criminal, to my


understanding, of it what takes place within the bedroom


through consent.  Am I right about that? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  You're right about that, but --


QUESTION:  And why isn't that something that the


State has no business getting involved in --

 MR. ROSENTHAL:  First of all, let me say that


consent may be alleged in this case, but consent is not


proven in the record in this case.  There's -- there is


nothing in the record that shows that people are capable


of giving consent or that consent was, in fact, given, but


even given that, I -- I think that the -- that this Court


having determined that there are certain kinds of conduct


that it will accept and certain kinds of conduct it will


not accept may draw the line at the bedroom door of the


heterosexual married couple because of the interest that


this Court has that this Nation has and certainly that the


State of Texas has for the preservation of marriage,


families and the procreation of children. 


QUESTION:  Does Texas permit same-sex


adoptions -- two women or two men to adopt a child or to 

be foster parents? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  I don't know the answer to that,


Justice. 


QUESTION:  Well, in portraying what Texas sees


as a family and distinguishing both married and unmarried


heterosexual people from homosexual people, those things


wouldn't go together if the State at the same time said


same sex couples are qualified to raise a family.  You can


adopt children, you can be foster parents.


You don't know what -- what the Texas law is on

that? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  I do not know what that Texas


law -- what the Texas law says in that regard. 


QUESTION:  I think it would be relevant to your


argument that they're making -- that Texas is making the


distinction between kinds of people who have family


relationships and can be proper guardians of children and


those who can't. 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, again, Your Honor, we're


not saying that they can't be proper guardians and we


can't say that they can't raise children.  That -- that's


not the issue.  The issue --


QUESTION:  You're fairly certain that they can't


procreate children, aren't you?


[Laughter.]


MR. ROSENTHAL:  We are sure that they -- that


they can't do that.  But we're also not -- not penalizing


their -- their status.  We're penalizing only the


particular activity that those unmarried couples may have


with respect to whether they have sexual intimacies. 


QUESTION:  Does Texas prohibit sexual


intercourse between unmarried heterosexuals? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, it used to.  It does not


do that now, unless the sexual intimacy is in public or


where someone might view --

 QUESTION:  No, say in a -- a private situation


like this, it would not -- it would not be prohibited? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  It does not criminalize it, it


does not condone it. 


QUESTION:  What about adultery? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  I beg your pardon? 


QUESTION:  What about adultery? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Again, adultery is not penalized


in Texas, but it is certainly not condoned in Texas.


[Laughter.]


QUESTION:  All right, so you said -- you said


procreation, marriage and children, those are your three


justifications.  Now from what you recently said, I don't


see what it has to do with marriage, since, in fact,


marriage has nothing to do with the conduct that either 

this or other statutes do or don't forbid.  I don't see


what it has to do with children, since, in fact, the gay


people can certainly adopt children and they do.  And I


don't see what it has to do with procreation, because


that's the same as the children. 


All right.  So -- so what is the justification


for this statute, other than, you know, it's not what they


say on the other side, is this is simply, I do not like


thee, Doctor Fell, the reason why I cannot tell.


[Laughter.]

 QUESTION:  Now, what is aside -- aside from


that? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  I think what -- what I'm saying


is -- and I had not gotten into the equal protection


aspect of the -- of the argument yet, but under the equal


protection argument, Texas has the right to set moral


standards and can set bright line moral standards for its


people.  And in the setting of those moral standards, I


believe that they can say that certain kinds of activity


can exist and certain kinds of activity cannot exist. 


QUESTION:  Could they say, for example, it is


against the law at the dinner table to tell really serious


lies to your family? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Yes, they can make that a law,


but there would be no rational basis for the law. 

QUESTION:  Oh, really.  It's very immoral.  I


mean, I know there's certainly -- it's certainly immoral


to tell very serious harmful lies to your own family under


certain circumstances and around the dinner table, some of


the worst things can happen.


[Laughter.]


But the -- the -- so Texas could go right in


there and any kind of morality that they think is just


immoral or bad, cheating, perhaps.  What about rudeness,


serious rudeness, et cetera?

 MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, again, if -- if Texas did


pass the law, it would have to -- have to show through


some rational basis test that it's rationally related to


some State interest.


QUESTION:  Mr. Rosenthal, don't you think that


what laws a State may constitutionally pass has a lot to


do with what laws it has always been thought that a State


can constitutionally pass, so that if you have a 200-year


tradition of a certain type of law -- and I don't know of


a 200-year tradition of laws against lying at the dinner


table -- the presumption is that the State is within the


bounds of -- of the Constitution to pass that law in -- as


declaring what it has proscribed as contra bonos mores, a


term that's been in the common law from the beginning as


against good morals, bigamy, adultery, all sorts of things 

like that, and isn't that determined pretty much on the


basis of what kind of laws the State has traditionally


been allowed to pass? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Certainly.  And it goes -- it


goes to things as diverse as --


QUESTION:  I don't suppose you're going to argue


that Loving against Virginia was incorrectly decided, are


you? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Oh, certainly not.

tradition that supported that --


MR. ROSENTHAL:  But it also violated a


fundamental right.


QUESTION:  And that's the issue here.


[Laughter.] 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Yes, sir.  And the fundamental


right that was asserted there is -- is a long-established


fundamental right that we don't -- we don't treat races


differently because we think that one's inferior or we


stereotype someone --


QUESTION:  There was a constitutional text


there, wasn't there, with Loving versus Virginia.  I


thought there was something about a Civil War and no


discrimination on the basis of race. 


MR. ROSENTHAL: 


Yes, and the same with -- with 

the case that was cited from Florida. 


QUESTION:  When -- when did Texas select


homosexual sodomy as -- as a subject of specific criminal


prohibition? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Sodomy as a -- as a --


QUESTION:  My question --


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Yes, sir.


QUESTION:  Go ahead, but my question is --


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Yes, sir. 


QUESTION:  -- is about sodomy among two adults

of the same sex? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Yes, sir.  And sodomy had -- has


a longstanding tradition of the history of Texas of sodomy


being against the law, however --


QUESTION:  When -- when was -- was the first


statute passed?  I think 200 years was mentioned.  Was


there a law in the books in 1803? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  No, I don't think Texas was a


State back then.


[Laughter.]


QUESTION:  It doesn't have to be -- it doesn't


have to --


QUESTION:  Territorial --


QUESTION:  It's a trick question, Mr. Rosenthal. 


Don't -- don't fall into that trap.


[Laughter.]


QUESTION:  1803 or the first date of the Texas


legislature's meeting, did they pass it at the -- at the


first meeting of the legislature? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, certainly in the -- in the


1854 Penal Code, the -- the kinds of activity that -- that


were classified now as sodomy were against the law. 


However, I think to address your question --


QUESTION:  When did -- when did they single out


homosexual sodomy?

 MR. ROSENTHAL:  In 1973, in the passage of the


1974 Penal Code. 


QUESTION:  So the issue here doesn't have much


of a longstanding tradition specific to this statute, does


it? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, not specific to -- not


specific to that statute, but it has a longstanding


tradition in Texas as being something that should be


proscribed and something that is regarded as immoral and


unwholesome. 


QUESTION:  Well, homosexual sodomy was unlawful


in Texas from when?  There was not a statute addressed


just to that.  It was addressed to sodomy in general, but


homosexual -- but homosexual sodomy included, and that law


goes back how long?  To 1803? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  To the -- to the time that Texas


was a republic, before it --


QUESTION:  But what about the statute which this


Court I think once had to grapple with, people felt during


World War I that it was immoral to teach German in the


public schools.  So then would you say that the State has


every right to do that, parents want their children to


learn German, but the schools forbid it?  See, the hard


question here is can the State, in fact, pass anything


that it wants at all, because they believe it's immoral.

If you were going to draw the line somewhere, I guess you


might begin to draw it when the person is involved inside


his own bedroom and not hurting anybody else.  Now that --


that now -- so you say it's morality.  I -- I agree many


people do believe that that's a question of morality. 


Many do not, but nonetheless, what can you add to what


you're saying, other than simply asserting its morality? 


Because I don't think you think that the State could pass


anything in the name of morality? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Certainly not.  But it would


have -- any law that would pass would have to have some


rational basis to the State interest. 


QUESTION:  You've not given a rational basis


except to repeat the word morality. 


QUESTION: 


Is the rational basis is that the 

State thinks it immoral just as the State thinks adultery


immoral or bigamy immoral.


QUESTION:  Or teaching German.


QUESTION:  Well, that --


[Laughter.] 


QUESTION:  Maybe we should go through counsel,


yes. 


QUESTION:  Isn't the -- Mr. Rosenthal, isn't the


thrust of Justice Breyer's question that when -- when the


State criminalizes behavior as immoral, customarily what

it points to is not simply an isolated moral judgment or


the moral judgment alone, but it points to a moral


judgment which is backed up by some demonstration of harm


to other people. 


We -- we've heard questions for example about


harm to a -- a marital institution.  It makes sense to say


whether you think the law is enforceable or not.  It makes


sense to say that adultery threatens the -- the durability


of a particular instance of marriage. 


What kind of harm to others can you point to in


this case to take it out of the category of simple moral


disapproval, per se? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, part of the -- part of the


rationale for the law is to discourage similar conduct,


that is, to discourage people who may be in jail together 

or want to experiment from doing the same kind of thing


and I think -- and I think that the State can do that. 


People can harm themselves and still be -- and still have


it be against the law.  But they can take drugs and do


that. 


QUESTION:  Well, do you point to a kind of harm


here to an individual or to the individual's partner,


which is comparable to the harm that results from the --


the harm to the deterioration of the body and the mind


from drug-taking?  I mean, I don't see the parallel

between the two situations. 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, not -- not only do we say


that morality is a basis for this, but of course the


antecedents have raised that there may also be health


considerations.  I don't know whether there are or not. 


QUESTION:  That is not the State's claim in any


case?


MR. ROSENTHAL:  That's not the State's claim,


but I can't say that it's not true.  Obviously this --


this has --


QUESTION:  Did you read -- I don't know -- I


can't remember now who filed it, but there was one medical


brief filed on that subject and the argument there was


that, in fact, these laws are -- are directly antithetical


to health claim. 


Do you -- do you have any comment to 

make on that brief? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Yes, sir.  There was a law filed


on behalf of the respondents that took exactly the


opposite position. 


QUESTION:  So the issue was open, so far as --


as we're concerned that that would be your position, I


take it? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Yes, sir, for each expert


there's an equal and opposite expert. 


QUESTION:  But you're not saying the State of

Texas is doing this for -- to protect the actors who are


involved in this?  One can say the State is taking action


to see that people don't harm others or themselves. 


You're not suggesting that that's the reason for -- for


this particular law? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, I think Texas has the


right to prohibit certain conduct.


QUESTION:  But if that's the reason for it, why


doesn't Texas prohibit the conduct in a heterosexual


relationship?  I mean, it doesn't seem to be any harm


because if there were a harm, beyond moral disapproval,


the law would not be restricted to homosexuals. 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, because heterosexual


conduct is -- the same kinds of conduct -- and by the way


it's not distinguished, it's still called deviate sexual 

intercourse with heterosexuals. 


QUESTION:  But it's not prohibited? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  But it's not prohibited. 


QUESTION:  Yeah. 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  But it also can lead to marriage


and to procreation.  And that's -- and that's a legitimate


State interest. 


QUESTION:  But -- but procreation -- many people


with the blessings of Texas can have sexual relations who


are unable to procreate, so I don't see how -- whatever

the line might have meant in times gone, it certainly


isn't true that sexual relations are for the purpose of


procreation and anything that is not for that purpose is


beyond the pale. 


You can't make that distinction.


MR. ROSENTHAL:  No, but I think as a matter of


public policy, the State can make -- have -- can have


preferences -- and again it doesn't say that simply


because heterosexual people can -- can have deviate sexual


intercourse, the State approves it.  There are just simply


other sanctions that the -- that the State may imply. 


I did want to briefly distinguish this case from


your decision in Romer v. Evans.  And obviously the


distinction there was -- was that the Colorado amendment


sought to classify people based on their orientation and 

not their conduct.  And by so doing, they excluded a


certain class of people from the political debate.  Now,


on the contrary, Texas welcomes all into the political


debate and -- in the last Texas legislature, fortunately


our legislature meets only every other year, but in the


last Texas legislature, there was a hate crime statute


passed which made it a more heinous crime to make someone


a victim of crime based upon their sexual orientation and


it included all sexual orientations.  It included


homosexuals, bisexuals and heterosexuals, all, so I don't

think we can say across the board that there's some sort


of Texas policy that we're trying to overall discriminate


against -- against homosexuals as a group. 


QUESTION:  Somebody wants to participate in the


political process, run for political office who is


homosexual and the charge is made on the other side don't


-- don't vote for this person, this person is a law


breaker, there is a closer connection to Romer in that


regard, isn't there? 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, that would be true, if it


weren't that the historical fact that that's not in fact


true.  That there have been people who have campaigned in


Texas and have admitted their homosexuality and have been


elected to office. 


QUESTION: 


But the charge -- they could be 

charged as law-breakers. 


MR. ROSENTHAL:  No, ma'am, they can't be charged


as law-breakers for having that orientation.  They can


only be charged as law-breakers if they commit that


particular act.  And then, again, the State does not allow


any disabilities to come from class C misdemeanor acts. 


I'm sure it's obvious to this Court that the


issues of homosexual rights are highly emotional for the


petitioner in these quarters but equally anxious in this


Court's -- for this Court's decision are those who are,

number one, concerned with the rights of States to


determine their own destiny, and, two, and possibly more


important, those persons who are concerned that the


invalidation of this little Texas statute would make --


would make marriage law subject to constitutional


challenge. 


Then again, how far behind that can there be


other acts of sexual gratification brought for


constitutional challenge also.  There's already movements


to lower the age limit of consent for children engaged in


sexual practices.  And there are secondary effects,


particularly in Texas law, where we are a common law state


and the common law is based upon community property shared


by both spouses.  The State of Texas is asking this Court


to be mindful of the far-reaching aspects of your decision 

in this case, so as not to disenfranchise 23 million


Texans who ought to have the right to participate in


questions having to do with moral issues.  We ask you to


affirm the Texas Court of Appeals.

just have a couple of points to make.  I thought I might


address this question of what it was that we proved in the


record below and whether or not we have, as a result,


adequately teed up the issues before the Court without


having put into evidence directly that this was a


noncoercive act or a noncommercial act or a nonpublic act


or things of that kind. 


Our position is that this is a criminal statute


that has only two elements, it has a list of particular


kinds of sexual intimacy that you're not allowed to engage


in and it they have to prove as well that the two people


involved were of the same sex. 


There was a complaint that was filed that listed


those two elements.  My clients pleaded no contest to


those two elements but said that there is an insufficient 

basis for imposing criminal liability on them, because,


first of all, they invade fundamental rights and second of


all, because the law is discriminatory, while it's


supposedly got a moral basis, it's a discriminatory


morality, a morality imposed only on one category of


couples in a State which does not penalize in any way


adultery, fornication or sodomy for people of -- of


couples that are different sex. 


Those are the arguments that were made and -- so


our position is that that the statute is unconstitutional

both facially and as applied here, because the State


purports to impose liability based on those two elements


alone and that they are constitutionally insufficient


bases both for fundamental rights reasons and because it's


a discriminatory state.


The other point I thought I might just address


for the moment is the public health rationale which didn't


come up before.  Essentially, what the facts are -- and I


think this comes out to a large extent, it's undisputed in


the amicus briefing -- the issue is not briefed in here


because the Texas brief doesn't even attempt to make this


argument, but it is -- the facts are that if this was the


line between safe and unsafe forms of sexual intimacy it's


as if the law cuts right across it.  Regulating some of


the most safe forms of sexual activity possible, 

including, for example, lots of safe sex -- same-sex


activity involving women and leaving completely


unregulated all sorts of forms of unsafe sexual activity


involving different sex couples. 


So if there was ever a case of a law where the


fit is egregiously improper and insufficient to justify


the law under the rational basis test, this would be such


a case. 


Unless the Court has further questions, thank


you very much.
