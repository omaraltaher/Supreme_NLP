CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 01-309, Larry Hope v. Mark Pelzer.


Mr.  Jones.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG T. JONES


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. JONES:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


Under United States v. Lanier, the law was


clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity


when it gives officials fair warning that their conduct is


unlawful.  The fair warning standard is met when a rule


laid out by prior law applies with obvious clarity to the


conduct in question, even if the rule arises from a case


involving different facts.


The materially similar facts requirement of the


Eleventh Circuit is an unwarranted gloss upon the fair


warning standard, just like the fundamentally similar


facts requirement which this Court unanimously rejected in


Lanier.  It is an impermissible gloss because it


emphasizes similarity of fact over clarity of ruling.


QUESTION:  And what should be the rule that you


say was violated here?  If we write out the opinion, we'd


say the rule that the officer should have known is, and we

have to fill in the blank.  What is that rule?


MR. JONES:  The rule established by the Eleventh


Circuit's own precedent is that it is unconstitutional to


punish an inmate through the use of restraint, and


restraint is punitive if it goes beyond the point in time


which is necessary to quell a disturbance or immediate


threat.


QUESTION:  Does the include solitary


confinement?


MR. JONES:  No, Your Honor.  Restraint involves


total physical immobility coupled with the pain and


discomfort attendant to that.


QUESTION:  And what case establishes that


proposition?


MR. JONES:  Well, there is a --


QUESTION:  Any physical restraint is unlawful. 


What case establishes that?


MR. JONES:  Physical restraint, the precedents


speak of physical restraint to a fixed object.


QUESTION:  Yes, and what precedent in


particular?


MR. JONES:  Gates v. Collier is the first case


of a body of law which has developed in our circuit,


Justice Scalia.  Gates v. Collier was a 1974 Fifth Circuit


decision which was binding upon the present Eleventh

Circuit and it held that a variety of forms of corporal


punishment --


QUESTION:  That's my problem.  It was a whole


variety.  They didn't say that any single one.  I mean, as


I recall that case, there are a number of instances of


brutality against prisoners, and the holding of that case


was that that was cruel and unusual punishment, but I


don't recall that case saying that any single one of the


many instances that the case recited, one of which was


physical restraint, would qualify.


MR. JONES:  Your Honor, the Fifth Circuit


decision in Gates affirmed a district court decision which


specifically enjoined each and every one of those


punishments, and the fact that --


QUESTION:  And you think that amounts to a


holding that any single one of them would have violated


the Eighth Amendment?


MR. JONES:  Yes, Your Honor, if used punitively,


that is correct, and --


QUESTION:  But the court ordered stopping each


and every one of those measures.  Wasn't that the nature


of the injunctive degree, not just a combination of them,


but each one?


MR. JONES:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  This was not


a case where the court viewed the totality of the

circumstances and said that the conditions constituted


cruel and usual punishment and ordered the State of


Mississippi to build a new prison.  This was a case where


the State was specifically enjoined --


QUESTION:  Did the reasoning follow that line?


MR. JONES:  Well --


QUESTION:  Was the reasoning of the opinion, did


it examine each one individually and say each one


individually was cruel and unusual?


MR. JONES:  It examined a variety of practices,


and those practices were discussed in a subsection called


corporal punishment.  The fact that Gates involved


multiple holdings does not make it any less important in


clearly establishing the law, otherwise a case could only


clearly establish the law if it had a single holding.  The


fact that Gates v. Collier drew multiple bright lines as


opposed to a single bright line did not make --


QUESTION:  Do we need --


MR. JONES:  Yes.


QUESTION:  In this case, do we need to get into


the issue, Mr. Jones of what this Court's holdings amount


to on this subject, or are we just limiting ourselves to


the Eleventh Circuit, perhaps the old Fifth Circuit?


MR. JONES:  With respect to the underlying


constitutional violation, or with respect to qualified

immunity analysis?


QUESTION:  With respect to each.


MR. JONES:  Well, Your Honor, this Court has


never squarely addressed the constitutionality of


continued restraint as a form of corporal punishment.  It


has acknowledged in decisions that restraints can be


harmful.


yes.


QUESTION:  I suppose one would have to do that,


MR. JONES:  Yes, that's correct.


QUESTION:  Are you relying on anything beyond


the restraint itself?  I mean, in the facts that have been


recited, the facts include leaving the individual in the


sun without a shirt on, and not giving him bathroom


breaks, and pouring water out in front of him to taunt


him.  Are you relying upon those features?


MR. JONES:  Not as -- not for the proposition


that the law was clearly established, with regard to those


facts.  Those facts are certainly relevant on the issue of


the damages suffered by the 


-- 

QUESTION:  Well, do we have to assume that the


facts as alleged are true for purposes of deciding whether


summary judgment is appropriate?


MR. JONES:  Based -- Justice O'Connor, based


upon the grant of certiorari by the Court, the issues

raised in the petition, and the grant, I think that is


correct.


QUESTION:  I would assume we -- I gather we just


assume those are correct for purposes of evaluating the


summary judgment question.


MR. JONES:  I think that is correct.


QUESTION:  And the Eleventh Circuit decided


there was a constitutional violation?


MR. JONES:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And there was no cross-appeal on


that.


MR. JONES:  That is correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  So do we take that as a given, too?


MR. JONES:  I think that this case is like


Saucier, where the Court acknowledged that the first step


be the inquiry of whether there was a constitutional


violation made out by the facts.  That was resolved by the


circuit court.


QUESTION:  Well, that gets back to the Chief


Justice's question, and I'm wondering again if the Court


writes the opinion giving you the judgment that you seek,


isn't it necessary for us to say, a) this law was clearly


established, and b) it is a correct interpretation, a


correct exposition of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment


Clause, so we are -- it would be a rather odd holding for

us to say, well, this was established in the Eleventh


Circuit, but we're not telling you whether or not that was


right.


MR. JONES:  Well, I think, Justice Kennedy,


because the certiorari was only granted on the second part


of the Saucier test, that is, on the clearly established


inquiry, the Court could limit its ruling to the issue of


whether the law was clearly established and whether,


specifically whether the Eleventh Circuit applied the


proper standards in determining whether --


QUESTION:  Well, maybe Justice Kennedy is


suggesting that it's fairly included within the question


granted, that it's quite impossible for a judge to say


that it does or does not violate a clearly established


constitutional principle if he doesn't think that it


violates a constitutional principle at all, clearly


established or otherwise.  I mean, isn't -- doesn't -- the


one sort of wrapped up in the other?


MR. JONES:  Yes, Your Honor, and I think that it


is fairly included.  My point is that --


QUESTION:  I take it your position, though, is


that all we have to decide is whether the substantially


similar standard is the proper standard, and if we say no,


it's not, that's like Lanier, which was -- what was it? --


substantially identical, I guess, wasn't it, something

similar --


MR. JONES:  The verdict was fundamentally


QUESTION:  Fundamentally, yes. 


MR. JONES:  --in Lanier.


QUESTION:  And if we say that that gloss, the


substantially similar gloss was wrong, what you want us to


do is simply vacate and send the thing back, or do you


want us to go further and say, no, in fact, there -- we


determined that there can be no sovereign -- that there


can be no qualified immunity here, because if we have to


go the second step, then we have to get into the issue, it


seems to me, that Justice Kennedy has raised.


MR. JONES:  Your Honor, I believe that the


first -- the issue of whether there's a constitutional


violation is fairly included within the questions which


were granted by the Court.


QUESTION:  All right.  Now, if that's what we're


going to get into, so we will determine what the violation


was and then get to immunity with respect to that


particular violation, we won't confine ourselves simply to


the substantially similar verbiage, then I go back to my


earlier question, and I take it -- and I think you've


answered it, but I want to make sure I understand you --


for purposes of determining whether there's a

constitutional violation, you are not arguing, I take it,


that we should take into consideration the particular


circumstances of the day, the heat, the shirt, the


bathroom breaks, the water, is that correct?  All we look


at is the restraint itself?


MR. JONES:  Yes, Your Honor, because the conduct


of these defendants was to restrain this man as a form of


punishment.


QUESTION:  And some of the allegations of the


facts have been questioned, and one point was about the


lack of bathroom breaks.  There's nothing in the


pleadings -- the pleadings didn't allege lack of bathroom


breaks, and how does that get into the cases if the other


circuits didn't mention that either?


MR. JONES:  Well, I think it got into the case


because the respondents wanted to argue the case rather


than the law.


QUESTION:  But that had not been found below,


and it hadn't been even asserted in the complaint, is that


correct?


MR. JONES:  Yes, that is correct, except to the


extent that the affidavit of the plaintiff was referenced,


I think incorporated by reference into the pleadings.


QUESTION:  And the plaintiffs affidavit said


that specifically, that he wasn't allowed bathroom breaks?

 MR. JONES:  The plaintiff's affidavit is that he


was left on the hitching post for 7 hours, and the fair


inference that can be drawn from that is that he was


restrained for 7 hours without breaks, and there's


certainly no evidence rebutting that with respect to the


second incident, which he was on the hitching post.


The first incident he was on the hitching post,


there is evidence that he was given one bathroom break,


and he was taken down that incident only after 2 hours,


which in itself is --


QUESTION:  That, we got into that.  That is, I


think, disputed even as to the first instance because I


think that the State said he had been offered other breaks


but he had declined them.  Well, that's one thing, and


another argument that was made about the background, if


we're going to get anything beyond the hitching, that the


particular officers' names were not involved in some of


the worst aspects of that.


That is, the officers that are named defendants


here didn't tell Hope to take off his shirt, and didn't


pour water in front of him and have the dogs drink it. 


Those were other people who are not named defendants, and


you don't contest that, do you?


MR. JONES:  I do not contest that reading of the


record, Justice Ginsburg.

 QUESTION:  They didn't keep him on there for


7 hours, as far as we know.  Do we know that they were in


charge of how long he would stay there?


MR. JONES:  We do not know that, Your Honor,


although we do know that it was their expectation that he


be restrained indefinitely.  Findings in other cases


indicate that -- including the published case of Austin v.


Hopper, indicate that inmates were routinely left on the


hitching post for the remainder of the day.


QUESTION:  You say indefinitely.  According to


the prison policy, they were kept on until they agreed to


go back to the work crew without disrupting it, so that he


could have been released at any time that he said I'm


ready to go back on the work crew and do the work, right?


MR. JONES:  Justice --


QUESTION:  That's what the prison policy says,


anyway.


MR. JONES:  Well --


QUESTION:  Now, is the contention in this case


that he was prepared to -- you see, I don't understand


what they could have done.  Here is a prison that has a


policy of having work crews.  You don't contend that


that's cruel and unusual punishment, right?


MR. JONES:  That is correct.


QUESTION:  And the allegation is that this

prisoner refused to work in one case, and disrupted a work


crew in another case, and according to the prison


policy -- I mean, you have to do something when he does


that.  To take him back and say, oh, you know, you've got


to go back to prison, he says yes, that's exactly what I


want.  What was the prison supposed to do?


MR. JONES:  Well, Justice Scalia, in both


instances he was being punished for fighting.  He was


being punished for --


QUESTION:  Disrupting the work crew.


MR. JONES:  For an altercation.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. JONES:  An altercation which subsided at the


work site, which was miles away from the prison property,


and after he -- in each instant after he was restrained


and subdued, and whatever disruption he was a part of had


abated, he was put into a van for 20 minutes without


incident, another 20 minutes were spent transporting him


to the facility without incident, he was then walked


without incident, without the necessity for the use of


force, to the post.


QUESTION:  And the work rules were not brought


up by the State.  The Eleventh Circuit said specifically,


we are not going to consider these work rules because they


were never put in the district court record as a reason

for the officer's behavior in question.


MR. JONES:  That is correct, Justice Ginsburg,


and if they were in the record, the evidence would also be


they were not followed, which was also consistent with the


finding of the Middle District of Alabama in the case of


Austin v. Hopper.


QUESTION:  Quickly, what are we supposed to take


as the fact?  Do we take the fact in the second affidavit


of Larry Hope?


MR. JONES:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Okay.  There's nothing about bathroom


breaks in that.


MR. JONES:  That is correct, but the critical


time element here is the time it took them between the


time that the disruption had abated and the time that they


decided to punish him for past conduct which had occurred


an hour earlier and 10 miles away.  That is the critical


time element, not the amount of time --


QUESTION:  You say it's critical.  Why is that


critical?  I mean, must they decide to punish him


instantaneously or never?


MR. JONES:  It's critical, Your Honor, because


restraint is not a proper form of punishment under those


circumstances.  They can suspend privileges, they can take


away TV --

 QUESTION:  You say no kind of restraint is


permissible?


MR. JONES:  Not as a form of punishment.  If


they need to restrain him to maintain order and discipline


at the scene of exigent circumstances, that's perfectly


proper.


QUESTION:  Or to make him go back to work.  You


say that that issue is not in this case.  You say that


there's not in this case the fact, contended by the State,


that the only reason he was restrained was to get him to


agree to go back to the work crew, and that as soon as he


said okay, I'll go back and I won't disrupt it any more,


he would have been released.  You say that's not in the


case.


MR. JONES:  Yes, Your Honor, because if you


fight with five prison guards, you're not going to be able


to escape punishment simply by --


QUESTION:  So we should leave open -- even if we


decide in your favor, you want us to leave open the


question of whether this prison could follow the policy


that it has in effect, namely, only restraining people


this way as a means of inducing them to go back to the


work crew.  That would be left open.


MR. JONES:  Yes, Your Honor.  We're not


attacking the policy.  We're attacking the conduct which

Mr. Schlick, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. SCHLICK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


An official is immune from personal liability


for violating Federal rights unless the violation would


have been clear to a reasonable officer.  Where, as here,


the governing legal standard does not itself establish a


violation, the practical inquiry would be whether the


violation was established by case law is not


distinguishable in a fair way.


QUESTION:  What, in your view, is the governing


legal standard that you just referred to?


MR. SCHLICK:  The overarching standard would be


the Harlow v. Fitzgerald, where the law was clearly


established.  The --


QUESTION:  Well, I thought -- you're not


talking, then, about a substantive standard?


MR. SCHLICK:  In that, in the particular context

where one looks to case law, this Court's decision in

appropriate gloss as well.  Now --


QUESTION:  I mean, we start with a prohibition


for substantive law, the prohibition against cruel and


unusual punishment.  Then how do we work ourselves down


from there, or up from there, whatever you want to call


it?


MR. SCHLICK:  Yes, Your Honor.  We would urge


the Court in this case to take the case on the terms on


which it was briefed and decided in the Eleventh Circuit,


that is whether the law they applied in the Eleventh


Circuit in 1995 clearly established the violation.  In


that context --


QUESTION:  Then we don't get into the question


of our own view whether -- what the law might, or the


result might be in this case?


MR. SCHLICK:  Even under that approach, the


first step would be to ask whether this Court's decisions


themselves gave clear notice, and the answer to that in


our view would be no.  It's only because of the Gates v.


Collier decision that these officers had fair warning, had


clear notice.


QUESTION:  So then the result could be one thing

in the Eleventh Circuit and another thing in the Fourth


Circuit?


MR. SCHLICK:  Yes, the -- it could be.  This


Court hasn't definitively decided whether, when it takes a


qualified immunity case, it should analyze the case in


light of its own law solely, or whether it should give


greater weight to the relevant circuits.  In this case, we


think it would give most guidance to the lower courts to


analyze the case as the Eleventh Circuit did.


QUESTION:  But what is the standard that the


officers should have been aware of, first in the Eleventh


Circuit, and then, assuming that we think we -- that this


case presents either the necessity or the proper


opportunity for us to say what the national standard ought


to be, what is the standard at a more specific level of


abstraction than Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause that


we should be dealing with?


MR. SCHLICK:  Justice Kennedy, let me address


the Eleventh Circuit first.  In the Eleventh Circuit, the


reasonable officer would have looked to the Gates v.


Collier decision, noted that it held that it violates the


Eighth Amendment to punish an inmate by handcuffing the


inmate to a fence for a prolonged period of time, or cell


bars for a prolonged period of time, or forcing him to


maintain an awkward position for a prolonged period of

time.  The reasonable officer --


QUESTION:  Even if -- do you maintain that the


issue of whether it was done only to get him to return to


the work crew is not in the case?


MR. SCHLICK:  Yes.


QUESTION:  We have to assume that he was just


put on there to punish him, and he couldn't have been


released if he had said I'm ready to go back to the work


crew?


MR. SCHLICK:  Yes, Justice Scalia.  The Eleventh


Circuit we think correctly explained that's not a fair


inference from the record as we must take it.


In the Eleventh Circuit, the reasonable officer


would -- could not have concluded that there is a


constitutional difference between handcuffing an inmate to


a fence or a cell bar and handcuffing an inmate to a metal


pole.  Accordingly --


QUESTION:  For purposes of punishment?


MR. SCHLICK:  For purposes of punishment.


QUESTION:  You have to add that.


MR. SCHLICK:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And you're content to have us hold


these officers liable when a few years down the line we


may find that the Eleventh Circuit's opinion was wrong?


MR. SCHLICK:  Your Honor, we don't suggest a

view one way or the other on liability.  We're simply


suggesting that to grant qualified immunity at this stage


of the case was improper.  That brings me, though, to the


second question --


QUESTION:  Well, I understand, but I mean, they


would be stripped of their qualified immunity even though


the Eleventh Circuit's opinion was wrong, and we find it


to have been wrong when we finally confront that issue.


MR. SCHLICK:  I think that suggests Justice


Kennedy's second question, which was, absent Gates, how


would the case be viewed, and in that situation --


QUESTION:  And don't you think we have to reach


that?


MR. SCHLICK:  No.  No, we don't think so, Your


Honor, because it wasn't included in the petition or in


the questions on which this Court granted certiorari, and


really it hasn't been squarely faced by the parties,


because the State is defending the Regulation 429 rather


than the facts that must be taken as true in this case.


QUESTION:  Well, it's not defending Regulation


429, according to you.  Regulation 429 as it reads says,


he is released as soon as he agrees to go back to the work


crew without disruption.


MR. SCHLICK:  That's right.  My point, Justice


Scalia --

 QUESTION:  So regulation 429 is not in the case,


according to you.


MR. SCHLICK:  -- is that the respondents have


briefed the case as if they were acting in compliance with


Regulation 429, which is not in our view how the case must


be taken.  Now --


QUESTION:  At least the case in the Eleventh


Circuit, because it wasn't in the case.  It wasn't in the


case before the district court.  It was -- in the district


court it was just restraint as punishment.  The idea of


this being a temporal measure to get him to go back to


work doesn't show up till the Eleventh Circuit, and the


Eleventh Circuit rejects it because it wasn't raised in


the district court.


MR. SCHLICK:  That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.


QUESTION:  So the regulation is not before us,


you're saying.


MR. SCHLICK:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. SCHLICK:  To answer Justice Kennedy's second


question, how would this Court address the issue if Gates


v. Collier did not exist, in that case, a reasonable


officer -- the question would be, what would a reasonable


officer -- what would have been clear to a reasonable


officer.  The reasonable officer could have made a

colorable argument that the appropriate analysis is the


deliberate indifference standard established by this


Court's decision in Farmer v. Brennan, that standard being


whether the officer was deliberately indifferent to a


substantial risk of serious harm.


The reasonable officer could further have


concluded that neither the May incident in this case nor


the June incident in this case presented a substantial


risk of serious harm.


QUESTION:  So you think deliberately indifferent


is a sufficient standard for the imposition of liability


without more specificity.  All officers must be aware that


their specific acts can be challenged under the general


standard of deliberately indifferent.


MR. SCHLICK:  Yes, we think it would be


sufficient to establish a substantive violation of the


Eighth Amendment, although as the facts must be taken


here, qualified immunity would attach, because there's a


colorable argument that the threshold was not crossed, but


I'd want to say that this Court has not resolved whether


it's this deliberate indifference standard or rather the


Hudson v. McMillian test, the excessive force test of


whether force was used maliciously and sadistically to


inflict harm, and that is an unresolved question, is,


it's -- that is that very absence of certainty that would

be most relevant absent the Gates v. Collier decision.  In


this --


QUESTION:  Suppose I think that I have to reach


the question of whether it would violate the Constitution,


not just whether the Eleventh Circuit said it would.  Do


you think it would violate the Constitution to make the


inmate stand in a corner, to immobilize him to that


extent?


not --


Honor.


MR. SCHLICK:  You would need to know more,


QUESTION:  To go stand in the corner.


MR. SCHLICK:  Not in all instances, no, Your


QUESTION:  So what makes the difference is, you


say stand in the corner, and I'm going to handcuff you,


and that's the difference between cruel and unusual, and


not cruel and unusual?


MR. SCHLICK:  The relevant considerations,


Justice Scalia, would be the degree of pain and the threat


to the safety of the inmates.


QUESTION:  It's not necessarily the degree of


pain.  Being handcuffed to some immobile object, any --


not much more than standing in a corner.


MR. SCHLICK:  The overarching question of


whether the pain was wanton and unnecessary would focus on

the degree of pain, the penalogical justification, and the


threat to the inmate's safety, so you would need to know


the facts that bear on those inquiries.


In this case, as I've said, the Eleventh Circuit


decision of Gates v. Collier was directly on point.  It


provided sufficient certainty for the officers here, and


it was correct in that as applied to these facts, under


this Court's decisions, there was an Eighth Amendment


violation.


QUESTION:  I didn't understand your last


statement.  You say, it would depend on the facts, the


degree of pain, the circumstances. I thought your argument


for the proposition that any physical restraint as a form


of punishment is bad.


MR. SCHLICK:  No, Your Honor.  That --


QUESTION:  You're not.


MR. SCHLICK:  It's the petitioner's position,


but not a position of the United States.


QUESTION:  Ah.  All right.  All right.  All


right.


MR. SCHLICK:  If the Court has no further


questions --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Schlick.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN A. FORRESTER


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. FORRESTER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


In the last 15 years, at least eight Federal


master judges and eight Federal district judges in Alabama


have read the law to hold that handcuffing a prisoner to a


restraining bar or to a similar stationary object does not


violate the Eighth Amendment.


QUESTION:  Have they discussed Gates?  I didn't


go to look at the district court opinions, though you


cited them, but did those opinions discuss Gates?


MR. FORRESTER:  No, Justice Souter, they didn't


pointedly cite Gates.


QUESTION:  Did they just ignore the pre-Eleventh


Circuit precedent?  I mean, how did they get by without --


MR. FORRESTER:  Primarily they refer to the


subsequent authority in Williams v. Burton and Ort v.


White, and I don't think that we can presume that they


stargazed and ignored it, or that they just thought that


case really had been largely superseded by this subsequent


clarifying authority.


QUESTION:  What was the subsequent clarifying


authority?  Gates was a specific injunction.  It said, we


won't use physical restraints or punishments.  What came

after from the Eleventh Circuit that modified that


injunction?


MR. FORRESTER:  Well, the proposition for which


petitioner's amici wish this Court to read Gates and say


that our respondents should have read Gates is this very


broad proposition that any form of restraint as a form of


punishment is unconstitutional, although that proposition


has clearly been narrowed not just by the Eleventh


Circuit's rulings and rulings in Williams v. Burton and


Ort, which indicated that certainly in an excessive force


context you could restrain a prisoner for a period of


time, but also by this Court's rulings in Wilson v. Seiter


and Whitley v. Albers, and the clarifying ruling in Farmer


v. Brennan, where this Court indicated that the fact that


a restraint was possibly objectively problematic is not


enough to create an Eighth Amendment right.  There had to


be --


QUESTION:  If we are assuming the fact as


alleged, as it was used here, not to quell a riot, not to


keep things calm in an interim, but as a means of


punishment -- because that's what I understood the


injunction in Gates was, not, you couldn't use restraints


in a temporary situation, but that you could not use it


strictly for punishment purposes --


MR. FORRESTER:  Well --

 QUESTION:  And that, as far as I know, hasn't


been modified.


MR. FORRESTER:  A couple of responses to that. 


The first is that the restraint was not used in this case


as a form of punishment.  Petitioner never alleged or


presented evidence that it was used as a form of


punishment.  That phrase does not appear anywhere in his


first affidavit or his second affidavit.  He simply says


that he was put on the bar, and our respondents put him on


the bar not to punish him, per se, but because he was


refusing to work under the regulation.


QUESTION:  But you didn't bring up the


regulations in the district court.  At least the Eleventh


Circuit said it was nowhere in the record.


MR. FORRESTER:  Well, first of all we think that


the Court's entitled to take judicial notice of it,


because it is the law, that you don't have to actually


introduce the law into the record, but on top of that, it


was always in the mix.  The district court -- the activity


log for the petitioner's first day on the bar is a copy of


the log that comes from the appendix to the regulations.


QUESTION:  What has that got to do with it, that


reg?  I mean, so what?  That is, his allegation is that he


was left for 7 hours on a very hot day with his arms about


over his head, standing up, and given no water, except

once, so there are 3 hours at least without any water. 


All right, that's his allegation.


Now, introduce any regulation you want, why


doesn't that create an issue for trial?


MR. FORRESTER:  Well, because, the Your Honor,


the most important fact there is that he could have gotten


off the bar --


QUESTION:  I don't see anything, all right, that


he said that was so, and I don't see anything where


anybody in the record said that was so.


MR. FORRESTER:  The regulation --


QUESTION:  So what is the regulation?  Did you


move, did you say -- did you say -- I don't see in these


papers in front of me, say that the reason we're entitled


to summary judgment is, it was ordinary practice to let


the person go off, and then you'd cite that, and here


they're following ordinary practice.


Now, maybe then they'd have to have replied, but


I couldn't find anything like that.  Where does it say


that in the trial court?


MR. FORRESTER:  No, Your Honor, we didn't say


that, but it was petitioner's --


QUESTION:  Then why isn't it --


MR. FORRESTER:  Because it was petitioner's


burden, as the plaintiff, to set forth the facts that made

something unusual that may be -- and you're saying --


where is this counter thing in the trial court?  I don't

thought there was no activity log of the --


MR. FORRESTER:  Yes, that's the first incident.


QUESTION:  All right.  The activity log, as far


as I see it, says nothing about what you're saying.  It


just says he was placed on a restraining bar for a fight.


MR. FORRESTER:  Yes, Your Honor.  It refers to


the two --


say?


QUESTION:  I've looked at it now.  What does it


MR. FORRESTER:  It refers to the two conditions


that are the conditions for using the restraining bar


under reg 429.


QUESTION:  Why don't you read that?


MR. FORRESTER:  Refusing to work and being


disruptive to the work squad.


QUESTION:  And what it says is, refusing to


work, fight.


MR. FORRESTER:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  That's the reason that they put him


on the bar.  Okay.  Now what?


MR. FORRESTER:  Yes, Your Honor.  Now, the

bottom of the next page -- unfortunately there's a


typographical error in this appendix, but it says, Annex A


to AR 119.  That should be 429, and we have gone back and


checked.  The actual copy of this log in the record says,


AR 429.


QUESTION:  Yes, and it says that right after it


says, restraining bar to be used only during daylight


hours, Annex A to AR-119, so -- now, what has that to do


with it?


MR. FORRESTER:  That refers -- that's actually


429, and that is the regulation.


QUESTION:  Okay.  Let's suppose that you're a


genius as a trial judge, and you happen to know that when


it says here AR-119 it means AR-429, okay.  Now, what it


said is, restraining bar to be used only during daylight


hours, cite, 429.  Now, how does that help?


MR. FORRESTER:  Well, reg 429 is what these


respondents were following when they put him on the bar,


and this petitioner has not alleged that when he was put


on the bar he could not have gotten off.


QUESTION:  Okay.  I'll take that into account.


My other question is whether or not it is the


case that any human being would know that it is cruel and


unusual to keep a person, if that's what happened -- it's


what he's alleged -- keep a person chained with his arms

over his head, handcuffed to a bar, for 7 hours, in the


hot sun, not giving him water but for once, so he goes at


least 3 hours without water.


Now, is there a case that would confuse what I


think would be ordinary common sense on that -- at least,


or tell me why that isn't ordinary common sense to think


that that is very cruel, and certainly an unusual thing to


do.


MR. FORRESTER:  Yes, Your Honor.  Let me preface


my response with one quick -- he wasn't cuffed with his


hands over his head.  They were chest high.  His own


pictures show that in the joint appendix, but I would draw


Your Honor's attention to a district court opinion which


is transcribed in the joint appendix.  It starts at --


QUESTION:  One of my pictures happens to show


it's slightly up here, his hands, and the others show it's


about eye level.


MR. FORRESTER:  And he's slumping.


The -- I would like to draw Your Honor's


attention to this district court opinion that is


transcribed in the joint appendix at page 81.  It's


entitled, Whitson v. Gillikin, and this was a 1994 case. 


This was 1 year before the events in this case.  Jim


Gates, who is one of the respondents here, was a defendant


in this case, and in this case the prisoner alleged that

he was put on the bar for 8 hours in 95-degree heat, which


is hotter than this case, was not given any water, was not


given any bathroom breaks, which has not been alleged in


this case.


The district court, or rather the magistrate


judge appointed counsel for this pro se litigant,


instructed counsel to go out and provide supplemental


briefing on the question of whether that circumstance


violated a clearly established right, and the court said,


I have done my own diligent search -- this is on page


89 -- the court has made a diligent search of the case


law, I requested additional brief from the parties, and


neither the court nor the parties have identified any


cases binding or otherwise in this circuit in which it was


found that the Eighth Amendment as violated in these


circumstances.


Now, we submit that if you have a learned


authority such as this reading the law that carefully and


not finding it in this manner, it would be exceedingly


unfair to hold our respondents --


QUESTION:  This is --

same.


QUESTION:  -- a post -- post Gates?


MR. FORRESTER:  Yes.  This is a 1994 case.  This

is 20 years after Gates.


QUESTION:  And it seems to me exceedingly


careless for the counsel who was appointed not to bring


that to the magistrate judge's attention.


MR. FORRESTER:  Your Honor, in 28 years since


Gates v. Collier, no Federal court of which we are aware


has ever read it for the broad principle that petitioner


now seeks to read it in this case.  It's clear in the


context of Gates v. Collier that the officers there were


employing -- were handcuffing prisoners to cells and to


fences for malicious and entirely arbitrary reasons.  They


had no valid penalogical purpose whatsoever.


QUESTION:  The more drastic episode in this case


was the second episode, and there you can't even point to


an activity log, didn't even write it up.  The State


treated it as though it didn't happen.


MR. FORRESTER:  Well, Your Honor, it's not clear


that they didn't write it up, and furthermore it wasn't


respondent's responsibility.


QUESTION:  Whose burden was it -- whose burden


would it be to show an entry in the activity log?  After


all, the prisoner doesn't -- is not the custodian of that


log.  Isn't it the State's obligation to bring it forward,


just as it was brought forward with respect to the first


instance?

 MR. FORRESTER:  Yes.  We attempted to find it,


and just couldn't find it, and these three respondents,


moreover, were not personally responsible for the activity


log.  They weren't responsible for keeping it because they


weren't the one supervising him, and they weren't


responsible for his custody after it was kept.


QUESTION:  They weren't responsible for how long


he was left on the bar, either.


MR. FORRESTER:  Correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Which makes me wonder whether it was


your burden to bring in the regulation or, rather, whether


it was the burden of the plaintiff to show that these


defendants, when they put him on the bar, knew that he


would be left on the bar for 7 hours, and if that was


their burden, it seems to me it's not up to you to


volunteer the defense which is in the public record, that


in fact, if the prison policy was followed, he wouldn't


have been left there for 7 hours as soon as he agreed to


go back to the work crew.


QUESTION:  But it's your position, I take it,


that so long as the regulation was in place so that he


could go back to work, that the State could legitimately


keep him --


MR. FORRESTER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- hanging to this rail for as long

clearly entitles him to regular water and bathroom breaks.


QUESTION:  But the allegations are that he was


not given water and not given bathroom breaks.  We take

those allegations as true for purposes of a summary


judgment motion.


MR. FORRESTER:  No, Your Honor, he did not


allege, ever, nor present evidence that he was denied a


bathroom break, and he did not allege that he was denied


water.  He simply said that during one 3-hour stretch


these two other defendant, nondefendant officers, who are


clearly not these three respondents, deprived him of water


and -- you know, in acts --


QUESTION:  -- certainly in the hot sun for 3


hours without water is fine.  That's fine?


MR. FORRESTER:  If it is being done because he


has refused to work -- and I would hasten to add, Your


Honor, this is --


QUESTION:  But we have nothing in the record, as


I understand it, to indicate that.  Your position on that,


as I understand it, is that's what the regulation makes


clear, that that's why they were doing it, but the


regulation is not on the record, and I don't see any basis


upon which a United States district court is required to


take judicial notice of every State's prison regulations


if the State doesn't want to put it into the record.


MR. FORRESTER:  Yes, Your Honor.  I mean, I


would note that even in the absence of the regulation the


district court didn't find his allegations in evidence

sufficient to make out a claim that would withstand


qualified immunity, so introducing that only makes the


case all that stronger, but I would hasten to add that the


Court did make a finding that he was put on the bar


because he was disruptive to the work crew -- work squad. 


That is the condition in the regulations.  He was not put


on the bar for a strictly punitive purpose in the sense


that petitioners are arguing --


QUESTION:  Can you help me with this, Mr.


Forrester?  The assumption seems to be in the State's


argument that if you restrain a person in order to -- then


choose the word, convince, coerce him to do something,


that is not punishment.  I thought one of the purposes of


punishment was rehabilitation, or corrections, as well as


deterrence and prevention.


MR. FORRESTER:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Why isn't this punishment if you're


doing this in order to have him comply with your command?


MR. FORRESTER:  Yes, Your Honor, it is certainly


punishment in the broad sense.  For instance, it is a part


of prison life.  We're not saying that it shouldn't be


analyzed as to whether it's cruel and unusual, but in the


narrow sense in which they are using it, and in the narrow


sense in which Ort v. White sought to distinguish


punishment from what it termed an immediately necessary

coercive measure, this requires --


QUESTION:  Yes, but Mr. Schlick, can I just ask


you about the case you called our attention to on page 89-


90 of the -- and there, according to the magistrate


judge's opinion, Judge Putman, in that case the plaintiff


was refusing to check out in his work detail, but then he


gave him the choice of either working or being handcuffed


to the security bar.  There's no such allegation in this


case, is there?


MR. FORRESTER:  Petitioner never alleged that he


couldn't have gotten off the bar --


QUESTION:  But you didn't allege that you gave


him the choice, did you?


MR. FORRESTER:  The petitioner bears the burden,


as the plaintiff, to say I could not have gotten off the


bar if I had asked for it.


QUESTION:  I must say, I can't understand why


that wasn't put in by the State.  I can't -- I cannot


imagine why the State did not raise that point, that he


could have gotten off the bar at any time by just saying,


I'll go back to work.  Why -- what's your explanation for


that?


MR. FORRESTER:  Well, it is a regrettable --


QUESTION:  Regrettable, it's incomprehensible.


MR. FORRESTER: -- litigation error.

 QUESTION:  Why doesn't the -- Ort, which you say


he's the magistrate on page 89 and 90, supports your


position.  Interestingly enough, that case is cited by the


Government in support of its position, and I suppose the


reason is because they make very clear in that case that


it was unusual to deprive a person of water, and in that


circumstance, absolutely necessary, and so how, in this


circumstance, was it necessary to do what he says they


did?


I was deprived of water, was teased by two


officers when I asked for water, on one occasion they


started to bring me water but ended up giving it to some


dogs, I was given some once or twice during 7 hours, but


that was not enough, and at one point during the hottest


part of the day I was left without water for at least 3


hours.


All right, so for a person reading the case of


Ort, and then reading that, you would think that Ort


actually supports the Government, not you, because --


unless, of course, there's some reason that behavior like


that, if it occurred, would have been necessary, so what


is the necessity, or what can you say about it?


MR. FORRESTER:  Well, I would hasten to add,


Your Honor, those allegations that you keep reading again


are not alleged against our three respondents.

 QUESTION:  That's, of course, what you say, but


what the allegation says is that it was your three


respondents.  In -- on -- in the affidavit what he says


specifically on that is, he says, I believe that the


officer who actually put me on the hitching post was


defendant Sergeant Mark Pelzer.  However, a report says I


was put there by defendant Gates, and an officer named


Mark Dempsey, and then McClaran wrote the report, and in


McClaran's reply he suggests he was there, and so I don't


see any denial here by your particular clients that they


were not responsible for this, and he alleges they were.


QUESTION:  Would that be your burden?  Is that


their burden to say, I was not responsible, or is it the


plaintiff's burden to say, you were responsible for not


giving me water?


QUESTION:  That's not there.  The language I


read was the plaintiff's affidavit saying they were


responsible in his opinion.


QUESTION:  Responsible for putting him onto the


post.


MR. FORRESTER:  We do believe it was the


plaintiff's burden, Justice Breyer.  The excerpt you just


read actually refers to the first day he was on the bar,


May 11.  The second day was not when Pelzer put him on the


bar, but it is no way clear from that that either Pelzer

or Gates, who it would appear put him on the bar, stuck


around after that.


QUESTION:  It's an important point for me.  I


still don't understand why coercion to comply with an


order by a restraint is not a punishment.


MR. FORRESTER:  We do think it's punishment in a


broad sense.  That's trying to make too fine a point.  The


point I'm trying to respond to is their contention


basically that there was no valid penalogical purpose for


putting him on the restraining bar, that this was somehow


arbitrary or retaliative, or retributive and not remedial,


which was the purpose.  The purpose here was to get him to


go back to work.  It wasn't --


QUESTION:  But he says, and we must take this as


true I think at this stage, I have no reason to say I'm


willing to go back to work because I never for a moment


said I wouldn't work.  They took me away from the work


site.  In one case I was having a fight with somebody, but


in neither case did I say, I won't work.  This was not a


man who said, I want to be back in my cell watching the


television and not working.


MR. FORRESTER:  Yes, Your Honor, but getting


into the altercation, actually getting to the point where


he had his blade raised and was ready to strike another


inmate, is certainly disruptive to the work squad, and

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Forrester.


Mr. Schaerr, We'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENE C. SCHAERR


ON BEHALF OF MISSOURI, ET AL., AS AMICI CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS


MR. SCHAERR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


We believe this case is controlled by any of


three common sense principles of law, each of which is


essential if this Court's qualified immunity doctrine is


to prevent the problems that it was designed to prevent.


The first is that where personal liability is at


stake, public officials shouldn't be expected to be more


adept at construing case law than the State court judges


whose decisions are reviewed in Federal habeas


proceedings.


Now, the United States appears to adopt a


standard that would be equivalent functionally to the


standard that this Court has already adopted in the habeas


context, and we think the United States' argument in this


point is correct, and in fact we believe the Court has


already come close to adopting that standard in the


Saucier decision, which said the proper inquiry is whether


the case on which a plaintiff relies occurred, and I

quote, under facts not distinguishable in a fair way from


the facts presented in the case at hand.  It seems to me


that is just another way of saying that the facts of the


two cases can't be materially indistinguishable.


QUESTION:  Well, let me ask you a different


question, though.  What's the conceptual difference


between materially similar, which was used here, and


fundamentally similar, which was disapproved in Lanier?


MR. SCHAERR:  Well, as I understand, the


fundamentally similar requirement required a much tighter


fit between the facts of the two cases than the materially


similar standard does, and I think --


QUESTION:  I mean, maybe you're right, but I


don't know that from looking at the two words.  I mean, it


sounds to me as though materially and fundamentally are


substantially similar.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  I mean, I --


MR. SCHAERR:  And not materially -- you got it.


QUESTION:  But it's splitting it pretty fine, it


seems to me, and wouldn't it be better, wouldn't it serve


clarity better if we in effect said in this case, look,


stop paraphrasing the standard, and just stick to the


basic standard, and that is, would it be clear to a


reasonable officer?

 MR. SCHAERR:  Well, it seems to me, Justice


Souter, the way you answer that question is, you look at


the case law, and that's what at issue here.  There's no


allegation that the text of the Eighth Amendment or that


any statute bars the conduct at issue here.


QUESTION:  So you're saying regardless of how


they paraphrased it, when you get down to the district


court cases, on any standard, they ought to win.  That's


it.  You're not resting anything on materially similar as


the right way to describe it.


MR. SCHAERR:  Well, I think it is important and


useful for this Court to make the link to the habeas


context, because I think that would provide greater


clarity in the law, and the ultimate standard under this


Court's decisions is whether official action violated


clearly established law.


Well, that's the exact -- that's exactly the


same phrase that's used in the habeas statute, and that


this Court has interpreted in Williams and Penry II as


meaning materially indistinguishable, and it would be


useful, and I think quite productive to apply that in this


context as well, and would bring greater clarity to the


law.


QUESTION:  But isn't that -- isn't it a concern


for the State court, because here we're talking about an

officer, and did he follow what was an Eleventh Circuit


decision.


MR. SCHAERR:  Right.


QUESTION:  There, we're talking about a Federal


court overriding a determination by a State court, so I


don't think the settings are similar.  There's a


particular concern that the habeas statute reflects, and


that is not overriding a State court's determination.


MR. SCHAERR:  Sure, but -- and I agree the two


situations are not entirely identical, but if anything it


seems to me the section 1983 context raises even greater


federalism concerns, because as this Court recognized a


couple of terms ago in Geyer v. Honda, litigation can


often be the functional equivalent of a statutory -- of a


statute or a regulation, and so what happens in the 1983


context, as illustrated in this case, is that courts


articulate broad rules that purport to govern the conduct,


the day-to-day conduct of elected and nonelected State


officials, and so it seems to me if anything the


federalism concerns are greater.


In another important way, public officials,


nonlawyer, nonjudge public officials are at a disadvantage


and that, as this Court noted in Saucier, and I quote,


public officials are often forced to make split-second


judgments in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and

rapidly evolving, unlike judges, who can take all the time


they want sometimes to --


QUESTION:  Yes, but wait a minute, this is not


split-second.  We're talking 7 hours here.


MR. SCHAERR:  I agree with that, Justice


O'Connor, but the standard, it seems to me, needs to apply


to the full range of official action that would be covered


by 1983.


QUESTION:  Yes, but you have to ask whether a


reasonable officer in these circumstances would have known


that what was done was unconstitutional.


MR. SCHAERR:  I think that ultimately is the


answer, and it seems to me the way you answer that is


asking the question posed in Saucier, of whether the two


cases are materially -- well, are -- whether there's a


fair distinction between the two cases, which seems to me


amounts to material distinction.


QUESTION:  If you're requested to advise the


correctional officers in your State as to the standard,


the constitutional standard they must observe with


reference to restraining inmates, and circumstances like


these, what is the standard that you tell them they must


follow?


MR. SCHAERR:  Well, I don't think that's clear


from this Court's decisions at this point, as the United

States --


QUESTION:  Well, they come to you, and you're


their attorney, and you have to figure out what we mean up


here.


MR. SCHAERR:  Well, at --


(Laughter.)


MR. SCHAERR:  At worst -- at worst I would tell


them they have to follow the standard in Farmer.  That is,


their actions can't be objectively cruel, but they also --


they also cannot act with a subjective awareness of a


serious harm to the inmates, and it seems to me that's the


key distinction in this case between Gates, or the key


reason why Gates is not controlling here.


Gates was decided long before Whitley and Farmer and


all of those decisions that made clear the subjective


requirement in the Eighth Amendment, and indeed if you


look at the Eleventh Circuit's opinion, there's not even a


finding of any awareness of serious harm that would come


to these inmates.  They just completely overlooked the


serious harm requirement, and so it seems to me Gates,


based on this court's current cases, Gates is easily


distinguishable, and can't be taken as controlling here.


Now, the second principle that I'd like to


address is the principle --


QUESTION:  Well, I don't see in Gates -- and I'm

reading from page 1306, where they talk about being put in

MR. SCHAERR:  Right.


QUESTION:  I don't see any requirement of


serious harm to the inmates.


MR. SCHAERR:  Well, that's right, and that's why


it seems to me Gates had been overtaken by this Court's


subsequent decisions and therefore was not -- was no


longer binding, even if you take it on the terms that the


petitioner was --


QUESTION:  What decision --


QUESTION:  Yes, what --


QUESTION:  -- of this Court do you rely on as


changing what Gates said?


MR. SCHAERR:  Well, Farmer added a new


requirement.  Well, not just Farmer, but Farmer and the


other decisions that preceded it added a requirement of


subjective awareness of a risk of serious harm.  Gates


didn't impose that kind of requirement at all, and


therefore once this Court's decisions made clear that that


subjective requirement was present, Gates, it seems to me,


could no longer be regarded as controlling in this


situation, even if you interpret Gates on its own terms.

requirement, you think the allegations here don't suffice?


MR. SCHAERR:  No, I don't.  At worst, the --


QUESTION:  That one would not -- a reasonable


person would not be aware that you couldn't restrain


someone on a post or rail for 7 hours in the heat, without


water more than every 3 hours?


MR. SCHAERR:  Well, I think the question is


whether the harm that you could foresee from that -- and


the record does not suggest that he was without water.  He


says that he received water only once or twice during that


7-hour period.  Lots of people go without water and food


for 24 hours.


QUESTION:  Yes, but also no bathroom breaks.


MR. SCHAERR:  I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  Also no bathroom breaks for 7 hours.


MR. SCHAERR:  There's no allegation of that in


his affidavit.


QUESTION:  Well, the court of appeals said there


was.


MR. SCHAERR:  The court of appeals made a


mistake, and this Court has the ability to review the


summary judgment record de novo, and it's not a long


record.


But that leads me to the -- to my second


principle, and that is that a public official shouldn't be

held liable under section 1983, or shouldn't be stripped


of his or her qualified immunity except on the basis of


his or her own actions based on reasonable inferences from


the summary judgment record, and it seems to me that


principle is well-illustrated in the Saucier decision that


this Court decided last term.


Indeed, as Justice Ginsburg recognized in her


concurrence in that case, the evidentiary predicate for


denying qualified immunity must consist of what Rule 56(e)


calls specific facts set forth in affidavits or other


similar evidence.  General allegations are not enough, in


the summary judgment context, even though they might be on


a motion to dismiss.


QUESTION:  Can I just ask you a specific


point --


MR. SCHAERR:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- because he's right about -- my


thing about the defendants was not June 7, it was, he


alleges it.  Is there any place in the record where it's


denied that these are the right defendants?


MR. SCHAERR:  With respect to some of the


activity, yes.  I couldn't give you the pages as I sit


here, but the burden is on the plaintiff to make that


record.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Schaerr.

 Mr. Jones, you have 3 minutes left.


MR. JONES:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


If the Court has no questions, we submit that


the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Very well.  Thank you,


Mr. Jones.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
