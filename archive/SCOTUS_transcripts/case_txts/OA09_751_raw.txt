 (10:02 a.m.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

first today in Case 09-751, Snyder v. Phelps.

 Mr. Summers.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN E. SUMMERS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SUMMERS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 We are talking about a funeral.  If context 
is ever going to matter, it has to matter in the context 
of a funeral.  Mr. Snyder simply wanted to bury his son 
in a private, dignified manner.  When the Respondents' 
behavior made that impossible, Mr. Snyder was entitled 
to turn to the tort law of the State of Maryland.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are we just talking about a 

funeral?  That's one of the problems I have with the 
case.  There was also this video that -- that your 
client watched, right, later, after the funeral?

 MR. SUMMERS:  There was a flier that was 

sent out prior to the funeral.  We have the funeral and 
we have what they described as the "epic," which was put 
on the Internet afterwards, which --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  Well, what does 

that have to do with the funeral?

MR. SUMMERS:  As the district court 

explained, and the circuit court followed their logic, 
and I think the facts at trial confirmed this, that the 
epic was essentially a recap of the funeral protest 
itself.  That's --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's fine, but it -- it 

does not intrude upon a funeral.  I mean, no.  You --
you either have two separate causes of action -- one is 
the intrusion upon the funeral, and the other is the 
harm caused by viewing this -- this posting on the 
Internet.  But I don't see how they both relate to 
intrusion upon the funeral.

 MR. SUMMERS:  Well, the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And they were just 

submitted to the jury as one big lump, right?

 MR. SUMMERS:  Well, we had the flier that 

was submitted, that was sent out before the funeral.  We 
had the facts of the funeral.  And, yes, the epic did --
of course, we focused on the personal, targeted comments 
in the epic when we presented our evidence.  But, yes, 
it was --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Suppose there hadn't been a 

funeral protest, just the epic.  Would that have 
supported the cause of action you -- you assert here?

 MR. SUMMERS:  I think that's a closer call.

But when we have the personal --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes or no?
 MR. SUMMERS:  I would say yes, because we 
have the personal, targeted epithets directed at the 
Snyder family.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even though it's -- he 

doesn't have to watch them?  They're just posted on the 
Internet.

 MR. SUMMERS:  That's correct, 

Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's his choice to watch 

them, but if he chooses to watch them he has a cause of 
action because it causes him distress.

 MR. SUMMERS:  Well, the -- he has a cause of 
action.  That doesn't mean he's going to win.  You still 
have the pleading standards, the summary judgment 
standards, and the motion to dismiss standards.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, why does he have a 
-- a claim?  As I understand it, after this case arose 
Maryland passed a statute putting time, place, and 
manner restrictions.  I read that statute, and it seems 
to me that there was nothing unlawful, nothing out of 
compliance with that statute, that was done here.

 It was at considerable distance.  There was 
no importuning anyone going to the funeral.  It stopped

before the funeral, the service, began.

 Am I right that, under the current statute, 

this conduct was not unlawful?

 MR. SUMMERS:  Justice Ginsburg, the statute 
wasn't in place at the time.  But there's a complicated 
answer to the question, because they were positioned 
about 30 feet from the main vehicle entrance to the 
church, and they rerouted the funeral procession so they 
were 200 to 300 feet away from there.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Didn't they -- didn't 

they stand where the police told them to?

 MR. SUMMERS:  Well, they -- they told the 
police where they wanted to stand, and the police said 
okay.  So the police didn't say, please stand here. 
They said -- in fact, they sent out a flier --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And they were there to 
the knowledge of the police and with the permission of 
the police.

 MR. SUMMERS:  It's true they did not violate 

any criminal statutes, Justice --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Is there anything to suggest 
that the Maryland legislature, in enacting that statute, 
intended to occupy the field of regulations of events 
that occur at funerals?

 MR. SUMMERS:  I believe the -- the Maryland

legislature made it clear that they didn't want people 
to protest funerals in general.  When you --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But they didn't prohibit 

it.

 MR. SUMMERS:  They did prohibit it under 

certain circumstances and in a certain --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Which this the case, 

which the facts here meet.

 MR. SUMMERS:  For statutory enforcement. 

But what we're dealing with here is tort law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, if that statute 
applies to any protest at funerals, protesting the 
Vietnam War, protesting whatever, your case involves, at 
least if we accept your version of it, a protest of the 
-- of a dead soldier who -- who is going to Hell and 
whose parents have raised him to go to Hell.  So simply 
to say you can have a protest within a certain distance 
is not to say you can have a protest within a certain 
distance that -- that defames the corpse.  That's --
that's a different issue, isn't it?

 MR. SUMMERS:  That's our position, yes, 

Justice Scalia.  And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You -- you knew just what 

was going on.  Do you suppose -- because this had been 
done before.  In fact, wasn't this the very same day

they picketed at Annapolis and at the State Capitol?
 MR. SUMMERS:  They picketed, yes, those 

three locations that day.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So they knew what the 

signs were going to be.  Could they have gotten an 
injunction, do you suppose, against this protest?

 MR. SUMMERS:  I don't think they could have 
beforehand because, although you said we knew what the 
signs were going to be, generally from their pattern I 
think we could guess what the signs may have been, but 
you don't really know what the signs are going to be 
until they show up.  For example, in this case, they had 
a sign that said "Priests Rape Boys"; they had a sign 
that said "God Hates You"; "You're Going to Hell."

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you could go into 

court and say the signs were this, that, or the other 
thing at the State Capitol, the same signs at Annapolis; 
they're going to use the same signs at this protest.

 MR. SUMMERS:  As -- Justice Ginsburg, from 
our perspective, the signs that said "God Hates You"; 
"You're Going to Hell" referred directly to Matthew 
Snyder, and we would hope and believe that the district 
court could enjoin those types of specific targeted 
epithets.

 If, for example, this was done at a public

park in Montana, logically I think you could conclude 
that it wasn't directed at the family.  But when you 
show up at a 20-year-old Marine's funeral and say 
"You're Going to Hell" --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did they have the "Going 

to Hell" sign at the State Capitol at Annapolis?

 MR. SUMMERS:  They had -- the majority of 

the signs were the same, yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Those particular ones 

that you mention, did they have those at the other two?
 MR. SUMMERS:  Yes.  I believe the only ones 

that they changed were they have a sign for each 
different branch of the service.  Matt was a Marine, so 
he --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So it sounds like the 

"you" is the whole society, the whole rotten society, in 
their -- in their view.

 MR. SUMMERS:  If we're forced to accept 
their view, yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's what they 
testified to.  Mr. Snyder's view, the view of the Fourth 
Circuit, was that these "God Hates You" and "You're 
Going to Hell" signs specifically referred to Matthew 
Snyder and the "Thank God for Dead Soldiers" -- Mr. 
Snyder certainly interpreted that as referring to his 
son, because after all Matthew Snyder was the only

deceased Marine/soldier at the funeral.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where did -- you said the 

Fourth Circuit found that those signs targeted the 
family rather than the whole U.S. society?

 MR. SUMMERS:  The "God Hates You" and the 

"You're Going to Hell" sign were the ones that the 
Fourth Circuit said they can avoid that issue, because 
they can simply say this was hyperbolic and protected 
pursuant to its interpretation of Milkovich under 
defamation law and then its extension of 
Hustler v. Falwell.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that the epic 
is relevant as an explanation of some of these arguably 
ambiguous signs that were displayed at the funeral?  For 
example, "You're Going to Hell"; "God Hates You" -- who 
is "you"?  If you read the epic, perhaps that sheds 
light on who "you" is.

 MR. SUMMERS:  It can shed light, but if you 

put this in the context of a funeral-goer, 
Justice Alito, what you have is -- it was a typical 
funeral.  Family members driving in and --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, yes, but the signs say 

"you," and the argument is made "you" doesn't mean 
Matthew Snyder; it means a larger group.  And then you 
have the epic, which is directed directly at Matthew

Snyder.  Doesn't that show -- shed light on what "you" 
meant on those signs?

 MR. SUMMERS:  Correct, and that's where I 

was going to go with that, Justice Alito.  The epic 
specifically referenced Matthew Snyder by name, 
specifically referenced Matthew's parents by name.  So 
in our judgment, and the defendants testified that the 
epic sort of explained, at least in their explanation, 
explained the funeral protest itself.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not certain that this 
is about the funeral.  I mean, I understand there was a 
funeral in it, but the First Amendment question seems to 
me a different -- possibly a broader and different 
question.  Did your client see the signs?  I gather from 
the record he didn't see what the signs were; he just 
saw tops of signs.  So he didn't read anything on the 
signs; is that right?

 MR. SUMMERS:  He didn't read the content.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So he hadn't seen them.  So 
how does -- how did your client find out that the signs, 
the tops of which he saw at the funeral when the 
demonstrators were standing with the approval of the 
police, 300 feet away -- how did he find out what they 
said?

they sent out a flier announcing they were going to 
protest the funeral.  They had Matthew Snyder's picture 
there.  They claimed they were going to protest at 
St. John's Catholic dog kennel.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Did they say in -- my 

question is, how did your client find out these very 
objectionable things on the signs?  How did he find out 
what they said?

 MR. SUMMERS:  He found out about the 

specifics of the signs --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, that's what I'm 

interested in.

 MR. SUMMERS:  -- by going to the family wake 

immediately following and seeing it on the television.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So now we have two 

questions.  One is, under what circumstances can a group 
of people broadcast on television something about a 
private individual that's very obnoxious?  And because 
of the funeral, you said that -- I accept that from your 
point of view; that is very obnoxious.  And the second 
is, to what extent can they put that on the Internet, 
where the victim is likely to see it?  Either on 
television or by looking it up on the Internet.

 Now, those are the two questions that I'm 

very bothered about.  I don't know what the rules ought

to be there.  That is, do you think that a person can 
put anything on the Internet?  Do you think they can put 
anything on television even if it attacks, say, the most 
private things of a private individual?  Does 
Maryland's -- does Maryland's law actually prohibit 
that?  We know it does.  And what should the rules be 
there?

 Have I said enough to get you talking?
 (Laughter.)
 MR. SUMMERS:  Yes, Your Honor.
 Right now the rule we're stuck with is 

Hustler v. Falwell for intentional infliction of 
emotional distress, and the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Your -- your claim is 

that Hustler was a -- Falwell was a public figure, and 
the Snyder family is not.  So I think what I got from 
your brief is you don't fall under that case because 
you're not dealing with a public figure.

 MR. SUMMERS:  That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Were you 

finished --

finish --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you can go ahead and 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Were you finished

answering Justice Breyer's question?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  The more you say about 

this, the happier I'll be, because --

(Laughter.)
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm quite interested.
 MR. SUMMERS:  The private, targeted nature 

of the speech, in our judgment, is what makes it 
unprotected.  So, for example, the epithets directed at 
the family would be unprotected.  If, for example, a 
person repeatedly put on the Web site that Mr. Smith has 
AIDS, whether it's true or not, essentially at some 
point in time, it might rise to the level of an 
intentional infliction of emotional distress.  There 
would have to be other facts combined there.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You -- so you have 

no objection if the sign said "Get out of Iraq" or 
antiwar protests; in other words, not directed at this 
particular individual?

 MR. SUMMERS:  Correct.  I don't think 

there'd be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So no objection 

there?

 MR. SUMMERS:  I don't think there'd be any 

constitutional impediment to bringing -- or the 
Constitution would not -- would bar that claim from

going forward.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So the intrusion upon the 
privacy of the funeral is out of the case then, right, 
because that sign would intrude upon the privacy of the 
funeral just as much?  That's not really what you're 
complaining about.  You're complaining about the 
personal attacks, aren't you?

 MR. SUMMERS:  Yes, Justice Scalia, and I 

think under a certain scenario, you could have --
regardless of the signs, you could have a scenario where 
the funeral was disrupted, and it was disrupted in this 
case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It was or it wasn't?
 MR. SUMMERS:  It was, Justice Ginsburg.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that -- that 
when the service itself began, the protesters stopped.
 MR. SUMMERS:  The police testified that, I 

think it was, about 8 minutes after the funeral started, 
that the protesters left the area.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Were they heard and 

deterred --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought that they had to 

turn in a different entrance?  Is that -- is that the 
extent of the disruption?

MR. SUMMERS:  Well, according to, I believe, 

all the witnesses, yes, they had to come in --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  In order to avoid the 

protest?

 MR. SUMMERS:  That, and they certainly took 

away -- according to the priest that was coordinating 
the mass, they certainly took away the peaceful 
experience that all private figures --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you wouldn't have 

objected to that if there weren't these nasty signs, you 
just said, right?

 MR. SUMMERS:  No.  I said -- I hope I said, 
Justice Scalia, that under the right context, just the 
signs alone -- if that's all we're saying, there's a 
sign out there that says "God Hates America," I don't 
think that we could have a claim there.  But if they, in 
fact, disrupted the funeral, I do think in some set of 
facts there could be a claim.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I'm trying to 
tease out the importance of the -- whether the person's 
a private nature or public figure -- a private person or 
a public figure.  Does it make a difference if I am 
directing public comments to a public or private figure?

defamation, we had the Rosenbloom followed by the Gertz 
decision.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, I'm talking about in 

terms of infliction of emotional distress.  If I am 
talking to you as a Marine, if you were a Marine, and I 
was talking about the Iran war and saying that you are 
perpetuating the horrors that America is doing and said 
other things that were offensive, would you have a cause 
of action because you are being called a perpetrator of 
the American experience?

 MR. SUMMERS:  I'd think there'd be -- have 

to be a lot more facts involved, harassing type of 
facts.  The --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you're saying yes. 

So public speech, speech on a public matter, if directed 
to a private person, should be treated differently under 
the law?  I think that was part of what Justice Breyer 
was asking.  Is that what your position is?

 MR. SUMMERS:  Public speech, even directed 
to a private figure, should be treated differently than 
as directed towards a public official.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  And under 
what theory of the First Amendment would we do that?

matter should be treated differently depending on the 
recipient of the speech?

 MR. SUMMERS:  Gertz v. Welch treated the 

public versus private figure status different, albeit --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That was defamation, 

wasn't it?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's defamation. 

That's false -- truth or falsity.  But --

MR. SUMMERS:  Correct.  Correct, but the 

problem is the only other case we have that deals with 
intentional infliction of emotional distress from this 
Court is Hustler v. Falwell, and Hustler v. Falwell 
clearly dealt with a public figure.  The States have 
interpreted Hustler v. Falwell as not applying to a 
private figure.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But have they done it in 

the context of differentiating between public and 
private speech?

 MR. SUMMERS:  Yes, there is an Illinois case 
that we've cited in the brief where it was specifically 
said it was a matter of public concern, and they said 
the plaintiff was not a public figure; therefore, the --
just you have to meet the elements of intentional

State cases.  I was talking about a Supreme Court case 
that suggested that we would treat -- we would treat the 
First Amendment and the right to -- to speak on public 
matters differently, depending on the person to whom it 
was directed.

 MR. SUMMERS:  I think Gertz v. Welch says 
that.  Dun & Bradstreet says you have to at least look 
at the context of the situation.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it always goes to the 

context.  Now, going to the context of this speech, do 
we look at the words on a sign alone, or do we look at 
the entire context of what all of the other signs said 
at the demonstration, to determine whether or not the 
speech here was public or private speech?

 MR. SUMMERS:  I think you have to look at 

the particular signs, because if you don't, anyone could 
come up with a public concern, because they could direct 
any type of epithets at a person.  In the middle of 
their paragraph they could say I'm for taxes or I'm 
against taxes.  And, therefore, the entire statement 
would be --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, in that case --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Summers, I'm a little 

concerned at your apparent acceptance of -- of the 
proposition that if one comes up to a Marine and says,

you're contributing to a -- a terribly unfair war, that 
that alone would -- would form the basis for the -- the 
tort of intentional infliction of an emotional distress.
 What -- what are the requirements for that? 
I thought that it had to be outrageous conduct.  Doesn't 
it have to be outrageous conduct?

 MR. SUMMERS:  It does, Justice Scalia, and I 

wasn't suggesting that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I mean -- I mean, why 
accept that as -- as parallel to what -- to what you're 
claiming here?

 MR. SUMMERS:  And I hope I didn't.  What I 
meant to say, if I didn't, was there would have to be a 
lot more facts involved to rise to the level of an 
intentional infliction of emotional distress case if you 
just told the Marine, for example, you're not in favor 
of the war.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What about the -- taking --
if you have an instance where the defendant has said on 
television or on the Internet something absolutely 
outrageous.  You show that.  You show that it was 
intended to and did inflict serious emotional suffering. 
You show that any reasonable person would have known 
that likelihood.  And then the defendant says:  Yes, I 
did that, but in a cause, in a cause.  And now -- in a

cause that we are trying to demonstrate how awful the 
war is.

 At that point, I think the First Amendment 
might not leave this alone.  But if it's not going to 
leave this alone, there's where we need a rule or we 
need an approach or we need something to tell us how the 
First Amendment in that instance will begin to -- enter 
and force a balancing.

 Is it that you want to say no -- no punitive 

damages in such a case?  Or that you would have to 
insist upon a particularly clear or a reasonable 
connection between the private part of this and the 
public effort?

 Have you thought about that at all?  Because 

that's where I am thinking and having trouble.

 MR. SUMMERS:  The -- I think the standard 

should be Hustler v. Falwell generally does not apply --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Hustler -- Hustler v. 

Falwell is defamation.

 MR. SUMMERS:  I thought Hustler v. Falwell 

was intentional infliction of emotional --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Intentional infliction, 

okay, good.  Thank you.  Go ahead.

MR. SUMMERS:  I think the rule should be 

Hustler v. Falwell generally does not apply to a private 
figure unless the defendants can show some compelling 
connection there, and if you --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Compelling.
 MR. SUMMERS:  If you -- or at least 

reasonable, rational connection.  In this case, they 
don't even claim there's a connection.  They just used 
this moment to hijack someone else's private event when 
they are grieving over a 20-year-old child's funeral.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Summers, Hustler seems 

to me to have one sentence that's key to the whole 
decision, and it goes like this.  It says: 
"'Outrageousness' in the area of political and social 
discourse has an inherent subjectiveness about it which 
would allow a jury to impose liability on the basis of 
the jurors' tastes or views, or perhaps on the basis of 
their dislike of a particular expression."

 How does that sentence -- how is that 

sentence less implicated, in a case about a private 
figure than in a case about a public figure?

 MR. SUMMERS:  Well, at least in Hustler --
Justice Kagan, at least in Hustler v. Falwell we had a 
traditional area of public discourse.  We had a parody. 
I believe the opinion went to great length to explain

that.

 Here what we're talking about is a private 

funeral.  I don't -- I would hope that the First 
Amendment wasn't enacted to allow people to disrupt and 
harass people at someone else's private funeral.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that goes back to the 

question that was asked previously about -- suppose you 
had a general statute that just said there will be no 
disruptions of any kind at private funerals.  You know, 
pick your distance, 500 feet, 1,000 feet, but something 
that didn't refer to content, that didn't refer to 
ideas, that just made it absolutely clear that people 
could not disrupt private funerals.  What harm would 
that statute not address in your case?

 MR. SUMMERS:  Well, the States have -- in 

the statutory case, they have the interest of penalizing 
the offending party.  In tort law, the State's interest 
is to provide a remedy for its citizens.  Under the 
Fourth Circuit's interpretation of these facts, Mr. 
Snyder has absolutely no remedy, none.  He's a private 
figure, a grieving father, and he is left without any 
remedy whatsoever.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We have other instances 

where conduct is lawful, meets all the terms of the

statute that's meant to govern protests at funerals, and 
yet there's an award of damages permitted.

 MR. SUMMERS:  I believe that the 

Hustler v. Falwell was a -- had several tort claims, but 
there was no criminal statute violated.  I understand 
that it went the other way because of the public figure 
status, but that would be an example.

 Another example --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, that was a -- I'm 
asking you for an example where -- a Federal case where 
the conduct was permitted by the statute, by the 
policemen there, and yet there was -- was a damage 
award.

 MR. SUMMERS:  Justice Ginsburg, I'm not 

aware of any case, but I think the -- if, for example, 
someone sued someone for defamation, there probably 
wouldn't be a statute that was violated so I don't -- I 
would presume --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm talking about this 

intentional infliction of emotional distress claim that 
you're bringing.

 MR. SUMMERS:  Other than Hustler v. Falwell, 

I do not have any Federal cases to cite to you.  The

all conduct that complies with the Maryland funeral 
protest statute is lawful?  If the Maryland legislature 
said this is the -- these are the exclusive regulations 
that apply here, so that if someone came up to Mr. 
Phelps at the funeral and spat in his face, that would 
not be -- that wouldn't be illegal?

 MR. SUMMERS:  Justice Alito, I don't know 

whether that would be criminally --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Because it's not 

specifically prohibited by the statute?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, it certainly 

wouldn't be because of the distance.  I mean, you'd have 
to be a lot closer than the Maryland statute allows to 
spit in someone's face.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Perhaps you would 

like to answer Justice Alito's question.

 MR. SUMMERS:  I believe that you could 
commit a tort and still be in compliance with the 
criminal code, Justice Alito.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Summers, can I -- can I 

ask this?  Suppose -- suppose I don't think you have a 
cause of action for invasion of privacy when these 
people were at this distance from the funeral.  But that 
was one of the causes of action submitted to the jury.

action, I suppose I'd have to say there has to be a 
retrial now.

 MR. SUMMERS:  Of course, this Court could do 

that, Justice Scalia, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you have to support both 

causes of action here, the intentional infliction of 
emotional distress and the invasion of privacy, right?

 MR. SUMMERS:  Yes, Justice Scalia.  But 
according to the Fourth Circuit, we agree that the 
Respondents waived that issue by not appealing that 
issue.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Waived -- waived what 

issue?

 MR. SUMMERS:  The invasion -- or elements of 

the invasion of privacy.  They didn't contest that we 
met the elements of the tort.  They -- they contested 
the constitutional issue, but not whether or not we met 
the elements of the tort.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, all right.  Okay.
 MR. SUMMERS:  Could I reserve the remainder?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARGIE J. PHELPS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MS. PHELPS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review 

please the Court:

 When members of the Westboro Baptist Church 

entered an ongoing, extensive, public discussion and 
wide array of expressive activities taking place in 
direct connection with the deaths and funerals of 
soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, they did so 
with great circumspection, and they did so with an 
awareness of the boundaries that have been set by the 
precedents of this Court.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Phelps, suppose --
suppose your group or another group or -- picks a 
wounded soldier and follows him around, demonstrates at 
his home, demonstrates at his workplace, demonstrates at 
his church, basically saying a lot of the things that 
were on these signs or -- or other offensive and 
outrageous things, and just follows this person around, 
day-to-day.

 Does that person not have a claim for 

intentional infliction of emotional distress?

 MS. PHELPS:  Any non-speech activity, like 

stalking, following, importuning, being confrontational, 
could indeed give rise to a cause of action.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Demonstrations outside the 
person's home, outside the person's workplace, outside 
the person's church -- demonstrations, not disruptions,

but saying these kinds of things:  You are a war 
criminal -- what -- what would -- whatever these signs 
say or worse.

 MS. PHELPS:  My answer, Justice Kagan, is 

no, I don't believe that that person should have a cause 
of action or would under your cases have a cause of 
action.  You couldn't give that cause of action without 
direct reference to the viewpoint, which is exactly what 
happened in this case.  And --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  My goodness.  We -- we did 
have a doctrine of fighting words, and you acknowledge 
that if somebody said, you know, things such as that to 
his face, that wouldn't be protected by the First 
Amendment.

 MS. PHELPS:  We agree that fighting words 

are less protected under the First Amendment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Unprotected.
 MS. PHELPS:  I will go with unprotected, 

Justice Scalia.  And if I may add this:  Fighting words 
require imminence, they require proximity, and they 
require a lack of those words being part of a broader 
political or social speech.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is -- is that so?  Do we 

know that?

 MS. PHELPS:  I beg your pardon? 

28


Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do we know that?  Is it the 

criterion of the fighting words exception to the First 
Amendment that there be an actual fight?  Certainly not 
that.  Is -- is it a requirement that there be a 
potential for a fight?  I doubt it.
 MS. PHELPS:  I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where -- where do you get 

the notion that it has -- that there has to be an 
imminent fight?

 MS. PHELPS:  I get the notion from the 
series of cases starting within 7 years after your 
Chaplinsky case with the Gooding case and on down 
through the Brandenburg case and on down --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which say what?
 MS. PHELPS:  That say that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The person was too remote? 

The fight was not -- was not imminent?

 MS. PHELPS:  The -- the definition, the 
working definition of "fighting words," is that they 
have to be words which by their nature are likely to 
incite an immediate breach of the peace and not occur in 
the context of some social, artistic, educational, or 
political kind of speech.

 And if I may hasten to add, Justice Scalia, 
these Respondents were not charged with fighting words.

The jury was not instructed to limit themselves to 
fighting words.  No element of the torts under which 
liability attached included fighting words.

 The words that were at issue in this case 

were people from a church delivering a religious 
viewpoint, commenting not only on the broader public 
issues that the discussion was under way in this nation 
about dying soldiers, about the morals of the nation --

JUSTICE ALITO:  But is it --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Phelps, there's no 

question that these signs and the signs like that we saw 
during the Vietnam War.  But you had the demonstration 
at the capitol, and you had the demonstration at 
Annapolis.  This is a case about exploiting a private 
family's grief, and the question is:  Why should the 
First Amendment tolerate exploiting this bereaved family 
when you have so many other forums for getting --
getting across your message, the very same day you did?
 MS. PHELPS:  Right.  So several pieces to 

that, Justice Ginsburg.  When I hear the language 
"exploiting the bereavement," I look for what is the 
principle of law that comes from this Court?  And the 
principle of law, as I understand it, is without regard 
to viewpoint, there are some limits on what public 
places you can go to, to deliver words as part of a

public debate.

 If you stay within those bounds -- and under 

these torts even, this notion of exploiting, it has no 
definition in a principle of law that would guide people 
as to when they could or could not.  And if I may --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Is it your -- is it your 

argument that the First Amendment never allows a claim 
for the intentional infliction of emotional distress 
based on speech unless the speech is such that it can be 
proven to be false or true?

 MS. PHELPS:  In --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that your -- is that 

argument?

 MS. PHELPS:  With a -- yes, Justice Alito, 
and with a little bit more from your cases, if I may: 
And not under an inherently subjective standard, and 
where you're only claiming that the impact of the speech 
was adverse emotional impact.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Well, Justice 
Kagan gave you one example.  Let me give you another 
example along the same lines.

 Let's say there is a grandmother who has 

raised a son who was killed in Afghanistan or in Iraq by 
an IED.  And she goes to visit her son's -- her 
grandson's grave, and she's waiting to take a bus back

to her home.  And while she's at the bus stop, someone 
approaches and speaks to her in the most vile terms 
about her son:  He was killed by an IED; do you know 
what IEDs do?  Let me describe it for you, and I am so 
happy that this happened; I only wish I were there; I 
only wish that I could have taken pictures of it.  And 
on and on.

 Now, is that protected by the First 

Amendment?  There's no false statement involved, and 
it's purely speech.

 MS. PHELPS:  Right.  And -- and it may give 

rise to some fighting words claim, depending on the 
proximity and the context.  And I would have to know 
what --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, it's an older -- it's 
an elderly person.  She's really probably not in -- in a 
position to punch this person in the nose.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And she's a Quaker, too.
 (Laughter.)
 MS. PHELPS:  Justice Scalia, let us assume 

that the grandmother had not done what Mr. Snyder did in 
this case.  Mr. Snyder, from the moment he learned of 
his son's death, went to the public airways multiple 
times in the days immediately before and immediately 
after --

you think the First Amendment would bar that cause of 
action or not?

 MS. PHELPS:  There would have to be a very 
narrow circumstance where it didn't, Mr. Chief Justice. 
That's my answer.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you think there 

are situations where a tort of intentional infliction of 
emotional distress is allowed, even for a matter of 
public debate?

 MS. PHELPS:  Not public debate, 

Mr. Chief Justice.  That is not the way I understood the 
hypothetical he posed me.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I understood 

the hypothetical, that the person disagreed with the war 
in Iraq and the sending of American troops there.

 MS. PHELPS:  Right.  And knew that this 

elderly woman was the grandmother of a soldier.  And I 
would ask the question in the hypothetical, how they 
knew, which is why I was making reference to what Mr. 
Snyder did.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The person selects 

the grandmother because he thinks that will give maximum 
publicity to his views.  Now, is -- does the First 
Amendment bar that cause of action or not?

 MS. PHELPS:  If the grandmother entered the 

public discussion, the First Amendment bars it.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, no --

Justice -- Justice Alito posed, the grandmother was 
returning from the grave of her grandson.  She didn't 
enter the public discussion at all.  So I'm anxious to 
determine whether in those circumstances you think the 
First Amendment allows that cause of action or not.

 MS. PHELPS:  I'm reluctant to say that it 

does not, Mr. Chief Justice.  However --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you gave the answer 

before about -- you said stalking.

 MS. PHELPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't this comparable to 

stalking?

 MS. PHELPS:  And that's what I was trying to 

liken it to, and that's what it sounds more like to me.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you think it 

satisfies the normal tort or law against stalking for 
someone to come up to an individual and engage in 
discussion?  I thought a lot more was required.

MS. PHELPS:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I 
would not file that claim for that person, for that 
elderly grandmother.  I am not prepared, without knowing 
more, to say absolutely there could be no cause of 
action.  What I am prepared to say is there was 
absolutely much more than that in this case.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if that -- if that's a 

possibility there's a claim there, then what 
distinguishes that from this case?

 Now, I thought you were beginning to say 
that my hypothetical is different because Mr. Snyder 
made his son into a public figure, and the question I 
wanted to ask in that connection is whether every 
bereaved family member who provides information to a 
local newspaper for an obituary thereby makes the 
deceased person a public figure?

 MS. PHELPS:  Not the deceased person, 

Justice Alito.  We don't allege that the young man dead 
was a public figure.  We do --

JUSTICE ALITO:  But if the grandmother 

called up the local paper and said:  Let me tell you 
something about my grandson --
MS. PHELPS:  Yes.

and I've gotten Congressman Murtha on the phone and 
talked about this situation, and I'm against the war? 
And then proceeded to repeat that question in the public 
airwaves repeatedly, then a little church where the 
servants of God are found say, we have an answer to your 
question that you put in the public airwaves, and our 
answer is you have got to stop sinning if you want this 
trauma to stop happening --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But Your response --
your response to Justice Alito is dwelling on the facts 
of this particular case.

 MS. PHELPS:  Yes, sir.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm interested in 
knowing what your position is on the broader question. 
Can you imagine a circumstance where this same type of 
discussion is directed at an individual and yet would 
give rise to the tort of emotional distress?
 MS. PHELPS:  Yes, I can imagine,

Mr. Chief Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry -- can or 

cannot?

 MS. PHELPS:  I can.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can.
 MS. PHELPS:  I can imagine that there could 
be a circumstance, a hypothetical, where there was not 
this level of involvement, and it was out of the blue 
and it was "up close," if I may use the term, 
confrontational.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So if you 

recognize that there can be a tort of emotional distress 
in circumstances like that, isn't that the factual 
question of whether it rises to that level of 
outrageousness, which is part of the tort for the jury?

 MS. PHELPS:  I don't agree with that, 

Mr. Chief Justice, because you've now taken an 
inherently subjective standard with the absence of any 
of these non-speech misbehaviors.  And now you are back 
to only -- the only barrier between a person and their 
First Amendment right to robust public debate, including 
this Court has said, outrageous statements --

MS. PHELPS:  -- with just that subjectively 

inherent standard and that subjective statement of 
emotional impact.  This Court has said repeatedly --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does it make a 

difference --

MS. PHELPS:  -- we won't let that go.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does it make a 

difference, which seems to me to be the case here, that 
Mr. Snyder was selected not because of who he was, but 
because it was a way to get maximum publicity for your 
client's particular message?

 MS. PHELPS:  That is not accurate, 

Mr. Chief Justice, with due respect.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, assuming it is 

accurate, does that make a difference?

 MS. PHELPS:  The -- the motive of the 

speaker to get maximum exposure, which every public 
speaker pines for, looks for, strives for, and is 
entitled to -- does not change the legal principle 
that's at play.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it might 

affect whether or not the selection inflicts emotional 
distress for a reason unconnected with the individual 
who is the subject of emotional distress.

 MS. PHELPS:  Well, if --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In other words, if 

the person is selected because, as I indicated, it gives 
maximum publicity, rather than because of a particular 
connection to the matter of public debate, I wonder if 
that makes a difference.

 MS. PHELPS:  I think it makes a difference 
when you are looking at what role the plaintiff had in 
that public discussion and how tied the words that they 
seek to punish are to his role in that public 
discussion.  I think that's how you get to the point --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Ms. Phelps, let's say 
that we disagree with you as to whether Mr. Snyder had 
at all injected himself into this controversy.  Or let's 
take a case where it's clear that the father of the 
fallen soldier had not injected himself, had not called 
any newspapers, had not said anything to anybody, but a 
group knew that this funeral was taking place and was 
there with the same signs, with the same -- are you --
are you saying that that makes the difference?  That 
there, there would be a claim?

 MS. PHELPS:  I'm -- I'm saying it does make 

a difference, and no -- but no, there would not be a 
claim there in my opinion because --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So it's not a difference 

that matters.

MS. PHELPS:  It is a difference that matters 
in some measure, I believe, Justice Kagan, in this wise: 
I believe that the umbrella of protection under the 
First Amendment that this Court has established firmly 
is speech on public issues.  Sometimes you get under 
that umbrella because it's a public official or it's a 
public figure, but the umbrella that you give the 
protection for is speech on public issues.

 Now, when a plaintiff comes to your Court 

and says, I want $11 million from a little church 
because they came forth with some preaching I didn't 
like, I think it does make a difference for the Court to 
look closely at what role did that man have in that 
public discussion.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But your argument depends on 

the proposition that this is speech on a matter of 
public concern; is that correct?

 MS. PHELPS:  Absolutely, Justice Alito.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  So let me -- let me give you 

this example.  Suppose someone believes that 
African-Americans are inferior, they are inherently 
inferior, and they are really a bad influence on this 
country.  And so a person comes up to an 
African-American and starts berating that person with 
racial hatred.

Now, is that -- this is just any old person 
on -- any old African-American on the street.  That's a 
matter of public concern?

 MS. PHELPS:  I think the issue of race is a 

matter of public concern.  I think approaching an 
individual up close and in their grill to berate them 
gets you out of the zone of protection, and we would 
never do that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that simply --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That simply points out 

that all of us in a pluralistic society have components 
to our identity; we're Republicans or Democrats, we're 
Christians or atheists, we're single or married, we're 
old or young.  Any one of those things you could turn 
into a public issue and follow a particular person 
around, making that person the target of your comments, 
and, in your view, because this gives you maximum 
publicity, the more innocent, the more removed the 
person is, the greater the impact -- the Justice Alito 
hypothetical in -- in the grandmother case.

 So I -- I think -- I think your -- your 

public concern issue may -- may not be a limiting factor 
in cases where there is an outrageous conduct and where 
there should be a tort.

MS. PHELPS:  Well, but, again, this Court 

has given substantial, longstanding protection to speech 
on public issues.  And how could it be gainsaid that the 
dying soldiers is not on the lips of everyone in this 
country?  And it is a matter of great public interest 
and why they are dying, and how God is dealing with this 
nation.  Were you to consult the Joint Appendix and see 
that at the very same funeral, right outside the front 
door of the church, were people with flags and signs 
articulating the "God bless America" viewpoint, and so 
this little church --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But your position is that 
you can take this and you can follow any citizen around 
at any point?  That -- that was the thrust of the 
questions from Justice Kagan.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and Justice Alito, 
and it seems to me that there -- you should help us in 
finding some line there.

Justice Kennedy, and I am pleased to do that because we 
don't do follow-around in this church.  We were a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But in the -- but the 

hypotheticals point out that there can be an intentional 
infliction of emotional distress action for certain 
harassing conduct.

 MS. PHELPS:  For harassing conduct, not for 

speech.  Not for public speech, Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But torts and crimes are 

committed with words all the time.

 MS. PHELPS:  I agree with that.  And there 

has never been any allegation in this case that the 
words of the Westboro Baptist Church were in any 
category of low-value or less protected speech.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's talk 

about subjectively.  You're concerned about -- surely 
fighting words is -- you know, whether something is a 
fighting word, that's a very subjective call, isn't it?
 MS. PHELPS:  I believe that your cases give 

some good light on that, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't think it's 

subjective?

 MS. PHELPS:  There may be in some people's 

mind an element of subjectivity.  My 20 years of --

outrageous statement is -- is very much different from 
what's a fighting word?  I don't see the difference.
 Besides which, isn't it the case that in 

order to recover for the tort of intentional infliction 
of emotional injury, you have to substantiate the injury 
with some physical manifestation, which the plaintiff 
here had?

 And, my goodness, for fighting words, you 
don't even need that.  You can just say, these words 
angered me to the degree that I would have been inclined 
to fight.  At least for this tort, you have to have 
physical manifestations.

 Why isn't that a very objective standard?
 MS. PHELPS:  Well, because the Court said it 

was inherently subjective in the Falwell case.  And I 
think that the language that Justice Kagan brought 
forth, and there's a few more paragraphs that follow, 
identify why it's inherently subjective.

 And the way this case was tried identifies 

why it's inherently subjective, where although two signs 
and then three were identified as actionable by a 
strange reading of those words, all of the preachments 
of Westboro Baptist Church, including all of the signs 
at that picket, all of the signs at other pickets, and 
all their doctrines went to a jury with that inherent --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So your point depends --

standard.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- depends upon the 

proposition that what is outrageous is more subjective 
than what is fighting words, right?

 MS. PHELPS:  Well, Justice Scalia, I must 

hasten to say this:  I am not a fan of the fighting 
words doctrine.  I do think it has problems.  I just 
don't think it applies in this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The Court has made that a 

very narrow category, hasn't it?  I mean, we have not 
allowed the fighting words -- you say that to me and I'm 
immediately going to punch you in the nose, because I 
have -- it's an instinctive reaction.

 I think the Court has rejected spreading 

fighting words beyond that.

 MS. PHELPS:  And especially not to where 

there's just emotional injury.  That's where I 
particularly think, although Chaplinsky would have 
suggested in some broad language you would go that way, 
you have not gone that way in any of the cases.  And 
again I have to reiterate, you have required immediacy 
and intent.

 Whether a fight ensues or not, I do

understand that hasn't been pinned down as a 
requirement.  But in intent, it's your purpose, is to 
mix it up with somebody, not to go out and say:  Nation, 
hear this little church.  If you want them to stop 
dying, stop sinning.

 That's the only purpose of this little 
church.  A thousand feet away could not possibly be 
fighting words.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  We are still worried about 
the statements on television and on the Internet and the 
knowledge there.  And I'm not -- I'm starting -- I'm 
trying to get the same answer from you I was trying from 
your colleague.

 Brandeis said that the right to be let alone 
is the most important, and so he must have been thinking 
there could be a tort there for interference with 
privacy, and the First Amendment doesn't stop State tort 
laws in appropriate circumstances.

 MS. PHELPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And emotional injury, 
deliberately inflicted, could be one.  All right. 
Now -- and I think it is one.  But I see that in some 
instances that could be abused to prevent somebody from 
getting out a public message, and, therefore, I'm 
looking for a line.

Now, let me suggest a couple.  See what you 

think.  Maybe you can think of some others.

 You could have a judge make the decision, 

since the First Amendment is involved, not the jury, and 
the judge could say whether in this instance it was 
reasonable for the defendant to think that it was 
important to interfere with the emotional life of that 
individual.

 You could say if that was so, there will 

still be no -- there would be no punitive damages. 
There could be ordinary damages.

 You could remove all protection from the 

defendant in an instance where the defendant nonetheless 
knew, actually knew, that they were going to cause an 
individual who's private severe injury, emotional 
injury, irrespective of their public message.

 So what I'm doing is suggesting a number of 

thoughts of ways of trying to do what I'm trying to 
accomplish, to allow this tort to exist --

MS. PHELPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- but not allow the 

existence of it to interfere with an important public 
message where that is a reasonable thing to do.

 Now, maybe this is impossible, this task. 

But I'd like your thoughts on it.

MS. PHELPS:  Thank you, Justice Breyer.  And 

I'm taking that we are speaking now of the intrusion 
claim, and I believe that I could offer you a compare 
and contrast two extremes that may help us here.

 On the one hand, you have a body of law that 

comes under the heading of captive audience.  And you 
can go into that body of law and read all those cases in 
one sitting, so to speak, from which you would conclude 
that it is very narrow, it is very limited, and there 
must be some actual physical sound, sight, intrusion, if 
you're talking about invasion of privacy.

 At the other extreme, for a compare and 

contrast, is what they seek in this case, what the trial 
judge gave them in this case, which is:  In an 
unspecified period of time that each individual will 
call their mourning period, no one, at any time, any 
place, any manner, may say any word that that mourner 
says caused me emotional distress.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why aren't the members of 

the family --

MS. PHELPS:  That would chill too much 

speech.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why aren't the members of 
the family of the deceased a captive audience at the 
funeral?

MS. PHELPS:  If -- if we were right outside 

the door like the other expressers were in these 
exhibits, they might have been.  Your body of law about 
captive audience, when you -- Hill v. Colorado, Madsen, 
Schenck -- that line of cases recently, taking the 
picketing, where they, by the way, specifically said at 
footnote 25, this isn't about content.  You've got to be 
up -- again, I will uses the colloquial term -- up in 
your grill.  The term I think the Court used was 
"confrontational."

 Now, you can't be a captive audience with --

to someone that you couldn't see when the test is --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I thought the targeted 

picketing of a person's house is not protected by the 
First Amendment.

 MS. PHELPS:  Focused picketing, per Frisby, 

directly in front of, can be regulated.  And even in 
Frisby, the Court --

JUSTICE ALITO:  What's the difference 
between that and picketing around the site of the 
funeral?

Because the captive audience doctrine, as fleshed out in 
those abortion picketing cases, what you were looking at 
was is it practical for the person to avoid it without

having to run a gauntlet?

 That's why you said images observable, the 
only objection you can have there is content.  Get up 
and close the blinds.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So it doesn't have to do 
with whether this is a -- what you characterize as a 
public funeral as opposed to a private funeral?  That's 
not the distinction you are relying on any longer?

 MS. PHELPS:  Not primarily.  I'm primarily 
relying upon proximity.  I do think that you could have 
a public event where there was not an element of 
vulnerability in the people going in.  You might even 
let them up in their grill.  I don't know for sure, but 
we don't have to worry about that.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I'm following 
your argument that the bulk of your speech in the epic, 
and even the bulk of your signs, involve public speech.

 What you have not explained to me is how 

your speech directed at the Snyders constituted public 
speech, or speech about a public matter, because you're 
talking about them raising Matthew for the devil, 
teaching him to, I think, defy the creator, to divorce 
and to commit adultery.

 At what point and how do we take personal 

attacks and permit those, as opposed to -- I fully

accept you're entitled in some circumstances to speak 
about any political issue you want.  But what's the line 
between doing that and then personalizing it and 
creating hardship to an individual?

 MS. PHELPS:  Right.  I believe, Justice 

Sotomayor, that the line is where it was in this case: 
When the father used the occasion of the son's death to 
put a question out in the public airwaves repeatedly.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if we disagree that 

that made him a public figure, if we view him as a 
private figure, is that enough to defeat your argument?

 MS. PHELPS:  No, Justice Sotomayor.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So assume 
that he's a private -- that the Matthews are private 
figures, and you did this.

 MS. PHELPS:  Right.  I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So explain to me how you 

are protected by the First Amendment.

private figure.  You have now made a public statement 
and directed personal comments at an individual who is a 
private figure.  Is that actionable?

 MS. PHELPS:  Well, I don't know, Justice 

Sotomayor.  I don't know that I can give you a 
definitive answer as you've framed it.  What I can tell 
you is that I think the Court would have great 
difficulty making a rule of law that whether you call 
yourself private, public, limited, whatever, you -- not 
the person you're mad at over their words -- but you 
step into the public discussion and make some public 
statements, and then somebody wants to answer you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, so that --

what -- what if -- did Mr. Snyder, the father, become a 
public figure simply because his son was killed in Iraq?

don't --

take out --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All right.  Well, 
let's just say he does nothing.  He does nothing other 
than bury his son.

 MS. PHELPS:  Right.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  He is then not a 

public figure?

 MS. PHELPS:  If he does nothing, we don't

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's because 

if he does nothing and it's not publicized, you don't 
get the maximum publicity that your clients are looking

a public figure open to this protest or -- or not?

 MS. PHELPS:  I don't know, in the context of 

a war, if I can give a definitive answer to that.  It 
was not an issue of seeking maximum publicity; it was an 
issue of using an existing public platform to bring a 
viewpoint that was not being articulated.  For 2 years 
this church watched --

JUSTICE ALITO:  And what if a parent is 

called after the -- he puts in the obituary information 
and called by the local newspaper and asked for a 
comment, and he says or she says, I'm proud of my son 
because he died in the service of our country?  Does 
that -- is he stepping into a public debate by doing

that?

 MS. PHELPS:  How -- by however you call it, 

Justice Alito, a church or anybody has the right to 
answer that public comment; that is our position.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Ms. 

Phelps.

 MS. PHELPS:  Thank you.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN E. SUMMERS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SUMMERS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Summers, could I ask you 

to go back to an answer that you gave to one of my 
colleagues when you were last up there?  You said that a 
-- a more standard antiwar demonstration -- "get out of 
Iraq," "war is immoral" at this funeral, same distance, 
same-sized signs -- that a more standard antiwar 
demonstration would be protected by the First Amendment 
from an intentional infliction of emotional distress 
suit.

 And I'm wondering why that is.  If you think 
that what is -- what causes the lack of protection here 
is the kind of glomming on to a private funeral, the 
exploitation of a private person's grief, the -- the

appearance for no other reason than to gain publicity at 
a private event -- if that's the problem, why doesn't it 
also apply to a standard, you know, "get out of Iraq," 
"war is wrong" kind of demonstration?

 MR. SUMMERS:  Justice Kagan, I say that is 

a -- one, it's a much closer call, and, two, I would 
look to the facts of the case to see if the funeral 
itself was disrupted.

 But that isn't the facts of our case.  The 
facts of our case was, one, that it was disrupted, and, 
two, that it's personal, targeted assaults on Mr. 
Snyder.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, suppose it's not 

disrupted and suppose -- and I know that this is -- that 
you contest these facts -- that yours wasn't disrupted, 
that they stopped when you started, that they were a 
sufficient number of feet away from the funeral and so 
forth.

 So we're just talking the fact that there 

are people who have -- who are appropriating and taking 
advantage of a private funeral in order to express their 
views, and they are in compliance with all the 
content-neutral rules.

 MR. SUMMERS:  I'd say that's a much closer 

call and not the --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But why is it a closer call?
 MR. SUMMERS:  It's a closer call because 

it's not the personal, targeted nature of the attack on 
the Snyder family that we have in this case.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So does that mean that now 
we have to start reading each sign and saying "war is 
wrong" falls on one side of the line, but "you are a war 
criminal" falls on another side of the line?  Is that 
what we would have to do?

 MR. SUMMERS:  I think that, generally 

speaking, yes, Justice Kagan.  The court -- the district 
court would have to look at the signs, as the district 
court did in this case, and determine which one he 
believed were directed at the family and which ones were 
not.  There was a comment earlier that all the signs 
were presented.  Well, all the signs were presented by 
the Respondents, not by Mr. Snyder.  So we --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I guess that that kind of a 

call is always necessary under -- under the tort that 
you're -- that you're relying upon.  The conduct has to 
be outrageous, right?

 MR. SUMMERS:  Correct.  And that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That always requires that 
kind of a call, unless the tort is unconstitutional, as 
applied to all -- all harm inflicted by words.

MR. SUMMERS:  Correct, Justice Scalia, the 
element of intentional infliction of emotional distress 
requires outrageousness.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that's true, but I was 

assuming a situation in which the -- a jury found that 
the "war is wrong" -- that a jury did find that 
outrageous, and the question was:  Were we going to 
reverse the jury verdict because we -- the First 
Amendment prohibited it?

 MR. SUMMERS:  Again, I believe that's a 
closer call, and I would say yes, if it's a general 
statement, does not disrupt the funeral, does not target 
the family.  I'd say that it's one -- a much closer 
call, and, yes, it's more likely that the Constitution 
is going to prevent that claim from going forward.

 The -- I see that I'm out of time.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Mr. Summers.
