CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 02-1593, BedRoc Limited and Western Elite v.


the United States. 


Mr. McCrum.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TIMOTHY McCRUM


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. McCRUM:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This case began in 1993 when the Bureau of Land


Management issued notices of trespass for the extraction


of common sand and gravel from private land in the Nevada


desert about 60 miles from Las Vegas. 


The central issue in this case is whether, under


the 1919 Pittman Act, the reservation of valuable minerals


included common sand and gravel that were -- that were


widespread and made up the bulk of the land.


Now, the purpose of the Pittman Act was to


develop the State of Nevada by granting private land to


citizens who made personal sacrifices to discover and


develop underground sources of water that was not -- that


were not previously known.


QUESTION:  It applied only in Nevada, did it


not?

 MR. McCRUM:  Yes, Your Honor. 


Now, Mabel and Newton Butler in this case


explored and found a -- a source of underground water and


obtained a land patent from the United States Government


in 1940.


As we've explained in the briefs, the plain


meaning of the words valuable minerals, as used in the


1919 Pittman Act, did not include the sand and gravel at


issue here because these common earthen materials in the


Nevada desert were not included in the contemporaneous


legal understanding of the term mineral when the act was


passed in 1919 and these materials did not have intrinsic


value at the time of the enactment of the act in 1990 --


1919 and at the time of the patent granting in 1940. 

QUESTION:  Does the gravel excavation take up


what?  About 16 to 20 acres out of some 500, which is the


total surface area or?


MR. McCRUM:  Yes, Justice Kennedy.  That's --


that's the approximate size at the time BLM conducted its


report in 1999 or so.


QUESTION:  Do we know, is that the sum total of


the gravel that's there?  Could they -- does it go on for


the -- another 100 acres or so?


MR. McCRUM:  We have photographs of the site in


the joint appendix of the case that show the area of the

-- of the land in the general vicinity to be essentially


the same.  It's common.  Sand and gravel is -- is pretty


much covering that whole general area.


Now, the Pittman Act's structure reserved


valuable minerals to the Government in section 8, and at


the same time it did that, it provided that those reserved


valuable minerals would be subject to location and


development by others.  At that time, the -- the


expectation of how this -- how these materials would be


developed, whatever was reserved as valuable minerals, was


under the 1872 Mining Law which itself applied to valuable


minerals.  So those were --


QUESTION:  Are you now -- the time you're


referring to is 1919 or 1940?


MR. McCRUM:  1919, Mr. Chief Justice. 


At that -- in -- in the act itself, it provided


for location to occur of the reserved valuable mineral


estate under the 1872 Mining Law.  So, therefore, it's --


it's quite important to look --


QUESTION:  Mr. McCrum, you left out one word in


the Mining Law.  It didn't say valuable minerals.  It


said, valuable mineral deposits, and there's a significant


difference between -- a lump of silver might be


tremendously valuable, but it wouldn't be a deposit if


that's all there was.

 MR. McCRUM:  Your Honor is -- is correct that


valuable mineral deposits is the -- is the language


referred to in -- in 30 U.S.C., section 22 of the 1872


Mining Law.  30 U.S.C., section 21 actually refers to


valuable mineral lands.  And those terms were really


viewed as quite similar by the Interior Department at the


time, and the question was whether a particular type of


mineral was -- was within the class of minerals that the


1872 Mining Law was subject to. 


And in 1919, if an individual sought to


establish a mining claim for common sand and gravel,


claiming a discovery of valuable minerals in 1919, it is


quite clear and certain how the Interior Department would


have addressed that in 1919. 


Interior would have quickly 

denied the patent and rejected the application of the 1872


Mining Law to common sand and gravel.


Now, we know that because we can look to the


published Interior Department decisions of the day which


were published at that time, as they are now, available


for citizens, as well as the Congress to -- to look at. 


And the repeated decisions from 1901, in particular,


through 1919 made it very clear that common earthen


materials, such as clay, sand and gravel, used for road


base, cement-making purposes, things of that nature, were


simply not subject to the -- the Mining Law.

 QUESTION:  Now, what would -- what would Land


Management have done in 1940?


MR. McCRUM:  In -- by 1940, the -- the Interior


Department had modified its view in 1929 and there said


that -- that sand and gravel could be subject to the


Mining Law if valuable on a site-specific basis.  And


under that modified view, adopted by Interior in 1929 in


the Layman v. Ellis decision, it confirmed the importance


of assessing the marketability on a site-specific basis.


QUESTION:  At -- at the time of the patent?


MR. McCRUM:  At -- well, the Layman decision


involved a -- a question of whether it was valuable at the


time of the patent in that case, which was a Mining Law


patent being considered. 


And then in 1956, the Interior 

Department, looking at the -- at the position that Layman


v. Ellis took, applied that in the context of a mineral


reservation, as we have here, and said in the context of a


mineral reservation, if it's to include these -- these


common materials, it can only include those materials when


there is value at the time of the patent.


QUESTION:  You say the Interior Department took


that position.  How?  Was that a -- a solicitor's opinion


or what?


MR. McCRUM:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.  That was in


a solicitor's opinion in 1956.  It's a solicitor's opinion

which this Court took note of in the Western Nuclear


decision in 1983 and -- and relied on.


QUESTION:  Well, Western Nuclear certainly cuts


the other way from your argument here today.  I didn't


agree with the holding, but that was the holding of the


Court.  It was under a different act, not the Pittman Act,


but certainly very similar.


MR. McCRUM:  Justice O'Connor, the Western


Nuclear decision did hold that gravel could be reserved


under the Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916, but


importantly, the issue of whether that sand and gravel had


to be valuable at the time of the patent was not addressed


in the holding of the Court, as the Government has


acknowledged in its brief.


QUESTION:  Well, wasn't that because the word


valuable didn't include in the -- wasn't included in the


reservation of Stock-Raisers Act?


MR. McCRUM:  It -- it could well have been --


that -- that could have been part of the Court's thinking. 


In -- in the Pittman Act, we do have an emphasis on the


term, valuable minerals, in the plain language of the


statute, and certainly that is a further reason why the


element of value is all the more important in this case,


both at the time of enactment in 1919, as well as at -- at


the 1940 patent.

 QUESTION:  Why couldn't it be that the -- the


word valuable doesn't mean at the time of the patent?  It


means reserves the mineral rights, and if and when they


prove valuable, the Government will assert its right.  I


mean, one could imagine a metal that was not considered


worth anything.  Let's just suppose that was the view of


uranium.  And then years later, one realizes the


tremendous value of that metal.  Would one say that, well,


because when the patent was granted, no one had any idea


how valuable this would be, therefore when it turns out


that it is indeed very valuable, the United States hasn't


any reserved rights?


MR. McCRUM:  Well, Your Honor, that -- that


could be a possible construction, but in this case the 

Interior Department in the 1956 solicitor's opinion took


note of the common nature of sand and gravel and how


widespread it is across the western public domain and


recognized that there was a need to look at -- at value on


a site-specific marketability basis, which was actually


consistent with the -- the approach the Department took in


the Layman v. Ellis decision in -- in 1929, looking at the


site-specific marketability of sand and gravel, because


unlike a precious metal like gold which, once you extract


it, it can be sold on an international market without


regard to transportation costs and has intrinsic value,

sand and gravel and -- and similar materials are -- are


common and widespread across the western public domain


and, in fact, across the country.  And it is only where


you have a market on a site-specific basis that you can


have value established.


QUESTION:  What would happen, though, if you --


what -- would any bad thing happen if the words were


interpreted to mean any mineral at all that ever becomes


valuable in the future so that then a person who bought


this land could never take anything off of it?  The


Government would have the right to all the dirt.  Anything


that he -- anything that the individual sold, he couldn't


sell.  It would be the Government that would have to sell


it. 


Now, if you took that interpretation, what would 

happen?


MR. McCRUM:  Justice Breyer, if -- if you took


that interpretation, you would have western landowners


essentially being -- having a very, very limited surface


-- surface estate interest that would essentially be at


the discretion of the Government where when local -- local


demands for these materials arose, the Government at any


time could come in and assert that they have ownership of


these widespread common materials which would actually


destroy -- potentially destroy the value of the land and


-- and further, eliminate any private incentives to

develop the private land, which was the intent of Congress


in 1919.


QUESTION:  One -- one way to -- to rule for your


client here would be for the Court to hold that it is not


a mineral if it can't be removed without disturbing the --


the surface, and that certainly would resolve this case. 


I'm hesitant to say that, though, because of the placer


mining of gold, et cetera.  Could you comment on that?


MR. McCRUM:  Yes, Justice Kennedy.  We are not


advocating such a rule, although it certainly in this case


bears -- is certainly a significant factor that this


common, widespread material actually would essentially


destroy the surface of the land.


QUESTION: 


Yes, that's what's bothering me. 

What -- what are we to do with that factor?  I just don't


see how you can get the gravel without completely


destroying the -- the surface use that -- that the owner


might want to put to it --


MR. McCRUM:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- assuming there's a different


owner.  This -- this happens to be the owner that makes


that choice.


MR. McCRUM:  Yes.  Justice Kennedy, it's just


that type of factor that have caused the vast majority of


State and Federal court decisions that have addressed the

question of whether gravel is a reserved mineral in any


type of private conveyance and cases involving the


Government where they acquire a surface interest that have


caused these -- the Federal and State courts to rule


almost uniformly that gravel is not a -- a reserved


mineral in the absence of some express intent to indicate


that it should be reserved.


QUESTION:  Of course, but you're -- you're in


that boat too.  I mean, you -- you acknowledge that if the


sand and gravel was valuable at the time the patent was


issued, the Government would -- would own it under the


mineral reservation.  So, I mean, despite the fact that


you'd have to chew up the surface land to -- to get at it


with a commercial value.  Right? 


MR. McCRUM:  Well, Justice Scalia, we -- we --


so, I mean, we have two positions here and -- and one is


that sand and gravel was -- was not reasonably within the


-- the meaning of this phrase as it was -- was used in


1919 considering the common legal understanding which had


-- had been developed by the Interior Department quite


clearly between 1901 and 1919 that made it very clear that


-- that common, widespread sand and gravel was not what


the -- was not what was considered to be a valuable


mineral at that time.


QUESTION:  Well, if it wouldn't be considered a

valuable -- I mean, that -- that does bring you into --


into contradiction of our prior cases because if that --


if that were so, it wouldn't have been considered a


mineral either, it seems to me. 


MR. McCRUM:  That's correct, Justice Scalia, but


we -- we -- in this case we do have the further express


language of -- of valuable.


QUESTION:  Yes, the problem is you have Western


Nuclear, which said that gravel was a mineral.  Now you've


got a statute in the Pittman Act that says valuable


minerals, which brings you to your fall-back position


which is that if at the time of patenting the land it


wasn't valuable commercially, then it isn't covered.  Is


that right?


MR. McCRUM:  Yes, Justice O'Connor.  If -- if


the Western Nuclear precedent is followed and applied to


the 1919 Pittman Act, then our -- our primary position is


that the material was not valuable at the time of patent.


QUESTION:  It's a little odd in this Pittman Act


because it -- it does in section 8 refer to valuable


minerals, but at various other times in the act, it just


says minerals.


MR. McCRUM:  In -- in section 8 of the Pittman


Act, it -- the statute makes it quite clear that only


valuable minerals are reserved.  And then it -- in -- in

later parts of that section, it refers to, and the mineral


so reserved shall be disposed in accordance with law.  I


don't think that changes the -- the meaning of the


reservation, and it's further confirmed here by the actual


patent issued by the Interior Department in the joint


appendix where only valuable minerals are reserved in the


patent.


QUESTION:  Suppose --


QUESTION:  Is that term used in any other act


that we'd be concerned with the term, valuable minerals,


as a reservation?


MR. McCRUM:  Not as a reservation that I'm aware


of, Your Honor, but it is -- is, of course, quite similar


to the language used in the 1872 Mining Law which 

described what -- what -- how -- what would be done with


the reserved mineral estate.


QUESTION:  Suppose -- and -- and it's only a


supposition -- that we were to reconsider our -- our


earlier case, Western Nuclear, and -- and overrule it.  It


-- it seems to me that then -- then there would be chaotic


lawsuits to follow because there would not -- not have


been intentional trespasses but the wrong people would


have been extracting the minerals if there had ever been a


-- a grant by the Government to -- to a person other than


the owner of the fee.  Is there any precedent in the Court

for how we unwind the -- the clock, or whatever the


metaphor is?


MR. McCRUM:  Well, as we -- as we point out in


our reply brief, Justice Kennedy, the amount of land that


is potentially subject to contract issued by the


Government for gravel on reserved mineral estates appears


to be on the order of less than two-tenths of 1 percent of


the lands patented under the Stock-Raising Homestead Act. 


So the vast majority of private lands at stake would --


would not be affected by a ruling except to the extent


that it would confirm that the landowner has the common


sand and gravel that -- that was part of the land


conveyed.


QUESTION: 


But your fall -- your fall-back 

position would extend only to Nevada, I take it, and the


fact that it was valuable would be distinguishing from the


Western Nuclear case.


MR. McCRUM:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.  The -- the


Pittman Act itself applies solely in Nevada and regardless


of whether the Court were to reconsider Western Nuclear,


we think that Western Nuclear should certainly not be


extended to this act which has the term, valuable


minerals, express in the statute and where the time of


patenting issue was not addressed by Western Nuclear, as


the Government acknowledges.  There's no issue of stare

decisis if -- if the Court is to say the time of patent is


paramount, as the Interior Department itself has held in


the 1956 solicitor's opinion and as the Tenth Circuit


ruled in the Hess case only last fall.


QUESTION:  Mr. McCrum, I don't understand what


your response to Justice Ginsburg's question is under your


fall-back position.  That is to say, what do you do with


uranium which was not regarded as a valuable mineral when


the patent was issued and nowadays is regarded as a very


valuable mineral?  What happens to uranium under your


fall-back position?


MR. McCRUM:  Yes, Justice Scalia.  Uranium is


clearly a rare, valuable mineral.  Whether or not it


was --


QUESTION:  Oh, it is now.  It wasn't then.


MR. McCRUM:  Yes.


QUESTION:  I mean, it was rare but not valuable.


MR. McCRUM:  Yes, and -- and therefore, it is --


it is clearly within the class of minerals that the --


that the 1872 Mining Law applied.  It has --


QUESTION:  Well, why is it if it's not valuable? 


I mean, that -- that's the problem.  If it wasn't valuable


at the time of patenting, what do you do with it?  It


seems to me that if -- if your argument is going to be


consistent, you're going to say the -- the Government

hasn't reserved the right to uranium.


MR. McCRUM:  Justice Souter, the -- uranium is


clearly of a -- a valuable, rare nature.


QUESTION:  No, but you're changing the


hypothesis.  Justice Scalia's question was, if it wasn't


valuable at the time of the patent, but we have now


discovered uses for it so that it is valuable, what do you


do with uranium?  And I would have thought that your


position would be the Government loses on uranium too.


MR. McCRUM:  Of course, the Court may -- may


view it that way, Justice Souter.  The -- the way I would


view it is that uranium is a rare, valuable mineral,


similar to gold, silver, lead, and zinc, and it's very


different --


QUESTION:  Well, I guess you could take the


position that a mineral like uranium has some intrinsic


value, very little as of 1919 and more today, but that


sand and gravel neither in 1919 nor today has any


intrinsic value as a mineral.  It is only when it is


located near an urban center and therefore has value as a


convenience.  I suppose that would be your argument. 


MR. McCRUM:  Yes, Justice O'Connor.  Thank you. 


That -- that is -- that is precisely the distinction. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. McCRUM:  That is precisely the distinction.

 QUESTION:  Well, I mean, you -- you could say


uranium only has -- only -- has no intrinsic value.  It


only has value if you're splitting atoms.  I mean, you can


make the same -- the same argument about uranium.


MR. McCRUM:  But uranium is -- is not dependent


upon local transportation costs in the way that sand and


gravel was, and that is the fundamental distinction --


QUESTION:  This must have come up under -- under


-- it has nothing to do with -- I don't think, with the


word valuable.  It has to do with the word minerals


covered in leases all over the country.  So it must have


come up in this other context too.  Western Nuclear,


putting that aside, that somebody looks at titanium or


some -- something. 


Maybe it's never come up, but I would 

think it would be true of every mineral lease, that --


that you have some kind of a mineral that had no value in


1500 or 1919 and today it's fabulous.  And -- and does --


are they -- do they cover them or don't they cover them? 


Maybe you don't know.  I don't know, but I don't see that


the word value has much to do with it.


MR. McCRUM:  The -- the way that it has come up


is -- would be in the -- the most analogous way that I can


think of is in the context of the 1872 Mining Law where,


although that language was enacted in 1872, the Interior


Department has had no trouble with the administration of

that law determining that -- that uranium is subject to


location as a mining claim under the 1872 --


QUESTION:  It was a mineral in 1500.  I mean,


nobody --


QUESTION:  Yes, but everything was.


QUESTION:  -- nobody disputes that it was a


mineral, which is what the -- what the mining act says. 


The -- the issue is whether it's a valuable mineral.  In


your fall-back position, you're placing a lot of weight on


the adjective valuable, and that -- that created problems


with -- with uranium.


QUESTION:  Didn't we have a case that involved,


was it methane, that was thought not only did it have no


value, but it was a positive detriment to have it?  And


then years later it turned out to be something very


valuable.


MR. McCRUM:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that would


have been the Amoco v. Southern Ute case in 1999.  There


the question is -- was whether under the contemporaneous


understanding in 1909 and 1910 did coal include coal bed


methane.  The Court looked to that common understanding


and common meaning and said, no, it didn't.  And that's


precisely the same approach we're asking the Court to


follow here.


QUESTION:  So who had the reserve?  Didn't

somebody have reserved rights in it?


MR. McCRUM:  Yes.  The -- the Government had


initially reserved coal and -- and the question was


whether that pure coal reservation extended to the coal


bed methane within the coal, and the -- and the Court


concluded no.  So it -- it is -- it is a case that we rely


on to look to the contemporaneous interpretation and


understanding at the time.


And here, sand and gravel was well known.  It


was widespread, and there were repeated Interior


Department decisions that said this is not the type of


mineral that is subject to the 1872 Mining Law as a -- as


a valuable mineral.


QUESTION: 


May I ask you a question about an --

an argument that hasn't specifically come up this morning? 


And, first, I just want to tell you what my -- my


understanding of the argument is and -- and you tell me if


I've got it wrong. 


I thought one of your arguments was that it was


important to know whether the mineral was valuable or not


at the time of the patent or the deed because the -- the


grantee, the patentee, ought to know, in effect, the


extent to which his -- his land grant is -- is jeopardized


by the Government's right to come in.  He ought to be able


make a rough judgment as to whether at some point they're

going to come in and start extracting things.  Is -- is


that a fair statement? 


MR. McCRUM:  Yes, Justice Souter.  Correct.


QUESTION:  My -- my question is this.  If -- if


that is the reason for saying we should look to value at


the time of the patent, isn't that an argument that is at


odds with your position that if the mineral is valuable at


the time, it is reserved?  Because -- the reason I say


that is this.  There may be gold under the land, but the


patentee doesn't know it and the Government doesn't know


it.  So that there is no way, at the time the deed passes,


that the person taking that deed is going to be able to


know whether, at some point in the future, the Government


is going to come in and -- and start drilling a mining 

shaft in the land. 


So my question is, regardless of what the date


at -- at which value is established, isn't it the case


that these patentees never really know whether at some


future time the Government is going to come in and start


drilling?  And if that is so, why should the patent date


be important? 


MR. McCRUM:  Justice Souter, you're -- you're


correct that there is -- there's always some level of


uncertainty when a party takes land subject to a mineral


reservation.  But the distinction that is important that

the Interior Department has long recognized and -- and


that the Federal and State courts have recognized is that


in the case of a common, widespread material such as


gravel, it is -- it is the value at the time of patent


which needs to be looked to.  And that's what --


QUESTION:  So are you saying basically, look,


that's the way we've done it and you ought to defer to the


practice?  Is that -- I mean --


MR. McCRUM:  We are -- we are --


QUESTION:  -- is that the foundation for your


argument? 


MR. McCRUM:  We are saying that this is the way


the Interior Department itself has done it, and this --


and this is the Interior Department that here is asserting 

a different rule today.  And the Interior Department and


the decisions of this Court have recognized a distinction


between common material such as sand and gravel and


precious metals and other materials that have intrinsic


value and recognized a distinction to look to


marketability and local, site-specific factors.


QUESTION:  When -- when you say today about --


and you cite the opinion of the solicitor from 1956, but


the position that the Government is arguing today in this


Court is not new.  This is hardly the first time the


Government has taken the position that sand and gravel can

be valuable minerals.


MR. McCRUM:  Justice Ginsburg, the -- the


position -- the litigation position which the Government


is taking here today that value does not matter at the


time of patenting actually has -- is not supported by


Interior Department decisions.  We are relying on the 1956


solicitor's opinion.  This Court referred approvingly to


the opinion in -- in Western Nuclear.  That opinion has


never been overruled by the Interior Department and the --


and the Interior Department offers no other interpretation


of -- on that issue as -- as something that this Court


should rely on.


A further reason that we think that -- that


these issues should be resolved in a -- in a fair manner


is the application of the Leo Sheep precedent of this


Court which recognizes the sacrifice and -- and -- that


have been made by the private individuals in obtaining


these patents and the inducement that the Government


carried out in encouraging parties to make these


sacrifices to obtain these lands.  And the purpose of the


act would be defeated to -- if -- if the Government is


able to later reserve common sand and gravel.


QUESTION:  But they didn't -- they didn't make


sacrifices to get the sand and gravel.


MR. McCRUM:  Justice Stevens, they made

sacrifices to get the land, and the sand and gravel makes


up the bulk of the land.  And if the Government can later


come back and say, that sand and gravel is ours now that


it has acquired some economic worth, it really defeats the


purpose of putting the lands into -- into private


ownership.


QUESTION:  You're saying it makes up the bulk of


the land?  I mean, I can understand that you would have an


argument maybe for -- for limiting what the government can


take if out of your, whatever it is, 600 acres, you know,


590 are gravel and the Government says, too bad, we're


taking it all.  But as I understand it, we -- we have not


gotten any issue in this case or in other cases about an


inequitable enforcement of the -- of the extraction 

condition.  Am I wrong about that?


MR. McCRUM:  Justice Souter, the Government's


position is that they own all the common sand and gravel


that makes up this entire parcel of land.  As -- as much


as the extraction operations may continue, the Government


would continue to take the view that they own every bit of


it based upon the decision of the -- of the Ninth Circuit


below.


QUESTION:  Well, you'd have an argument on the


first prong of Western Nuclear if they took that position


in fact, wouldn't you?

 MR. McCRUM:  Well --

MR. McCRUM:  We do -- we do believe that -- that


we -- that the Government's position is -- is contrary to


Western Nuclear in the sense that it is not -- that it --


that it is relying on the value of the sand and gravel


today without regard to what the value was in --


QUESTION:  No, no, but I'm talking about the


extent of it.  Does -- does the record indicate that the


-- that the -- that you have claimed that -- that one


basis for -- that you should win this case is that the


Government, in effect, will take, as you put it, the bulk 

of the property if they win?  Is -- is that in the record?


MR. McCRUM:  What is in the record is that -- is


that this sand and gravel deposit is extracted from the


surface, that the -- that the character of the land is


widespread, abundant common sand and gravel.  The -- the


photographs in the record show that the land is of the


same character.  The Government's position in this case is


that they own the sand and gravel wherever it may be on


that property.  And -- and I think there's no question


that it comprises the bulk of the land, and -- and I


wouldn't expect the Government to dispute that here today.

 QUESTION:  You wish to reserve the balance of


your time, Mr. McCrum?


MR. McCRUM:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. 


QUESTION:  Very well. 


We'll hear from you, Mr. Sansonetti.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. SANSONETTI


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. SANSONETTI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


QUESTION:  Mr. Sansonetti, I looked in the -- to


get some statistics about what Nevada was like in 1940,


and it had a -- a total population of 110,000.  It has an


area of 100,000 square miles, which is about 1 person per


square mile.  Las Vegas had a population of 8,000.  This


property is 65 miles away from Las Vegas. 


Does the Government say that it -- that this was


a valuable mineral in 1940 when the patent was issued? 


And if not, when did it become valuable?


MR. SANSONETTI:  The United States is saying


that the sand and gravel was, indeed, valuable as a matter


of a category of minerals.  In other words, the category


of sand and gravel was valuable actually, we're saying, as


far back as 1919, that the actual passage date of the


Pittman Act in 1919 was the exact time that sand and


gravel was valuable.

 QUESTION:  Well, dirt is valuable on that basis. 


I mean, people buy topsoil.  And, you know, if you're in


an area where -- where a lot of people need topsoil, I


suppose you'd say dirt is valuable.


MR. SANSONETTI:  In that case I wouldn't,


though, Your Honor, because topsoil also mixes both


organic and inorganic materials.  And the test that the --


that the Court set out in Western Nuclear was four-legged,


and the four-part test for a mineral was that it be


inorganic.  Extractable from the soil was the second leg. 


Third one was usable for a commercial purpose, and the


fourth one was that the -- the mineral was not somehow to


be included in the use of the surface estate.


QUESTION: 


What if -- what if you had only sand, 

which wasn't covered by Western Nuclear?


MR. SANSONETTI:  That would not be a problem in


this particular instance, Mr. Chief Justice, because sand


and the gravel are really just a matter of size.  In


order, they go silt, sand, gravel, cobble, building stone.


QUESTION:  So you say that's no problem for the


Government.  The Government gets the sand too?


MR. SANSONETTI:  Oh, yes, because sand is a


mineral.


QUESTION:  It's a problem for me, even if it's


not for you.

 MR. SANSONETTI:  Yes, yes. 


QUESTION:  Doesn't the Government get -- I mean,


it gets everything.  I mean, what -- what is it -- I mean,


you -- mud is made into adobe bricks.  I mean, and -- so


it gets absolutely everything except for the 6 inches or


so that maybe was mixed up that you could grow corn in. 


And I don't even understand why they wouldn't get that too


if they wanted it.


MR. SANSONETTI:  Now, I think that the first


thing we have to do is take a look at the purposes of the


passage of both the Stock-Raising Homestead Act and the


Pittman Act.


QUESTION:  Am I right in thinking the Government


gets absolutely everything with the possible exception 

because of the fourth point of Western Nuclear that I'm


not sure why it even came in, but that if it's mixed with


something you could grow something in, then they don't get


it.  But everything else is the Government's. 


MR. SANSONETTI:  Surface, yes.  Minerals, no. 


The -- the Justice is -- Justice Breyer is -- is correct. 


The degree that the surface has been given to the


patentee, the patentee has total control of the surface --


QUESTION:  So and then -- if it's so, then at


this time what this amounted to what seemed to be giving


the land away -- it amounted to a lease or a right to use

a piece of land to grow crops.  And that's all these great


giveaways were.  They were simply a right to use land to


grow crops and nothing else.


MR. SANSONETTI:  Initially the answer to that --


that question is yes because if you look at section 3 of


the Pittman Act, it refers to an affidavit that must be


signed by the patentee coming onto the land, and that


affidavit states that they are applying for this patent


for the purposes of reclamation and cultivation and it


states that they are not there as an agent for any other


corporation, mining company, or anything like that.  They


are there for the surface.  Basically --


QUESTION:  All right.  Then that whole argument


would be that's certainly a possible reading of the lease. 

That's certainly a possible way to look at it, but it


would have come as a great surprise to Senator Pittman and


everybody else at the time in the Interior Department and


elsewhere.  That's why, to make their argument, they say


that Western Nuclear was certainly wrong and therefore


what we should do is limit it by turning everything on the


word valuable.  All right.  That I think is their whole


argument and you don't want to --


MR. SANSONETTI:  And -- and let me -- if I may


shorten our own then, let me say that Congress, in looking


at both the Stock-Raising Homestead Act and the Pittman

Act, was basically saying to the patentees through the


mineral reservation, you could have the surface of the


land -- initially the thought was, of course, farming.


QUESTION:  Well, what if -- what if the surface


had -- what if the gravel was on the surface?


MR. SANSONETTI:  Okay.  At -- the -- the gravel


on the surface that is usable for commercial purposes


belongs to the United States. 


QUESTION:  So they didn't even get that part of


the surface.


MR. SANSONETTI:  If they wanted to use the sand


and gravel as part of their surface operation as in the


farming where you want to gravel a road, when you turn it


into cement, as was done in this case -- the farmer Butler 

that obtained the patent in 1940 used some of the sand and


gravel to make concrete to provide patios, et cetera.  As


long as it is linked to the purpose of the surface, it


belongs to the farmer, but if it's not, it belongs to the


United States. 


QUESTION:  Why is that?  Why is that?  Why is


that?  Why is that?  Is it the same with gold?


MR. SANSONETTI:  The -- the --


QUESTION:  So long as he uses the gold in his


house, it's okay?

For -- the long-term policy of the Department of


Interior and the Bureau of Land Management, as is spelled


out in great length in footnotes 3 and 14 of Western


Nuclear, is that it's always been okay for the owner of a


surface estate to go ahead and utilize a mineral so long


as it is incident to the purposes --


QUESTION:  Can I ask --


MR. SANSONETTI:  -- ordinary farming. 


QUESTION:  -- what -- what are his surface


rights?  Can -- can the -- can the Government do whatever


it takes in order to get at these minerals?


MR. SANSONETTI:  The --


QUESTION:  I mean --


MR. SANSONETTI:  The answer is yes.


QUESTION:  -- he -- he supposedly has surface


rights.  Don't -- don't they have to preserve his surface


rights when they do this?


MR. SANSONETTI:  The -- the answer is --


QUESTION:  But they can just go -- go in and rip


up the whole -- the whole acreage in order to --

indeed dominant, Justice Scalia, and in fact, the Congress


already thought ahead about what would happen if the


entire surface did need to get destroyed to go into a very


valuable mineral.  And that is -- and that thought by


Congress is included in sentences 3 and 4 of section 8 of


the Pittman Act where they make provisions for exactly


what to do if you have to come in and locate a mineral or


today you actually contract or sale your -- your sand and


gravel.


Here's what it said.  It said that that person


may come on the land provided he shall not injure, damage,


or destroy the permanent improvements of the entryman or


patentee and shall be liable and shall compensate the


entryman or patentee for all damages to the crops by 

reason of such prospecting.  And that covers those that


locate under sentence 3, and under sentence 4 it covers


those that acquire a right to obtain the mineral through a


contract.


QUESTION:  Is it -- is it true?  I -- I suppose


there's -- there's placer mining even for gold and I -- I


guess in some instances for coal.  But I -- I must tell


you my -- my assumption is that most mineral easements can


be exploited without undue disturbance of the surface.  Do


you want to tell me that that's just wrong empirically,


factually?  Other than gravel.  Other than gravel.

 MR. SANSONETTI:  The fact here, though -- I


mean, the -- the answer is, is that some minerals can be


extracted without much harm to the surface.  A lot of them


do require it, though.


QUESTION:  How about coal?  How about coal and


how about copper --


MR. SANSONETTI:  Of course --


QUESTION:  -- where you destroy huge areas of


the surface?  Do you know? 


MR. SANSONETTI:  You certainly do, Justice


O'Connor.  And -- and the fact is that that is exactly


what was contemplated ahead of time when this particular


act was passed.  The minerals belong to the United States. 


And if it was copper and you needed a gigantic pit, so be 

it. 


In this case, we have a gigantic pit.  Let's not


-- you know, if you take a look at the joint appendix


picture 15, you actually see what we're talking about


there.  This is not just a -- a surface operation.  It's a


huge pit.


QUESTION:  Well, that's the whole problem


because they say a person who went out to Nevada and


invested his time in this knew perfectly well that they


weren't going to find copper.  But if you had told him


that the Government might come in and take all the dirt

out and take all the gravel out and take all the sand out,


he would have said this is ridiculous.  I'm not going to


go out there and invest my time to -- to graze a cow when


the Government can come along and build a copper mine not


for copper but for dirt.  I mean, really. 


So that's -- that's why he says they've made


this historical distinction between something that has


intrinsic value, a precious metal then or now, uranium or


gold, and something that's widespread and commonly found,


dirt, copper -- dirt or gravel or sand.  And when you're


in that second category, I'm sorry, you just can't dig


these -- these great big holes. 


MR. SANSONETTI:  And that's -- that's what we


have here.  We have got a gigantic hole. 


And you have to 

keep in mind the difference between the dirt and the


topsoil which goes to the farming element of all this and


the sand and gravel which may be a humble mineral compared


to gold or silver.  Maybe the sand and gravel are the --


the poor stepchildren to brother gold and -- and sister


silver, but they're just as valuable as a member of the


mineral family.  Let me note that --


QUESTION:  May -- may I just interrupt to ask? 


I thought that you -- we weren't going to talk about dirt


because dirt is part animal, part vegetable, so it's not


mineral.

 MR. SANSONETTI:  Right, but I brought that up


because the question about topsoil.  I wanted to make sure


that I was distinguishing what is part of the surface


versus sand and gravel which is not part of the --


QUESTION:  How about clay?  Is -- is clay like


dirt or is clay like sand?


MR. SANSONETTI:  Clay can -- clay is like sand


in there.


But the point is is that sand and gravel, as far


back in the 1800's, much less at the point that I want to


bring our -- the -- the Court's attention to, which is


1919 where the Pittman Act is passed --


QUESTION:  I guess granite --


MR. SANSONETTI: 


-- sand and gravel -- I'm 

sorry.


QUESTION:  So granite -- I mean, I'm thinking of


granite.  On our -- we have some granite.  Somebody can


come in and dig up all the granite? 


MR. SANSONETTI:  Yes, because actually this


Court in 1903 in the Soderberg case said gravel is a


mineral.  Sand and gravel is a mineral.


QUESTION:  And the -- and the same way with


decorative rocks which are a big thing in northern


California now?  People are selling decorative rocks off


their -- off their property.  That's -- that's a mineral.

It belongs to the Government under these patents.


MR. SANSONETTI:  Actually in that particular


case, you would look at quartz.  If it was something that


they were using as part of their surface -- they may have


a greenhouse or whatever -- then obviously the Bureau of


Land Management is not interested in -- in taking the


person's cactus or whatever.


QUESTION:  The -- the holding -- the holding in


Soderberg was that granite outcroppings were reserved. 


That -- it didn't talk about -- it didn't hold as to


gravel, did it? 


MR. SANSONETTI:  No, not -- not as to gravel.  I


said granite.  He asked about granite.  Granite. 


Soderberg said granite is a mineral. 


Now, there was dicta 

in Soderberg, though, that quoted that -- favorably that


gravel was also a mineral. 


QUESTION:  At what -- at what point did the


Department of Interior take the position that you could


get a mining claim under the mining act for sand and


gravel claims?


MR. SANSONETTI:  As of 1872, as I understand it,


Justice O'Connor.


And -- and now to the 1919 part --


QUESTION:  You -- you think you can show that


patented mining claims were allowed for sand and gravel on

public lands that early?


MR. SANSONETTI:  In -- in fact, with the passage


of the 1872 Mining Act, that was the first opportunity


under that law for people go after sand and gravel.  It


was not until 1947 with the passage of the Mineral


Materials Act that you could obtain sand and gravel either


by locating it through the 1872 Mining Act or obtaining a


contract for lease.  That changed.  That contract for


sale.  Excuse me.


And that changed in 1955 with the passage of the


Common Varietals Act where the only way you could obtain


sand and gravel today -- well, ever since 1955 -- is by


sale contract.  You go to the Bureau of Land Management


and you say you want 10,000 cubic yards of sand and 

gravel.  You pay 35 cents or something like that that you


bid to take each cubic yard out, and once that is out, of


course, the 35 cents goes to the United States Government,


Treasury, and the remainder, of course, goes for the sale


of the sand and gravel. 


But while it is valuable, obviously, in 1993


when the petitioners were so interested in coming into the


farmer's shoes -- this is a mining operator BedRoc


stepping into the shoes of a farmer, those that had gone


ahead and stayed on the surface of the land from 1940 to


1993, now wanting to produce sand and gravel.

 QUESTION:  Are you -- are you suggesting that


because the grantee in this case was -- was a commercial


operation, somehow the -- the value of the grant or the


terms of the grant had changed?


MR. SANSONETTI:  Well, the -- the terms of the


grant did not change, but I think we have to keep in mind


exactly what the purpose of the statute was.  And here it


was Congress' intent to concurrently develop the surface


of these lands and the mineral estates.  The goal was to


get new farmers to farm, new ranchers to ranch, while


leaving the mineral estate to those that would be able to


exploit that mineral and were after the mineral because


they wanted to be mineral operators, not because they came


on the land as farmers.


This was the problem with all the fraud that was


going on under the old land classification system where


people would come onto the land saying this is non-


mineral.  I want it to be an agriculturalist, and then as


soon as they'd get the patent to everything, including the


surface and -- and the minerals, they were selling out to


the coal companies.


And that's what brought out the 1906 reservation


of the coal, and then you have the 1909 act which says the


patentee gets everything but the coal.  And then in 1916


and 1919 we have these two acts that say, nope, we're now

going, Congress says, to a split estate system where the


surface goes to the surface grantee, the patentee, and a


mineral operator must come to the United States to get any


type of mineral.


QUESTION:  Let me get something clear about the


-- the Department of Interior's position.  You said that


ever since 1872 they had taken the position that sand and


gravel was -- was mineral.  But isn't it the case that


they had taken that position only with respect to sand and


gravel that was removable in -- in commercial quantities?


MR. SANSONETTI:  That is correct.


QUESTION:  Not all sand and gravel was minerals.


MR. SANSONETTI:  That -- that is correct.  And


that's where the test of Western Nuclear comes in.  If you


want to know whether something is a mineral or not, you


apply the test. 


QUESTION:  Let's -- let's go back before Western


-- I think Justice Scalia's question -- I don't think your


answer is consistent with what the Government did in the


Zimmerman case, the Department, which was questioned


later.  But certainly at the time of Zimmerman, it -- it


was not a -- it was not regarded as a mineral, was it?


MR. SANSONETTI:  Well, Zimmerman in -- the


Zimmerman case was -- was the Department of the Interior


case that counsel has been referring to, Zimmerman, which

was in 1910, that said that sand and gravel did not equal


mineral lands.  So up until 1910, the question was, yes,


it was -- it was a mineral.  And the things -- things to


note about this. 


First of all, Zimmerman was specifically part of


the Western Nuclear case and is rejected at pages 45 and


46 of that opinion.


The second thing is is that that opinion, issued


by the Department of the Interior, was never tested in the


courts.  It is certainly --


QUESTION:  Well, wait a minute.  Does that mean


an opinion -- say, an agency opinion -- has no value if


it's never been tested in the courts?


MR. SANSONETTI: 


No, but it does mean that 

there's a difference between the Department of the


Interior's ability to inform the Congress at the time that


this act passed in 1919 and their ability to bind the


Congress.  The solicitor's opinion is not binding on the


Congress that that meant that sand and gravel fell out


from the definition of valuable minerals in 1919,


particularly since in 1919 sand and gravel was the fifth


largest value of minerals produced in the United States


that were nonmetallic.


QUESTION:  Yes, and where -- where was that sand


and gravel value concentrated?  It was concentrated on the

east coast because of World War I, wasn't it?


MR. SANSONETTI:  No.  Actually as -- as you can


see in the joint appendix, pages 56 through 118, there are


a series of annual mineral reports that were utilized in


both of the -- the district court case and the appellate


court case in -- in BedRoc, that spell out that by 1911,


there was already a national association of sand and


gravel producers, including associations of State sand and


gravel producers, in 14 different States. 


QUESTION:  Where --


MR. SANSONETTI:  And -- and Nevada is included. 


QUESTION:  And where -- and where else were the


14 States?  If you don't have it handy, don't --


MR. SANSONETTI: 


Michigan, Texas, California, 

and I would note, I believe, it is at joint appendix -- I


believe the page is 56 that shows that sand used for the


making of glass had already been discovered in Nevada as


of 1918.  So -- and --


QUESTION:  Well, that just -- that just proves


that sand and gravel in certain places is valuable. 


That's conceded by the other side.  Right?  The issue was


that -- is whether sand in the Gobi Desert is -- is


something that's worth anything.  And the fact is that the


Interior Department never took the position that all sand


and gravel is -- is minerals under the Mineral Act until

when?


MR. SANSONETTI:  The -- the --


QUESTION:  When was the first time it came up


with the notion that whether it's commercially extractable


or not at -- you know, at a profit, it is all minerals


under -- under the mineral laws?


MR. SANSONETTI:  You could locate sand and


gravel from 1872 up to 1910.


QUESTION:  You could locate it if it was


commercially valuable, yes.


MR. SANSONETTI:  That is correct. 


QUESTION:  That's not the question I asked. 


When is it that the Department first came up with the


position that all sand and gravel, no matter where it is, 

is covered by the mining laws?


MR. SANSONETTI:  I don't know the exact answer


to your question, but I can say in regard to this --


QUESTION:  Is it after -- is it after 1940?


MR. SANSONETTI:  It's before 1940 because in


1919 the Department of the -- as of 1919, the Congress had


stated that sand and gravel is a valuable mineral.


QUESTION:  Then how do you explain the 1956


solicitor letter -- opinion -- the DOI solicitor who said


that -- that there's a reservation only if the gravel had


a definite economic value because of the proximity of a

market at the date of the patent?


MR. SANSONETTI:  It was that -- okay, first of


all, the 1956 solicitor's opinion was also reviewed by


this Court in Western Nuclear.  And the only portion of


the solicitor's opinion that was approved by this Court


was the finding that gravel was a mineral.  The -- this


Court in --


QUESTION:  Well, did this Court disapprove of a


portion that Justice Ginsburg just referred to?  I don't


remember.


MR. SANSONETTI:  It did not adopt it.  In other


words, it was considered, but not adopted.


QUESTION:  Did it say it was wrong?  Did it say


that was wrong?


MR. SANSONETTI:  It did not, but then that's


because Western Nuclear didn't answer this precise


question of site-specific. 


QUESTION:  We're not talking for the moment


about what the Court adopted.  We're talking about what


the Interior Department adopted.  What is there in the


Interior Department that would have contradicted its


solicitor's opinion? 


MR. SANSONETTI:  Well, for one, it's the


practice that has been followed since that time.  Since


site-specific is what's being mentioned in the solicitor's

opinion -- and frankly, it's an issue that related to an


Indian reservation -- has absolutely no basis with the


Stock-Raising Homestead Act grants or the Pittman Act


grants.  The statute at issue there related to an Indian


reservation.  It continued to grant United States control


over all the minerals on that reservation, considered the


trust responsibility.  There were other elements being


considered there rather than whether or not site


specificity should be what the BLM follows all across the


board.  Note that we are here --


QUESTION:  There's -- there's another -- there's


another piece from the Department of the Interior that Mr.


McCrum emphasized in addition to the 1956 opinion letter,


and it was a heading or a sentence in the Western Nuclear 

brief, in the SG's brief, stating that the reservation


embraces only gravel deposits that are economically


exploitable and would justify an entry under the 1872


Mining Act.  So in Western Nuclear, according to Mr.


McCrum, that issue wasn't before the Court and the


Government said, indeed, the issue is it has to be


economically exploitable at the time of the patent.


MR. SANSONETTI:  Your Honor, we're mixing up two


things.  The 1872 Mining Act is an act that -- that tells


you how to obtain a mineral.  The reservation we're


talking about today is describing what is covered by the

mineral.  Once you've got the what, then you can decide


the how, whether it's the 1872 act which has these deposit


references and -- and the like, or whether something is


saleable under contract.  That -- those are the hows. 


Today we're talking about the what, what is


covered by the reservation.  And the Pittman Act House


report notes that the reservations in both the SRHA, the


Stock-Raising Homestead Act, and the Pittman Act are


identical.


QUESTION:  Well, but that -- that can't be


correct, can it, because one uses the term valuable and


the other doesn't?  And the House report certainly doesn't


prevail over the statute.


MR. SANSONETTI: 


It does not prevail over the 

statute except let me come back to the question about the


two words being -- the two phrases being different because


section 8 of the bill -- again, Pittman was passed after


the Stock-Raising Homestead Act, and the actual quote is


that section 8 of the Pittman Act contains the same


reservations of minerals which was passed by Congress in


the Stock-Raising Homestead Act. 


Now --


QUESTION:  Well, that's not a quote from the


statute.  That's a quote from the report. 


MR. SANSONETTI:  And now as to the quotes from

the statute.


QUESTION:  Will you -- will you answer my


question? 


MR. SANSONETTI:  The answer is yes.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. SANSONETTI:  Okay.  Now as to the actual


statutes.  In the Stock-Raising Homestead Act, it is all


the coal and other minerals.  That's section 9.  In


section 8 of the Pittman Act, it is all the coal and other


valuable minerals.


QUESTION:  Right.  So -- so can I -- can you


deal with this --


MR. SANSONETTI:  Yes.


QUESTION: 


-- problem that's in the back of my 

mind?  Okay?  All right.


You wanted to finish what you were saying.


MR. SANSONETTI:  If -- if I may, the position of


the United States is that those two phrases, valuable


minerals and minerals, are synonymous.  The word valuable


definitely has a meaning.  That meaning was set out in


Western Nuclear as being used for commercial purposes.  So


used for commercial purposes, the concept of value is


definitely part of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act, and


consequently, it means the mineral must be valuable.


In Pittman, you've got again the exact same

language of section 8 and section 9 with the addition of


the word valuable.  It appears eight times in both of --


of those sections, and it is our -- our position then that


they are interchangeable.  Minerals sometimes, valuable


mineral other times.  So it's a distinction without a


difference and valuable is definitely not a word of


surplus.


QUESTION:  Okay.  What's bothering me in the


back of my mind, assuming all the opinion letters and


everything are sort of a wash, is that we don't ranch all


-- as much as we used to and we don't farm as much as we


used to.  And therefore, what's really at stake is the


ability to transfer title.


And once I begin to think in that way, I think 

that whoever might want to sell or buy some of this land,


which now might be used for a city or a town or who knows


what, might think to himself, well, I can deal with the


reservation of, let's say, a specific precious mineral


right like gold or even tungsten or even uranium.  But if


there's a possibility here that the Government can come in


and start digging, because the mixture of organic only


goes down about 6 inches, and if everything below that 6


inches potentially belongs to the Government, and the


Government can come in and tear up even that 6 inches to


look for rocks or look for sand or look for gravel or

granite or all that stuff, which is undoubtedly there, I


just don't know what I'm getting into.  And therefore, I


would be pretty reluctant to buy this piece of land, or at


least not for much of a price.


Now, it's that kind of uncertainty in land


transfer title that is coming on 100 years after the event


that's worrying me.  So I would like you to reply and tell


me what you think of that.


MR. SANSONETTI:  Let -- let me try it in -- in


this fashion because we're talking about expectations here


and what the patentee, the surface owner, is obtaining and


how it passes that on to successors. 


The United States was saying through the


Congress through both of these acts that the mineral --

through the mineral reservations that you, the patentee,


can come onto the surface of this land, use it as you


will.  We, the citizens of the United States, keep


anything that may be found on or underneath that land that


has mineral value.  The patentee gets to use the surface


as his benefit of the bargain and should not expect


anything else.  If there are windfalls -- if there are


windfalls of valuable minerals that no one knew were under


these lands in Nevada, if any, they should belong to the

this subject -- most of the State courts that have ruled


on this subject, have come out the other way from Western


Nuclear.  Do they have a different perspective or


different concerns? 


MR. SANSONETTI:  They -- they do -- they do


because there's no congressional mandate in those -- in


those State court cases.  Those State court cases


invariably have situations where the reservations may or


may not be applied by the Secretary of the Interior, in


reference to the Hess case for instance. 


QUESTION:  No, but the practical problems and


the -- and -- and the likely expectations and


understanding of the purchasers would be the same.


MR. SANSONETTI: 


They -- they would be the same 

except in our instance, they're much more clearly laid out


because once that affidavit is signed under section 3,


then you have the person coming onto the land


contemplating cultivation.  They are signing an affidavit


saying they want the free land, and it's free land.  For


20 acres of crops, they get up to 640 acres of free land. 


And they get the appreciation of that land.  This


particular plot happens to be just north of Las Vegas.  If


it appreciates --


QUESTION:  If they find -- if they find water. 


They have to come in --

 MR. SANSONETTI:  They have to --


QUESTION:  -- and expend a certain amount of


money --


MR. SANSONETTI:  Yes, they did. 


QUESTION:  -- considerable money sometimes, to


find water.  And if they find it, then they have the right


to -- to farm.  And, you know, I don't think that's a --


such a terrific deal if they can be just dug out of their


-- of their homestead by the Government. 


MR. SANSONETTI:  But the fact is is at the point


where they did find water, they applied for the patent.


They get their 640 acres.  In this case it was 560.  They


acknowledge that they are getting this free land for


crops. 


They grew the crops, the 20 acres' worth of crops 

that had been grown that got them the opportunity to file


their final certificate and obtain that patent.


Now, remember, if this land appreciates, they


get the benefit of that bargain, the same way as if the


United States happens to find that there is a valuable


mineral underneath, they happen to benefit from it.  This


could be a golf course or a WalMart or anything in a few


years north of Las Vegas. 


QUESTION:  If -- if the --


MR. SANSONETTI:  The United States is not asking


for that appreciation.

 QUESTION:  If the property owner had exported --


transported the water to Las Vegas for a municipal water


supply, would that be consistent with reclamation?


MR. SANSONETTI:  Any -- as I understand it, that


under Nevada State law, the water actually that was found


by Farmer Butler in this case is -- is dealt with by the


Nevada State water engineer.  So long as he uses it for


beneficial uses, the permission to take it off premises or


on premises has nothing to do with this reservation.  It


has to do with Farmer Butler and Nevada State law.


But I would like to note a couple quick things


in regard to the bad consequences of a site-specific test


because it does place the ownership of other minerals into


doubt. 


It's not just gold or silver that we're dealing 

with on one hand and sand and gravel or some ubiquitous


common gravel over here.  What happens?  What's the test


then for things like trona or bentonite or limestone or


dolomite or any other thing.  You mentioned uranium. 


Uranium was used for watch dials way back in 1919, but of


course, we now see it has a much more important purpose


today. 


QUESTION:  The -- the test, as I understand it,


would be whether it was commercially worthwhile to extract


it and transport it to wherever you'd have to take it to


use it.

 MR. SANSONETTI:  Ah, and if it was, it would be


a mineral reserved to the United States.  But if the site-


specific test is put into place, imagine then the


practical difficulties in trying to show that from the


Bureau of Land Management's point of view going back in


time --


QUESTION:  No, no.  I mean, the -- the Bureau


has always had a -- a doctrine of inherently valuable


minerals, gold and silver.  You don't have to show that it


can be extracted at a commercial profit.  And benthamite


or kryptonite, which Superman uses --


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  -- whatever you want, all you have to


do is say that that is an inherently valuable mineral. 

MR. SANSONETTI:  Well, to the extent that


there's any doubt on -- on the Court about whether or not


gravel is a mineral reserved to the United States in the


Pittman Act reservation, we feel it should be resolved in


favor of the Government due to the old canon of


construction that says that about the scope of land grants


are construed favorably to the Government. 


Thank you. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Sansonetti.


Mr. McCrum, you have 2 minutes remaining.

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. McCRUM:  Thank you. 


One point that I'd like to make as clear as I


possibly could is that sand and gravel was not locatable


under the Mining Law from 1872 onward.  It -- it -- the


Interior Department was as clear as could be in published


decisions that common material like sand and gravel and


clay were not subject to the 1872 Mining Law, not within


the class of valuable minerals.  The -- the first


published decision we see on this is in the 1880's and we


see a repeated line of cases from 1901 through 1919. 


They're all cited in our opening brief.  We really


shouldn't have an issue about that.


It was not until 1929 --


QUESTION:  Well, your opponent flatly disagrees


with you, doesn't he, on that?


MR. McCRUM:  I have great respect for my


opponent, Mr. Sansonetti, but I -- I think that this point


that I'm making is -- is as clear as could be in the


record. 


And the Zimmerman case is not an isolated case. 


It's merely a case in 1910 that is stating this very


explicitly in the case of sand and gravel that this was


actually the general understanding and that the Department


was not even receiving applications for sand and gravel

mining claims because this was so well known. 


It was not until 1929 in the Layman v. Ellis


decision where the Department changed that rule, 10 years


after the Pittman Act in this case.  Then it was


determined on a site-specific basis.  That's the site-


specific base -- basis argument that we are putting


forward here, which then was adopted in the 1956


solicitor's opinion in the context of mineral


reservations.


There was some reference to the Soderberg case


of this Court in 1903.  That involved valuable granite


building stone of the type that we see here in the


Jefferson Memorial and around this city.  Not -- it was


not a surprising ruling when this Court upheld the 

position of the Interior Department patent that valuable


granite could be subject to the Mining Law within the


class of valuable minerals. 


By then, in 1897, in the Pacific Coast Marble


case, the Interior Department had already ruled that


marble was a valuable mineral, which is an eminently sound


ruling looking at the marble in this Court building, which


is quite different from common sand and gravel.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. McCrum.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the
