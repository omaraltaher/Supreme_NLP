CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We  will  hear

On  the  severance  question,  Mr.  McAllister. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

 

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  STEPHEN  R.  McALLISTER 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

            

The  joint  sentencing  proceeding  in  these 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  did  not  violate  the  Eighth  Amendment  because  each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  received  the  individualized  sentencing 

 

 

 

 

determination  to  which  he  was  entitled. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Each  presented  all  of  the  mitigating 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  he  chose  to  produce.  The  jury  instructions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

explicitly  told  the  jury  to  consider  each  defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individually.  In  fact,  there  were  several  separate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

instructions,  some  that  related  only  to  one  defendant  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  to  another  defendant. 

 

 

 

            

Each  ­­ the  jury  for  each  defendant  then  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  complete  a  specific  verdict  form,  and  this  jury  had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already  proven  its  ability  to  distinguish  between  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  defendants  when  it  convicted  one  of  some  counts  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  original  guilt  phase,  of  which  it  acquitted  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other.

The  only  way  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court  gets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  an  Eighth  Amendment  error  in  this  case  ­­ well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really,  there  are  two  points.  One,  it  relied  upon 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible,  and  one  instance  not  even,  violations  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

errors  of  State  law  to  find  a  prejudice  that  ­­ that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rose  to  an  Eighth  Amendment  level.  And  two,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disregarded  altogether,  with  really  no  explanation,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long­standing  foundational  principle  that  juries  are 

 

 

 

 

 

presumed  to  follow  their  instructions. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  two  State  law  errors,  arguably,  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Kansas  Supreme  Court  found,  one  was  the  admission  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  of  the  sister  who  made  the  comment  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reginald  may  have  told  me  he  shot  those  people. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Well,  that's  not  even  an  error  of  State  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  said  basically  that's  prejudicial.  It  might  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  come  in  if  they  had  been  tried  separately,  but  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  that  evidence  would  be  relevant  to  aggravator 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  1,  that  the  defendant  killed  multiple  people. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  would  have  been  admissible  evidence  and  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  just  can't  be  an  Eighth  Amendment  violation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  the  Kansas  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas  Court  found  independent  of  the  severance  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  was  constitutional  error  in  the  admission  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearsay. 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  That's  the  third  question

presented  in  the  cert  position  on  which  the  Court  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  taken  any  action  yet,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Yes.  But  when  it  goes 

  

  

 

 

 

 

back  to  Kansas,  they  can  still  say  thank  you  for  telling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us  about  severance,  but  we  have  this  other  ground  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leads  to  the  same  bottom  line. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Well,  and  we  are  certainly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hopeful  that  the  Court  will  take  another  look  at  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second  question  depending  on  its  resolution  of  the  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions  that  are  in  front  of  it  today. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  would  ­­

  

 

 

 

MR.  McALLISTER:  But  if  it  goes  back  in  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

posture,  yes,  they  would  have  another  ground. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Was  ­­ was  any  evidence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

introduced  with  respect  to  one  of  the  defendants  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  not  have  been  introduced  against  the  other  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  been  severance? 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  The  only  arguable  evidence 

  

 

 

 

 

really,  Justice  Kennedy,  is  what  ­­ what  Reginald  refers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  as  the  corrupting  influence.  But  even  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguably,  would  be  relevant  to  the  mercy  consideration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  show  his  character,  the  nature  of  this  person  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  sentenced. 

 

            

And  that  was  the  notion  that  his  mother 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testified  that  sometimes  ­­ of  course,  Jonathan  looked

up  to  his  big  brother,  and  maybe  sometimes  Reginald  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  bad  influence  on  him.  But  that's  ­­ that  was  really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  extent  of  that  evidence.  And  that  might  have  come 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  as  a  rebuttal  to  a  mercy  argument. 

   

   

 

 

 

            

 

The  Kansas  Supreme  Court  did  not  really 

 

 

 

 

 

definitively  say  that  was  even  State  law  error,  but  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  assumed  it  was  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

law. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Could  you  tell  me  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  McALLISTER:  ­­ it  would  only  be  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ what  the 

  

 

 

 

constitutional  standard  you're  asking  us  to  apply?  I  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  argument  goes  to  harmless  error;  a  serious  position 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  take,  that  even  if  there  was  error,  no  foul  ­­ a  foul 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  no  penalty.  Okay? 

  

 

 

            

But  what  standard  are  we  applying?  We  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  applying  the  rule  ­­ or  are  we  or  should  we  apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Rule  14  standard? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  No,  not  ­­ not  for  Eighth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  purposes,  Your  Honor.  Kansas  would  propose  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I  suspect  the  United  States  can  propose  something  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  but  it's  a  very  high  standard  as  an  Eighth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  matter.  And  we  would  say  ­­ we  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

content  to  accept  something  like  it's  a  serious  risk 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  defendant  will  not  be  able  to  receive

individualized  sentencing.  It  is  sort  of  molding  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional  notions  of  joinder  with  the  Eighth  Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consideration,  because  that  seems  to  be  the  only  Eighth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  consideration  here,  is  the  individualized 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing. 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Is  it  the  Eighth  Amendment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

or  is  it  due  process? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Well,  you  could  use  a  due 

   

  

 

 

 

 

process  standard,  Justice  Scalia,  which  we  would  also  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fine  with.  The  question  would  really  be,  did  joinder  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infect  the  process  with  unfairness  that  the  proceedings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  fundamentally  unfair. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That  seems  like  a  ­­ a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

language  that  is  relevant  rather  than  the  cruel  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unusual  punishments  language. 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Well,  and  that's  exactly 

  

 

 

 

 

what  this  Court  said  in  Romano  v.  Oklahoma,  a  case  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  the  defendant's  other  death  sentence  in  a  separate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  was  admitted  against  the  defendant  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  proceeding.  That  sentence  later  got 

  

 

 

 

 

reversed,  and  the  Oklahoma  court  said  the  jury  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  have  heard  about  his  other  sentence  as  a  matter  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law.  That  defendant  Romano  said  it  is  an  Eighth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  violation,  and  it's  a  due  process  violation. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

The  Court  said  the  Eighth  Amendment  doesn't  have

anything  to  say  about  what's  admissible  really.  That  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  evidentiary  rules,  that's  not  an  Eighth  Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue. 

            

And  the  Court  went  on  to  address  the  due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  claim  in  Romano,  applying  that  very  standard. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  as  we  suggest  the  Court  should  do  here,  one  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  it  pointed  to  specifically  was  jury  instructions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  said  these  are  the  aggravating  circumstances  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  consider,  you  may  not  consider  any  others.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  said  we  presume  the  jury  follows  its  instructions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  nothing  in  the  instructions  gave  the  jury  here  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  to  give  effect  to  that  improperly  admitted  evidence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that's  true  here  to  the  extent  Reginald 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Carr  argues  some  of  this  evidence  was  really  used  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonstatutory  aggravating  circumstance.  By  statute, 

  

 

 

 

Kansas  does  not  allow  anything  other  than  statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravating  circumstances.  In  the  instructions  ­­ No.  5 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  for  Reginald,  No.  7  for  Jonathan  ­­ very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explicitly  and  clearly  say,  here  are  the  four 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravating  circumstances  the  State  has  alleged.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

then  the  next  paragraph,  you  may  not  consider  anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else  as  an  aggravating  circumstance. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  in  our  view,  the  most  the  Kansas  Supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  could  come  up  with  is  potential  violation  of  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  if,  in  fact,  the  evidence  which  is  minimal  in  the

corrupting  influence  on  Jonathan,  if  that  would  not  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  admitted,  that's  really  all  the  Kansas  Supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  is  left  with  to  hang  its  hat  on  in  finding  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  there  is  an  Eighth  Amendment  violation  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Can  you  tell  me  if  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

aware,  in  other  States  or  perhaps  even  in  Kansas  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  trials,  is  it  a  common  practice  to  sever  when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  ­­ for  the  penalty  phase  when  there  are  multiple 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants? 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Justice  Kennedy,  I  think  in 

   

  

 

 

 

the  briefs  ­­ I  do  not  remember  the  exact  page  ­­ there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  two  States  that  mandate  severance  ­­ one,  Ohio  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that's,  I  think,  Georgia  and  Mississippi. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  This  is  just  for  penalty 

  

 

 

 

 

 

phase? 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  I  think  it's  for  the  entire 

    

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding.  And  then  Ohio,  there  is  a  presumption  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  favor  of  severance,  but  all  the  other  States,  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  nothing  that  mandates  or  even,  I  think,  creates  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption  of  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It  seems  it  would  be  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficult  for  the  trial  judge  to  decide  which  should  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first. 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  It  would,  and  that's  one  of

the  reasons  ­­ I  mean,  not  just  judicial  economy  but,  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  sense,  overall  fairness  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Yes. 

  

 

MR.  McALLISTER:  ­­ having  them  tried 

  

 

 

 

 

together  and  you  don't  have  one  defendant  having  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity  to  preview  the  evidence  that  the  State  may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present  and  the  arguments  that  may  be  made.  This  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  recognized  that  potential  tactical  advantage  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  joinder  cases.  Of  course,  it  has  not  had  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

joinder  capital  case  like  this,  but  in  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  that's  a  factor. 

   

 

            

The  Court  has  also  emphasized  the 

 

 

 

 

 

consistency  of  determinations  with  respect  to  facts.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  saying  the  outcomes  have  to  be  the  same,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  the  evidence,  the  mitigation  evidence  is  99  percent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overlapping  ­­ they  were  using  the  same  witnesses,  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  experts  were  co­authors.  They  were  testifying  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  exact  same  things  essentially  about  each  brother. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

All  that  overlapping  evidence,  what  this 

 

 

 

 

 

allows  is  a  consistent  determination  by  the  jury  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

evaluation  of  all  that  mitigating  evidence  that  leads  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  outcome  the  jury  decides.  But  the  jury  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  clearly  told  to  consider  each  defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individually.  And  that's  what  they  got,  was  individual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

consideration.

I  would  say  also,  remember,  even  if  this 

 

 

 

Court  were  to  think  there  were  some  kind  of  error  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas  simply  does  not  see  here  ­­ again,  at  most, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibly  an  error  of  Kansas  law,  not  an  Eighth  Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  ­­ it  would  have  to  be  harmless  under  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard,  and  Kansas  would  accept  any  standard  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  certainly  here.  Given  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

four  uncontested  aggravating  circumstances  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  you'd  also  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

look  ­­ you  have  it  at  the  top  of  your  head,  maybe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forget  if  you  don't,  but  what  I  thought  I  would  do  is  I 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted  to  look  to  the  aggravating  circumstances,  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  they. 

 

            

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  What  were  they. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Let's  call  it  "he  was  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

monster"  approach.  Reginald  was  the  monster  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Jonathan  was  the  puppet  or  whatever.  I  want  to  look  at 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  aggravators.  I  also  want  to  look  at  the  mitigators 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Reginald  said  existed,  and  then  see  if  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comparative  monster,  let's  call  it,  fits  into  any  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them. 

            

Do  you  know?  Do  you  know  the  pages  where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  are,  just  by  chance? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Well,  I  think  the  ­­ in

set  forth  in  the  instructions,  Justice  Breyer,  so  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

are. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  I  know  where  they 

    

  

 

 

 

MR.  McALLISTER:  Yeah,  Instruction  No.  5  for 

   

  

 

 

 

Reginald  and  Instruction  No.  7  for  Jonathan,  and  then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

following  each  one,  so  I  believe  Instruction  No.  6  and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Instruction  No.  8. 

 

 

            

 

 

But  the  mitigating  ­­ those  are  the 

 

 

 

 

statutory  mitigating  circumstances.  So  what  happens  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

these  cases  is  the  jury  is  told,  here  are  the  statutory. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  we  list  all  of  them  that  are  listed  in  the  Kansas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  And  then  you  can  ­­

JUSTICE  BREYER:  On  what  page  do  you  list 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  McALLISTER:  Well,  so  those  are  listed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  Instruction  No.  6  and  Instruction  No.  8.  It's  all  in

JUSTICE  BREYER:  If,  in  fact,  this  gets  in,

to  do?  I  don't  see  how  I  could  avoid  that  if  they  are 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  all  relevant. 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Well,  I  would  say,  first  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

all,  if  were  you  to  do  that,  it  would  be  quite  clear. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  evidence  is  overwhelming. 

 

 

 

            

But  furthermore,  the  premise  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

supported  really  by  the  record.  They  say  Jonathan's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole  strategy  was  to  paint  Reginald  as  the  bad  actor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  That's  not  really  what  happened.  What  they  both 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented  was  lots  of  witnesses  and  testimony  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  ­­ their  childhood  and  their  experiences  growing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up,  and  they  presented  psychological  experts  to  talk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  their  mental  condition.  No  expert  said  Reginald 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  some  kind  of  psychological  control  over  Jonathan. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  ­­ that  testimony,  to  the  extent  it's  there  at  all, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes  from  their  mother. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  what  do  you  think  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  case,  whether  or  not  this  is  that  case,  in  which  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite  clear  to  a  judge  that  each  of  two  defendants  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  going  to  be  pointing  to  the  other  person  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying,  that  was  the  bad  actor.  He  is  why  these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terrible  crimes  committed.  And  you  know  that  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  each  of  them  is  going  to  be  doing  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Should  a  judge  separate  the  penalty 

   

 

 

 

proceeding  in  that  context?

MR.  McALLISTER:  Well,  not  necessarily.  If 

  

  

 

 

 

the  high  standard  is  met  that  it  will  not  be  possible, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps,  to  give  individualized  consideration  to  each  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  Eighth  Amendment  or  a  due  process  standard  is  going 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  so  fundamentally  unfair,  if  you  can  meet  that  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

high  standard,  then  ­­ but  that's  always  been  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  approach.  It  is  a  case­by­case  determination. 

   

  

 

 

 

Even  Zafiro,  which  is  a  joinder  case  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  I  guess  I  am  asking 

   

   

  

 

 

you  in  what  kind  of  factual  circumstances  you  would  find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  standard  met? 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Rarely,  but  I  think  it 

   

  

 

 

 

would  be  ­­ certainly  the  Court  has  recognized  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bruton,  you  have  some  sort  of  co­defendant  confession  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  confession  situations,  if  there  was  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  had  not  been  used  in  the  guilt  phase,  might  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant  in  the  sentencing.  That  might  be  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudicial. 

            

We  have  tried  to  think  of  other  examples.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  suggest  something  like  one  is  claiming  at  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  in  time  some  kind  of  insanity,  even  though  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  succeed  on  that  at  trial.  If  there  was  something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  starkly  contradictory  in  their  presentations  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  were  going  to  get  a  lot  of  evidence  about  one  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  had  nothing  to  do  at  all  with  the  other.

But  we  do  believe  it's  a  high  standard  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  rarely  be  satisfied,  especially  given  the  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long­standing  presumption  that  the  jury  follows  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions.  And  that's  one  thing  I  would  point  out 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

here,  the  complaints  that  each  makes  in  this  Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First  of  all,  at  least  one  of  those  complaints  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  even  made  in  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court,  much  less 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  trial  court,  and  that's  the  shackling  of  Reginald 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  whether  that  might  have  prejudiced  Jonathan. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

But  they  ­­ there  was  no  complaints  during 

 

 

 

 

the  sentencing  proceeding.  This  corrupting  influence 

  

 

 

 

 

evidence  is  relevant  only  for  Jonathan's  mitigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  not  with  respect  to  Reginald;  can  we  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limiting  instruction?  Reginald  has  anti­social 

  

 

 

 

personality  disorder;  there  was  no  request  for  any  sort 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  limiting  that  that  ­­ that's  not  applicable  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jonathan.  Although,  of  course,  the  irony  there  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jonathan's  own  expert  all  but  diagnosed  him  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anti­social  personality.  He  said  out  of  26  risk  factors 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Department  of  Justice  has  recognized  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violence  and  sexual  violence,  Jonathan  has  24  of  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  both  brothers  talked  about  family 

 

 

 

 

 

history  of  mental  illness.  Both  brothers  and  their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

experts  talked  about  whether  some  of  these  things  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hereditary  or  genetic.  This  was  really  a  case  in  which

it  made  very  good  sense  to  proceed  with  a  joint 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding,  because  the  evidence,  99  percent  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overlapping,  essentially.  I  mean,  they  were  calling  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

same  witnesses,  taking  turns  with  those  witnesses. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Judicial  economy  nor  fairness,  neither  one  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  served  any  better  by  separating  this  into  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings. 

            

And,  in  fact,  I  will  conclude  for  now, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

unless  there  are  further  questions,  with  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

observation,  that  prior  to  trial,  to  the  guilt  phase, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  prosecution  actually  offered  to  have  two  juries  sit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  this  proceeding.  Jonathan's  attorney  said  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  consider  it,  and  Reginald's  attorney  rejected  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  State  even  tried  to  ­­ to  agree  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  workable  system  and  ­­ and  it  was  declined. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  unless  there  are  further  questions,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  reserve  the  remainder  of  my  time.

that  the  State  violated  the  Eighth  Amendment  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conducting  joint  sentencing  proceedings  for  the  crimes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Respondents  committed  together.  Joint  proceedings 

  

 

 

 

 

can  enhance  accuracy  and  fairness,  as  a  long  line  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court's  cases  hold.  They  provide  a  fuller 

   

  

 

 

 

 

evidentiary  record  to  juries  that  are  assessing  relative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

culpability,  and  they  prevent  arbitrary  disparities  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  arise  when  two  juries  reach  inconsistent  conclusions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  common  facts  of  a  single  crime. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Ms.  Kovner,  is  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

any  difference  between  the  Federal  government's  position 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  position  of  the  State  of  Kansas  on  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question? 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  As  to  the  standard,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

there's  a  small  difference.  I  think  our  proposal  is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

that  the  constitutional  standard  is  whether  evidence  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  resulted  in  a  denial  of  due  process  or  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deprivation  of  an  individualized  sentencing  proceeding. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that's  slightly  different  from  Kansas's 

 

 

 

 

 

standard,  because  Kansas  is  proposing  a  rule  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

involves  analysis  of  risk,  and  we  think  that  is  part  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statutory  rule  under  Rule  14,  as  Justice  Sotomayor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alluded  to.  It's  also  part  of  the  statutory  standard 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  states  "by  and  large  are  applying,"  but  we  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  constitutional  question  is  just,  was  this  person

deprived  of  a  fair  trial  by  the  evidence  that  came  in? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that's  the  constitutional  question. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  When  you  said  it  the  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

time,  you  had  "deprived  of  a  fair  trial"  and  then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  about  individualized  sentencing;  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  Is  that  supposed  to  indicate  that  this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deriving  both  from  the  Due  Process  Clause  and  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eighth  Amendment? 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  Well,  the  Eighth  Amendment  does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

speak  to  this  need  for  an  individualized  sentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination.  We  would  think  that  the  Due  Process 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause  also  requires  that  proceedings  be  individualized. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  we  would  agree  that  if  there  were  a  situation  where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  a  joint  trial  and  because  of  the  evidence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

introduced  by  one,  for  instance,  a  jury  simply  could  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  individualized  consideration  to  a  second  ­­ second 

   

 

 

 

 

 

defendant,  that  would  be  a  constitutional  problem. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

And  to  give  an  example  of  that  ­­ I  mean,  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  example  the  Court  suggests  in  Zafiro  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  where  there  is  aggravating  evidence  that  pertains 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  to  one  defendant,  but  that  that  aggravating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  is  just  so  prejudicial  and  so  overpowering  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  couldn't  really  separate  the  two  and  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inclined  to  sort  of  judge  the  second  one  by  association. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  think  that's  the  example  the  Court

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Don't  you  think 

  

 

 

 

individualized  consideration  is  required  even  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non­capital  cases? 

 

            

think  ­­

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  Absolutely,  Your  Honor.  So  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  It's  really  a  due  process 

   

  

 

 

 

consideration,  isn't  it? 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  I  think  due  process  encompasses 

    

 

 

 

 

that  requirement  of  individualized  consideration. 

 

 

 

 

            

Just  to  address  several  of  the  points  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

came  up  during  Petitioner's  argument,  I  think  ­­ as  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  that  Justice  Kagan  asked  about  whether, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  defendants  are  simply  pointing  the  finger  at  each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other,  that  would  necessitate  severance.  I  think  that's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  that  the  Court  addressed  in  Zafiro,  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  essentially  the  claim  the  defendants  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making,  that  we're  both  going  to  point  the  finger  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each  other  at  trial.  And  the  Court  said  that  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessitate  severance;  that  that  may,  in  fact,  increase 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury's  ability  to  reach  an  accurate  verdict,  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reach  an  accurate  assessment  of  relative  culpability, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  enhance  fairness.  So  we  don't  think  that  that's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation  that  would  require  severance.

strongest  evidence  for  Reginald  is  Temica's  testimony. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  ­­ it's  pretty  prejudicial.  She  said  he's  ­­ he's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  one  who  ­­ he  said  he's  the  one  who  shot. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  I  don't  think  that  that's 

    

 

 

 

 

prejudicial  evidence,  certainly  not  any  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  with  the  admission  of  that  evidence.  I  don't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  even  Reginald  Carr  is  asserting  that  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  couldn't  have  come  in  against  him.  Rather  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  asserting  or  the  State  below  suggested  ­­ the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  below  suggested  maybe  that  ­­ maybe  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  know  about  that  evidence,  and  maybe  just  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factual  matter  it  wouldn't  have  come  in. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  there's  no  constitutional  unfairness 

 

 

 

 

with  evidence  coming  in  on  a  co­defendant's  case  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

harmful  but  accurate  as  to  you.  That's  something  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  said  in  ­­ in  Zafiro.  If  it's  accurate  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant  evidence  that  comes  in  on  a  co­defendant's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

case,  there's  no  constitutional  unfairness  as  to  you. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  Reginald's  primary  claim  before  this 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  is  that  there  was  a  violation  of  State  evidentiary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  because  some  of  the  other  evidence,  the  evidence  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bad  influence,  might  not  have  come  in  under  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules.  I  think  this  Court's  cases  are  clear  that  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  of  State  evidentiary  law  is  simply  a  matter  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law.  The  State  could  decide  that  necessitates

reversal,  but  it's  not  a  constitutional  error.  That's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

what  this  Court  said  in  Romano. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  would  depend  on  what  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was,  wouldn't  it?  I  mean,  so  I'm  still  asking  the  same 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question.  If  the  ­­ I  take  it  that  Reginald  could  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  introduced  evidence  refuting  these  brothers'  state 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  mind  that  he  was  the  monster.  That's  what  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referring  to  by  the  bad  influence. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  jury  might  have  taken  that  evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  account  in  trying  to  decide  whether  Reginald,  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  reasons  than  in  the  statute,  was  a  sympathetic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough  character  not  to  provide  the  death  penalty. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  conceivable. 

 

            

But  severance  is  very,  very  rare,  and  joint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trials  are  very  common.  And  very  common  is  the  claim  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  appeal  in  any  kind  of  a  case  that  it  shouldn't  ­­ it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  have  been  severed. 

 

 

 

            

So  do  you  have  cases  that  you  can  think  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  be  good  precedent  for  you  where  a  court, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including  particularly  this  Court,  said,  of  course  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  be  a  little  prejudice  here,  some,  but  it's  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough  to  warrant  severance?  Because  I  think  what  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  do  is  read  the  record  on  this  point,  and  then  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need  something  to  compare  it  with.

like  to  answer  the  question  and  then  go  back  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

premise  ­­

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yes. 

  

 

MS.  KOVNER:  ­­ because  I  am  not  sure  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

agree  with  the  premise. 

 

 

 

            

But  as  to  whether  any  prejudice  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem,  I  think  the  best  case  for  us  is  Zafiro.  Zafiro 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talks  about  the  idea  that  what  you  need  ­­ that  joinder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  presumably  going  to  enhance  fairness  and  accuracy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  what  you  need  is  substantial  prejudice,  even  to  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  statutory  problem,  and  then  ­­ even  then  we  are  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  presume  that  a  limiting  instruction  would  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient  to  cure  it. 

 

 

 

            

point. 

            

So  that  would  be  our  best  case  on  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But,  Your  Honor,  I  think  the  inquiry  under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  Eighth  Amendment  has  to  be  would  the  Constitution 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  prohibited  this  evidence  from  coming  in  as  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reginald  Carr.  And  we  think  the  answer  is  no.  Any 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that's  relevant  to  an  individual  defendant  ­­

cases,  forgetting  the  death  cases,  seems  to  me  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  has  been,  look,  they  never  would  have  gotten 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  piece  of  evidence  in  against  my  client.  They

that  evidence  and  you'll  see  how  much  my  prejudice  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  my  client  was  prejudiced  by  that.

process.  Maybe  you  do.  But  that's  the  kind  of  argument

asked  the  question. 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  I  think  I  would  go  back  to 

    

   

 

 

 

 

Zafiro  again  on  that  one,  Your  Honor,  because  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Zafiro  establishes  that  when  accurate  evidence  comes  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  a  co­defendant  that  is  relative  ­­ that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

relevant  to  the  jury's  determination,  that's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice.  That's  information  that  may  enhance  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

accuracy  of  what  the  jury  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Can  you  tell  me  why  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  apply  the  Zafiro  standard,  which  was  joint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trials,  but  this  is  joint  sentencing  where  there  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  ­­ why  there  should  be  exactly  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  applied?

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ has  to  be  considered? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS.  KOVNER:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  We  agree  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

sentencings  may  involve  special  considerations.  What  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  Zafiro  establishes  is  that  generally  when  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant  information  is  placed  before  a  jury,  that's  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice  to  a  defendant,  that's  not  unfair,  and  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

juries  with  more  information  are  likely  to  make  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accurate  decisions,  and  we  think  that's  equally  true  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing. 

            

And,  similarly,  that  juries  with  more  ­­ who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  confronted  with  two  defendants  together  can  avoid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  unwarranted  disparities  that  may  occur  when  juries 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reach  different  results  ­­ two  different  juries 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considering  the  same  facts  reach  different  results  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  facts.  And  that's  equally  true  at  sentencing.

the  second  jury  have  to  know  the  facts  relevant  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigation,  as  well  as  aggravation,  I  suppose,  that  came 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  in  the  main  trial? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  It's  ­­ it's  certainly 

  

 

 

 

 

possible,  Your  Honor,  that  if  there  was  a  second  jury, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  could  simply  introduce,  for  instance,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  of  Reginald  Carr's  statement  to  his  sister  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  second  trial.  So  you're  introducing  this  disparity 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Justice  Kennedy  alluded  to  between  the  defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  goes  first  and  the  defendant  who  goes  second. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  would  this  second  jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  present  for  the  ­­ for  the  guilt  phase? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  Well,  in  ­­ in  the  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

system,  there  are  a  number  of  ways  you  could  do  it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Could  you  have  two  juries  that  hear  both  the  guilt  phase 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  the  penalty  phase.  You  could  have  a  second 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  impanelled  only  for  the  ­­ the  penalty  phase.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  in  a  case  like  this,  you  would  need  to  essentially 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

repeat  all  the  trial  evidence,  including  calling  victims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again,  because  that  ­­ because  the  State  was  relying  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  evidence  from  the  trial  phase,  and  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally,  we  submit,  going  to  be  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  think  I  missed  something 

    

   

 

 

you  said,  but  ­­ forgive  me.  But  the  constitutional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  that  you're  proposing,  is  that  a  constitutional

standard  for  both  the  guilt  phase  and  the  sentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phase?  And  is  it  also  for  both  non­capital  and  capital? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Are  you  drawing  no  distinctions  among  those  four  things? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  I  think  that's  right,  Your 

    

 

 

 

 

Honor.  I  mean,  that  ­­ because  we  think  that  the  due 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  standard  essentially  subsumes  the  requirement  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individualized  consideration,  and,  of  course,  due 

 

 

 

 

 

process  is  applicable  at  the  trial  phase  and  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  phase  in  capital  and  non­capital  trials. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  it  seems  a  little  bit 

   

  

 

 

 

 

counterintuitive  to  me,  the  idea  that,  you  know,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilt  phase  in  a  very  minor  crime  would  have  the  exact 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  standard  applicable  to  it  as  the  guilt  phase  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capital  crime  and  then  as  the  sentencing  phase  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capital  crime. 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  If  I  may  answer  really  briefly? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  we  think  the  reason  that's  the  case  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

joint  trials  often  enhance  accuracy  and  fairness.  So  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree  that  accuracy  and  fairness  considerations  are  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  paramount  in  capital  cases,  but  we  do  not  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  militates  for  a  different  standard  in  capital  cases 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  we  think  that  the  standard  that  the  courts  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applying  is  one  that's  going  to  generally  enhance  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

values.

Mr.  Liu. 

 

             

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  FREDERICK  LIU 

 

 

 

 

       

 

 

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT  IN  NO.  14­450 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  LIU:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  please 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

the  Court: 

 

              

I  want  to  begin  by  emphasizing  how  narrow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  rule  is.  Justice  Kagan  asked  the  question  involving 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ a  case  where  the  two  defendants  pointed  their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fingers  at  each  other.  We  are  not  advocating  a  rule 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  require  severance  in  any  case  where  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants  point  their  fingers  at  ­­ at  each  other. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  are  advocating  a  rule  that  this  Court  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  in  Zant,  Stringer,  in  Sanders,  that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  Eighth  Amendment  violation  occurs  when  the  weighing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  itself  is  skewed.  And  the  weighing  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  are  you  saying  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

severance  rule  is  the  same  in  non­capital  as  in  capital 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases? 

            

MR.  LIU:  The  general  severance  rule,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor,  is  the  same. 

 

 

 

            

prejudice? 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  you  just  look  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  LIU:  Exactly.  The  general  rule  is  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

can't  have  severance  when  it  would  compromise  someone's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  rights.  The  right  at  issue  here  just

happens  to  be  an  Eighth  Amendment  right,  but  we  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advocating  an  Eighth  Amendment  rule  that  would  apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  the  capital  context  or  even  beyond  the  penalty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phase.  That's  ­­

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You  know,  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

violated  an  individualized  sentence,  why  would  we  apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harmless  error  review?  Meaning,  it  seems 

  

 

 

 

 

counterintuitive.  We  are  now  becoming  the  sentencing  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  sentencing  body.  No? 

  

 

 

            

            

MR.  LIU:  Absolutely.  And  I  think  ­­

   

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Oh,  so  then  we  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  the  ­­ in  harmless  error,  we  have  to  decide  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  aggravators  outweighed  the  mitigators,  et  cetera,  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  that  none  of  the  error  could  have  affected  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choice? 

            

MR.  LIU:  Well,  this  Court,  Your  Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  in  Satterwhite  precisely  how  difficult  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  to  conduct  a  harmless  error  analysis  in  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty  phase,  and  that's  precisely  because  there  are  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  factors  involved. 

 

 

            

Sure,  the  crimes  in  the  case  were  horrific, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  that's  just  one  side  of  the  scale  in  a  harmless 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error  inquiry.  There  is  an  entire  other  side  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

balance,  the  mitigation  side.  And  so  it  is  quite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficult  for  this  Court,  on  a  cold  record,  to  go

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  ­­ I  ­­

    

   

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  We  have  to  do  it,  though,

jurisprudence. 

            

So  what  ­­ what  do  you  think  are  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  ­­ are  the  factors  that  would  suggest  the  jury  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  come  out  a  different  way  had  the  rule  that  you  urge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  adopted?  What  ­­ what  specifically?  One  is  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

shackling  of  the  ­­ of  the  co­defendant? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LIU:  Well,  we  are  not  representing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Reginald  Carr.  We're  not  basing  our  claim  around  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shackling.  Our  ­­ our  claim  revolves  around  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  Jonathan  presented  that  Reginald  had  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corrupting  influence  on  him  while  they  were  growing  up. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that  evidence,  as  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court  itself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held  at  Petition  Appendix  411,  falls  beyond  the  rubric 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  any  valid  sentencing  factor. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But,  Mr.  Liu,  I  mean,  given 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  kind  of  evidence  that  was  presented  in  this  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  idea  that  somebody  was  a  lousy  big  brother  seems 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty  small  on  ­­ in  the  ­­ in  the  scale  of  things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LIU:  Well,  a  few  responses  to  that.  To 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

begin  with,  I  think  Your  ­­ Your  Honor  is  understating 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  evidence  here.  This  wasn't  just  that  Reginald  was  a

lousy  big  brother.  It  was  that  he  did  things  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jonathan  that  turned  Jonathan  into  the  person  who  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capable  of  committing  and  even  leading  these  crimes.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  wasn't  just  "lousy  big  brother"  evidence,  this  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  Reginald  himself  was  the  source  of  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

caused  Jonathan  to  do  the  things  he  did. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But,  Your  Honor,  I  think  it's  also  important 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to  keep  in  mind  two  separate  parts  of  the  inquiry;  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  violation  and  the  harmless  error  analysis.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  said  in  Stringer  that  even  a  thumb  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scales  is  enough  to  skew  the  weighing  process  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  of  the  Eighth  Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  what  ­­ what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  shouldn't  have  been  admitted  wouldn't  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  admitted  in  the  ­­ in  the  separate  trial? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LIU:  Well,  all  this  evidence,  Mr.  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice,  that  says  Reginald  was  a  corrupting  influence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

on  his  brother,  that  wouldn't  have  come  in  in  a  separate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial  for  two  reasons:  Number  one,  as  the  Kansas 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme  Court  held  at  Petition  Appendix  411,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  was  improper,  nonstatutory,  aggravating 

 

 

 

 

evidence,  which  is  to  say,  all  the  aggravating  factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  the  prosecution  pursuit  in  this  case  all  had  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  with  the  circumstances  of  the  crime. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  this  evidence  had  nothing  to  do  with  the

circumstances  of  what  happened  on  December  15th,  it  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  with  the  defendant's  character  concerning 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  that  occurred  years,  even  decades,  before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  crimes  at  issue. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Now,  wait  a  minute. 

   

  

 

 

You're  ­­ you're  representing  the  brother  who  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  alleged  corrupting  influence,  right? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LIU:  That's  right,  the  corruptor. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  The  corruptor  was 

  

 

 

 

sentenced,  by  the  same  jury,  to  death.  So  how  could  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibly  be  that  without  the  corrupting  action  of  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

client,  the  jury  would  have  sentenced  your  client  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life  even  though  the  corruptee  was  sentenced  to  death? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  doesn't  seem  to  me  at  all  likely. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LIU:  Well,  to  begin  ­­ begin  with,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  Jonathan  Carr's  sentence  is  a  proper 

   

 

 

 

 

 

baseline  to  use.  As  my  friend  will  argue  in  a  few 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minute,  his  own  sentence  was  prejudiced  by  severance. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  even  moving  beyond  that,  there  is  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  to  believe  that  the  jury  viewed  Jonathan  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overall  more  culpable  than  Reginald.  After  all,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  never  established  who  the  shooter  was  here.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  believed  that  Jonathan  was  the  shooter,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  could  have  believed  that  Jonathan  was  so  culpable

various  sexual  acts  on  one  another.  They  demanded  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gunpoint  that  each  of  the  three  men  have  sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intercourse  with  both  women. 

 

 

 

            

Then  Reginald  drove  the  victims  one  by  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  various  ATMs  to  withdraw  cash.  Jonathan  raped  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attempted  to  rape  both  women  twice,  and  Reginald  raped 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Holly  G.,  who  later  testified,  once.  Placing  the  three 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

men,  still  naked,  in  the  trunk  of  one  of  their  cars,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cars  drove  all  five  to  a  soccer  field,  forced  them  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kneel  in  the  snow,  and  shot  them  execution­style  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  of  the  head. 

 

 

 

            

One  of  them,  fortuitously,  was  not  killed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  ­­ I  think  it  was  a  hair  clip  that  she  was 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wearing  deflected  the  bullet.  And  she  is  the  one  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testified  to  all  of  this  activity. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  you  truly  think  ­­ oh,  and  they  ran  over

her  too.  After  shooting  her  in  the  head,  the  car  ran 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  her. 

 

            

You  truly  think  that  this  jury,  but  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  your  client  was  a  corruptor,  would  not  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed  the  death  penalty? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LIU:  We  do,  Justice  Scalia.  In  your 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

own  opinion  in  last  term  in  Glossip,  you  noted  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

egregiousness  of  an  offense  is  just  one  factor  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determining  whether  a  sentence  is  appropriate  at  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

penalty  phase.  And  Reginald  Carr  submitted  a  week  and  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

half  full  of  mitigation  evidence  that  extenuated  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense. 

            

So  I  don't  ­­ I  think  when  you  ­­ when  you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  all  that  all  into  account  and  consider  the  fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  wasn't  an  easy  case  for  the  jury  ­­ the  jury, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  all,  deliberated  a  full  day  on  what  the  ­­ what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas  thinks  is  quite  an  easy  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

 

 

I  think  the  ­­ the  scales  of  the  weighing 

 

 

 

 

 

process  were  much  more  evenly  balanced  than  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Do  you  think  that  the  desire 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  spare  Holly  from  having  to  testify  more  than  once  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  relevant  factor  here?  And  if  so,  how  could  that  be  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  do  you  ­­ how  would  you  propose  to  accommodate  them? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LIU:  It's  not  a  relevant  factor  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that's  not  my  saying  it,  it's  this  Court  saying  it.

This  Court  in  Zafiro  and  Bruton  has  said  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits  of  joinder,  while  they  may  exist,  cannot  come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  price  of  constitutional  rights. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  while  I  ­­ I  completely  appreciate  that 

   

   

 

 

 

severance  would  require  some  duplication  of  resources, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  precisely  the  sort  of  benefit  that  this  Court  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  cannot  trump  the  Eighth  Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  if  you're  right,  joinder 

  

 

 

 

 

 

being  among  the  most  common  kind  of  thing  that  gangs  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drugs  and  so  forth,  why  won't  the  same  argument  be  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  and  over  preventing  ­­ requiring  severance  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dozens  and  dozens,  perhaps  hundreds  of  cases  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  tries  people  together?  Because  they  will  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  different  relationships  among  members  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gang.  Those  relationships  ­­ some  evidence  would  come 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  that  would  negative  the  relationship  that  would  tend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  show  that  this  particular  individual  wasn't  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  in  this  aspect  of  it,  et  cetera. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  why  my  experience  on  the  Courts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower  courts  particularly,  leads  me  to  think  it's  a  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rarely  accepted  argument,  severance. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LIU:  Well,  you're  right,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Breyer  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  that's  why  I'm

it  very  unusual  to  try  people  together,  which,  in  fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  very  usual.  And  so  when  you  told  me  there  is  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  thing  for  the  death  cases,  then  I  imagine  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  affect  every  criminal  trial  of  gangs  throughout 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  country. 

 

            

            

MR.  LIU:  Well,  I  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  that  is  something 

  

 

 

 

 

that's  concerning  me  and  I  am  looking  for  an  answer. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LIU:  You're  absolutely  right,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Breyer,  that  under  our  rule,  the  circumstances  of  each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  are  relevant.  But  I  think  what's  also  important 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ is  that  some  ­­ the  circumstances  of  some  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  not  get  rise  for  severance. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  what  I'm  looking 

  

 

 

 

 

for.  Why  is  it  you  believe  that  if  I  were  to  decide  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  favor  on  this  case  and  find  the  sufficient 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice  to  warrant  severance  here,  I  wouldn't  at  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  time  be  throwing  a  huge  monkey  wrench  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LIU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ into  the  ordinary  cases 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  gangs,  drugs,  et  cetera,  where  joinder  is  very  common 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  reversal  is  very  rare. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LIU:  Because  the  evidence  here  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

special  in  the  sense  that  it  fell  beyond  any  existing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  factor.

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Are  you  proposing  just 

  

 

 

 

 

separate  sentencing  hearings,  or  are  you  proposing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  juries  for  each  of  the  brothers? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LIU:  Well,  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  ordered  as  its  remedy  a  new  trial  with  two 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

juries,  but  I  don't  think  that  is  necessarily  going  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  the  required  remedy  in  every  case.  There  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  ways,  Justice  Ginsburg,  to  solve  the  problems 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  sentencing. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Let's  take  this  case.  If 

  

  

 

 

 

 

you  had  only  one  jury  and  Jonathan  goes  first,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury,  when  it  gets  to  Reginald's  case,  is  not  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forget  everything  it  heard  in  Jonathan's  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LIU:  You're  absolutely  right,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg.  I  don't  think  a  sequential  solution  with 

    

   

 

 

 

Jonathan  going  first  is  going  to  work  in  this  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precisely  because  the  jury  won't  ­­ you  won't  be  able  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unring  the  bell  of  the  ­­ precisely  the  evidence  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  is  prejudicial  in  this  case.  But  that's  not  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  a  sequential  solution  isn't  going  to  work  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  mine  run  of  cases. 

 

 

 

 

            

This  case  is  special  just  because  there  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  some  allegation  that  the  prejudice  ran  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways.

minute  you  defend  the  idea  of  two  different  juries,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  sacrifice  the  desirability  and  the  possibility  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistency. 

            

MR.  LIU:  Well,  Justice  Kennedy,  there  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

many  ways  that  States  have  developed  to  resolve  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  of  inconsistent  verdicts  among  different  juries. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One  way  is  what  the  Georgia  State  has  done,  which  is  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proportionality  review.  They  ask  the  appellate  courts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  look  across  many  sentences  to  see  if  they  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent. 

            

Another  way  the  Federal  government  has  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solution  to  this,  is  that  let  one  jury  know  how  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  jury  sentenced  the  other  defendant.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18  U.S.C.  3592(a)(4).  And  so  there  are  ways  to  solve 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  problem  of  inconsistent  verdicts  across  juries.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's  ­­

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  That  sounds  ­­ that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sounds  pretty  prejudicial  to  me.  If  the  second  case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  say,  oh,  the  jury  considered  this  and  individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances,  you  know,  these  people  act  together,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  way,  a  jury  of  your  peers  unanimously  found 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  this  guy  should  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentenced  to  death;  now  do  whatever  you  want  with  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guy.  That  sounds  pretty  prejudicial  to  me. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LIU:  Well,  it's  ­­ it's  ­­ if  you  think

that  is  prejudicial,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  then  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding  was  quite  prejudicial  too  because  the  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  asked  to  make  that  same  exact  comparison. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  specific  prejudice  we  are  alleging 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  is  ­­ is  unique  to  these  or  at  least  quite  ­­ quite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restricted  to  the  circumstances  of  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Liu,  could  you,  for  me, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  tell  me  what  is  the  specific  prejudice  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleging  here?  In  other  words,  tell  me  more  than  just, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

oh,  he  was  a  corrupting  influence.  What  evidence 

   

  

 

 

 

 

particularly  came  in  ­­

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LIU:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ and  why  do  you  think  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  have  mattered  to  the  jury?  Just  give  me  your, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like,  best  shot. 

 

 

            

MR.  LIU:  Sure.  Well,  Kansas  said  there  was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

no  expert  testimony  on  this,  but  that's  wrong. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dr.  Cunningham,  at  Joint  Appendix  pages  324  to  329, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explained  how  Jonathan  looked  up  to  Reggie,  and  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  they  would  get  together  they  would  do  drugs  heavily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

together,  that  when  ­­ that  when  they  were  ages  6  or  7, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reginald  prompted  someone  to  have  sex  with  Jonathan. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These  are  precisely  the  sort  of  evidence  that  shows  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

however  bad  you  think  Jonathan  is,  Reginald  is  worse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  Reginald  is  the  one  who  created  the  person

Jonathan  is. 

 

            

It's  in  a  sense  making  Reginald  doubly 

   

 

 

 

 

culpable  for  these  offenses;  that,  well,  whatever  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  Jonathan  did  ­­ and  yes,  as  Justice  Scalia  read, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  were  some  horrific  things  done  ­­ well,  Reginald 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  punished  for  not  only  everything  Reginald  did, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  also  everything  Jonathan  did. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  this  is  precisely  the  sort  of  evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  basically  transfers  all  of  Jonathan's  actions  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reginald.  And  that's  why  it's  so  prejudicial  when  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  in  the  jury  room,  it's  because  it  ­­ it  skews  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weighing  process. 

 

            

And  a  skewing  of  the  weighing  process  is  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

error  this  Court  has  recognized  for  30  years.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  something  that  we  ­­ we  came  up  special  for  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  This  Court  has  recognized  time  and  again  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  a  jury  is  told  to  consider  an  improper  element  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  weighing  process,  the  weighing  process  is  therefore 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

skewed.  And  the  only  thing  that  can  cure  that  error  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either  harmless  error  review  or  ­­

that  what  made  the  difference  was  the  fact  that  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

client  was  a  corrupting  influence  upon  his  younger 

   

 

 

 

 

 

brother? 

            

MR.  LIU:  Well,  Justice  Scalia,  the  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

never  established  the  identity  of  the  shooter,  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  key  horrific  act  in  this  case.  If  the  jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believed  Jonathan  was  the  shooter,  then  the  jury  might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  given  him  the  death  penalty  anyway  regardless  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  Reginald  did  to  him. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  doubt  whether  that  is  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

key.  You  really  think  that  that's  the  only  thing  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  is  going  to  be  focused  on,  is  who  pulled  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trigger?  My  Lord. 

  

 

            

MR.  LIU:  I  don't  think  it's  the  only  ­­ I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  it's  the  only  thing,  but  it's  certainly  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

main  thing  given  that  we  are  here  on  a  capital  murder 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charge. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Do  you  think  that  on  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

retrial  they  cannot  use  the  sister  to  prove  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reginald  claimed  he  was  the  shooter? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LIU:  No.  And  I  think  that  just 

   

  

  

 

 

 

highlights  exactly  how  narrow  our  rule  is.  That  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  Temica  said  that  Reginald  told  her  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reginald  was  the  shooter  goes  to  the  circumstances  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  crime.  And  that  sort  of  finger  pointing,  who  shot

who  on  the  day  of  the  crime,  is  going  to  fall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comfortably  within  an  existing  sentencing  factor,  and  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  result,  is  not  going  to  skew  the  weighing  process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  the  only  issue  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  was  prejudicial  was  that  he  was  a  corruptor? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  LIU:  Absolutely. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  evidence. 

  

 

 

MR.  LIU:  And  for  reasons  I  ­­ I  gave  to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan,  that  evidence  was  extremely  prejudicial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  skewed  the  weighing  process  because  it  transferred 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jonathan's  culpability  back  onto  Reginald's  shoulders. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  I  may,  I'd  just  like  to  address  a  few 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

points  raised  by  my  friend  from  Kansas.  He  said  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions  solve  the  problem.  Well,  none  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions  told  the  jury  to  consider  this  evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  corrupting  influence  only  as  to  Jonathan. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  on  the  contrary,  the  instructions  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instruction  No.  2  told  the  jury  consider  the  evidence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable  to  each  defendant.  Well,  this  evidence  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

equally  applicable  to  Reginald  as  it  was  to  Jonathan. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

After  all,  it  was  Reginald  ­­ Reginald's  actions  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  at  issue. 

 

 

            

My  friends  also  point  to  the  instruction  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  aggravators.  But  that  disregards  an  entire 

  

 

 

 

 

 

swath  of  evidence  that  the  jury  heard  that  it  could

consider  against  Reginald.  This  was  evidence, 

  

 

 

 

 

anti­mitigation  evidence  that  the  jury  considered,  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  caused  them  to  remove  weight  from  the  mitigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side  of  the  scale.  And  the  instructions  left  the  jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely  free  to  consider  this  evidence  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anti­mitigation. 

            

 

 

My  friends  also  suggest  that  I'm  here  only 

 

 

 

 

 

arguing  an  error  of  State  law.  Well,  no  less  than  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners  were  in  Zant,  Stringer,  and  ­­ and  Sanders. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Each  of  those  cases  recognizes  that  a  skewing  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weighing  process  has  to  be  based  on  State  law  premises. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  why  this  Court  in  Zant  went  so  far  as  to  certify 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  question  to  the  Georgia  Supreme  Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Yes,  it's  true  that  to  understand  the  effect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  weighing  process,  you  have  to  look  at  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  But  the  mere  admission  of  evidence  isn't  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causes  the  violation  here.  It's  the  admission  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence,  followed  by  the  fact  the  jury  was  required  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider  it.  And  it  was  required  to  consider  it  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  part  and  parcel  of  Jonathan's  mitigating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence. 

            

And  this  Court  has  said  time  and  again  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  defendant  has  a  constitutional  right  for  the  jury,  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  to  consider  but  to  listen  to  a  defendant's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigating  evidence.  So  by  considering  this  evidence

for  Jonathan,  the  jury  necessarily  considered  it  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reginald.  After  all,  if  you're  told  that  Reginald  had  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corrupting  influence  on  Jonathan,  you  can't  separate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  as  something  for  Jonathan  and  something  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reginald.  It's  equally  applicable  to  both. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

My  friend  also  suggested  that  we  ­­ we 

 

 

 

 

 

rejected  a  two­jury  solution  before  trial.  Well,  we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

rejected  that,  not  because  of  it  wouldn't  work  to  solve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  prejudice  in  the  penalty  phase,  but  because  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  work  to  solve  any  prejudice  in  the  guilt  phase. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  remember,  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court  found 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  was  actually  error  to  keep  the  guilt  phase 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

joined,  so  we  were  perfectly  appropriate  in  objecting  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  two­jury  solution  at  that  phase  of  the  trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Can  you  explain  that 

  

 

 

 

 

again?  I  thought  you  ­­ you  sought  only  a  severance  at 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  sentencing  phase. 

 

 

            

MR.  LIU:  No.  That's  not  ­­ that's  not  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You  sought  severance 

  

 

 

 

totally? 

            

MR.  LIU:  Exactly.  Prior  to  trial,  on  pages 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

25  and  26  of  the  Joint  Appendix,  we  moved  for  severance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  entire  thing. 

 

 

 

            

And  if  you  look  at  those  pages,  you'll  see

Well,  his  attorney  was  exactly  right. 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  exactly  what  happened  many  months  later.

MR.  GREEN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it

to  you,  was  ­­ was  depressed  and  schizophrenic. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That  is  ­­ that  is  a  unique  illustration  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  how  different  these  two  defendants  were  in  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presentation,  and  why,  again,  a  sequential  penalty 

   

 

 

 

 

phase,  even  if  they  had  been  separate,  wouldn't  work. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Reginald  says  he  didn't  want  to  hear  or  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  it  would  be  prejudicial  if  the  jury  heard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  from  the  ­­ from  the  ­­ from  Jonathan's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses  about  Reginald  being  a  ­­ a  corrupting 

   

   

 

 

 

influence.  On  the  other  side,  Jonathan  doesn't  want  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  to  hear  from  Reginald's  expert. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  to  answer  your  question,  Justice  Kagan, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  the  evidence  that  would  not  have  been  introduced. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Justice  Woltersdorf's  ­­ or  excuse  me  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dr.  Woltersdorf's  testimony  about  incurable  sociopathy 

 

 

 

 

 

would  not  have  been  relevant  or  admissible  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Maybe  I'm  missing  something, 

  

 

 

 

 

but  if  ­­ if  your  client's  strategy  was  to  make  Reginald 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  bad  ­­ the  bad  actor  in  the  case,  why  didn't  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  actually  go  hand  in  hand  with  your  client's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strategy,  which  was  to  say  it's  all  on  Reginald? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  One  ­­ one  would  think  that  it

The  problem  was  that  ­­ that  the  fact  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  two  brothers  were  sitting  together  allowed  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutors  to  repeatedly  paint  them  with  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brush. 

            

And  ­­ and  if  we  take  a  look,  for  example, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  JA  402,  the  prosecutor  says  to  the  jury  in  her 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opening  argument  at  the  beginning  of  the  penalty  ­­ or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  conclusion  of  the  penalty  phase,  ladies  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gentlemen,  they  have  the  same  eye  color.  They  are  now 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wearing  glasses,  although  their  mother  said  Reginald 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  need  them,  they  share  some  DNA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  this  ­­ maybe  you  can,

That  is  the  legal  problem  that  is  worrying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me.  And  you  will  either  cure  that  worry  or  say  I've

say  could  they  make  a  reliable  judgment?  Now,  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

sounds  harder  on  you,  because  if  all  you  have  to  show  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  error  was  harmful,  it  sounds  like  an  easier  task  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  than  to  show  that  the  juror  ­­ jury  wasn't

reliable.  Or  are  they  the  same  thing  in  your  opinion? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Well,  let  me  ­­ I  think  they're 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  thing  and  I  think  that's  a  generalization,  but 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

we've  ­­ we've  offered  a  test  that  actually  specifies  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  little  bit  more,  Justice  Breyer. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

In  terms  of  saying  that  ­­ that  the  test 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  whether  there  is  a  reasonable  risk  ­­ and  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  explain  the  difference  between  reasonable  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious  in  a  minute  ­­ but  whether  there  was  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  risk  that  there  would  be  evidence  introduced, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material,  prejudicial  evidence  introduced  that  would  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would,  in  fact,  not  have  been  introduced  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

severed  penalty­phase  proceeding. 

 

 

            

And  to  go  back  to  Justice  Kagan's  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  intuitive  difference  between  these  two  things, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  between  ­­ excuse  me  ­­ trials  and  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty­phase  proceedings,  the  answer  is  that's  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  ­­ in  a  trial,  the  ­­ the  relative  culpability  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  defendants  makes  a  big  difference  with  respect  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

who's  a  conspirator,  who's  not  a  conspirator,  who's  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

principal,  who's  an  aider  and  abettor. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  when  we  turn  to  the  penalty  phase,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry  changes,  as  Mr.  Liu  indicated  ­­ it  changes  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  what  happened  to  who  this  person  is  and  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  not  the  jury  wants  to  put  this  person  to  death.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Who  ­­ who  ­­ if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  separate  proceedings,  who  ­­ who  gets  to  go  second? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because  obviously  that  person  will  have  a  significant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

advantage  since  they'll  see  all  of  the  evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented  in  the  ­­ in  the  other  proceeding. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GREEN:  Well,  in  ­­

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  most  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  here  was  overlapping,  so  that  at  least  you'll 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  ­­ you'll  be  able  to  see  what  the  State  thought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  that  evidence.  You  have  sort  of  a  dry  run  if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  the  second  person. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Well,  in  this  case, 

  

 

 

 

 

respectfully,  no,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  because  what  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  State  basically  said  was  we're  relying  on  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  from  the  ­­ from  the  trial  phase  ­­ or  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilt  phase  of  this  capital  trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  exactly  what  the  prosecutor  told  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurors  when  they  turned  in  to  the  penalty  phase,  and  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  prosecution  did  in  the  penalty  phase  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cross­examine  the  defense  witnesses. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  that 

  

 

 

 

 

cross­examination  is  important. 

 

 

            

Were  there  any  common  defense  witnesses? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  There  were  family  members. 

  

 

 

 

 

So  ­­ so  it  is  true  ­­

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  at  least  it  would

who  goes  second  to  know,  well,  what  did  the  prosecutor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talk  ­­ how  did  the  prosecutor  attempt  to  cross­examine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  witness,  because  I  am  going  to  call  the  same 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witness,  and  her  testimony  is  going  to  be  a  lot  better 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  second  time  around  because  you  will  know  exactly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  cross­examination  questions  are  going  to  be. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  That  might  happen.  I  ­­ it  ­­

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  could  well  be  that  that  would  be  ­­ I  would  consider 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  ­­ a  minor  advantage,  Your  Honor.  But  that  could 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

be  handled  by  the  judge  in  ­­ with  protective  orders, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  orders  about  ­­ rules  against  witnesses  and  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

folks  in  the  courtroom  who  will  have  another  proceeding. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  would  submit  ­­ and  then  with  respect 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  witnesses  who  might  have  been  traumatized  by  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

events,  that  ­­ the  ­­ you  know,  a  trial  court  could 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

easily  have  a  simultaneous  penalty  proceedings  so  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  witness  would  only  have  to  testify  once.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense  team  on  one  side  wouldn't  get  an  advantage  over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other.  There  would  be  two  juries  in  two  different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courtrooms,  same  week,  same  days,  the  ­­ the  witness  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  back  and  forth  between  courtrooms,  and  there  is  none

would  have  to  put  on,  basically,  its  guilt  phase  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again  at  the  penalty  phase,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Yes,  it  would  have  to  do  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  I  would  imagine  that  ­­ that  with  respect  to  cases 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  this,  the  defense  attorneys  are  going  to  move  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  what  counts  as  stipulations;  we  will  read 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  I  am  sure  you'd  like 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to  stipulate  to  all  the  facts  that  were  proven  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilt  phase,  but  I  doubt  that  the  State  is  going  to  want 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  stipulate  to  those. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GREEN:  And  the  State  might  do  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  again,  I  think  a  trial  judge  could 

   

   

 

 

 

easily  handle  that  by  expediting  matters.  And  this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  happens  in  a  lot  of  the  Federal  trials.  I  would 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

refer  the  Court  to  the  ­­ to  the  brief  of  the  Promise  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Initiative  which  shows  that  when  we  have  joint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trials,  we  get  joint  results.  When  we  have  severed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trials,  we  get  severed  results.  25  for  25,  joint 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trials,  same  result  for  the  defendants. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Woodson  says  we  must  have  individualized 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  at  the  penalty  phase,  so  I  do  not  see  why  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Zafiro  test  would  not  ­­ would  ­­ would  work  for  penalty

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  how  is  that  different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

from  what  the  government  said? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  I  ­­ so  I  think  we  ought  to 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

lower  the  risk  standard.  We  ought  to  lower  the  risk 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  to  a  reasonable  risk  standard,  not  ­­ and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what  we  propose  in  our  brief  at  page  15.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  lower  the  standard  because  that  would  recognize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  acute  need  for  reliability  and  accuracy  when  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes  to  penalty  phase  proceedings  and  the  decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  somebody  is  going  to  live  or  die. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You  said  you  were  going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  make  a  distinction  between  serious  and  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

earlier. 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Right.  So  a  serious  risk  may  be 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

treated  as  a  ­­ as  a  preponderance  or  a  ­­

   

   

   

 

 

 

  

or  above. 

 

With  respect  to  reasonable,  we're  at  a  ­­ we're  at  a  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ maybe  a  likelihood.  Maybe  that's  ­­ maybe  that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

perceived  as  30  percent  versus  55  percent  or  60  percent, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  like  that. 

 

 

            

And  indeed,  this  Court  said  in  Boyde,  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  reasonable  likelihood,  that  is  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preponderance  standard.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr.  McAllister,  five  minutes. 

 

 

 

       

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  STEPHEN  R.  McALLISTER 

 

 

 

 

 

                

ON  BEHALF  OF  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

              

I  will  try  to  be  brief.  The  only  Eighth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  implication  that  this  Court  has  recognized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  really  applies  to  this  case  is  I  go  back  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Romano  case  where  the  Court  said  the  admission  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  might  or  might  not  be  in  violation  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law  is  not  an  Eighth  Amendment  concern.  The  only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  the  Eighth  ­­ Eighth  Amendment  comes  into  play  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  the  evidence  is  ­­ involves  constitutionally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protected  conduct. 

 

            

An  example  would  be  Dawson  v.  Delaware, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  they  sought  a  capital  sentence.  He  was  a  member 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

of  the  Aryan  Brotherhood  in  prison.  It  had  nothing  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  with  an  aggregating  factor.  That  was  First 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment­protected  activity.  The  Court  said  that  kind 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  thing  could  be  an  Eighth  Amendment  problem  if  you  use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  against  the  defendant. 

 

 

 

            

Their  cases  ­­ I  could  be  wrong,  but  I  think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  their  cases,  Zant,  Stringer,  the  others  that  they

admission  of  evidence,  they  are  about  invalid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravating  factors.  So  you've  basically  told  the  jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  something  else,  literally,  on  the  scale,  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravating  factor  that  later  the  State  says,  no,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  ­­ that  was  not  correct,  that  should  not  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there.  That's  distinguishable  from  this  case. 

  

 

 

 

 

              

I  ­­ I  agree  completely  with 

   

 

 

Justice  Scalia's  point,  and  the  dissenting  justice  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  in  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court:  If  the  evidence  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corrupting  influence  evidence  was  so  prejudicial  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reginald,  why  did  Jonathan  also  get  a  death  sentence? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  would  close  by  saying  that  we  all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree,  I  think,  that  the  Constitution  values  accuracy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and  fairness.  But  it  also  values  finality.  And  each  of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  individuals  received  an  individualized  sentence, 

 

 

 

 

 

presented  all  the  evidence  they  wanted  to.  The  jury  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructed  to  consider  them  individually.  And  if  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  to  undo  this  now,  it  would  be  very  difficult  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas  to  go  back.  We'd  be  talking  about  having  to  redo 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  the  guilt  phase  evidence.  And,  again,  you  get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  questions,  separate  proceedings,  traumatizing 

 

 

 

 

victims  yet  again.  None  of  that  is  necessary,  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  end  of  the  day  they  got  a  fundamentally  fair

sentencings  didn't  need  to  be  severed,  didn't  the  Kansas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  hold  on  another  ground  that  they  were  entitled  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  new  trial? 

 

 

            

MR.  McALLISTER:  Yes.  So  that's  the  third 

  

  

 

 

 

 

question  presented  in  the  Petition,  which  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding  is  that  is  something  the  Court  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reconsider.  It's  not  denied.  The  Court  granted 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Questions  1  and  3. 

   

 

            

The  other  question  that  we  presented  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  other  ground  that  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court  gave  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reversal,  that's  a  Confrontation  Clause  violation  in 

   

 

 

 

 

terms  of  some  of  the  hearsay  evidence  presented  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  proceedings. 

 

            

So  if  the  Court  were  to  reverse  on  these, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deny  on  that  question,  then  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could,  in  fact,  rely  on  that  ground.  But  our  hope  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  that  the  Court  would  do  something  different  than  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  reverse  on  these  two  questions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Unless  there  are  further  questions,  thank
