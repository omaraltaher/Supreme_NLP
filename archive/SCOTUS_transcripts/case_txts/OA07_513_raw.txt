 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 
first today in Case 07-513 , Herring v.  United States.

 Miss Karlan.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 MS. KARLAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice 

and may it please the Court:

 In February 2004, the Dale County circuit 

clerk told the local sheriff's department that the court 
was recalling a warrant that had been issued earlier for 
Petitioner's arrest.  Having received that notice, 
someone in the sheriff's department physically removed 
the warrant from the file and physically took the 
warrant back to the court clerk's office.  But no one 
either then or later in the sheriff's department ever 
updated the computer file to indicate that the record 
had -- that the warrant had been recalled.  As a result 
of that police department error, the Petitioner in this 
case was subject to a warrantless arrest for which there 
was no probable cause five months later.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Didn't they have 

some regular system for updating the computer base?  I 
mean, I assume it was updated at some point.

MS. KARLAN:  No.  Your Honor.  There was 

no -- there's nothing in the record to suggest that this 
department ever does, for example, what the FBI does, 
which is to conduct periodic audits.  Had they conducted 
one, they would have discovered almost instantly what 
they discovered five months later, which was there was 
no warrant in this case.  So this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So people who are, 
you know, the warrant is served, they're arrested, they 
go to trial, they're in jail, their name still shows up 
as having a warrant out for their arrest.

 MS. KARLAN:  We don't know, Mr. Chief 

Justice, because this is a department that as far as the 
record reflects conducts no audits of any kind to update 
its files.  And if you look at page 41 and page 60 of 
the joint appendix, one of the things you'll discover 
about this department is that everyone in the department 
has access to the physical place warrants are kept. 
They're kept in several different places in the office.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well then, how did 

this warrant clerk, I guess is what I'd call her, 
discover the error?  She discovered it within 10 or 15 
minutes, right.

 MS. KARLAN:  She discovered it because what 
happened is a clerk in another police department called

and said, is there a warrant for Petitioner's arrest. 
She looked at the computer list on her computer and said 
yes.  Then this other warrant clerk said, please fax us 
a physical copy of the warrant.  So she went to the file 
where the warrant should have been.  It wasn't there. 
She went to another file.  The warrant wasn't there. 
She then called the court clerk's office and discovered 
that they had recalled the warrant which was back in 
their records five months earlier.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why did the first --

first person in that scenario need a physical copy of 
the warrant?

 MS. KARLAN:  The record doesn't reflect 

that, but she simply I guess wanted to verify that there 
actually was a warrant because they were picking 
Petitioner up in a different county.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Does your argument depend on 

the quality of the recordkeeping in this particular 
department?  I thought your argument would apply even if 
this department had excellent recordkeeping procedures 
but nevertheless made a mistake in this instance.

 MS. KARLAN:  That's correct, Justice Alito. 

Our view is, just as is true with respect to probable 
cause, the fact that 99 percent of a department's 
arrests are with probable cause doesn't mean that when

they arrest someone without probable cause you say, 
well, you get one bite at the apple or a sort of "good 
enough for government work" theory.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  You're not asking for 

Arizona v. Evans to be overruled are you.

 MS. KARLAN:  No.  We're asking to you apply 
Arizona v.  Evans.  And if I could give an answer to the 
question the Chief Justice was asking earlier that comes 
from Arizona v. Evans, what happened in Arizona v. Evans 
-- and Justice Stevens mentions this in his dissent 
there -- is the clerk discovered there, the court clerk 
discovered, that the warrant that had been, that she had 
verified, had in fact been recalled.  And so what they 
instantly did is they checked their files, and they 
discovered four other warrants from that same day that 
had been recalled but that were still in their files.

 Here we didn't have anything done after they 

discovered the error.  They discovered this error and, 
as they say, have gone on their merry way.  There's 
nothing in this record --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, there was 

something done in this particular case, though, right? 
The warrant clerk notified -- was it the Coffee County 
people?

 MS. KARLAN:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- that the warrant 
-- that the information she had given 10 minutes before 
was inaccurate.

 MS. KARLAN:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.  And 

that indicates part of what we're concerned about here, 
which is this is a department that was built for speed, 
not for accuracy.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But none of that matters for 

your argument, does it?

 MS. KARLAN:  Oh, no.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  You want to make it -- you 

want to draw a clear line between errors by -- by 
clerical court employees versus errors by police 
employees.

 MS. KARLAN:  That's correct.  We think 

that's the most workable argument, because what we want 
is a system in which suppression hearings can be 
conducted expeditiously based on the facts of particular 
cases.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  How expeditious would it be 

-- suppose there's negligence on the part of both a 
court employee and a police department employee.  What 
is the judge supposed to do in deciding the suppression 
motion?  Is this a comparative negligence determination.

 MS. KARLAN:  I don't think it would be

exactly a comparative negligence determination.  I think 
it -- that raises a difficult question and the way I 
would approach that question is to perhaps use some of 
what Justice Kennedy talked about in Hudson as a 
causation approach.  That is, if but for the negligence 
of the police department there would have been --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought negligence is 

irrelevant here.  I think if the police department was 
wrong, even if they had been very careful but for some 
reason or other they made a mistake -- so you're arguing 
for shear causality, not for negligence.  If negligence 
made the difference then we'd have to go into these 
factors that you say are very difficult to calculate.
 MS. KARLAN:  Well, Justice Scalia, I was 

answering Justice Alito's question and if I could just 
give a little bit of --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I know you were answering 
his question, but you want to answer it in a way that's 
consistent with your argument here.

 MS. KARLAN:  Well, it is, Justice Scalia. 

So let me explain why it's consistent, which is our 
position is if police department error causes an 
unconstitutional arrest then you should suppress 
evidence, but if both the police were negligent and the 
clerk was negligence and the police department's

negligence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You've injected the word 

"negligence."

 MS. KARLAN:  Okay, let me take the word 

"negligence" out then.  If the police error didn't cause 
the discovery of the evidence --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Alone, but --
MS. KARLAN:  -- that's correct.
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

  

-- there is dual 

causality.

 MS. KARLAN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It isn't a matter of simple 

negligence.

 MS. KARLAN:  No, that's correct.  That's 

correct.

keep --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How is it going to 

JUSTICE ALITO:  How are -- how are you going 

to determine whether there's error without determining 
whether there's negligence?  Suppose the court clerk 
calls up the police department and says the warrant is 
still outstanding, and in fact it's not.  And it sends 
them over a physical copy of a warrant, but that warrant 
has been withdrawn.  Now, the police could always take 
additional steps:  They could send someone over to check 

9


Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

the records, to look at the court docket to make sure 
that the warrant had not been withdrawn.  So there would 
be causality, but it would not determine what they 
should --

MS. KARLAN:  There would be no police error 

there.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  --

what their duty was. 

How are you going to determine where this error should 
be -- should be assigned?

 MS. KARLAN:  Because in that case there 

would be no police error.  What this Court held in Evans 
is that police departments are entitled to rely on the 
representations of court clerks that there are warrants. 
So if the court clerk erroneously sends a warrant over, 
the police are not required to look behind that warrant, 
just as they're not required in Evans.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me give you another 

example.  Suppose that the court clerk calls up and says 
-- it leaves a message, gives a message to somebody in 
the police department.  And they memorialize that, and 
they say "called up."  And let's say the warrant number 
is the same as the docket number of this case.  So the 
court employee says -- writes down "Called up," says, 
"Warrant quashed in warrant, in case 07-513."  The court 
-- the police department has a record of the call, and

they say, "Received call from court clerk.  Warrant to 
be quashed.  Warrant quashed in case 07-531."  And so 
the 513 is not quashed; the person is arrested.  Now, 
who caused that?  You have to have a hearing?

 MS. KARLAN:  The police -- the police 

department person caused that by writing down the wrong 
number.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  How do you know that the 

police department wrote down the wrong number?

 MS. KARLAN:  Well, it's the same question as 

--

was --

JUSTICE ALITO:  How do you know what number 

MS. KARLAN:  Well, it's the same question as 

in Evans:  How do we know who made the mistake?  That 
question, just like the question -- is a question on 
which you're going to have to hold a hearing because 
Evans says if it was court error, there is no 
suppression; and our position is, if it was police 
error, there is.  But that's a very manageable hearing.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just so I have your theory 
firmly in mind, you would say there is police error even 
if what happened was that there was an unpredictable and 
unavoidable computer glitch, no negligence on anybody's 
part?  The computer simply malfunctioned, got it wrong. 

11 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

It wasn't negligence.  You would still say that that is 
police error, and you would say that that counts against 
the admission of --

MS. KARLAN:  That's correct.  As long as 

it's police error, it counts against the police.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why, if there is no 

negligence?  Why do you need to argue that and why do 
you argue that?  I mean doesn't there have to be at 
least negligence on somebody's part?

 MS. KARLAN:  Well, here's the problem: 

There are two kinds of negligence you might have; that 
is, you might have the negligence of an individual 
employee, or what you might have is a decision to use a 
shoddy recordkeeping system that doesn't catch those 
errors.  So the question is --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, either of those 

things are negligence or worse.

 MS. KARLAN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So what I didn't understand 

is why you would charge the police with anything or 
suppress a warrant where there was a mistake but no one 
was negligent or worse.

 MS. KARLAN:  Well, we have had some 

difficulty finding any reported cases in which there is 
a police error of the kind of computer glitch that was

just hypothesized.  That is where the machines --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But what you argued for --
MS. KARLAN:  Yes.  What --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- you said, it should be 
suppressed even if no one is negligent or worse.  And I 
have trouble seeing why you're suppressing a warrant 
where no one does anything wrong at all.

 MS. KARLAN:  Well, part of what I'm trying 
to get at in my answer to your question is it's unclear 
in that situation whether anyone has done something 
wrong; that is, whether somebody in the police 
department programmed the police department computer --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let's just assume the 

hypothetical -- the hypothetical:  The computer 
malfunctions.

 MS. KARLAN:  Well, you could have an act of 

God exception to exclusionary rule, if you wanted to, 
but this case doesn't ask you to do that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm sure a computer might 

be compared to God, but let's --

(Laughter.)

You're saying that the question is whether anybody did 
anything wrong at all.  This is not undisputed, that 
this person was illegally arrested?  The arrest itself 
violated the Fourth Amendment.

 MS. KARLAN:  There is no question that as a 

matter of fact --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  The question is whether it 

can be justified.

 MS. KARLAN:  Yes.  This was a warrantless 
arrest without probable cause.  And the question is: 
Does the government have some sort of affirmative 
defense as to why it should be allowed to use this? 
Now, in Evans --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's a separate 

question.  It may be an illegal arrest, but the question 
is the separate one of whether or not you exclude the 
evidence collected incident to that arrest.  And we 
have, in several cases, separated the two questions, and 
I guess it's difficult for me to see if no one has done 
anything wrong, no one, why you would suppress the 
evidence in that case.

 MS. KARLAN:  Well, that case of course is 

not this case, and you might want to leave open the 
question of the --

this difficulty:  Do we have to get into negligence, or 
should we assume, as I understand to be your theory, as 
Justice Breyer put it, that you would still suppress the 
evidence when no one has done anything wrong?

 MS. KARLAN:  We are asking in this case for 

you to suppress when someone has done something wrong.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But how do you know?  How 

do you know?  That's the problem.

 MS. KARLAN:  Well, we do know that someone 

did something wrong here, because we know --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But we want an answer --
MS. KARLAN:  No, I'm trying to answer --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We want an answer to the 

question.

 MS. KARLAN:  No, I'm trying --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let's assume no one did 

anything wrong.

 MS. KARLAN:  I know.  I'm trying to answer 

that question.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- because this bears on 

the fact of why are we doing this at all.

 MS. KARLAN:  No.  I'm trying to answer that 
question, and the point I wanted to make is:  This case 
asks for a narrow rule, but the question that you may 
also want to be thinking about here is how to have a

workable suppression hearing.  And if you require 
showings of different levels of fault, rather than 
asking was this police-generated error, the suppression 
hearings are going to be somewhat more cumbersome.  So 
you have a choice.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Exactly.  You give 

something, you get something.  If you adopt a negligence 
theory, the --

MS. KARLAN:  We would be happen with the 

negligence theory.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- the noose is not as 

wide, but on the other hand it's a lot harder to 
calculate whether you -- every case involves an inquiry 
into whether there's police negligence or not.

 MS. KARLAN:  That's exactly what I'm --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  A much easier rule, was 

there a warrant or not?  If there wasn't, end of the --
end of the inquiry.

 MS. KARLAN:  Well, that's exactly why I --

why I said I think the easier rule for judges faced with 
suppression hearings is a rule that says --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I don't know what 

the underlying law is here.  I mean -- I guess it's 
little weird, but what happens if the policeman arrests 
the wrong person, but it's nobody's fault?  You know,

the person was pretending to be his brother.
 MS. KARLAN:  Well, that's like --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Or the mother said it's 

John and it's really Joe.  And so, the policeman wasn't 
at fault.  They arrest the wrong person.  I guess that's 
happened in history --

MS. KARLAN:  Sure.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- but do they suppress 

things then?  I wouldn't think so --

MS. KARLAN:  Well, there are two different 

--

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- but maybe they do.
 MS. KARLAN:  There are two different kinds 
of cases where police arrest people:  One set of cases 
where the policeman is arresting on the basis of 
probable cause, and there, there's a lot of room for 
error that is based on the facts.  The mother told him 
it was Joe when it was really John.  That's good enough, 
good enough, because that's probable cause.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But do we suppress?
 MS. KARLAN:  No, you do not --
JUSTICE BREYER:  We do not?  Okay.
 MS. KARLAN:  There was not even a Fourth --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So there's no reason then,

of the policeman, none, it was just a weird 
circumstance, then I don't understand why we would 
suppress here.  And nor do I understand why you have to 
argue this because I thought it's clear here that there 
is error, and it was negligently caused.  There were 
four months that went by without anybody doing anything 
about this mistake.

 MS. KARLAN:  No.  That's correct.  If I can 
just say one thing that will make this perhaps a little 
clearer, Justice Breyer, you would not even find a 
Fourth Amendment violation in the first place in the 
hypothetical you gave because there was probable cause 
to arrest.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't there probable cause 

here?

 MS. KARLAN:  Probable cause to do what?
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  He thought he had a 

warrant; he had probable cause to arrest.

 MS. KARLAN:  There is no such thing as 
probable cause to believe there's a warrant.  You 
yourself in Hudson said it's a bright-line rule.  Either 
there's a warrant or there isn't.  Here there was no 
warrant.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's just 

rephrasing it.  It's probable cause based on the

existence of a warrant, and it turns out to be there is 
a mistake in the warrant.

 MS. KARLAN:  This Court has never said that 

before, which is it's not probable cause to believe 
there's a crime because there's a warrant.  It's --
you've always separated those two lines of cases for --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't seem to make 

sense, though.  Why should we separate the two?
 MS. KARLAN:  Well, because here --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If the policeman is 

mistaken about whether he saw this guy picking 
somebody's pocket, he's mistaken about that, and in that 
case, the search is -- the product of the search is 
admitted.  In the other case he's mistaken about whether 
there was a warrant.  Why do you want to draw a line 
between those two?

 MS. KARLAN:  Well, for two reasons:  One is, 

even in the probable cause case, if the reason he 
thought there was probable cause is another officer told 
him there was probable cause and that officer was wrong, 
this Court said in Leon you continue to suppress.  Here, 
this police officer was told by other police personnel 
that there was a warrant, and there wasn't.  So it's a 
case just like the cases post-Leon -- you suppress when 
the chain of information is fatally flawed by police

error, which is what happened here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, you would impose 
a burden on the officer on the street serving a warrant? 
When he gets the call saying there's a warrant, he's 
supposed to say, "Are you sure?  Did you double-check 
with the clerk?  When was the last time they updated the 
computer system?  I don't want to go through all this if 
the evidence is going to be suppressed."  At every chain 
in command, you would impose that burden.

 MS. KARLAN:  No, I would not, Mr. Chief 

Justice, because if you announce that police error is 
going to lead to the suppression of evidence, the police 
will do a better job of maintaining their records.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, but I mean I 

don't know what the situation is like --

MS. KARLAN:  And then you won't have this 

problem.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't know what 
the situation is like in Dale County.  They probably 
don't have the latest version of WordPerfect, or 
whatever it is.  They are probably making do with 
whatever they can under their budget and doing the best 
they can.

 MS. KARLAN:  But there's not a Barney Fife 

defense to the violation of the Fourth Amendment either.

If a department is having its records kept the way they 
are keeping them here, then suppression is the only 
thing that tells them:  You're going to have to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you said this 
wasn't anything in the record about what type of program 
they might have, whether they were updated.  They found 
the mistake in ten minutes.

 MS. KARLAN:  Which suggests if they had been 
doing a good job of maintaining their records all along, 
this violation never would have occurred.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what's the 

justification for drawing a distinction between a court 
employee and everybody who works for the police 
department?  Suppose the person who makes the mistake in 
the police department is a -- a person who holds a 
unionized position where advancement is based purely on 
seniority, or it's a civil service position where the 
person is -- is totally protected from any sort of 
adverse job consequences as a result of displeasure 
about or pleasure about how the job is being -- being 
performed.

 And what's the justification for drawing a 

distinction between errors committed by those two 
employees just based on where they fit in the 
organizational box?

MS. KARLAN:  Well, three things:  One is the 
police themselves are often unionized and protected from 
retaliation.

 Second --
JUSTICE ALITO:  What if it's not a police 
officer; it is not a law enforcement officer?  It is a 
clerical employee, or it's a computer guy.

 MS. KARLAN:  Well, I think that the clearest 

line is inside the police and outside, and let me give 
you a couple of reasons why.  The first reason --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, one is that you --
you are stuck with the Arizona v. Evans, which says if 
it's the court --

MS. KARLAN:  Well, if it's the court, yes; 

but I -- I was going to give some reasons why the police 
department should be treated as an integrated whole.

 One reason why is in many departments 
officers, sworn officers, who are on desk duty for 
physical disabilities and the like, perform clerical 
tasks.

 The second is on the record in this case. 

We don't know whether it was a sworn officer who removed 
the warrant from the file or it was a clerk, and there's 
no way of finding that out now.

 A third reason, if I could just point to

this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure.
 MS. KARLAN:  -- this Court, for just a 
moment, is clerical personnel, support personnel --
there is a reason they are called "support personnel". 
They support the mission of the office, and here this 
office decided to maintain its records in a particular 
way and to have this quick reference file and the like, 
presumably to support --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the Coffee 

County people aren't called "support officers" for the 
Dale County police.

 MS. KARLAN:  They are support for the 

police, and this Court has --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now you keep saying 

this when you did this in your brief.  You just call 
everybody "police," "police," "police," when the 
question is whether there's a distinction between the 
Coffee County police and the Dale County police for 
purposes of applying the exclusionary rule.

 MS. KARLAN:  This Court, at least since 
Elkins, has recognized that police departments often 
operate across the board.  If I could point to Leon 
itself, in Leon the search was conducted by California 
municipal police, and the evidence was used in Federal

court.

 And this Court never suggested, not even for 

a minute, that the fact that the evidence was obtained 
by State-level -- local-level police and used in a 
Federal prosecution was relevant to the question whether 
or not it should be suppressed.  Because what the Court 
is trying to do in the exclusionary rule, as I 
understand it, is to deter future violations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's crucial to your case 

--

MS. KARLAN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- really, that you -- that 

the police will not keep good records unless -- unless 
we let the criminals go.

 MS. KARLAN:  That they need a powerful 

incentive.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's the theory of 

the exclusionary rule as --

MS. KARLAN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- as has been expressed in 

writings in some of our prior cases.  Things have 
changed a whole lot since we adopted the exclusionary 
rule, and I think it's quite -- policing has become much 
more professional, and I think it's quite unrealistic to 
think that if we don't adopt the rule that you -- that

you propose, police -- police departments will just 
willy-nilly not keep track of warrants.  I -- I just 
don't think that's true.  That's not professional 
policing, and -- and I think to say -- to apply the --
the severe remedy that you propose in this -- in this 
area at this date seems to me excessive.

 MS. KARLAN:  Well, we don't think this is a 
severe remedy, and we think that the professionalism of 
the police is in substantial part a response to the 
message that the exclusionary rule sends, which is 
either you professionalize your police departments or 
the evidence they obtain is going to be suppressed; 
either you maintain good records or the reliance on 
those records is going to lead to suppression.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't think that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We don't know if these 
records are good, bad, or indifferent.  As far as this 
record shows, this could be an isolated incident, or it 
could be typical of what goes on.  We just don't know.

 MS. KARLAN:  It could be, and if I can just 

point to -- if you look at the Government's brief at 
page 48, they talk about how the FBI maintains its 
"Wanted" lists now.  And they show that due to a list of 
reforms they were able to cut the error rate there from 
about 6 percent to about 3 percent.  None of those

reforms, limited access to entry, periodic audits, is

we cite in our brief about -- about Alabama, is that 
they had about a 13 percent error rate.  That is, 13 
percent of the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you are back to 

arguing that there was negligence, and that that's 
pertinent.

 MS. KARLAN:  Well, in this case there was 
negligence, and you need not go any further than that. 
If the Court has no more questions, I'll reserve the 
remainder of my time.

Miss Karlan.

 Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear now from you.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. DREEBEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The exclusionary rule under this Court's 

cases has always been a balance between the interest in 
achieving some deterrence of police misconduct and the 
high cost of excluding probative evidence of criminal 
activity.  The exclusionary rule does not put the error 
back in the box.  It does not correct it.  It serves

only as incentives for future compliance to avoid future 
Fourth Amendment errors.

 In this case, where nothing is shown other 

than a negligent and isolated clerical error in the 
maintenance of warrants, there is no showing that 
suppression of evidence will achieve the kind of 
appreciable deterrence that this Court has said is 
necessary before the exclusionary rule is applied.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do we assume on the 

basis of the record that there is negligence in this 
case?

 MR. DREEBEN:  The district court did find 

that there was negligence.  There is very little in the 
record, Mr. Chief Justice, that explains precisely what 
did happen.  But I would take issue with my colleague's 
comment that the record shows that there were no 
auditing procedures.  The record simply was not made on 
whether there were auditing procedures.

 What the district court did find based on 

testimony is that the Dale County Clerk's Office and the 
Dale County Sheriff's Office both had a reliable system 
of recordkeeping on which law enforcement could rely. 
That's a finding of the district court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, Ms. Karlan made 

the point -- and I'd like to get your response to it --

that if we adopt something that depends on the showing 
of negligence, that that will require extensive hearings 
in every case into exactly what their computer update 
system was, and so on.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, I actually 

think that negligence alone should not be enough to 
justify suppression, because it would not produce the 
appreciable form of deterrence that this Court has said 
is warranted.  But I also think that --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  May I interrupt you there? 

I mean, why do you say that?  I mean, we -- we have --
just getting outside the criminal law for a minute, we 
-- we've got a whole system of personal liability law in 
which the theory is that, in effect, requiring 
compensation for negligence, even though it is not an 
act of bad faith or malice, is -- is going to affect 
conduct.  Why do you assume it will not affect conduct 
here?

 MR. DREEBEN:  I'm not sure that it won't 

affect conduct to some degree, Justice Souter.  I think 
the exclusionary rule requires far more than saying that 
it might affect conduct, and I think that what the Court 
should look at --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Don't you think it's 

probable that it will affect conduct?  I mean, if the

police know that they are going to lose the case because 
they are engaging in a negligent or objectively 
unreasonable way in -- in relation to their 
warrant-keeping, they are going to be more careful.

 MR. DREEBEN:  I think the incremental change 

in police behavior will be modest at best, and I think 
this is crucial to my view of the case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They -- they won't know 

that they are going to lose a case.  What they will know 
is that if they happen to arrest someone whom they 
should not have arrested anyway, they won't be able to 
prosecute him, right?

 MR. DREEBEN:  That's precisely so.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So they are saving 

themselves nothing.  I mean, this person would not have 
been stopped.  I mean, if the difference was we -- we 
caught a criminal and we could have convicted him except 
because of the clerical error we can't, but that's not 
the situation.  They would never have found this fellow 
but for the clerical error.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Scalia, if you take it 

--

--

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But they -- but they also 

MR. DREEBEN:  -- if you take it --

29 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But they also, as in this 
case, in the course of -- of committing their -- their 
negligent arrest find evidence of a crime.

 MR. DREEBEN:  They do.  But from an ex ante 
perspective, Justice Souter, they can't know that, but 
they do have --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  They can't know that, but 

we all know, as a practical matter, that that's why 
police want the -- the greatest scope to the arrest 
power.

 MR. DREEBEN:  No, I think that --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Because in the course of 

doing incidental searches, they find things.  They know 
that, and we know that.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Souter, what I think 

it's important for the Court to know is that the 
police have ample incentives as it stands to try to make 
their recordkeeping systems as accurately as possible. 
The police do not have an interest in believing that 
there is an outstanding warrant for someone's arrest 
when there is not.

 The first reason is that an arrest situation 

is a highly dangerous encounter for police officers. 
It's not one to be undertaken lightly.  That's why this 
Court has rules that govern searches incident to arrest

in order to remove potential weapons from suspects.  The 
police don't want to convert what would be an otherwise 
routine traffic stop or no stop at all into a felony 
encounter that could go bad for all concerned.

 Second, there is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is there a 1983 violation 

here?

 MR. DREEBEN:  On the facts of this case, 

Justice Kennedy, I would not say there is 1983 
liability.  It's a litigable issue whether there would 
be the potential for a plaintiff to show, as the 
defendant in this case did not try to show, that there 
was a degree of deliberate indifference to a need to 
have a reliable recordkeeping system such that some 
official would be personally liable for the failure to 
have that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I suppose if the concern 
were that the police would become sloppy, then a 1983 
suit would be more likely?

 MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  I think a 1983 suit, and 

there is ample evidence that many such suits have been 
brought, and we cite cases in our brief and the 
Petitioner cites cases in his brief.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Dreeben, can I go back

the police department have to withdraw warrants that 
have been cancelled?  Why not just leave them there?  As 
long as they are there, it would justify an arrest.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, that assumes, I think, 

contrary to this Court's assumption of good faith on 
governmental actors --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  If you put aside good 
faith for the moment.  If you just think in terms of 
incentives of officers, would they not have an incentive 
just to leave everything there?

 MR. DREEBEN:  No.  There are three reasons 
why they would not.  The first is the danger factor, as 
I mentioned.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  The existence or 

nonexistence of the warrant doesn't affect the danger.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Oh, it certainly does, because 
it converts what would otherwise be not a stop at all or 
a reasonable suspicion stop into a felony arrest.  And 
when the police are undertaking an arrest, this Court 
has recognized that suspects often have an incentive to 
escape or to use weapons to resist --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But the incentive exists 

whether there is a warrant in his pocket or not.

 MR. DREEBEN:  If there is no warrant, there 

will be no arrest.  And that's why the police have an

incentive to clean up the records so that they don't 
send out the police on warrant situations when there is 
no warrant.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Dreeben, what you've 
said about the danger to the arresting office -- officer 
and so they don't undertake an arrest lightly, doesn't 
fit with the facts of this case.  This was a police 
officer who really wanted to go after the defendant.  He 
expected -- he suspected defendant was a bad guy.  So 
that's how this all started.  So he called his own 
department, do we have any warrant, and then the next 
county's department.  But this was an officer who wanted 
to go after the defendant.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

assume that the Court will make its decision not based 
on the conduct of Officer Anderson in this case, but in 
an assessment nationwide of whether the exclusionary 
rule is necessary because the police lack incentives to 
keep warrant systems up to date.  And I'm giving reasons 
why institutionally the police do have that incentive 
and, therefore, undertake those kinds of efforts.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And there are three 

reasons.  One is to reduce the incidence of arrests, so 
they don't have the hazard of felony arrests.

 Number two is? 

33 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

MR. DREEBEN:  The second reason is police 

resources.  It takes a lot of time and energy to 
undertake a felony arrest.  Many jurisdictions have 
dedicated warrant forces which seek to serve outstanding 
warrants, and they don't want to spend their time doing 
it on warrants that have been recalled.

 Similarly, in a case like this, the police 
happened to find drugs on Petitioner's person and a gun 
in his car, but if they had found nothing and taken him 
down to the station house and booked him, that would 
have been taking two police officers off the street for 
an afternoon, wasting their resources so that they're 
not engaged in the kind of protection of the community 
that the police force wants to do.

 And the third reason is that it does not 
create community goodwill to undertake arrests when 
people do not have warrants and simply because of a 
mistake in police records they're hauled downtown. 
That's the kind of thing that creates friction between 
the police and communities.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  There is one question I 

have in my mind, and it's the only factor I thought of 
hypothetically that cuts against you.  This is the 
argument and I'd like you to respond to it.

 I take everything you said as so.  I'll

assume all that.  And so I'd still say the rule, the 
basic rule of suppression, putting Leon to the side, 
basic rule is -- the opposite of Holmes:  If the 
constable blunders, you suppress the evidence.  Okay.

 Now, our prior case -- here we have a case 

where the constable blundered.  I grant you, not the 
arresting officer.  It was a different policeman, and it 
was a different form of error.  But five months this 
thing -- this warrant had been recalled five months 
earlier and you agree that it was negligent.  Therefore, 
the constable blundered.  And the virtue of our earlier 
case where we said don't suppress, it wasn't the 
constable who blundered.  So I see an absolutely clear 
line:  If the constable blunders you suppress; if it's 
somebody else who blundered, you don't.

 Now, every time I've tried to think of a 

substitute for that clear line, I've run into trouble. 
I've been sitting in my chambers with my law clerks and 
we've tried out five substitutes, and I can't find one 
decent substitute that isn't filled with problems.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What is your substitute?
 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, my first answer, Justice 

Breyer, is that this Court's exclusionary rule 
jurisprudence already draws a number of careful lines

trying to show you is you, if you want to have a 
different rule than within the prior case, remember the 
one where it wasn't the police that blundered, you have 
to come up with some rule.  And I want to know what your 
rule is.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the rule, to state it 
simply, that I think should govern this case is:  An 
isolated and negligent police clerical error in the 
maintenance of warrant records should not lead to 
suppression.  And the reason for that is there are ample 
incentive for the police to attempt to correct their own 
records such that the exclusionary rule would not 
approve --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So now we have -- let's 

think about that.  The special rule is now we have the 
Leon exception and now we have a new exception, and the 
new exception is called for isolated police clerical 
errors.  Well, that's going to be interesting, I 
suspect.

 The first thing you'll have when you try to 
impose your rule is you will have the defense attorneys 
throughout the city going in to see if it's an isolated

error.  And they will, of course, have a right to decide 
whether or not this is the only such error, whether 
there are other clerical errors, how often they occur, 
what the -- is that an administrable rule?

 MR. DREEBEN:  I think it's highly 

administrable.  It doesn't create that many problems. 
This exclusionary rule hearing is an illustration.  The 
warrant clerk for Dale County was on the witness stand. 
The warrant clerk for Coffee County was on the witness 
stand.  The arresting officer was on the witness stand. 
All of those people were asked, do these errors occur 
with frequency?  They said:  They don't; our system is 
reliable.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if there were 

pervasive deficiencies, I assume that's exactly what we 
would inquire about under 1983?

 MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct, Justice 

Kennedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And would you add 1983 as 

number four to your list?

 MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, I would add number -- I 

would add 1983 possible liability as an additional 
incentive, just as it was remarked in Hudson that it 
provides for additional incentive for --

JUSTICE BREYER:  One other question.

Suppose that the error here consisted not of a computer, 
but rather Joe, who is the policeman, has a partner 
called Sam, and Sam told Joe that this is Harry Smith, 
when negligently it wasn't Harry Smith?  It was Joe 
Smith.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I mean does that 

count as a clerical error if, in fact, it's the man's 
partner who tells him this negligently?

 MR. DREEBEN:  I'm with Miss Karlan on this 
one.  I don't think that's a Fourth Amendment violation 
at all.  I think under Hill v. California --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Negligent.  It's Negligent 

police work.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  It's a mistake.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's negligent error. 

You mean we don't suppress the negligent errors of the 
partners who, after all, say, let's arrest this man over 
here, and through negligence they have got the wrong 
man?  We don't suppress?

 MR. DREEBEN:  I think that that's a very 

close case, and I don't think that this Court --

JUSTICE BREYER:  There must be millions --
not millions, but there must have been cases where two 
policemen or one policeman goes off to arrest someone

and negligently arrests the wrong man.  And when he does 
that and does a search, we don't suppress.

 MR. DREEBEN:  What we know about that from 
this Court's cases is that if one police officer has a 
warrant and it's, he obtained it based on an affidavit, 
that's purely a bare-bones --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's Leon.  I'm not 

thinking that.

 MR. DREEBEN:  No, it's actually not Leon. 

It's Whiteley versus Warden.  And I'm positing a warrant 
that was completely based on a bare-bones affidavit.  So 
it would not pass the Leon test.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not thinking of a 

warrant.  I'm thinking of a policeman who has a warrant 
for Jack Smith and he goes to arrest Jack Brown because 
through negligence he went to the wrong house.  Now, 
under those circumstances would we suppress the drugs 
that happen to be found in Jack's house.

 MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think it's so clear 

from this Court's cases.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, there must have been 

a lot of cases.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, not in this Court.

courts?  What have they done?

MR. DREEBEN:  I'm not so aware that there 

are so many of them in the lower courts where it's 
negligence.  Most often the kind of mistakes that's 
made, the courts say it's within the realm of probable 
cause if it's a reasonable mistake.  If it's an 
unreasonable mistake, negligent mistake, I would be 
prepared to say that the lower courts are probably today 
suppressing.  And this Court doesn't have to decide 
whether that's correct in order to decide this case. 
This case --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do we use the word or the 
phrase "good faith" in writing the opinion if we write 
it your way?

 MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think the Court needs 
to use the word "good faith."  The Court used the words 
"good faith" in Leon.  It's repeated it in all of its 
so-called good faith exclusionary rule exceptions. 
We're talking about an objective rule, and the line that 
I think that the Court should draw today is between 
isolated negligent errors and errors that result from a 
more systematic or widespread pattern, the kind that 
Justice O'Connor referred to in her concurrence in 
Arizona v. Evans.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You would allow all of that 

inquiry every time there's a motion to exclude.  That

would not just be the basis for 1983.  You still want 
negligence inquiry.

 MR. DREEBEN:  I don't want it.  I'm saying 
that the Court doesn't have to reach the issue today of 
whether a widespread pattern of errors or complete 
neglect --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Thank you.  That's a little 

different.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  That's not to say --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  What about reaching -- what 

about reaching your standard in cases in which the 
arrest is wrong, not because there's no warrant, but 
because there's just slightly less than probable cause? 
If there are isolated incidents of that are we going 
to -- are we going to say that in fact that does not 
violate the Fourth Amendment?

 MR. DREEBEN:  I think that's a very 

different -- well, whether it violates the Fourth 
Amendment or not would turn on whether there is in fact 
probable cause.  If there is no probable cause, and I 
understood your question, Justice Souter --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  No.  We're starting with 
the assumption that there is a violation of the -- I 
think we're starting with background law at this point 
that there is a violation of the Fourth Amendment if

there is an arrest without probable cause or without a 
valid warrant.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  The warrant itself may be 

subject to attack, but at least that's sort of the front 
line of our objective reasonableness inquiry.  And 
you're making a dent in the warrant requirement for 
isolated incidents, and I don't see why we can't or why 
coherence would not require us to make the same dent in 
the probable cause requirement for equally isolated 
mistakes.

 MR. DREEBEN:  I think it's simply a 

different inquiry, Justice Souter, because, as I tried 
to explain, in this area the Court can note a number of 
incentives that law enforcement has to keep its warrant 
databases accurate and up to speed.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Dreeben, can I ask a 

background question?  How frequent does the issue in 
this case arise?

 MR. DREEBEN:  In my experience, Justice 

Stevens, not that frequently.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's my understanding, 

too.

may have more symbolic importance than practical 
importance.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think that the 

practical importance of it and the legal importance of 
it is what, kind of a balance is the Court going to 
strike under the exclusionary rule.  We heard a lot from 
Petitioner today about how the exclusionary rule would 
help make police engage in better practices.  We heard 
nothing about the costs of the exclusionary rule. 
Compared to, for example, to --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Are there any cases where 

-- this is a drug peddler here that was caught.  Are 
there any cases involving violent criminals that have 
been affected by the outcome of this case?

 MR. DREEBEN:  Some in the lower courts have 
involved violent crime, and I think this case would look 
and feel very different if evidence of a murder had been 
discovered in the car.  And that just accentuates the 
point that the exclusionary rule comes with a price to 
society.  It's not free.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Dreeben, if we adopt 

your formulation that isolated negligence doesn't count, 
is it clear that that's all there was in this case?
 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, that's all that the 

district court found.  The district court had evidence

and made a finding that there was no pattern of 
violations like this, that the system of recordkeeping 
was generally reliable.  This is the findings of the 
district court that are on page 17a and 18a of the 
Petitioner appendix.  The district court concluded: 
"There is no credible evidence of routine problems with 
disposing of warrants and the warrant clerk herself 
could not recall other instances like this."

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, if Miss Karlan's 

figures are correct in Alabama there would be 
suppression.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, there was no record made 

whatsoever on what Alabama's overall --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  No.  I said if her figures 
are correct and there's a 13 percent error rate either 
in the State of Alabama or at least in the department 
involved that we'd have suppression there.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Unless -- if the Court is 

prepared to say that the exclusionary rule is going to 
function differently on a State by State basis depending 
on the statewide error rate, which I think is an unusual 
thing for the Court to do --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it's going to 

function -- even on your theory, it's going to function 
differently on a department to department basis

depending on the error rate.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Upon a -- Not just upon a 
showing of an error rate, but upon a showing that a 
particular recordkeeping system that produced an error 
was conducted in a manner so that you could say much 
more than negligence was involved here.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, if you've got a 13 

percent error rate I think you've got a pretty good 
prima facie case.

 MR. DREEBEN:  You do.  I would concede you 

have a good prima facie case.  I would want to know more 
to know what that really means because with a lot of 
these statistics --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But the fact is unless the 
"more" showed that they were getting a 13 percent error 
rate in a negligence-free system, you would have 
suppression there and you would not have suppression 
there in the town next door or the county next door or 
the State next door.

 MR. DREEBEN:  If the Court adopts a rule 

that says that a showing of more than isolated 
negligence would justify suppression, you're correct.  I 
would note, though, that --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But I thought that 

basically was the distinction that you were arguing for.

MR. DREEBEN:  No.  I think I clarified to 

Justice Scalia that I think all the Court needs to 
decide today is that an isolated negligent error in 
police recordkeeping should not result in suppression. 
It should not hold today because it's not confronted 
with today --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But I take it if you're not 

accepting -- if you're not accepting -- I mean, you're 
not accepting the proposition that the 13 percent error 
rate which is not somehow shown to be non-negligent 
should have a different result, you are saying in the 13 
percent case we're still not going to suppress.

 MR. DREEBEN:  I would reserve the right to 
argue that the exclusionary rule's costs outweigh its 
benefits even if that is shown in a particular case 
because there are a myriad of other reasons why the 
police would have an incentive to improve that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But if you -- if you were 
to make that argument and it came down to that bald a 
proposition, I assume you would come in with some kind 
of evidentiary basis to tell us exactly what the cost 
is.  And you have spoken of the cost today.  You have 
not spoken of the benefit and the value of having 
relatively error-free arrest recordkeeping.  But I

the exclusionary rule --

MR. DREEBEN:  Well I think --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- beyond the record.
 MR. DREEBEN:  It's manifested in it every 

case in which reliable probative evidence is suppressed.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Sure, sure it is.  But that 

does not even get us to, as it were, to half the 
equation.  We want to be know how much of that there is 
and we want to be able to measure against that the value 
that society is getting by requiring valid arrest 
warrants and in a probable cause case by requiring 
probable cause.  And you can't just walk in and say, 
well, there's a cost.  We know there's a cost.

 MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think, Justice Souter, 
that the Court has ever looked for an empirical count of 
how many cases.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Don't you think we should 
if we are in effect -- if you are making what sounds to 
me like an empirical argument -- there is a cost to 
society, cases are being lost, criminals are going free 
-- don't you think that we ought to have a factual basis 
to know what that cost is?

 MR. DREEBEN:  If the Court wants one in 

order to justify the exclusionary rule, then it probably 
needs to go back to scratch and start all over again.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  We've done an exclusionary 
rule now and in effect you are arguing for an exception 
to it because the cost is too great, and it seems to me 
the burden is on you to tell us what the cost figure is.

 MR. DREEBEN:  I will say this, Justice 

Souter.  If the cost is very low because very few cases 
result in suppression, then deterrence is also very low 
because there are very few cases in which evidence is 
being suppressed.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But if you take that 

argument to the extreme, we won't have an exclusionary 
rule at all, I suppose.

 MR. DREEBEN:  But my argument today does not 
require the Court to take that step at all because this 
is an area in which there is a local geography of 
incentive pertaining to the accuracy of warrants that 
allows the Court to conduct the balance in a way 
distinct from what it might do if it's confronted with 
police negligence or if it's confronted with a 
widespread pattern of negligence.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Of course, if you did the 
cost-benefit analysis the way Justice Stewart would, the 
cost is always zero to the State because they would not 
have had the evidence if they had obeyed the law.

Stevens, that form of looking at the question has been 
rejected in this Court's cases that have recognized that 
the exclusionary rule has to pay its way because in 
every case in which it results in suppression there is a 
cost to society and the benefit therefore needs to be 
appreciable and this Court needs to be confident of that 
before it concludes that what the Court called the 
"massive remedy of exclusion" is applied in any 
particular case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We know what the 

cost was here, right?  I mean, not just a drug peddler, 
but somebody with an illegal weapon found in his car, a 
weapon that presumably he would use on an occasion in 
which it was in his view appropriate to do so.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Correct.  There was benefit in 

this very case and cost if the evidence is suppressed.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But don't you take -- I 
understood you to take the position and I thought the 
Court had previously taken the position that the cost 
benefit analysis had to be a systemic one.

 MR. DREEBEN:  I think that that's correct, 
Justice Souter, but I'm not aware of any case in which 
the Court has said the exclusionary rule has costs and 
now we need to see the numbers of statistically how many 
cases result in suppression.  I'm just not aware of any

case in which the Court has done that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, I think that's -- I 
think that's true.  I mean, we operate -- quite think 
frankly we operate on the basis of a -- of a good guess 
and I think your argument is saying let's have -- let's 
have an exception to the good guess.  And if -- if you 
start with a good guess as the baseline it seems to me 
you -- you ought to have something more than another 
guess to justify the exception.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Souter what my 
case comes down to today I believe is the proposition 
that when we are talking about clerical errors made by 
the police, there are ample incentives for the police 
not to make those clerical errors that I've described 
earlier, such that the incremental benefit of the 
exclusionary rule which we know has a cost; it has a 
tangible cost in every case in which it's applied; does 
not pay its own way.  In other words, there is no 
sufficient incremental deterrence to warrant taking an 
isolated negligent error in a generally reliable system 
and saying we need to suppress evidence anyway; and 
Petitioner's argument goes farther than the isolated 
negligent error case.  It says even if the police have 
driven the error rate down as low as it's humanly 
possible by committing mass amounts of are resources to

warrant database systems in order to avoid suppression, 
which is what the Petitioner's theory posits, you should 
still suppress; and that seems to me nothing other than 
the return to the theory when there is a Fourth 
Amendment violation, suppression automatically follows; 
and this Court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's not what we 

have here, and we have a 13 percent error rate.  If this 
case goes your way, the police have limited resources; 
why should they spend them on upgrading their computer 
system when if there is an error it wasn't matter?

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, it does matter, Justice 
Ginsburg, because the police officers that I'm familiar 
with and the agencies that I'm familiar with as 
exemplified by the NCIC which is the national database, 
says that the last thing that we want to do is send 
officers mistakenly out on a felony arrest where they 
are going to be placed in a potentially dangerous 
situation spending community police resources to arrest 
somebody who should not be arrested.  This is not what 
they want to do.  They have a good reason to avoid being 
placed in that situation and I would caution the Court 
against relying on a 13 percent figure in a study that's 
submitted in a brief to this Court for the first time 
without any kind of adversarial testing.  That is not I

this think a reliable basis for the Court to infer that 
this particular police department had that kind of an 
error rate or that the exclusionary rule is necessary to 
prevent it from having that kind of an error rate or 
even that there were no procedures in place to prevent 
errors and warrants from remaining in the system.

 The record simply doesn't show that.  The 

warrant clerks were on the stand and neither party asked 
them the question so this Court doesn't have the 
information to say today was there a system that would 
have ferreted this out.  We know that if there was it 
failed in this case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In Hudson versus Michigan, 
didn't the Court engage in a very broad balancing of the 
social costs and the potential for increase in 
violations in saying that there was no necessity for the 
suppression rule in the no-knock case?

 MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, Justice Kennedy; the 

Court did just that and it began with the outset that 
the massive remedy of suppression of evidence is a high 
social cost that should not be borne by society, not 
just the police, by all of us, unless appreciable 
deterrence will result as a benefit; and the Court then 
examined the incentives that the police had not to make 
illegal no-knock entries and to add that whatever

incremental benefit there might be from exclusion was 
not justified in light of the possibility of 198e 
liability and the increased professionalism of the 
police which has made it less necessary to make the 
exclusionary rule a remedy of first resort rather than 
last resort.  While this Court could conceptualize the 
case as one in which the government is looking for an 
exception to the exclusionary rule, I think it's more 
accurately one where the Court should extend the 
exclusionary rule to cover negligent police clerical 
errors.  For the first time, at this day and age when 
1983 recoveries have become effective --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How many 1983 recoveries 

have there been when someone says the police, they 
convicted me on the basis of this evidence that wasn't 
suppressed, but they committed a Fourth Amendment 
violation so I should prevail in the 1983 action?  How 
many defendants in that situation have ever won a 1983 
action?

 MR. DREEBEN:  No one knows, Justice 

Ginsburg, because a great many of these cases will 
settle out of court, but our brief does provide examples 
of conduct that was more serious and more egregious than 
anything involved in this case resulting in situations 
where courts denied summary judgments to the defendants

and ordered the cases to go to trial.

 And I'm not suggesting that in a case like 
this -- may I complete the answer -- there should be a 
1983 remedy, but I am suggesting that civil remedies 
will provide incentives to the police to avoid the bog 
of litigation by putting into place systems that will 
prevent this kind of error.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Mr. Dreeben.  Miss Karlan, you have eight minutes 
remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Can I use 30 seconds of 

your eight minutes because I want some clarity on this.

 MS. KARLAN:  Absolutely.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Divide in your mind two 

separate things:  The nature of the bad conduct: is it 
negligent, reckless, deliberate; and the other question 
is who engaged in it -- a police department official or 
some other official?

 I thought this case was about the second 

question, but now I'm confused about the first question 
because I suppose a policeman, an arresting officer 
makes a negligent error.  He goes to the wrong house. 
And he never looks at the number; and he arrests, starts

to arrest the wrong person:  Is the evidence suppressed?
 If the evidence isn't suppressed, frankly, I 

don't see why a clerical official should be held to a 
higher standard; but if the evidence is suppressed then 
quite possibly the clerical official should be held to 
the same standard.  So you've heard the government say 
well, the answer isn't clear; very often a negligent 
official -- a negligent officer would not have that 
evidence suppressed.  Well, what is it?

 MS. KARLAN:  The answer to your question, 

Justice Breyer, is if the police officer in your 
hypothetical was negligent the evidence would be 
suppressed.  There are cases where the mistake of the 
officer was a reasonable mistake, that is.  He did not 
--

JUSTICE BREYER:  He was not.
 MS. KARLAN:  Then he was not negligent.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I want to know if he is 

negligent.

 MS. KARLAN:  If he is negligent --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Excuse me, because I think 

I'm getting a different view from the government.

 MS. KARLAN:  I'm absolutely certain that the 

answer is if he was negligent then there was not 
probable cause; if there was not probable cause and one

of the other exceptions to the exclusionary rule does 
not apply, then the evidence will be suppressed.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And the definition of 
negligence is that he was not objectively reasonable?

 MS. KARLAN:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So we've got 

this --

MS. KARLAN:  And the rule we are asking for 
here -- the narrow rule for our Petitioner is when you 
have negligent error by police officials, you suppress 
but as Justice Scalia pointed out in my colloquy with 
him earlier, that rule is perhaps slightly less workable 
than a rule that says all error.

 Now we have given you a workable rule here 
and we still have not heard I believe a workable rule 
from the government; because what Mr. Dreeben tells you 
is that under some circumstances there will be 
suppression.  And I just want to make up with factual 
correction here which is about the 13 percent.  It was a 
study by the FBI.  It's a very dated study because they 
haven't done a more recent one and it was statewide. 
But let assume for purposes of argument here that if 13 
percent of the errors in the file are there because the 
police are not maintaining their records properly, there 
ought to be suppression of a warrantless arrest based on

that because otherwise you're really telling the 
department that "good enough for government work" is, 
you know, one out of six warrants is invalid, one out of 
seven warrants is invalid, but that's okay.

 So then what you would have to have in each 

case is a hearing, and at the hearing we would be 
entitled to discovery --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But in that -- but in that 

hypothetical I think it might be easy to say that the 
policeman on the beat was not objectively reasonable in 
relying.

 MS. KARLAN:  But Justice Kennedy --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's certainly not 

the case here.

 MS. KARLAN:  But Justice Kennedy, if you 

believe in the government's rule we should have a right 
to audit that system to show that 13 percent of the 
warrants --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I agree with that.  If --
to say with Mr. Dreeben that we don't have to decide 
that today is just unrealistic.  We have to decide today 
whether we are going to adopt a rule that down the road 
will turn every exclusionary request into a pretrial 
investigation of the procedures of the police.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And a major -- major trial.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not the procedures 

of the police.  The officer is on the stand and you say, 
all right, you've been here a while, how many times have 
these warrants turned out to be wrong, just as simple as 
it was in this case?  And he says, gosh, this is the 
first time that I've had this question.

 MS. KARLAN:  But one of the things we know 
from the oral argument and the transcript in Evans is 
that clerk said this is the first time there has ever 
been an error, and it turned out there were four errors 
them made the same day.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Cross-examine 
people.  These people are under oath, you cross-examine. 
You say, I don't think that's right.  How many times? 
It's not that big a deal to find out on what basis the 
arresting officer was acting.

 MS. KARLAN:  Right.  But we would be 

entitled I think, Mr. Chief Justice, to say to the clerk 
on the stand, have you ever conducted an audit?  She 
says, no, but our system is reliable.

 At that point I think we are entitled to an 

audit.  That is we are entitled to hire an expert at 
government expense to figure out how many times this 
department has gotten it wrong.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't your rule also going 

to require hearings.  If negligence is required --

MS. KARLAN:  The hearing in this case --
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- you are going to have to 
have a hearing on whether there was negligence.  And if 
so, who was negligent.  If only causation is required, 
you're going to have to have a hearing on who caused it.
 MS. KARLAN:  Justice Alito, we had a hearing 

in this case that's adequate to the rule that we have 
and it took approximately two hours.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And will that be the case in 

every instance?

 MS. KARLAN:  It will be the case more often 
then that you'll have a two-hour hearing that you have 
to show isolated --

JUSTICE ALITO:  How do you know that?  What 

basis do you have for saying that?  How do you know 
that?  How many of these hearings have you examined?

 MS. KARLAN:  Hearings in which there was no 
warrant?  I have examined none, but I can't imagine that 
it would take more than two hours.  In this case it took 
two hours.

 All you have to do is figure out who said 
there was a warrant when there wasn't one.  Was it a 
court employee under Evans?  The answer is then clear.

You let the evidence in.  Was it not the court, that is, 
everybody concedes that the court called, everybody 
concedes the warrant was removed, everybody concedes 
that the warrant went back?  Then you answer it that 
way.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose it were an agency 
like INS or Customs in which they have many people that 
are not sworn officers or some that are, does it make a 
difference who answered the phone?

 MS. KARLAN:  I don't think the sworn officer 

distinction makes a difference.  I think the agency 
does.

 If I can refer to the State cases here, I 
think they can illustrate how to answer your question 
more precisely, Justice Kennedy.  That is, a number of 
States suppress evidence under these circumstances, and 
they ask what's a question of law that then applies to 
all future cases, which is, is this agency an adjunct of 
law enforcement or is it something else?

 So, for example, in California, the 
Department of Corrections, not.  They are not an 
adjunct.  So errors by the Department of Corrections, 
evidence is admitted.  The State of Florida, the 
Department of Motor Vehicles is an adjunct.  So there if 
the Department of Motor Vehicles makes the mistake,

there is suppression.

 This rule has been --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In Rand we said this is 

exactly the inquiry we are not going to make.

 MS. KARLAN:  I'm not sure.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Rand was where we had a 

traffic stop made by a narcotics officer.  And the 
question was, well, he was going outside his 
jurisdiction.  We said we are not going to get into the 
way police departments are organized.  We are just not 
going to do it.

 MS. KARLAN:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's Rand.
 MS. KARLAN:  No.  I understand Rand 

perfectly well, Justice Kennedy.  But the question here 
is not a Rand case.  It's what counts as the police? 
And that's the only question we are asking you to answer 
here, is what counts as the police?  Everyone who works 
for the police department.  When they make an negligent 
error, that's enough.

 Now, let me turn for just a moment to the 
question of the bloated records and their incentives.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's your bottom line 

position, it has to be a negligent error?

perfectly happy --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is the position you're 

arguing for?

 MS. KARLAN:  We are arguing for negligent --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You want to adopt a rule 

that's only when it's a negligent error?

 MS. KARLAN:  We are arguing for that rule 

but wanted you to understand that there is a tradeoff as 
you identified earlier.  Our rule is, I think, a clean, 
narrow rule.  It may require, as Justice Alito has 
pointed out, slightly more detailed hearings.

 Let me turn now to this question of the 

incentives, which is the incentives of departments, as 
illustrated in this case, are to leave the question of 
maintaining records to the end of the line in spending 
their resources, because they are not going to have to 
serve these warrants.  These warrants serve as an 
opportunity to stop and arrest someone they otherwise 
wouldn't be able to stop and arrest here, because they 
like probable cause.

 All they had to do to cite -- Justice 

Kennedy, to cite Rand to you is if they wanted to follow 
him for a while, I'm sure they could have found a motor 
vehicle violation at some point.  But they didn't even 
want to do that.  They just wanted to use this

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So that's assuming 

bad faith on the part of the police.

 MS. KARLAN:  No, it's good faith.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They want to arrest 
him, so they follow him until they find a motor vehicle 
violation.

 MS. KARLAN:  This Court has said it's 

absolutely fine and it's not bad faith.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you're 

suggesting it's bad faith --

MS. KARLAN:  No, I'm not suggesting that.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- because they --

because they don't want to have to worry about getting a 
warrant that might be wrong?

 MS. KARLAN:  No, no.  That's not what I 

said, Mr. Chief Justice.  May I please --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What was the point 
of -- well, sure, as long as I'm asking the questions, 
you can answer.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What was your point 

then?  You're saying, well, they want to get this guy

anything else.  They can follow him, find the broken

taillight and then they would have gotten that guy.  I 
thought that was the point you were trying to make?

 MS. KARLAN:  No.  The point I was -- the 

point I was trying to make is that there are other 
techniques here if you haven't as yet inarticulable 
suspicion that somebody is a bad guy that you can use 
that to comply with the Constitution.  What you can't do 
is rely on a warrant that doesn't exist, and then turn 
around and say police error, but we are entitled to rely 
on our own error.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  May I ask one question, 

Chief.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Your -- your comment seems 

to assume that these warrants just lie there and the 
police only use them incidentally.  I have always 
assumed that when a warrant is out, part of the job of 
the police is to -- is to arrest the person.  Isn't that 
the case?

 MS. KARLAN:  Well, there are really two very 

different kinds of warrants out there, Justice Scalia, 
as I understand it.  One is warrants the police go and 
try and find themselves, and then they are trying to 
serve those aggressively.  But there are a lot of 
warrants like this one that sat in a file for five

months, nobody tried to serve it during the vast 
majority of that time because a lot of these warrants, 
as is true in this case, are for failure to answer a 
calendar call or for not paying a parking fine on time 
or for not sending in your fine on a motor vehicle.

 In the Ott case that we cite it was failure 

to pay child support.

 So those are not the kinds of things where 

the police are serving the warrants aggressively.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you 

Miss Karlan, the case is submitted.
