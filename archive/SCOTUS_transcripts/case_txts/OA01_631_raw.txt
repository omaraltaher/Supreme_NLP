CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 01-631, the United States v. Christopher


Drayton and Clifton Brown.


Mr. Thompson.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF LARRY D. THOMPSON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. THOMPSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This Court has held in several decisions that


the police questioning of individuals is a legitimate and,


indeed, vital law enforcement technique.  The decision


below ignores this Court's teachings as to when a police-


citizen encounter on a bus may violate the Fourth


Amendment and may constitute the seizure of the passenger.


Police-citizen encounters have proven to be


effective law enforcement techniques in the area of drug


and weapon interdiction.  These encounters are also


important in today's environment with respect to the


protection of passengers in the Nation's public


transportation system. 


This case is controlled by this Court's decision


in Bostick and the court below incorrectly applied the


Bostick test to these facts.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Thompson, isn't it so that in


Bostick the police did inform the passengers that they had


a right to refuse consent?


MR. THOMPSON:  That is correct, Your Honor, but


also in Bostick this Court clearly pointed out, on remand


to the Florida Supreme Court, the factors that the Court


should evaluate in terms of determining whether or not the


encounter was coercive or otherwise inappropriate.  And


two of those factors are important here that would put


into context what the court below considered. 


For example, this Court pointed out to the


Florida Supreme Court whether or not there were guns


pointed and noted that there were no guns pointed in a --


in the Bostick case.  This Court also pointed out to the


Florida Supreme Court that -- whether or not there was the


existence of threatening language, and none of that


existed in the case below. 


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I suppose that the advice


that you have a right to decline the request applies --


and I -- I take it you could read Bostick this way;


perhaps you disagree -- to whether or not the -- the


consent was actually given as opposed to whether there was


a coercive environment. 


MR. THOMPSON:  That's correct, Your Honor, and


as the Bostick Court pointed out with respect to the test

to be applied is whether or not, under all the


circumstances, the police conduct communicated to a


reasonable person -- and that presupposes a reasonably --


a reasonable innocent person -- whether or not the


passenger could have refused the officer's request to


consent or otherwise have terminated the -- terminated the


encounter.


There is really nothing remarkable about the


facts of this case when you look at this Court's decision


in Bostick and compare Bostick with this Court's decision


in Robinette which clearly pointed --


QUESTION:  My question, Mr. Thompson, was your


opening statement was that the Eleventh Circuit had ruled


in direct conflict with this Court's precedent.  If we're


applying a totality of the circumstances test, that's one


circumstance that was present there, is not present here. 


So, whether the Eleventh Circuit erred is for us to


determine today, but I do think it's a bit much to say


that they -- they just disregarded this Court's precedent.


MR. THOMPSON:  Your Honor, the Eleventh Circuit


considered factors that were unlike the factors that this


Court in Bostick believed were important in determining


whether the police conduct at issue was coercive.  And


moreover, Your Honor, the Eleventh Circuit incorrectly


applied the legal principles that this Court formulated

with respect to the facts of this case. 


For example, the Eleventh Circuit noted the


importance of Officer Hoover at the front of the bus and


pointed out that his presence might lead a -- a passenger


to believe that he or she could not leave the bus.  Well,


this Court in Bostick clearly pointed out that the -- in a


-- in the context of a bus interdiction effort, whether or


not the passenger could leave the bus was the wrong


question.  The question was whether or not the passenger


-- whether or not the police conduct communicated to the


passenger whether or not they could refuse the consent


requested or whether or not they could just terminate the


questioning of the police officer.


QUESTION:  Well, it's -- it's true that the --


the issue of whether someone could leave the bus or not is


-- is not really an issue that -- that focuses the


question, and we said so in Bostick.  But it doesn't


follow from that that it was irrelevant in Bostick or that


it's irrelevant here that there was an officer stationed


at the front of the bus.  If we're going to have a


totality of the circumstances test, wouldn't you agree


that that is one relevant fact to consider in trying to


reconstruct the atmosphere and decide whether or not it


signaled to the -- to the person searched the -- the


possibility of just ending the encounter?

 MR. THOMPSON:  Yes, Your Honor.  That -- it is


one relevant fact to be taken into consideration with the


other factors, but here the officer stationed at the front


of the bus -- at the front of the bus really did not


communicate, nor did Officer Lang who was doing the


questioning -- did not communicate that -- to any


passenger that he or she could not terminate the


questioning. 


QUESTION:  He did -- nobody said, you can't


leave the bus.  But isn't it a fact that a passenger would


take into some consideration that there was an officer


stationed at the front of the bus?


MR. THOMPSON:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  He wasn't keeping people out,


apparently.


MR. THOMPSON:  Excuse me. 


QUESTION:  It's -- it's a relevant fact in


determining the coerciveness of the atmosphere, is it not?


MR. THOMPSON:  Your Honor, not in this case. 


The court below and the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged in


-- in their findings, if you will, that the -- the aisle


was not blocked, the exit was not blocked.  In fact,


every --


QUESTION:  Let me -- let me try a -- a different


suggestion.  The fact that the officer at the front of the

bus was kneeling in the driver's seat was one graphic


reminder of another fact in this case, and that is, that


the driver was gone.  The driver had left the bus.  The


only people exercising any kind of official capacity in


that bus were three police officers.  One of them was


occupying the driver's seat.  Isn't that a signal that


nobody is going to be going anywhere on this bus?  This


bus isn't going to be going anywhere until the officers


are satisfied. 


Now, that may or may not be dispositive of


anything, but it is a relevant fact on the question of


coercion and voluntariness.  Isn't it? 


MR. THOMPSON:  Your Honor, the presence of the


officer at the front of the bus is a factor, but in the


context of these facts and if -- in the context of this


Court's decision in Delgado where you had armed agents


surrounding the factory, and this Court held that simply


because the factory workers could not leave without


passing those agents --


QUESTION:  I agree with you.  You're -- you're


absolutely right there.  The -- the point that I'm making


is that you can't go through this kind of analysis and


say, well, this fact is irrelevant.  This shouldn't have


been considered by the court.  That fact was irrelevant. 


That shouldn't have been considered.  It was a relevant

fact.  What it all adds up to, as you suggest by the


Delgado reference, is a different question, but it's a


relevant fact, isn't it?


MR. THOMPSON:  It's a relevant fact, but the


factors to be considered and the factors that this Court


clearly announced in -- in the Bostick case were factors


that were threatening, factors that were otherwise


coercive, like pointing a gun.  In this particular case,


Your Honor, the Eleventh Circuit even noted that there was


no evidence that any of the passengers saw that this


officer was armed.  The officers were --


QUESTION:  Mr. Thompson, did they know that he


was an officer?  Was it clear that he was an officer?


MR. THOMPSON:  The officer was conducting


individual passenger-specific questioning. 


QUESTION:  The -- the other two officers were I


know, but was there -- was it clear that the person


kneeling in the driver's seat was an officer? 


MR. THOMPSON:  He was casually dressed, Your


Honor, and it's not clear from the record as to whether or


not he was a police officer.


QUESTION:  Did he have his badge?  The other two


showed their badges.  Did the one in the front show --


MR. THOMPSON:  I don't believe the record is


clear as to where the badge was located with respect to

the officer at the front of the bus. 


QUESTION:  Did he enter with the other two?


MR. THOMPSON:  Yes.  They all entered as


passengers, all casually dressed. 


And with respect to the conduct of this -- of


this search --


QUESTION:  Well, I mean, I -- what -- I don't


know what that -- why should that make a difference.  If


somebody shows me a badge and he's casually dressed, I


know he's got a gun, or he's going to be fired.  An


officer is fired if he doesn't carry his gun.  Everybody


knows that.


Let me -- let me ask you this.  Would it be


appropriate in your view for this Court to write an


opinion in which we say that citizens have certain


obligations to know their rights and to assert their


rights?  That's what makes for a strong democracy.  The


law lives in the consciousness of the people.  And people


have a certain obligation to assert their rights.  If they


don't want to be searched, they say I don't want to be


searched.  Should we write that in an opinion? 


MR. THOMPSON:  Well, that follows on with the --


the clear test that this Court announced in Bostick, and


the test was, Your Honor, whether or not the police


conduct commuted anything -- communicated anything to the

citizens and these passengers as to --


QUESTION:  What about the proposition as I -- as


I've stated it?  Because if you say yes -- and I think


there's a good answer for it -- then I'd just say, well,


we have to distinguish Miranda at least.  Miranda is based


on a contrary assumption.  That's what's running through


my mind as I'm asking the question. 


MR. THOMPSON:  Well, here -- here the -- the


citizens -- some citizens did refuse Officer Lang's


request, and what -- what you posit is -- is really the


guts of what is going on here.  As Officer Lang testified,


Your Honor, many of the citizens -- most citizens went


along with the police questioning in -- in this particular


-- these particular bus interdictions, and they -- and


they were happy to do so.  Officer Lang testified that


many of the bus passengers appreciated his efforts in


coming onto the bus.  They -- it made them feel a sense of


-- of safety. 


And here citizens generally do know their


rights, and here the police did not communicate anything


to these passengers that would indicate that they had to


answer, that they were required or otherwise compelled to


answer Officer Lang's questions. 


QUESTION:  Did any other case that we considered


involve a body pat-down, not just a request to look at

luggage?  This -- in this case the -- the luggage didn't


turn up anything of interest to the police, but the pat-


down did. 


And the image of let's take what is -- Mr.


Drayton is sitting next to a man who has just been hauled


off the bus, handcuffed.  I imagine he would feel some


intimidation at that point when the police then turned to


him and said, okay, we'd like to search you too.


MR. THOMPSON:  Well, the -- the Bostick test


presupposes a reasonable, innocent person.  In this


particular case, Mr. -- Mr. Brown's consent was


unambiguous.  He opened his coat.  He -- in response to


the question, he said, sure.  He opened his coat.  He took


out a cell phone.


QUESTION:  But Drayton said nothing throughout


the whole encounter. 


MR. THOMPSON:  Drayton's -- Drayton's consent,


as the district court found, was clear and unambiguous. 


He raised his hands off of his thighs, Your Honor.  There


was nothing that Officer Lang said to Mr. -- or said to


Mr. Drayton or had said to Mr. Brown that would have


indicated that Mr. Drayton could not have terminated the


questioning or that he could have refused consent. 


And as this Court noted -- as this Court noted


in Bostick, the fact that a lawbreaker knows that the

search is going to uncover contraband or is -- knows that


the search is going to uncover drugs does not make the


consent involuntary.


QUESTION:  Well, it doesn't make it involuntary,


but it -- it does suggest perhaps that there is an


ambiguity here as -- as against your claim that there was


none in Brown's consent because -- and correct me if I'm


wrong on the facts, but I -- I think the first request to


Brown was -- or maybe to the two of them together -- can I


look at your -- your luggage, your bag, whatever they had


pointed to, and they said, sure.  And I presume they said


sure because they knew there was nothing in it that was


going to be incriminating.  So, the officer looked in the


-- in the luggage and he found nothing. 


Then he turned to Brown and said, mind if I do a


pat-down, or whatever the phrase was.  Well, that's the


search that's in question here, and I would have thought


that at that point Brown was in the situation in which the


reasonable citizen would have thought I'm damned if I do


and I'm damned if I don't.  If he pats me down and he's --


he's thorough about it, he's going to find the -- the


drugs.  If I say you can't pat me down, having just given


permission to him to -- to look in the -- in the bag, he's


going to know that there must be something on me that


wasn't on the bag.  And -- and, therefore, it seems to me

that the -- that Brown at that point was by no means in a


position in which he had a kind of free choice to say yes


or no.  So, it sounds to me as though it is ambiguous. 


Have I got the facts wrong?


MR. THOMPSON:  You have the facts, but your


conclusion, Your Honor, I would differ with because in --


in the situation both individuals pointed to the bag.


There was nothing in Officer Lang's request to Mr. Brown


that would -- that would -- that -- that would send or


communicate to Mr. Brown that he could not have refused


the request.  There was nothing in Officer Lang's question


that would indicate to Mr. Brown that he could not have


otherwise terminated the questioning.  Why some of the --


QUESTION:  Well, you don't agree, I hope, with


the -- with the proposition that there would be no reason


to decline the pat-down search except the reason that he


had something incriminating on him.  I mean, the mere fact


that you've -- you've acceded to the luggage search, which


is a much less intrusive search, does not show that --


that you have something to hide when you -- when you


decline to -- to have a pat-down.  Don't -- don't you


agree that a consent to a luggage search is a lot less


difficult to obtain than consent to a pat-down?


MR. THOMPSON:  The nature -- the nature of the


search is not necessary to the Bostick inquiry.

 QUESTION:  Well, I think you're -- I think


you're missing my point.  Justice Souter was suggesting


that having acceded to the luggage search, the only


plausible reason for objecting to the pat-down would be


that I have something on me that is incriminating.  And I


-- I acceded to the luggage search because I knew there


was nothing incriminating.  But don't you think that an


innocent citizen could agree to a -- a policeman's search


of luggage but not agree to a pat-down? 


MR. THOMPSON:  Absolutely, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And -- and, of course, I would


agree --


QUESTION:  You know, let's be reasonable here.


QUESTION:  Yes.  But don't -- don't you think


the most probable inference is the inference I gave you?


MR. THOMPSON:  No, Your Honor.  You have --


again, you have to understand this Court's holding in


Bostick and that is the --


QUESTION:  The holding in Bostick, if I remember


it, was that the Florida Supreme Court was wrong in


adopting a per se rule and left open the question of


whether there was a seizure in that case.  Isn't that


right?


MR. THOMPSON:  Yes, Your Honor.  But in this


particular case, the reasonable person, as this Court

said, presupposes a reasonable, innocent person. 


Lawbreakers sometimes agree to be -- agree to be searched,


knowing that the drugs are in their luggage or on their


person, for a number of reasons, sometimes as -- as these


gentlemen did.  They want to be cooperative.  They do not


want to send some kind of message that they indeed have


the items in question.  They want to appear innocent. 


They do this for any number of reasons, hoping that the


police officer will not search them and go away. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Thompson, you --


MR. THOMPSON:  It has nothing to do with --


QUESTION:  -- you were about to say --


MR. THOMPSON:  -- compulsion.  Excuse me.


QUESTION:  -- that the police -- you were about


to say when the police go over the line.  I think you said


here they did nothing that would imply that consent or


that -- that the search was required of the citizen.  What


-- can -- can you give a description of when the police


would step over the line?  Is it -- must the police give


words of command, get up, I want to search you?  Is that


-- does it take that?


MR. THOMPSON:  The -- if -- if the police would


communicate to the citizen somehow that the citizen's


response was compelled.  For example, in -- in Bostick


this Court noted that pointing guns, drawn guns would lead

to that -- that kind of compulsion or coercion.  For


example, if the police used threatening language.  If the


police communicated to the reasonable person that he or


she could not refuse the request for consent or could not


otherwise terminate the questioning. 


QUESTION:  And that explains Miranda, of course,


to the extent anything explains it. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  That -- that was a custodial


interrogation, wasn't it? 


MR. THOMPSON:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And the -- the physical custody would


have had that -- that effect of -- of causing the person


to believe that he had no choice.


MR. THOMPSON:  Absolutely.  Here you have


unstructured, rapidly developing police-citizen


encounters, and what is important here --


QUESTION:  And you have a request and a


response.  And the response is that there is no objection


to the search.  And it seems to me that that is an


objective consideration of the highest importance. 


MR. THOMPSON:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  May I ask, Mr. Thompson, do you


regard this primarily as a seizure case or a search case?

Honor.  That's the -- the court below decided this case


under the -- under the Bostick test.  Both parties before


the Eleventh Circuit urged the Bostick test, and this is


-- I would submit that this is a seizure case.


QUESTION:  Do you think it always would follow


if you concluded that there was no seizure, that there was


necessarily voluntary consent to the search?


MR. THOMPSON:  If there was no seizure?


QUESTION:  Right. 


MR. THOMPSON:  It -- in this Court's test in


Bostick, the Court merged the voluntary issue and the


voluntariness in with the -- in with the Bostick seizure


analysis.  So, I would say that -- that the two are merged


together and are related. 


QUESTION:  It doesn't seem to me that


analytically they have to be.  It seems to me you could


have a case in which you could -- the officer could say to


the man, you're perfectly free to get off the bus anytime


you want to, but I'd like to -- to search you first, and


may I do so?  And then the question would be whether the


search was voluntary even if there had been no seizure. 


It seems to me that could be a scenario that would make


sense. 


MR. THOMPSON:  It's -- it's hard to -- in the


context of these bus -- police-citizen encounters on a

bus, it's hard to really see the distinction between the


voluntariness test and the seizure test.


QUESTION:  But it does seem to me the passenger


might have two different thoughts.  One, I better not get


off the bus.  I want to get to Columbus or Cleveland or


wherever we're going.  So, I -- that -- maybe I can get


off the bus, but it just doesn't make any sense.  But


that's one inquiry.  The second inquiry is, do I want to


let this fellow search me?  It seems to me they are really


two separate questions. 


MR. THOMPSON:  I don't know, Your Honor, but I


-- I would posit here that we do not really need in this


particular case to -- to understand the full extent of the


scope of the voluntariness test because the court below


clearly decided this case under Bostick and as a seizure


case.


QUESTION:  A seizure of the person or seizure of


the contraband?


MR. THOMPSON:  The person, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  If we were writing on a blank slate


and other cases weren't there, what would be the


Department's objections to a rule of law that said when


you're on a bus, only 11 inches of an aisle, three people


get on.  One is sitting in the back looking over the


crowd.  The other two systematically work their way to the

front.  What would be the objection to saying, policeman,


of course, you can ask citizens to cooperate?  Certainly


that's a very desirable thing.  But in those closed,


cramped quarters where you have three, just say you don't


have to answer if you don't want to.  You don't have to be


searched if you don't want to, making clear that you're


eliciting voluntary cooperation and nobody is under


compulsion.  What would be the objection to that?


MR. THOMPSON:  Well, as this Court noted in


Bostick, Your Honor, just because the police-citizen


encounter happens on a bus, there's no reason to establish


some kind of per se rule.


QUESTION:  Well, I assume Congress could enact a


statute like that, couldn't it, for Federal officers? 


Couldn't Congress prescribe that whenever Federal drug


agents enter a bus, they -- and to conduct a -- a search,


they shall make such a statement?


MR. THOMPSON:  I -- I don't know --


QUESTION:  You would have no problem with


Congress doing that, would you? 


MR. THOMPSON:  I would -- I would say, Your


Honor, here that --


QUESTION:  It might.  It might be bad policy. 


And my question was are there policy objections to -- I'm


not saying what the constitutional rule is.  I understand

those arguments.  I'm just, for my own benefit, trying to


find out if that would cause a practical problem or not.


MR. THOMPSON:  I can think of three reasons. 


Your Honor, this Court has consistently held that we --


you do not want to saddle law enforcement officers with


some kind of bright line test in Fourth Amendment cases. 


That's very important here when I would submit that


Bostick is an appropriate vehicle to determine the


validity of consent.


In these particular cases, it's -- it's very


difficult.  You have an unstructured, rapidly evolving and


developing situation, and warnings would not be --


QUESTION:  And one of the difficulties with --


with a warning is, you know, Miranda was supposed to be a


bright line test where, you know, we didn't have to argue


about anything.  Well, we had at least 60 or 70 cases here


deciding whether somebody introduced -- was interrogating


and that sort of thing.  So, if you have some sort of a


requirement like that, it's just another layer of


litigation. 


MR. THOMPSON:  Absolutely, Your Honor, and I


would direct the Court's attention to a case that was


cited in the Government's brief, United States v.


Stephens, where there was some appropriate warning, and


the court -- the Ninth Circuit in that particular case

said that the warning confused the passengers, intimidated


the passengers.  But --


QUESTION:  Well, I assume the other policy


objection is, the underlying premise of Justice Breyer's


suggestion is the Government has some obligation to teach


everybody about their rights.  And that's a -- that's a


sweeping proposition. 


MR. THOMPSON:  I would agree. 


QUESTION:  Especially when it's not required by


the Constitution. 


MR. THOMPSON:  I would agree, Justice --


QUESTION:  May I ask you what significance, if


any -- I don't know if it's significant or not -- do you


attach to the fact that, as I understand it from the court


of appeals opinion, that this officer had made similar


requests several hundred times and only five or six people


had ever said no?  Is that relevant at all? 


MR. THOMPSON:  It is not relevant, Your Honor. 


Some people did say no.  Most people --


QUESTION:  You don't think that suggests that


perhaps most people thought they had an obligation to


answer? 


MR. THOMPSON:  Well, Your Honor, as this Court


-- as this Court held in Delgado, simply because most


citizens cooperate and most citizens agree with the

officer's request, that's no indication that the consent


at issue is involuntary. 


If there are no further questions, I would like


to reserve the remainder of my time. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Thompson.


Ms. Spivey, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF GWENDOLYN SPIVEY


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MS. SPIVEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This Court should reaffirm Bostick in its


entirety.  We are not arguing that advice should be


required.  Rather, we think that Bostick got it entirely


right with the language that advice is a factor


particularly worth noting.  If Bostick is revised, we


would ask the Court to remand to the court of appeals, as


it did in Bostick, so that it can reconsider. 


I believe the key to this test -- and I don't


mean to sound presumptuous.  Having thought long and hard,


I think the key is that the Eleventh Circuit really was


trying to give voice to the seizure or -- and the consent


test, as set out in Bostick.  In Bostick at U.S. 437, the


Court wrote -- it focused on what the police conduct --


conduct would have communicated to a reasonable person.


And in Washington at 1357 and Guapi at 1395,

what the Eleventh Circuit focused on -- it said, it is


enough that the circumstances themselves would indicate


that the search can proceed only if consent is given.  So,


I believe that the Eleventh Circuit parallels Bostick's


use of the word -- that focused on what does it


communicate with their use of the word indicate.  And


indicate necessarily refers back to -- it expressly refers


back to the circumstances, which is the totality. 


And while courts tend to focus most commonly on


whether or not advice was given or not given, I think


there are any number of acts or omissions that focus on


the police conduct --


QUESTION:  That -- that I think is true, but


could -- if their point is that if -- if you were to take


your case, this case before us, and say under the present


law and the test that you're enunciating, that you do have


to tell the passengers what I suggested earlier -- tell


them they don't have to answer or respond -- well, then


you'd have to in every case.  So, why don't you give me an


example of one where they wouldn't. 


MS. SPIVEY:  Yes, sir.  I would -- I would posit


a -- a -- I could posit a scenario, and the best one I


thought of is that that we've all flown on airplanes and


--

QUESTION:  No.  On a bus.  Could you possibly do

-- because actually oddly enough Bostick is about buses. 


MS. SPIVEY:  Yes, sir. 


QUESTION:  And -- and there -- it's about buses.


MS. SPIVEY:  Yes, sir. 


QUESTION:  And the buses are stopped and


somebody comes on.  All right.  So, what is -- can you


think of any example in those circumstances where they


wouldn't have to make that announcement? 


MS. SPIVEY:  Yes, sir.  In a -- besides


referring to the specific factors here and suggesting that


the police conduct ratchet down the coerciveness of any


factor, I would suggest that if the police did not delay


the -- the departure of the bus, did not engage in bag-


matching, and did not do any more than a -- a flight


attendant does standing in the aisle and talking


individually to the passenger and does not use language


that would communicate to a reasonable, innocent person


that cooperation is required -- for example, using


language that it's voluntary.  They could use language


that it's voluntary.  They could say, are you willing,


with your permission. 


Or specifically in this case, relating to Mr.


Drayton, they could engage in acts.  For example, when you


ask --


QUESTION:  Didn't they use language like that in

this case?  Did they say, you know, open your coat, I want


to pat you down? 


MS. SPIVEY:  They used --


QUESTION:  Didn't they make it clear that they


were asking permission which suggests that the person has


the ability to deny permission?


MS. SPIVEY:  Respectfully, Justice Scalia, I


don't believe so.  I think it was very clear that what


they were asking for was cooperation.


QUESTION:  What -- what words did they use in --


in particular? 


MS. SPIVEY:  They immediately approached each


individual passenger --


QUESTION:  Right. 


MS. SPIVEY:  -- and said, I'm Officer so and so. 


I'm doing this. 


QUESTION:  Right. 


MS. SPIVEY:  Do you have a bag on the bus?


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. SPIVEY:  I believe that point right there


denied the Bostick right to refuse to engage with the


officer.


QUESTION:  Wait.  And -- and that's all they


asked, and when the person said yes, they immediately


searched the bag?

brief --


it?


MS. SPIVEY:  Do you mind if I check it?


QUESTION:  Does -- does that not suggest exactly


what you want them to suggest, that the person has the


ability to withhold that consent?


MS. SPIVEY:  No, Justice Scalia.  In Schneckloth


at U.S. 229, this Court referred to the, quote, subtly


coercive police questions.  And I think one really does


have to look at the nuances of the questions and how a


reasonable, innocent person would take them.


QUESTION:  Well, what is the nuance of a


question, do you mind if I inspect it?


MS. SPIVEY:  Because I think no matter how a


reasonable, innocent person answers it, Mr. Chief Justice,


the police can construe it as consent.  If they say --

 QUESTION:  But -- well, is there any doubt that


this person answered it in a way that indicated consent?


MS. SPIVEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, I believe there


is doubt because I believe -- not as to the bag, but as to


the question, do you mind if I check your person.  I do


believe there's definitely doubt because of the indirect


question and also because of his --


QUESTION:  Well, what's -- what's indirect?  Do


you mind if I check your person? 


MS. SPIVEY:  Because no matter whether you


answer it yes or no, it's not may I check your person.  If


you say no, it means no.  Yes means yes.  But if you say,


do you mind if I, if the person says yes --


QUESTION:  So, it -- it turns on that sort of a


subtle distinction? 


MS. SPIVEY:  I think it can, Your Honor.  I


think it's one factor --


QUESTION:  But if we do, then don't we have to


follow the district court?  I mean, the district court


there concluded in the facts that everything was


cooperative, there was nothing coercive, there was nothing


confrontational. 


MS. SPIVEY:  Yes, sir. 


QUESTION:  And he heard the officer and he heard


the tone of voice.  So, how -- how could we possibly get

around that? 


MS. SPIVEY:  Well, Justice Breyer, the district


court applied the wrong test.  It applied the free-to-


leave test.  That -- that's at the joint appendix at 132,


and that's specifically what this Court rejected in


Bostick the Florida Supreme Court had done. 


He also -- I disagree with the Government's


representation that he said that Mr. Drayton was clear or


unambiguous.  He did not address -- he did not make any


factual findings as to the actual encounter.  And --


QUESTION:  The freedom-to-leave test actually is


-- is more beneficial for your client.  Everybody knows


you're not free to leave the bus.  You'll miss the bus. 


I 

mean, that's -- that's what we said in Bostick.  So, it


seems to me that the district court applied a higher


standard than -- than was necessary and still found


voluntary search.


MS. SPIVEY:  Well, Justice Kennedy, from my


perspective, the important point is that he applied the


wrong test, the test this Court has rejected. 


And also, he made two other legal --


QUESTION:  Do you want us to reverse because


there was a test that's too favorable to your client?  I


don't understand that. 


MS. SPIVEY:  No.  I -- I have no -- I have no

objection with the Bostick test, either the test for


seizure at U.S. 437 or the test for consent at U.S. 438. 


I think that the court of appeals then applied the correct


test and overturned the -- the legal conclusion which the


district court reached. 


The district court said that -- he made a global


conclusion.  He said, quote, their consent leads me to


believe there was no violation.  Well, I think that, with


all respect, is a tautology.  Just because they consent,


it doesn't mean there's no violation.  And I think that --


he said --


QUESTION:  Surely he meant their consent in


those circumstances.  Didn't he recite in the opinion all


of the circumstances involved? 


MS. SPIVEY:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Don't you think it's a little unfair


to -- to read that after -- after he describes the whole


situation as simply saying, well, since they consented, it


must be okay? 


MS. SPIVEY:  Justice Scalia --


QUESTION:  I mean, you can say, you know, I'm


going to torture you if you don't let me look at it. 


Okay, okay, okay, look at it. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Surely nobody is going to say his

consent shows that it was voluntary. 


MS. SPIVEY:  No, Justice Scalia, I don't agree


with the first part of the question because the district


court made no findings whatsoever regarding the specifics


of the actual encounter or exchange between the -- the


defendants and the -- or the police officers and


individual passengers. 


QUESTION:  Did you ask for findings -- did you


ask for findings that were that detailed? 


MS. SPIVEY:  The trial -- neither trial counsel


for the Government nor the defense did, Your Honor. 


But the district court then said there's nothing


coercive about this encounter, and I believe that's an


ultimate legal conclusion which, when the court of appeals


applied the correct test from Bostick, reached the correct


result.


QUESTION:  As far as Drayton is concerned,


there's nothing in the record other than that he lifted


his hands from his lap.  Is there -- he didn't utter any


words, and so his consent rides on that gesture and what


it meant.


MS. SPIVEY:  Yes.  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that


is correct.  And I think it's clear under Schneckloth and


Bumper that mere acquiescence -- and that was -- is not


sufficient.  And that's why I was saying I think that the

police conduct can be either acts or -- and/or omissions. 


And I think the omission here or the act here was simply


not waiting on an answer.


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  When -- when you're asked


a question, do you mind if I conduct a pat-down, and you


raise up your arms like that, what -- what does that


naturally convey?


MS. SPIVEY:  I think that's a classic example,


Your Honor -- after you've just watched the other


passenger arrested and hauled across the top of you,


that's a classic example of mere acquiescence to a show of


authority. 


QUESTION:  Mere acquiescence.


QUESTION:  That's apparently the opposite --


QUESTION:  Acquiescence would be just to sit


there, it seems to me. 


QUESTION:  I mean, isn't that the opposite of


what the district court thought --


MS. SPIVEY:  The district --


QUESTION:  -- who saw all this?  I mean, the


district court heard the witnesses.  He heard the tone of


voice.  I mean, I don't see how to get very far with this


notion of the question. 


What about the other two things?  Was this a


case where the passengers knew that the bags were being

matched? 


MS. SPIVEY:  Justice Breyer, in response to your


first question, the district court never addressed the


specifics of Mr. Drayton's nonverbal response --


QUESTION:  All right.  I -- I see it. 


What about -- but was this a case where the --


where -- was this a case where the passengers knew that


the bags were being matched? 


MS. SPIVEY:  I think it was very clear.  I don't


think a reasonable person sitting in that bus, unless they


were deaf, could not have known that the bags -- they were


asking every person, do you -- as the first question.  Do


you have a bag?  If they did, may I check it.  In fact,


Officer Lang --


QUESTION:  Well, I don't know what you meant


then by bags being matched.  I thought you meant that they


went outside or did something.  I --


MS. SPIVEY:  No, Your Honor.  The carry-on


luggage, which this Court, you know, focused on in Bond,


the privacy of that carry-on luggage.  I believe that the


Government -- the officer used that as a means of


basically forcing an encounter by asking a person, do you


have a bag. 


And Stephens pointed out the Hobson's choice


that a passenger faces.  They don't -- it -- it denies

their right to ignore the officer because if they say


nothing, the bag is construed as abandoned.  You have to


respond to the officer.  So, I think Bostick gives you the


right to ignore --


QUESTION:  An American citizen has to protect


his rights once in a while.  That's -- that's a very bad


thing?


MS. SPIVEY:  I think the Bostick, Justice


Kennedy, gave citizens, bus passengers, the right to


ignore officers.


QUESTION:  Of course.  The right to say,


officer, don't bother me. 


MS. SPIVEY:  But that's not ignoring them, Your


Honor.  That's having to engage with them, and I think


that's part of the technique that's used, is getting a


person -- if you can get them to --


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I don't read Bostick that


way.


Now, this -- this argument that because the


first person is arrested, the second person feels coerced,


that seems to me it goes the other way around.  The second


person now knows the consequences of giving consent. 


Under your theory, the first person is arrested and the


second person says, oh, I -- I'd like to be arrested too. 


Come and search me.

MS. SPIVEY:  I don't think --


QUESTION:  That -- that doesn't make sense.


MS. SPIVEY:  I don't think a reasonable,


innocent person would take what happened to -- to a


passenger sitting next to him as anything but a classic


example of a show of authority. 


In -- in response to your question, Justice


Kennedy, to the Government earlier, I think that putting


the burden on the citizen shifts the -- the burden is on


the Government in every case to prove that the encounter


is consensual and that any consent given is voluntary and


is uncoerced.  And I think --


QUESTION:  The question is whether or not the


Government also has the burden to educate citizens as to


their rights in every encounter, whether or not there


isn't some obligation on the part of the citizen to know


and to exercise his rights or her rights. 


MS. SPIVEY:  Justice Kennedy, I believe that


that ignores the demographic realities of the reasonable


bus passenger.  The Government acknowledged below that


most bus passengers are economically disadvantaged, and


they don't know who their Congressman is or the Governor. 


They don't -- that was not acknowledged below.  I don't


mean --

 QUESTION:  So, you want people to travel on


buses where people might have weapons and drugs and can't


be searched.  You think that's better for passengers.


MS. SPIVEY:  Certainly not, Your Honor. 


Certainly not, but I think there is a limit to the


imposition on millions of innocent people for the purpose


of ferreting out ordinary criminal wrongdoing.  And to the


extent that the -- the departure of this bus was delayed,


I think this case is right on point with the Edmund case.


To the extent they delayed the forward movement of that


bus, I believe every passenger on it was seized even


though I disagree that the court below addressed the


seizure issue.


QUESTION:  Ms. Spivey, is there anything in the


record that -- that indicates whether the police knew that


these two people were traveling together? 


MS. SPIVEY:  They knew that they were seated


next to each other in a seat.  There was no testimony


whatsoever -- there was testimony that the officer had


seen the respondents in -- depending on which transcript


we're looking at.  There is testimony in the joint


appendix that the officer had seen them boarding the bus,


and that is at J.A. 105.  In response to questioning by


the court, he indicated he had seen them boarding the bus,


but there was no testimony in this record that he ever saw

them together before he saw them seated next to each other


in the seat.


And the other point I wanted to make, going to


that question, if I might, is that --


QUESTION:  Well, the -- he did associate the two


of them because of the fact that they were both wearing


heavy, baggy clothes, although the weather wasn't that


cold in Tallahassee at the time. 


MS. SPIVEY:  Yes, sir.  But he never said that


they were traveling together.


QUESTION:  Okay, but they're sitting next to


each other, and unlike the other passengers in the bus,


they're all -- they're both wearing heavy, baggy clothes.


I'm not sure that -- that the major result of


the first -- of the first seizure wouldn't really have


been to give the police probable cause anyway to -- to


search the second passenger, even without his consent.


MS. SPIVEY:  Well --


QUESTION:  You see -- you see two guys dressed


extravagantly sitting next to each other.  You search the


first one and find drugs on him.  You think you're not


going to search the second?


MS. SPIVEY:  I think that if they had looked at


the -- at the passengers' tickets, they would have had


reasonable suspicion, but I do not think there are any

facts in this case -- and the police officer -- they're


the best ones to judge -- and the prosecutor at trial all


agreed there was no reasonable suspicion here.


QUESTION:  I would have searched the second one. 


I would have thought I had probable cause having two guys


both dressed in baggy clothes in warm weather, I find


drugs on the first, they're sitting next to each other. 


I 

think I would have probable cause to search the second.


MS. SPIVEY:  Yes, Justice Scalia, I think the


record adequately points out reasons why all of those


factors could have been -- could have been determined to


be totally innocent.  The innocent people could have been


doing that same thing.  Baggy pants are very popular these


days.  One can look anywhere and see them.  There were


reasons why they would have had their coats on.


QUESTION:  Not in Tallahassee in the summertime.


MS. SPIVEY:  It was February 4th, 1999, Your


Honor, which is not --


QUESTION:  You -- you think that the police


should have asked them -- told the people in the bus


you're free to leave.  That's basically -- would that make


it all right in your opinion? 


MS. SPIVEY:  No, Your Honor, because I --


QUESTION:  No.  What -- what -- is it that the


police in your opinion can't search anyone in the bus?

Period?  What -- what is your view on that?


MS. SPIVEY:  I -- I don't believe that either. 


I think that -- I clearly agree with Bostick that on-bus


searches, consensual --


QUESTION:  No, no.  I'm trying to -- I'm sorry. 


I misspoke.  Your -- your view is that they should have


told the passengers explicitly in a strong way you do not


have to cooperate if you don't want to.  Is that -- is


that your view? 


MS. SPIVEY:  My view is that in a case like


this, which is at the margins, where a court of appeals


looks at it and feels that it's so coercive that there are


various acts or omissions that the police can do to


ratchet down the coerciveness of the environment, or they


can choose to counter it, which the most -- the typical


example we see is the giving or -- or withholding of


advice.  And certainly that's been determinative in some


of the Court's cases or appears to have been outcome-


determinative.  But I think there are other things the


police can do.


QUESTION:  So, we -- we should accept the feel,


as you describe it, of the court of appeals in this case?


MS. SPIVEY:  Well, Your Honor, I think that was


one of the main -- there were two main points of Arvizu. 


One was to reject the divide and conquer approach of the

Government that, well, because this -- this factor didn't


weigh heavily, we shouldn't even look at it. 


But the other was that it recognized the


importance of a court of appeals in a totality test,


employing de novo review, to unify precedent and to


provide guidance to district courts --


QUESTION:  What -- I'm trying to look at what to


do.  I'm -- I'm not -- suppose I think for argument's sake


in many circumstances where policemen come up and question


people, even if they say politely, are you willing to


answer my questions or be searched, the person feels


coerced.  But the law still tries to draw a line even if


that's fictional in reality.  Very well.  What's the right


line?  I mean, are buses special?  What is it that's


supposed to be done?  That's what I'm trying to elicit


from you. 


MS. SPIVEY:  Justice Breyer, I don't believe I


can give this Court a bright line test because of the


totality of the circumstances.  I think it's the nature of


the totality test that, under the right circumstances, any


factor can -- can serve to tip the balance in the right


circumstances.  And so, I -- I don't think I can give a


bright -- I don't think a bright line test can be devised


when the totality of the circumstances --


QUESTION:  May I ask you a question that I keep

-- perhaps this is sort of strange.  But if the police


made it perfectly clear to everyone that they -- in the


bus that there will be no adverse consequences whatsoever


if you refuse to let me search your -- your luggage, why


would anyone let them search?  Why --


MS. SPIVEY:  Well --


QUESTION:  In other words, I want to look


through your luggage.  Why would you say yes?  If you know


there can be no adverse consequences, it seems to me they


would never be able to search anybody. 


MS. SPIVEY:  Unless they had an overwhelming


desire to cooperate and have their personal stuff gone


through.


QUESTION:  Well, what is the cooperation?  We're


going to let you find out that I don't have guns and drugs


in my -- I know I don't have guns and drugs in my luggage. 


So, why should -- don't -- don't bother me.  I don't want


you to search me.  I don't see why anyone would ever


consent if they knew it was totally risk-free.


MS. SPIVEY:  I agree, Justice Stevens.


QUESTION:  I don't agree.  I -- I know it's


risk-free, and I would certainly give my consent.  I think


it's a good thing for the police to do.


MS. SPIVEY:  Well, Justice Scalia, I would


certainly never consent to them checking my person for

QUESTION:  If I was dressed like that, I would. 


If I was dressed like that on a hot day, I'd be


probably --


QUESTION:  On a hot day in February. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  I'm -- I'm only using the record,


Chief Justice.  The record -- the record says it was


unusually hot. 


(Laughter.) 


MS. SPIVEY:  I would like to address the


Government's argument that there is a per se rule in this


case.  And one of the points they make is -- in their


reply brief at 4, they argue that because we have not


identified one case in which the Eleventh Circuit has


ruled in favor of the Government in an on-bus case -- I


have been able to identify three unpublished decisions,


which I'd like to cite to the Court.  And at Mr. Souter's


direction, I will lodge them with the Clerk after


argument.  They are: the McLean case, which is case number


01-10678, dated July 6th, 2001, after Washington; the


Reese case, 00-11291, dated March 15th, 2001; and the


Garrett case, dated -- case number 97-2202, dated November


19th, 1997.


QUESTION:  Does the Eleventh Circuit have any

rule about using its unpublished opinions for any purpose


other than preclusion in a particular case?


MS. SPIVEY:  It's considered persuasive


authority but not binding authority. 


But my point was simply that if they had -- if


they had a de facto per se rule, then it would be outcome


-- the presence or absence of rights would be outcome --


outcome-determinative in every case.  But in those three


cases, which were on-bus searches, there was either no


advice or no mention of it in the opinion.  And of course,


these unpublished opinions are very hard to get, but the


Government gave me an incentive to find them.


QUESTION:  The -- the briefs make a big deal


about the fact that they didn't announce that everybody on


the bus first -- a general announcement what was going to


happen.  I -- I -- it seems to me that if we go down that


road and it'd be like our cases, where one case says they


didn't look at the officer, and the next case said they


didn't look at the -- I -- I just think that's equivocal. 


I think you can argue that either way. 


And you go on for 15 pages in -- in your brief


about the -- the police chose the -- the locus, the bus


locus, the fact that they were close to the passengers,


which they obviously had to be in the bus, and -- and


talked individually to each passenger, the officer's

appearance and demeanor, they constructively blocked the


aisle, they presented their badges, but they didn't show


the gun. 


It -- it seems to me this world you're creating


for us is -- is not strong for the Constitution.  It seems


to me a strong world is when officers respect people's


rights and -- and people know what their rights are and --


and assert their rights.  I don't want to be searched.


MS. SPIVEY:  Well, Justice Kennedy --


QUESTION:  I don't want to be searched.  Leave


me alone. 


MS. SPIVEY:  I agree that would be an ideal


world if all our citizens took civics or took law and knew


their rights, but I don't believe they do. 


And I think the fact that we go through the


factors is simply a product of the totality test.  That's


necessary to look at all the relevant factors in that


totality test.  But I don't think there is any defining


point at which one -- a person can say I think it's up to


the court in every case, is this too coercive, does it go


too far? 


I would note that in Bostick, Bostick did -- did


set out the seizure test at 437, the consent test at 438. 


The one thing it really in my mind didn't really clearly


focus on was the test that the Eleventh Circuit was

looking at.  The question they looked at is whether the


circumstances here were so coercive that no reasonable


person could have given a consent that would have been


determined to be voluntary.  And I think that's why in the


court's opinion, the court of appeals opinion -- this is


-- excuse me -- footnote 4 at page 6a of the petition to


the appendix.  That is why they then used the language --


I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  It's footnote 6 at page 8a.  They


then used the language, quoting Bostick, but whether a


reasonable person would have felt free to decline the


officer's request. 


And I think that is -- was their attempt to go


to the element of was this -- was this a coercive


environment.  It distinguishes it from the seizure test


which focuses on the police conduct and what it would have


communicated and I -- and then the consent test, which is


at 438, which focuses -- under Schneckloth includes a


focus on the personal factors, factors personal to the


defendant.  And I think that's why the Court here said


that those factors personal to the defendant were not


determinative because we're looking at a little higher


level of analysis as to whether this environment was so


coercive. 


I do agree that in the context of your average


bus case, it's a very short encounter, very brief.  The

testimony was that in 15 to 20 minutes, the officer could


engage with two to three people.  So, you're looking maybe


5 to 10 minutes per person.  And I think that the test --


that the factors relating to seizure and the factors


relating to the -- the consent tend to be conflated, and


so it is sometimes sort of hard to sort out.  And a lot of


the factors will apply to both of those tests.


QUESTION:  Why -- why is it that the most


immediate expression of the police officers does not


counteract whatever other indications of compulsion might


exist under the circumstances?  I mean, if the policeman


comes up and says, you know, lean up against the wall,


spread your legs, I'm going to pat you down, you're under


compulsion.  But if he comes up and says, do you mind if I


search your person, you know, I don't care what other --


there's a policeman in the front of the bus.  Who cares? 


He -- he has made it very clear that he's asking for your


permission.  What -- what more need he do than that?  Do


you mind if I search your person? 


MS. SPIVEY:  I believe, Justice Scalia, if the


Court ruled that, it would be a bright line test as


opposed to a totality test.  And I think one has to --


when one applies a reasonable person -- reasonable,


innocent person test, one of necessity puts themselves in


the seat of that bus passenger.  How do they feel?  And

that's why, Justice Breyer, I tried to give the -- the


little example of the airplane because --


QUESTION:  My problem, of course, is I think if


you go with an all-facts test, you've got to go with the


district court.  He saw it and the court of appeals


didn't.  And that's why I've been wondering if maybe


there's something inherently coercive about the bus


environment that suggests a -- a need for a warning.  But


you don't agree with that and -- and therefore I'm sort of


stuck.  And there we are. 


QUESTION:  Why -- why don't you agree with that? 


I mean, it seemed that was almost the question that I -- I


asked when -- when you were responding to Justice Stevens


and you said, well, ultimately sure, anybody who gets


these warnings, with a teaspoonful of brains, is going to


say no, I -- I'm not going to let you search. 


And -- and it seemed to me that maybe the -- the


answer to the problem is there are some situations in


which if you don't give the warning, it does get to the


point of -- or is virtually a -- a coercive situation per


se, and it may be that there's no easy answer in those


circumstances. 


If you don't let them know that they have a


right to refuse, there's inherent coercion.  If you do let


them know, most people are going to say, no, you can't

search.  But you resist that.  You -- you don't regard it


as inherently coercive.  And I -- I guess I'm not sure why


you -- you resist it.  Why isn't it? 


MS. SPIVEY:  Justice Souter, personally yes, I


do agree with you.  I think it is an inherently coercive


environment.  But I simply didn't take that position


because I didn't think that was a position that I could --


QUESTION:  Sell. 


MS. SPIVEY:  -- prevail upon. 


QUESTION:  Sell to the Court? 


(Laughter.) 


MS. SPIVEY:  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  I -- I did


not because of it being sort of a bright line. 


But I guess my feel about it is that there seems


to be some contradiction between when we talk about in


Miranda, we're talking about a coercive -- we're talking


about someone who's suspected of a crime.  There's


probable cause, and so we're going to give them some


warnings.  But yet, a reasonable, innocent person,


millions of bus passengers -- they don't get anything. 


And there just -- I don't know -- it seems to me something


wrong with that --


QUESTION:  Ms. Spivey, is there anything in the


record about what the innocent people actually felt when


the police officers came on the bus?

 MS. SPIVEY:  There's nothing but the testimony


of the officer as to what he thinks they felt.  There is


no testimony of the passengers.


QUESTION:  So, we really don't know how the


innocent passengers felt. 


MS. SPIVEY:  No, sir, we don't.  We just have to


try to put ourselves in their shoes and how would we feel. 


Not being lawyers --


QUESTION:  The only testimony was -- Officer


Lang was the only one.  He was one of the three.  He was


one of the two questioners.  He's the only one who


testified in the district court.  Is that right? 


MS. SPIVEY:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg. 


QUESTION:  Do you think -- you haven't said


anything about the difference between, say, a bus terminal


or a street where when the police say whatever -- you --


you are in a large space.  There is something different


about a bus and -- or the airplane cabin where you -- you


are rather confined compared to being stopped in the


street. 


MS. SPIVEY:  I think that is the primary point


that goes to Justice Souter's question about why it is


inherently coercive.  It sort of goes back to a Royer's


situation where you had a person in a small, enclosed


room.  But I personally -- if you're sitting in a seat and

that's why I said if -- if the person like a stewardess


would just stand there and not come right in your face,


but a person gets in your face, you can't move over, you


can't back up, I don't see how you could possibly get out


of the seat without -- even if you wanted to.  But that's


not the test. 


QUESTION:  I thought the testimony showed that


the officer leaned over from the back, not in your face.


MS. SPIVEY:  The -- the district court


characterized his style as sort of in your face.  He


clearly stood.  His testimony was he was standing in the


aisle, but I guess behind -- he didn't say this.  This is


how I understand it -- behind the arm -- behind the


armrest so that a person could theoretically get their


legs out.  My -- but he was very clearly leaning over 12


to 18 inches from Mr. Drayton's face, holding his badge


up.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Spivey. 


MS. SPIVEY:  Thank you very much. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Thompson, you have 4 minutes


remaining. 


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LARRY D. THOMPSON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. THOMPSON:  Your Honor, I have a couple


points.

 There was nothing in -- in the record that would


indicate that the bus was in fact delayed. 


On the -- on the consent point, the district


court specifically held that the defendants consented


after hearing the evidence at the -- at the suppression


hearing.  And the respondents were not naive individuals


or unable to understand or assert their -- their rights. 


Respondent Drayton was 26.  He was employed for 6 of the


last 8 years, and he had experience in dealing with


previous drug charges.  Respondent Brown was 29 and had


been a -- a corrections officer.


And the point with respect to Justice Breyer's


question.  Your Honor, buses, as -- as the Government


pointed out in its reply brief, buses today in today's


environment are vulnerable.  They are vulnerable to


specific public safety concerns, and the Government would


submit that bus passengers are entitled to the kind of


efficient, effective, and fair bus interdiction efforts


that are -- that characterize --


QUESTION:  Do passengers on the buses go through


the same kind of check that we do on airlines?


MR. THOMPSON:  No, they do not, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  That's -- that's what I was wondering


because today people might think if you're on a airport


and you don't go through the detector, you don't fly.

Well, they might think that if you don't answer the


questions, you don't go --


MR. THOMPSON:  We do not --


QUESTION:  -- on the bus.  And -- and -- so


maybe there's more need now for something. 


MR. THOMPSON:  We -- we do not have that


specific kind of program, and certainly that was not the


-- the reason relied upon for the consent in -- in the


record below.  But in this particular case, Your Honor,


Officer Lang testified that not only did most of the


passengers that he encountered consent, but of them


appreciated what he was doing.  It gave them a sense of


comfort.  It made them feel that their bus travel was


safe.  And that would be the point that I would like to


make here. 


And unless the Court has any further questions. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Thompson. 


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
