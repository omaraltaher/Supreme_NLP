CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 02-306, the Beneficial National Bank versus


Marie Anderson.


Mr. Waxman.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The complaint in this case alleges that a


national bank charged excessive interest.  This Court has


held repeatedly and consistently since 1875 that


section 30 of the National Bank Act of 1864 provides both


the exclusive standards governing the interest that a 

national bank may charge and the exclusive judicial


remedies for any violation.


And as a result, any claim that a national bank


charged excessive interest necessarily arises under


Federal law, whether that claim is brought in State court


or Federal court.  Any well-pleaded complaint would


reflect that, and therefore, any claim of usury against a


national bank, whether pleaded well or mistakenly or


deceptively, falls within the original jurisdiction of the


Federal courts and may either be filed there by a

plaintiff or removed there by a defendant.


QUESTION:  Mr. Waxman, normally when the Federal


Government creates a cause of action that preempts State


causes of action, it attaches an element to that cause of


action that does not exist under some of the State causes


of action.  Let's say, it -- it creates a cause of action


against the owners and -- and managers of nuclear


facilities, but the cause of action must be based on


something more than mere negligence.  It has to be


intentional malfeasance or gross negligence.  Okay?


Now, what if somebody comes in and brings a


cause of action in State court, alleging mere negligence


by the owners of the nuclear facility?  Is it your


position that that case is removable even though it


wouldn't -- it wouldn't survive a motion to dismiss for 

failure to state a claim under -- under Federal law?


MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Scalia, with respect, I


don't think that I would concede the premise of your


question, that is, that a Federal cause of action


ordinarily has an additional element.


QUESTION:  All right.  Well --


MR. WAXMAN:  But leaving that aside --


QUESTION:  Leaving -- in my hypothetical --


create one --


MR. WAXMAN:  Your -- your hypothetical actually

is an example of a very peculiar instance in which, with


respect to nuclear incidents, Congress has imported in --


has federalized the cause.  It created an express Federal


cause of action --


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. WAXMAN:  -- and said expressly that State


law standards will apply and it will be the law of


whatever State the incident occurred.


QUESTION:  But take my hypothetical.  What do


you do in my hypothetical?  Is it removable or not?


MR. WAXMAN:  If -- if --


QUESTION:  Yes or no.


MR. WAXMAN:  If -- if any -- I hope I can


remember your hypothetical.  The --


QUESTION: 


The hypothetical is you plead a State 

law cause of action that does not claim all of the


elements which are necessary for the Federal cause of


action.  So it's clear on the face of it that it is


dismissable.


MR. WAXMAN:  It is definitely removable.  It


definitely is completely preempted if it comes within the


scope of a cause of action that has been determined to be


exclusive.  Now, that's --


QUESTION:  It's very strange to say that you can


remove something that on its face does not constitute a

Federal cause of action.


MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Scalia, there may -- in


preemption cases, there are line-drawing problems at the


margins about whether something is or isn't preempted. 


This is a heartland case and the example -- the


hypothetical you're giving is let's say that State of


Alabama or the State of Delaware created strict liability


for excessive interest.  The Federal statute says it has


to be knowingly under section 86.  There is no question --


no question -- under this Court's decided cases that a


claim that a national bank charged excessive interest,


with whatever state of mind or lack of state of mind, is


governed exclusively by Federal standards and an exclusive


Federal cause of action and that --


QUESTION: 


Right, but the question is whether 

the consequence of that is that the State law cause of


action must be dismissed by the State court because it's


preempted, or rather, the consequence is that you can


remove into Federal court a pleading that plainly on its


face does not -- does not claim a Federal cause of action.


MR. WAXMAN:  Well, the --


QUESTION:  It just seems very strange to me.


MR. WAXMAN:  The -- the pleading -- the


complaint in this case on its face does satisfy the


Federal cause of action and --

 QUESTION:  I understand that.  I understand


that.  We're -- we're not talking about what happens here. 


But I -- with regard to the general principle that you


want us to set forth.


MR. WAXMAN:  I think --


QUESTION:  That's -- what's -- what I'm


concerned about.  Is it that all cases automatically come,


or is it only those that -- that set forth a Federal cause


of action?


MR. WAXMAN:  It has to be one that if well


pleaded -- I mean, a -- on a removal -- on a notice of


removal, the Federal court is obligated, like any court


determining its own jurisdiction, to read the complaint as


if it were well pleaded.  And if, when the court reads the


complaint, it says there is a Federal question necessarily 

presented in here which has been inartfully not pleaded,


the court then proceeds to adjudicate on the merits that


claim.  If the answer is no, if the answer is, hey, this


guy pleaded a claim under State law and I have well


pleaded it and it still doesn't raise a Federal question,


then you remand.


And it's that -- that's sort of -- I didn't mean


to quibble with you, but the principle that we suggest is


very straightforward is simply an application of this


Court's decided jurisprudence, under arising-under

jurisdiction, that removal jurisdiction follows original


jurisdiction.


QUESTION:  Mr. -- Mr. Waxman, is what you're


saying essentially there is a Federal claim or there is no


claim?  Certainly the plaintiff doesn't want there to be


no claim.  If there is a claim, it is necessarily Federal.


MR. WAXMAN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And that's what makes it removable. 


It is treated as though it were well pleaded, when, in


fact, it's badly pleaded.


MR. WAXMAN:  Indeed.  And the -- the perplexing


thing about this case is the sort of almost Kafkaesque


situation that we have that's exemplified by the amicus


briefs on both sides where this particular instance where


the plaintiff says usury under State law even though the 

Supreme -- this -- this Court has decided, since 11 years


after the act was passed in the Civil War, that there is


no such State claim, we now have a -- a group of


plaintiffs' lawyers from California urging this Court to


establish a right to plead something that in their own


case they say is only, quote, defensively preempted.


QUESTION:  If they had --


MR. WAXMAN:  And no one has -- I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  If they had pled it correctly, they


could still be in State court, but the defendant could

remove.  In other words, this is not -- although it's a


Federal claim -- it arises only under Federal law -- it


could be brought in State court or Federal court.


MR. WAXMAN:  Correct.  There is concurrent


jurisdiction as there -- as is the norm, as this Court has


explained.  And there are instances in which these cases


are litigated to the merits in State court and instances


in which they're litigated in Federal court either because


they're brought there by the plaintiff, as the plaintiff


could have here, or they're removed there as the


defendant.


And the other principle that this case reflects,


as I said, is not just the importance of parity in Federal


question jurisdiction between giving plaintiffs and


defendants parity in invoking the Federal courts if they 

choose, but the requirement that this Court has stated


over and over and over again that in -- in determining its


own jurisdiction, the Federal court will construe the


complaint as well-pleaded.


QUESTION:  Mr. Waxman, one thing that troubles


me about -- about the proposal that you make and that the


Government makes is that it seems to me in the LMRA case


that established this principle and in the ERISA case,


which is the only other case that has -- has held to the


same effect, those cases refer to this as being an

extraordinary, an unusual event.  But I don't think it's


going to be an unusual event if we say that whenever there


is created a Federal cause of action, and at the same


time, State causes of action are preempted, it may be


removed to Federal court.  I don't think that will be


unusual at all.


And I sort of looked upon the -- the Labor


Management Relations Act case as really sort of a -- a


platypus, I mean, a very strange case in which the courts


just didn't want these labor things to go into State


courts because they didn't trust State courts.  And so


they said, boy, we're going to have Federal courts create


this whole new law of -- of contracting, of collective


bargaining.  That's how I always regarded it.  And now


you're telling me it's really just a little piece of a 

much broader proposition which is not at all -- not at all


narrow.


MR. WAXMAN:  No.  Justice Scalia, I think it


actually is very, very narrow.  And we can go through in


detail, but almost all of the statutory schemes that


the -- the State's amicus brief cites are not, in fact,


examples of complete preemption.  But it -- it comes up


only in the instance where there is not only substantive


preemption by Federal law and the creation of a Federal


cause of action, but the determination that that cause of

action is, in fact, exclusive.  And that is the difficult


and close question that this Court --


QUESTION:  Well, was -- was that true in the


Farmers' and Mechanics' case?  The -- the Court certainly


said that when you're suing for usury, that was all you


could get with the -- that wasn't, of course, a -- a


removal case at all, was it?


MR. WAXMAN:  No, it wasn't a removal case.  And


in fact, depending on when in 1875 it was decided, there


may or may not have been --


QUESTION:  There wasn't Federal -- there wasn't


Federal question jurisdiction.


MR. WAXMAN:  -- there may not have been removal.


QUESTION:  But it is not a white horse case for


you, that one.


MR. WAXMAN:  I think it is a -- if I understand


the reference, I think it is a white horse case in the


sense -- in this sense, Mr. Chief Justice.  We're not


contending that the 1864 act evinced an intent to make


these causes of action removable, even if pleaded under


State law, because there was no general Federal question


jurisdiction, and it wasn't provided in the law.


The relevant question and the relevant question


that this Court deemed to be close in Metropolitan Life in


the ERISA context is whether -- okay, fine, Federal law

has substantively preempted the field or by conflict or


whatever.  Is the creation of the Federal cause of action


of such force that it should be deemed to be exclusive?


And that, I think, is what this Court decided


first in Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank by saying to the


borrower in that case -- the borrower was maintaining that


under New York State law, it was entitled to void not --


to forfeit not just the interest, but the note.  And this


Court said, look, New York State law has nothing to do


with this.  This is a claim of usury by a national bank. 


The Federal standards are exclusive, and the Federal


penalty expressly will not permit forfeiture of the note. 


Only the interest.


QUESTION:  But -- but certainly under the -- the


statute itself did not preclude the possibility of that 

action having been brought in State court.


MR. WAXMAN:  Not at all.  And in fact, it was


expressly contemplated.  Then as now, these actions can be


brought and are often brought in State courts.  All that


the --


QUESTION:  So can 3 -- 301 suits.  The two cases


that we have so far where we have recognized that there is


only a Federal cause of action, that cause of action could


have been brought just as well in State court, but it's up


to the defendant to remove it.  So we're not talking about

an exclusive Federal forum.


MR. WAXMAN:  That -- that's correct, Justice


Ginsburg.  And the same is true for the types of ERISA


claims that were at issue in Metropolitan Life.


QUESTION:  And -- and I suppose one reason -- I


was surprised when I went through.  I thought there would


be a whole lot of exclusive Federal cause of action,


and -- and there are very few.  But I suppose one of the


reasons we don't get it very often is just what Justice


Ginsburg said.  There are other provisions where there's


an exclusive Federal forum.


MR. WAXMAN:  Correct.  For example, the


Copyright Act.


QUESTION:  Which is -- which is not this case.


MR. WAXMAN: 


The Copyright Act certainly is an 

example of complete preemption, but there's a statutory


provision that --


QUESTION:  Okay, why didn't we express this --


this principle before instead of -- instead of adhering so


narrowly?  I mean, even the ERISA case, it didn't express


this -- this broad theory.  It says, this is -- this is


very much like the section 301, and the legislative


history referred specifically to 301, and therefore we


come out the same way.  Pretty -- pretty narrow.


MR. WAXMAN:  Here's -- here's why, Justice

Scalia.  The very difficult -- this Court made clear in


Metropolitan Life, if it wasn't clear before, that it


wasn't going to infer from congressional silence very


lightly that when Congress created a Federal cause of


action, it meant it to be exclusive so that it would


displace State causes of action.  There's a very strong


and longstanding presumption to the contrary.


But that difficult question was decided in the


context of section 30 of the National Bank Act beginning


in 1875 for reasons that are explained in this Court's


opinion and in the Comptroller's report that the


Government cites that precipitated the enactment of


section 30, which is that this was war legislation.  This


was a -- the creation of the national banks was hoped by


Congress and President Lincoln that it would provide the 

means with which the Government could continue to fund the


war, and national banks would knit the country together


when the war was finished.


And the one thing that comes out of the history


of this case and is reflected in this Court's opinions is


that they feared, based on their experience with the first


bank of the United States and the second bank of the


United States, that jealous States, States that were


jealous of their State-chartered banks, which were issuing


paper at the time, would engage in predations against the

national banks that were created at the very same time


that section 30 was enacted and, in essence, smother this


important Federal infant in its crib.


QUESTION:  I started to call you General Waxman.


(Laughter.)


MR. WAXMAN:  Thank you.


QUESTION:  Like the old days.


MR. WAXMAN:  R-18.


QUESTION:  Assume -- assume that I -- I agree


with you that -- that on -- on complete preemption,


this -- this case passes muster.


But assume also that in writing an opinion, I --


I want to say something to indicate why we do not have a


gathering snowball here.  I mean, we -- first, we had the


labor management reporting. 


Then we got in some ERISA 

cases.  Now we recognize this.


Is there any criterion that you see in -- in at


least the cases on those three points so far, that --


that -- or any language that points to a criterion for


when preemption, particularly field preemption, for


example, becomes complete and when it doesn't?


MR. WAXMAN:  Yes.  There has to be


substantive -- Congress has to supply the exclusive


substantive standards.  It has to create a cause of action


to remedy violations of those standards, and this is the

hard part.  And it also has to make clear that that --


that judicial remedy is, in fact, exclusive, that is, that


it will not permit the existence or operation of State law


causes of action, even those that import the Federal


standards and my --


QUESTION:  Okay.  Why in other cases?  Again,


assume you -- you made your point on -- so far as this


statute is concerned.  Why in other cases aren't courts


going to be, in effect, remitted to doing what the -- the


Court tried to do here, and that is, say, let's find out


what Congress had in mind?  And we don't find anything in


the legislative history that makes it clear, and therefore


it doesn't apply.


MR. WAXMAN:  You -- you have to find out what


Congress had in mind, but I think this Court has made 

clear in Metropolitan Life that it is going to be the


rare, rare, rare day when the Federal courts will infer


from congressional silence that a Federal cause of action


is to be exclusive.


And the other examples in -- in which -- in the


Federal law in which there is, in fact, complete


preemption, the FELA or the Carmack Amendment as an


example, Congress has gone ahead and expressly made those


actions nonremovable.


May I reserve the balance of my time?

 QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Waxman.


Mr. Roberts, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


MR. ROBERTS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


For more than 125 years, it has been clear that


the National Bank Act provides the exclusive cause of


action for a claim of usury against a national bank. 


Because the National Bank Act provides the sole available


avenue of relief, any claim that a national bank has


committed usury can arise only under that Federal law. 


The National Bank --


QUESTION: 


Can I ask you the same question that 

I asked Mr. Waxman?  What if -- what if the pleading makes


a claim of usury, but it does not contain all of the


elements necessary to make out a Federal cause of action? 


Is that removable?


MR. ROBERTS:  A failure to state a claim on


which relief is granted does not deprive the Federal court


of jurisdiction over the claim.  So the simple failure to


state a claim wouldn't prevent it from being removable if


the -- if the claim was within the scope of the Federal


cause of action, if it was a colorable claim.

what they charged was 3 percent and that would not violate


the Federal statute.


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, here -- here we -- we don't


have that situation, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  I understand that.  I want to know --


MR. ROBERTS:  That --


QUESTION:  We -- you're -- you're asking us to


set forth a new general proposition, which we haven't set


forth before. 


We've -- we've treated 301 and ERISA as --

as distinctive cases.  Now you want a general proposition. 


I want to know what does this general proposition cover.


Is the State court going to have to -- or is --


before removal is granted, is the court going to have to


decide whether a cause of action is properly stated, or --


or, you know, whether -- whether it could be dismissed


on -- on a motion to dismiss?


MR. ROBERTS:  When it's removed, the Federal


court decides whether there's jurisdiction under Federal


law, whether there's arising-under jurisdiction, and

decides whether the -- the complaint is properly pleaded,


the true nature of the complaint states a claim under


Federal law.  And --


QUESTION:  So if it doesn't, then it stays in


State court.


MR. ROBERTS:  If it doesn't, then it can remand


the State -- the case back to State court, but it would


have decided, in essence, that the claim should be


dismissed at the same time by deciding --


QUESTION:  What happens -- what happens if the


cause of action is for misrepresentation under State law,


and the misrepresentation is that the interest rate was


lawful and the plaintiff alleges it was unlawful because


it was usurious?


MR. ROBERTS: 


Well, to the extent that the State 

claim requires the decision that a -- a determination that


there were excessive interest charges by a national bank,


then the claim would fall within the scope of the cause of


action.  But that wouldn't mean that there couldn't be


claims for misrepresentation that --


QUESTION:  Well, in -- in my -- would this


removable?  This is the only thing in the complaint.


MR. ROBERTS:  The complaint --


QUESTION:  It seems to me this might be like


Gully in that it -- the -- the nature of the cause of

action was really a State cause of action even though it


involves an inquiry into what the Federal law --


MR. ROBERTS:  The State cause of action is just


misrepresentation.


QUESTION:  That's it.


MR. ROBERTS:  Then that would not be removable.


QUESTION:  It's unlawful, and the only


misrepresentation is it's unlawful and it's unlawful


allegedly because it's usurious.


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  I don't think that would be


removable, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  There were related claims here that


were strictly State claims.


MR. ROBERTS:  That -- that --


QUESTION:  But they fell into --


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, but the existence of pendent


State claims doesn't defeat removal jurisdiction just as


it doesn't defeat original jurisdiction.  There were


pendent State claims in the Metropolitan Life case, yet --


QUESTION:  And they'd come up under 1367.  They


would travel with the 13 --


MR. ROBERTS:  Exactly, Your Honor.  The


supplemental jurisdiction statute, 1367, expressly


provides for Federal court jurisdiction in those


instances.  They would come with -- with the claim to

Federal court.


QUESTION:  But if you had this same complaint


and it didn't have the usury claim and it just had those


State law claims, then there's nothing removable.


MR. ROBERTS:  That's -- that's right, Your


Honor.  The -- the misrepresentation claim and the


suppression claim are both species of fraud claim under


State law.  They don't come within the -- the scope of the


cause of action in the National Bank Act, and they're not,


on their own terms, arise under Federal law and they would


not be removable.


QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, can I go back to your


answer to Justice Scalia's question?  I wonder if you


really meant the answer you gave.


Assume a case in which the plaintiff alleges 

that 3 percent is usurious as a matter of Alabama law, and


under Federal law it must be at least 5 percent, say.  As


I understand it, that would be removable because he's


making a usury claim and would be dismissable, that is,


under your -- your theory of the case.  But I thought you


said that would have to be dismissed in State court.


MR. ROBERTS:  What -- what -- I tried to


distinguish between failure to state a claim, which I


agree the simple failure to state a claim is -- is not a


ground for lack of Federal jurisdiction, Your Honor.

 QUESTION:  If you fail -- you failed to state a

MR. ROBERTS:  There is no Alabama claim because


the only claim can arise under Federal law.  So it -- so


it is removable and then the Federal court would assert


Federal jurisdiction, which it has over the claim and


dismiss it.


QUESTION:  And the Federal court would dismiss,


yes.


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.  But -- but


that was the initial question that I -- that I understood


Justice Scalia to be asking.


But then he said, if it's not colorable on the


face of the complaint, what happens then?  But I don't


think it makes a practical difference.


QUESTION:  Well, that's my -- my hypothetical. 


It's 3 percent and the Federal law clearly says anything


under 5 percent is not usurious.  What happens with that


case?

QUESTION:  -- percentage rate that's usurious


under Federal law?


MR. ROBERTS:  You don't know what the rate is,


Your Honor, under Federal law without -- without more


facts about the complaint because the National Bank Act


provides the -- the possibility the national bank can


charge any of three rates.  But the --


QUESTION:  And one was a State rate.


MR. ROBERTS:  -- the fundamental -- the


fundamental point is that -- that it's removable if


there's jurisdiction in the original jurisdiction of the


Federal court.


QUESTION: 


Well, I still don't understand your 

answer.  My -- my hypothesis is the Federal law says no


cause of action unless it's over 5 percent.  He pleads


3 percent and he -- and he says this violates State law. 


He says that and the defendant comes in and says, well,


there's no State law cause of action.  It's a Federal


claim.  I want to remove it.  Does the judge remove it or


not?


MR. ROBERTS:  If -- if there is -- if the claim


properly pleaded states a claim over which there's Federal


jurisdiction, if it was pled as a claim under the National

don't understand your answer.


QUESTION:  I don't think there's authority to


remove it, if --


QUESTION:  The answer is yes, isn't it?  You can


remove it.


MR. ROBERTS:  You can --


QUESTION:  He might be able to remove it because


he doesn't have confidence in what the State judge will


do.


MR. ROBERTS:  No -- no, Your Honor.  You can


remove it if there's -- if there's original -- would be


original jurisdiction over the complaint.  And that


doesn't matter whether it's characterized as a -- as a


complaint under State law, which doesn't -- doesn't exist


because it's been entirely displaced, or if it's properly

as easily ask if they state the claim --

there's no colorable claim --


QUESTION:  Well, I've told you what the claim


is.  Is that colorable or not?


MR. ROBERTS:  Well --


QUESTION:  He says 3 percent.  Federal law is


5 percent, and Alabama says I'll -- I'll do it on


3 percent.  Can he remove it or not?  He -- I would think


he could remove it and get it dismissed, but I'm not sure


you agree with that.


QUESTION:  The question -- can I ask you a


standard on this?  I mean, I thought the standard is to


ask this question.  Is this -- i.e., the State claim --


the kind of claim in respect to which Congress intended


the Federal action to be the exclusive substitute 

therefor?  If the answer to that question is yes, you can


remove it even if it doesn't state a Federal cause of


action.  Now, have I got it right what your argument is or


not?


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Then the answer to Justice Stevens,


if I have the right standard, would be yes, because


Congress did intend the Federal cause of action to be an


exclusive substitute for those State actions which allege


that 3 percent is usurious.

defendant the right to remove to a Federal forum any claim


that arises under the laws of the United States --

reporting or that part of ERISA which has been held to be


complete preemption, I take it your answer would be that


if a -- a claim was pleaded that omitted one element of


the Federal cause of action in the State court, and you


didn't start with the assumption that there was complete


preemption for extraneous reasons, it wouldn't be


removable.


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  If there -- if I understand


the hypothetical, it's not a situation where it arises


under the exclusive cause of action for usury under the


National Bank Act.


QUESTION:  Right.  We don't start with the


assumption of complete preemption.  What he states is, in


fact, a Federal claim but for one element.  Is that


removable?


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.


QUESTION:  He leaves out an element.


MR. ROBERTS:  The Federal -- the Federal claim


would be removable to -- to Federal court, yes.


QUESTION:  But it's not a Federal claim.  He's


left out one element.  Would that be removable?


QUESTION:  Answer yes or no, and then sit down.


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor, it's


removal.


Thank you.

Mr. Clark, we'll hear from --


ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN M. CLARK


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. CLARK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


Federal jurisdiction is necessarily limited


jurisdiction.  Federal removal jurisdiction is limited by


statute to those cases that arise under the Constitution


or laws of the United States.  Plaintiffs have brought no


cause of action on the face of the complaint that arises


under the -- the Constitution or laws of the United


States.  As such, there's no Federal jurisdiction under


long-held jurisdiction --


QUESTION: 


Oh, but it's a claim of usurious 

interest charged by a national bank.


MR. CLARK:  It is a --


QUESTION:  So under the theory of the


Government, that is a Federal claim.


MR. CLARK:  Under the theory of the Government,


it -- the claim, as pled, is under Alabama Code section


8-8-1.  And any interposition of Federal law at all is


necessarily interposed by the defendant in this case.  And


under this Court's decisions in Gully, which was a


National Bank Act case, Caterpillar, MetLife, Franchise

QUESTION:  This is not a Federal defense, Mr. --


Mr. Clark.  This is like -- suppose you have a case in


State court and the plaintiff says, we're both from the


State of Alabama.  Defendant removes it, says, I was


from -- I am, was from Georgia.  Now, doesn't the


defendant have a right to remove that case even though


plaintiff pled it as though it were a case that could be


only in State court?  Said we're both from --


MR. CLARK:  Are you talking about where the --


where the -- a -- a complaint is pled by -- by an -- by a


Georgia plaintiff against an Alabama corporation, it will


be removed because --


QUESTION: 


Plaintiff is from Alabama. 

MR. CLARK:  -- because there's diversity?


QUESTION:  Plaintiff says defendant is from


Alabama.


MR. CLARK:  Right.


QUESTION:  Defendant removes because defendant


is, in fact, from Georgia.


MR. CLARK:  Right.  Well, in that case you have


a -- you have a -- you have factual inaccuracy in the


pleading.  In this case, we're not talking about their


basis for removal is not some factual inaccuracy of the

pleading, it's that they're saying that your legal theory,


plaintiff, which you, under the well-pleaded complaint


rule are allowed to choose your own legal theories, you've


decided to travel on the Alabama statute --


QUESTION:  You're not allowed to choose a theory


that doesn't exist.


MR. CLARK:  Well --


QUESTION:  The notion is that there simply is no


claim under State law for usury against a national bank. 


It doesn't exist.  No such claim.  If the plaintiff chose


to stand on such a claim, it would have to be dismissed


because the only exclusive claim for relief -- although it


can be brought in State or Federal court, the exclusive


claim is one under Federal law.  That's the argument here.


MR. CLARK: 


The argument that they are making is 

that there's no claim is -- is misstating.  There is a


claim.


What -- what Your Honor is discussing is the


principle of ordinary preemption.  Whether or not that


Alabama State law claim may proceed is a question of


ordinary preemption as to be -- to be distinguished from


complete preemption.  And the Court held in -- in


Caterpillar that -- that a case may not be removed on a


Federal defense, including the defense of preemption, even


if the defense is anticipated by both parties.

 QUESTION:  Of course.  And there's one case -- I


was surprised you didn't cite it in your brief.  It's


very -- makes that point very nicely.  The Rivet case


against Regions Bank, which was featured on the other


side -- you didn't mention it at all in your brief.


MR. CLARK:  That's an ordinary -- ordinary


preemption case -- case also.


QUESTION:  That -- that distinguishes between a


claim for relief and a defense.  And that case involved a


defense.


MR. CLARK:  Right, and --


QUESTION:  The defense of preclusion.


MR. CLARK:  Right, and that's exactly what they


have in this case, a mere defense in this case.  And --


QUESTION:  Because?


QUESTION:  Do you -- do you disagree that


section 86 of the National Bank Act provides the sole


source of the cause of action?


MR. CLARK:  It does not provide the sole source


of the cause of action that the plaintiffs have pled in


this case, and that's the difference here is -- is the


source of sort of organic law as to where the -- where the


complaint comes from.


Assume there were -- the defendants never


brought up this -- this claim or this defense of Federal

preemption.  The Alabama case would -- the Alabama usury


claim would go forward under Alabama law and would be


decided under Alabama law.  So it's important to -- to see


the distinction between -- between what's being -- what's


being pled and a defense to what's being pled.


Now, as -- as was stated --


QUESTION:  Wait.  Don't leave that point because


you're -- you win if you're right on that.  I mean, you


win if your particular claim is not preempted by this


Federal statute, you win -- and they admit it -- if this


particular Federal statute is not intended by Congress to


be the exclusive vehicle for bringing the kind of claim


that you have brought.  So now, explain to me.  You just


said it isn't.  Why isn't it?


MR. CLARK: 


Why isn't -- Your Honor, why 

isn't -- why isn't the -- the cause of action we've


brought --


QUESTION:  Why, in your opinion, is the State


cause of action that you brought -- you say it is not true


that Congress intended the Federal cause of action as the


exclusive vehicle, excluding your kind of claim.


MR. CLARK:  Well --


QUESTION:  They say it did.  You say it didn't.


Now, all I want to hear is your arguments for


saying it didn't because they pointed to a lot of Federal

cases going back to 1886 which say usury claims are to be


brought under the Federal statute.  The State power in


respect to a national bank has no power.  Okay?  Now, your


reply to that is what?


MR. CLARK:  As this Court stated in the


Caterpillar case under note 4, the question of the breadth


of the --


QUESTION:  I don't see what Caterpillar could


possibly have to do with it since it isn't a bank case.


MR. CLARK:  Well, but the question of the


breadth --


QUESTION:  Is it?


MR. CLARK:  -- of the remedy provided --


QUESTION:  I'm not asking you that.  I asked you


to tell me about banking law.


MR. CLARK:  Right.


QUESTION:  I want to know is it the case in your


view -- you concede it.  You seem to contest it.  I'll


repeat it for the third time.


Is it the case that this Federal cause of action


is intended by Congress as the exclusive vehicle excluding


your State cause of action under the Supremacy Clause of


the Constitution?


MR. CLARK:  Under Supremacy Clause --


QUESTION:  Is the answer to my question yes or

no?

cases hold.  However --


QUESTION:  Okay.  Well, then --


MR. CLARK:  -- however --


QUESTION:  -- then you can't make the argument


you just made.


MR. CLARK:  However, the question of whether or


not a claim is preempted ordinarily is a -- a wholly


different question from whether or not there's


jurisdiction in the Federal courts.


QUESTION:  All right.  You -- you really want --


you conceded you have no State claim.  It's preempted by


the Federal statutes.  Is that right?  Is that what you're


conceding?


MR. CLARK:  We -- it appears that there is no --


there is no State claim on the usury.


QUESTION:  All right.  There is no State claim. 


So then the question in this case is even though you


concede, as I take it you have -- I don't know if you


really mean to.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  But -- but I take it you just did


concede that the Federal cause of action is the only


possible cause of action that your client could have.

and what this goes back to is the well-pleaded complaint


rule.  Plaintiffs in -- in cases are allowed to choose


their remedies.  And in this case the plaintiffs chose a


remedy under the Alabama usury statute, be --


QUESTION:  The problem with it is your complaint


isn't well-pleaded if the only source of law is Federal,


which you conceded on your brief and again here.  There is


no well-pleaded Alabama claim because the Alabama claim or


the State law claim doesn't exist.  The only claim that


exists against a national bank for usury is a Federal


claim.


MR. CLARK:  Well, and again, that is a


defense -- the claim -- as the Court said in MetLife, the 

touchstone is not whether or not preemption is obvious,


but the question is whether or not that creates removal


jurisdiction.


QUESTION:  No, but the -- the --


MR. CLARK:  And that has to appear from the face


of the complaint.


QUESTION:  But I --


QUESTION:  But the face of a well-pleaded


complaint.  And there's a difference between preemption as


a defense to a claim that is well pleaded and here where

you have badly pleaded a complaint that can arise only


under Federal law that simply can't arise under State law.


MR. CLARK:  The problem with that test is it's


not a -- it's not a test.  It adds another layer of -- of


litigation to -- to almost any claim.  And what you're


going to have is, instead of following a well-pleaded


complaint rule that for years has served this Court,


you're going to have all manner of State law causes of


action all of the sudden removed and then you're going to


have this litigation over -- over, well, does it state a


cognizable cause of action under -- under State law or is


it part of --


QUESTION:  We have one simple question.  Has


Congress provided for exclusive Federal law to govern this


claim?  That's not a complicated question.


MR. CLARK:  Congress has not provided for


exclusive Federal cause of action to govern an Alabama


usury claim.


QUESTION:  So then you are not conceding --


QUESTION:  Then you just withdrew your


concession.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  -- complete preemption as opposed to


ordinary preemption.


MR. CLARK:  As a matter of ordinary preemption,

QUESTION:  You're conceding ordinary preemption,


but not complete preemption.


MR. CLARK:  Exactly.  And if I -- if I


misunderstood the question, then I misunderstood the


question.


QUESTION:  I'm sorry.  It probably was --


MR. CLARK:  As a matter of ordinary preemption,


it may very well be that -- that --


QUESTION:  Congress --


MR. CLARK:  -- the State Law claim and


Congress -- and Congress intended that.


QUESTION:  Let him finish answering the question


that somebody else asked.


QUESTION:  Oh, I'm sorry.


MR. CLARK:  But as a matter of complete


preemption, under -- under what I was saying in the


MetLife and the Caterpillar case, those do not


jurisdiction make.  In the Gully -- Gully case itself, it


said a suit brought upon a State statute dues not arise


under an act of Congress because prohibited thereby.


That is exactly the situation that we have here. 


We have a State law cause of action.  We have the


defendant interposing a defense saying, your State law


cause of action is prohibited by that -- by that -- by the

Federal act, and now we want to create removal


jurisdiction because of that.


It's interesting.  This Court has always


found --


QUESTION:  Mr. Clark, I'm -- can we go back


to -- you just cited Gully and maybe I have it wrong, but


I thought that that was a suit to collect a State tax


under State law.


MR. CLARK:  Yes.


QUESTION:  That the source of law that was


applied to the private actor was State law, the State tax.


MR. CLARK:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And here, the source of law that


would be applied is Federal law, not State law.


MR. CLARK: 


The -- the source of law pled in the 

complaint is Alabama State law.  Now, the fact that it may


be ordinary -- ordinarily preempted is something that --


that the defendants can raise and the State courts can


decide.  And the State courts have often -- often decided


matters of Federal preemption.


QUESTION:  I just --


QUESTION:  May I ask -- may I ask this one


question?  It seems to me there's a slight difference in


the text of section 85 and 86.  And section 85 reads as a


defense, and if that's all there were here, I would

understand your argument completely.


But I think one can read section 86 as creating


an affirmative Federal cause of action, and one can argue


that that's the only cause of action that can be


prosecuted.  Now, if that's true, would there not be --


would it not -- not -- would you not have to say then that


the affirmative remedy in -- under the Federal statute is


exclusive?


MR. CLARK:  Well, in -- in -- there are many


Federal statutes that would run concurrently with State


regulation of -- of business.  And if -- if the question


is, is the fact that there's a Federal remedy provided, in


addition to the State remedy -- does that provide --


provide removal jurisdiction, the answer would be -- would


be no to that question.


QUESTION:  It's not only that there's a Federal


remedy provided, but it's been construed to be the


exclusive remedy.


MR. CLARK:  Right.


QUESTION:  That those are the only remedies that


one can get.


MR. CLARK:  But again, I would --


QUESTION:  Doesn't that distinguish it from some


of these other hypothetical cases?

Court's concept of federalism wherein the -- the State


courts are allowed to make that call.  And in Avco, which


established the -- this platypus of -- of field preemption


or complete preemption is very limited to -- to those


actions construing the collective -- collective bargaining


agreements.  And then it was reluctantly extended by this


Court in the Metropolitan Life and Taylor cases, and --


QUESTION:  Well, the argument of the Government


is that this is another one of those rare cases.  That's


their whole point.


MR. CLARK:  But if this --


QUESTION:  And if it is, then you're just wrong


about it being only a defensive maneuver.


MR. CLARK:  This -- if this is another case, it


is a wholly separate and -- and distinguished -- distinct 

way to go because the National Bank Act carries with it


none of the indicia of the intent of Congress to


completely preempt that the LMRA does.


QUESTION:  But it's been interpreted by a number


of cases to have precisely that effect.


MR. CLARK:  To have ordinary preemptive effect,


which --


QUESTION:  No.  No.  That was not the


interpretation.  You want us to overrule earlier cases


about --

 MR. CLARK:  Absolutely not.


QUESTION:  -- the meaning of the National Bank


Act?


MR. CLARK:  No.


But in the -- in the LMRA context, you have


specific jurisdictional grant to the district courts of


the United States.  Then when ERISA came along, with


Taylor you have -- you have specific legislative history


saying that this is to be interpreted under the Avco rule,


which is to -- which is to -- to have a body of Federal


law deciding all cases, no matter where brought, under --


under ERISA or deciding all cases under collective


bargaining.


In this case, there's no -- in National Bank


Act, there's no -- there is no body of Federal law that 

could ever arise, and it's because the nature of the


National Bank Act is really more of a hierarchy of State


laws.  It says, National Bank Act, you can -- you can


charge either the interest rate in the State in which the


claim is brought, you can charge the interest rate in the


State in which the bank is located, or you can charge --


and there's a default Federal interest rate.  So what


you're going to have here is sort of a patchwork of State


law decisions concerning the State -- State law of


Delaware versus Alabama versus Kentucky versus Michigan.

 QUESTION:  I'm still trying to get back to my --


I'm beginning to see what I think your answer is, but


please don't agree with me if you really disagree.


All right.  First, if I were to ask the


question, is there Federal law in the area?  Yes.  Ask the


question, does Federal law preempt State law?  Yes.


MR. CLARK:  Ordinarily.


QUESTION:  Yes, here.  Yes, well, you'll say


right here, but wait.


So you -- if I ask this question, is this


State -- Federal cause of action -- did Congress intend it


to preempt a State cause of action substituting the


Federal cause of action therefor?  I think now you're


prepared to say the answer to this question is yes.


MR. CLARK:  Ordinarily preempt. 


QUESTION:  But you will answer the following


question no.  Is there an intent here by Congress that


this Federal cause of action that preempts the State cause


of action by substituting an exclusive Federal remedy --


is there an intent of Congress to allow removal when it's


pleaded?  The answer is we have no evidence of that.


MR. CLARK:  The answer to that question is no.


QUESTION:  And what they're saying on their


side -- and now this is exactly the issue between them and


the lower courts.  And indeed, there's language that's

unclear in the lower cases -- is that we need evidence of


that latter point.  That's what you're saying.  And


they're saying no.


MR. CLARK:  Well --


QUESTION:  They're saying, look, all you have to


have are the first three things I mentioned.  Stop after


you decide that Congress has created a Federal action with


the intent that it provide an exclusive substitute for


this State action.  Stop there.  Don't ask for any further


evidence of anything.  One, because you'll never get it.


Congress never thinks of this sort of esoteric issue.  And


second, because there's just no reason.


Now, okay.  Now I get the -- the clash, and now


I can get the answer.


MR. CLARK: 


I'm sorry if I -- I misunderstood 

your question before.


QUESTION:  No, no.  It's my fault.  I didn't get


it.


MR. CLARK:  And in fact, in the -- in Justice


Brennan's concurring opinion in the MetLife/Taylor case,


he said, you know, that -- that congressional intent is


the touchstone here, and that this Court would be well


served not to infer removal jurisdiction unless there is


some clear evidence of congressional intent to do so like


in an ERISA case or like in the LMRA case.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Clark, I should perhaps have


asked this question of the other side, but they're not


going to have a lot of time left when they get back up.


I assume that it -- it is a given that merely


setting forth all of the elements of a Federal cause of


action in a complaint is not enough to provoke removal. 


That is to say, if there is both a Federal cause of action


and a State cause of action which has the same elements,


if you plead those elements, which would constitute a


Federal cause of action, but you protest that you are not


asserting a Federal cause of action, you are only


asserting a State cause of action, that would not be


removable.  Would it?


MR. CLARK:  No, it would not be.  And that --


QUESTION:  Okay. 


So we're -- we're talking 

about a -- a distinctive rule here that where you set


forth the elements of a -- of a cause of action that you


do not assert to be a Federal cause of action, we are


going to allow it to be removed nonetheless.  Right?


MR. CLARK:  If -- if what the defendants are


arguing, it would be a new rule.  And it -- it is a


departure from --


QUESTION:  But may I understand this further


point?  What Justice Scalia's described seems to me quite


common.  You have State human rights laws.  You have


44

Federal human rights laws.  The same facts that I was


discriminated against.  If I make my choice that I want to


bring it under, say, New York law rather than Title VII,


that's my prerogative.  And the defendant certainly can't


remove that case by saying, well, you could have pleaded


those same facts as a Title VII case.  Quite different. 


That's where there's concurrent lawmaking authority, both


State and Federal.


Here the argument is there is no State lawmaking


authority.  There is no parallel source of law, State and


Federal, and that's what makes it different from the


ordinary case where you plead the facts and they would


state a claim under either State law or Federal law.  The


pleader has her choice.


MR. CLARK: 


There -- there is concurrent 

lawmaking authority.  However, because of the Supremacy


Clause, the courts have held that -- that there is


ordinary preemption in this case.  But that does not


answer the question whether or not should -- there should


be removal jurisdiction in the case.


And it's -- in other words, the Alabama


legislature certainly has the right to make -- make law


regulating Federal banks.  In fact, this Court decided way


back in 1870 that national banks are subject to State law


regulation.  And in fact, the quote from the case

something like in their daily activities, they're


regulated much more under --


QUESTION:  But not usury.  I mean, you -- it's a


question of how you characterize this, but I think you


agree that on the question of usury, the Federal


legislation is conclusive and it was done, indeed, for the


very purpose of having national banks escape from whatever


jealous, mean legislation the State might pass.


So the only law -- I mean, the choice would be


if you want to say, yes, I want to stick with Alabama law,


no Federal 85, 86 for me, that case must get dismissed. 


You can't get past the door because there is no such


claim.


MR. CLARK:  If -- if the preemption, ordinary


preemption, is -- is applied, it -- it would -- applied as 

it has been, it would be dismissed.


However, that is a wholly separate question from


whether the case arises under Federal jurisdiction.  It is


a question of ordinary preemption that the State courts --


QUESTION:  Why would a plaintiff want to bring


us a suit that inevitably must be dismissed?


MR. CLARK:  Well, and -- plaintiffs have


different reasons for pleading the things they do.  Under


the well-pleaded complaint rule, of course, it's their


prerogative to rise and fall on the causes of action that

they choose to plead.


However, I go back to the MetLife case which the


Court said it's not the obviousness of preemption defense


but the intent of Congress.  And I think in answer to the


question over there, is why -- why go that extra step?


Well, because this Court has decided in MetLife that that


extra step is necessary to stop this slippery slope down


where every case that is removed out of a State court, you


now have this other layer of -- of litigation over, well,


is there another cause of action and -- and perhaps that


we have to find some -- we have to litigate over whether


it's an exclusive cause of action.


And the answer to that is this Court has


provided, for right or for wrong, since 1887 that we


follow the well-pleaded complaint rule and it follows the 

language in the -- at the end of the Gully opinion saying


that what you need is a clear bright line limitation.  And


only where we find some clear congressional intent, such


as in the LMRA situation, such as in the ERISA situation,


do we make this extreme and extraordinary grant of field


preemption or complete preemption or whole preemption.


If there are no further questions, I will sit


down.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Scalia, the answer to your


question is yes, if there are --


QUESTION:  What was my question?


(Laughter.)


MR. WAXMAN:  Your question was if -- if you --


you said this would take time, and it will.  You pleaded


all the elements of a Federal cause of action, but it


also -- it also satisfies a State cause of action.  If the


Federal cause of action is not exclusive except in that


rare instance, it is not removable.


Justice Breyer, yes, indeed we say that you stop


at point 3.  That is, you determine whether or not this is


the rare instance in which there's not only substantive 

preemption but exclusive Federal remedies.  And the reason


you stop is because we have Federal question jurisdiction. 


It says that removal is tied to original jurisdiction,


and therefore, the question is, does the complaint


well-pleaded necessarily state a cause of action?  Justice


Holmes indicated in a statement that is oft repeated and,


if it's anything, is under-inclusive, as this Court


indicated I think in Merrell Dow, that a suit arises under


the law that creates the cause of action.  If the cause of


action is exclusively Federal, in that rare instance, it's

under arising-under jurisdiction.


Justice Kennedy I think asked what for me is the


most difficult question in this Court's sometimes not


fully explicated arising-under jurisdiction, which is the


question that was addressed in Merrell Dow and in


particular in footnote 1 in this Court's opinion in


Merrell Dow, which is if you have a State cause of action


misrepresentation, but it has embedded with it as a


necessary matter a conclusion about whether Federal law


was or was not satisfied, does that State claim arise


under Federal jurisdiction?


In Franchise Tax Board, this Court repeated


dicta that suggests that the answer is yes.  And in Smith


versus Kansas City Title and Trust, this -- this Court


seemed to indicate yes. 


But in Moore versus Chesapeake --

the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, the Court suggested that


the embedded Federal question has to be central to the


State cause of action and really important.


And the result, as I -- as I think things stand


now, is we have a very long footnote 1 in this Court's


opinion in Merrell Dow that says many people have


difficulty resolving our jurisprudence in this area, but


in the Merrell Dow context, where there was a State tort


claim that could -- may I finish my --
