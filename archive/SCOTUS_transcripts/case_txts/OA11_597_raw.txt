 The issue is whether temporary flooding can 
12  ever constitute a taking under the Fifth Amendment.  The 
13  Federal Circuit said, no, never, ruling that the 
14  permanent consequences of the Government's actions were 
15
16  permanent. 
17
18  the rule.  There are at least two reasons why. 
19
20
21  substantially intrudes upon a landowner's protected 
22  property interest, regardless of the particular mode or 
23  duration of that invasion.

 And, second, the Federal Circuit's decision 
conflicts with fundamental guarantees that the Takings

the Court said that for there to be Government 

1  Clause is intended to preserve, and, therefore, is 
2  manifestly unjust. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about this Court's 
3
4  precedent in, what is it, the Sanguinetti case, where 
5
6  responsibility it is at least necessary that the 
7  overflow constitute a permanent invasion of the land 
8  amounting to an appropriation, not merely an injury, to 
9  property?
10
11  statement, would we not, if you -- if your -- your 
12  argument prevails? 
13
14  say that you would not have to overrule Sanguinetti 
15
16  invasion," was -- was not how the case turned on the 
17  result.  The court there did make an inaccurate summary 
18  of the early flood-taking cases -- Pumpelly, Lynah, and 
19  Kress.  None of those cases said that flooding had to be 
20
21  permanent condition of flooding, but that was not made a 
22  requirement.  And none of those cases said that you 
23  could not have temporary flood invasions. 
24
25

 But, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was Sanguinetti -- had we 

permanent.  The facts in those cases did have a

was it -- was it simply saying there can't be a 

 MR. GOODHART:  Justice Scalia, there --

you're correct.  There was no temporary takings prior to 

 MR. GOODHART:  Justice Scalia --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  In other words, was 

1  had any temporary takings cases before Sanguinetti? 
2
3
4  Sanguinetti expressing a special rule for flooding, or 
5
6  temporary taking?  If the latter, that dictum if it's 
7  dictum or a holding if it was a holding has already been 
8  overruled by our later temporary takings cases. 
9
10
11  Sanguinetti.  The Court there didn't have occasion to 
12  address temporary flooding, whether that could 
13  constitute a taking.  And all of the cases after 
14  Sanguinetti that have actually addressed whether a 
direct temporary invasion will -- that substantially 
15
16  intrudes upon property interests have held that, yes, 
17  you can have a temporary --
18
19  counted eleven cases which either say, state, some seem 
20
21  temporary with a flood it's a trespass, and where it's 
22  permanent it's a taking.  Okay? 
23
24  my law clerk.  And then I tried to see, well, what are 
the ones that say the opposite?  And so far we've come 
25

to hold or support the proposition that when it's 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Which ones?  Because I 

 I mean, I have eleven.  And so I've got from

1  up with zero.  All right? 
2
 You could argue that there were three cases 
3  during the war which might be read that way, though they 
4  don't quite mention it.  All right?
 So which of the cases that you -- rather 
5
6  than list my eleven, I'm more interested in what you 
7  think, and so I'd like to know which are the ones you 
8  think support -- with something like a flood, which it's 
9  not -- you're not physically taking hold of the whole 
thing.  You're sending something in that comes back. 
10
11 
Which of the ones support you that temporary is not a 
12 
trespass, temporary is a taking?

from flooding, Mr. Dickinson reclaimed his property, 
15

18  Court there said the taking was a taking when that 
19  occurred, regardless of whether the landowner does

12  you don't take all the land.  You send some stuff in. 
13  And the stuff is there for a while, and then it comes 
14  back, and -- it's called water.  And so I don't know 
what to make of the cases like Kimball Laundry where you 
15

17  are not quite the same.

case. 

 Once the timber inventory was done, it 

1  saying, it's a proof of facts.  The physical takings 
2  analysis is the same.  The legal analysis is the same. 
3  But one flood could effectively destroy timber if it is 
4  a lake; if it sits there.  We didn't have that in our 
5
6
 We had intrusion during 1993 to 2000, 8 
7  years, 6 of which were substantially throughout the 
8  summer where this management area sat in water during 
9  June, July, into August, basically, stagnated water that 
choked the oxygen from the roots of these trees.  And in 
10
11 
1999 it was termed a brownout.  It was massive. 
12
13  revealed that there was over 100,000 trees in a 
14  6,990-acre area that were either destroyed or were --
15
16  the other 11,000 acres that we subsequently inventoried. 
17
18  cases in this temporary versus permanent, as I read the 
19  cases and I read what the multiple facts that each are 
20
21  attempting, in the term "temporary," to encompass a lot 
22  of different concepts.  Both intentionality, because an 
23  accidental issue is not a taking; causation:  Did this

the Government do actually and directly cause the injury

 So there is never a simple answer on the

other factors I've just mentioned are not in your favor. 
Is that correct? 

1  at issue?  And foreseeability:  Is what you intended 
2  something whose consequences you could have seen? 
 And they are using that in a multifaceted 
3
4  test, one that the Solicitor General is not trying to 
endorse here, but one that I think is more consistent 
5
6  with our general jurisprudence in this area. 
7
8  question of permanent damage, because you can have 
9  permanent damage that's not a taking, if all of the

14  United States.
15
16  that it was direct, natural, and probable -- the results 
17  were -- from the Government's action. 
 One thing in water cases is you don't have 
18
19  dye in the water.  Mr. Causby could look up and see the 
insignia on the airplanes.  And we knew that the cannon 
20
21  fire from the -- from the artillery was coming over the 
22  Portsmouth Harbor's land was from the Government.  The 
23  water, you can't always tell.  And so you have to prove 
24  that that was directly from the United States.  And the 
25

 The Court of Federal Claims found that --

commission in this case did. 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 The Government's rule -- I call it the 

1
2  this case, and it's part of what's interwoven in your 
3  adversary's arguments, is that with flooding it's going 
4  to occur naturally anyway.  The Government generally 
builds dams to control that flooding to the benefit of 
5
6  all of the interests along its affected route.  And at 
7  some point, either the Government is going to -- is 
8  going to make a decision that's going to help someone 
9  and potentially hurt someone.  And the question is, 
isn't all of those situations going to be subject to 
10
11 
litigation. 
12
13  Government's rule, but it's -- is basically simple.  It 
14  can't.  Because, if the deviation is temporary -- and 
15
16  exercise.  It's either a nuisance or temporary trespass, 
17  and we're not going to hold the Government responsible 
18  for that loss.  Assuming it's going to occur in part 
19  because flooding is always going to occur, the question 
is perhaps when.  But in any place you have a dam, it's 
20
21  there because flooding was happening. 
22
23  know that you've actually announced the rule that 
24  addresses the essence of the policy considerations that 
25

are driving the Government decision.  So tell me how 

that's what the circuit below said -- it's just

factors, you could have lots of flood that aren't a

of water, and then it recedes.  And it's -- you know --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You've indicated, I think, 

1  to the level of a taking. 
2
3  you is, how do you define the baseline of protected 
4  expectations for the property?
5
6
7  in your brief that one year won't do it.  This was six 
8  or seven years. 
 If that's a baseline of expectations, the 
9
Government cannot change that, even if it thinks that 
10
11  there is a higher and -- and more urgent priority in 
12  protecting some other land? 
13
14  the Government is not the insurer of -- of flood 
15
16
17  Government's brief, United States v. Sponenbarger, which 
18  says that very thing.  The United States is not the 
19  insurer of it.  But when it takes water and it controls 
20
21  storms, not from natural, but does it in a manner that 
22  they control how it's released and the duration, 
23  frequency, and they use property to store that water for 
24  eight -- you know, over eight years, that in this case 
was -- was compelling.  And the court found that those 
25

water and releases it in a manner that's not from 

control, how they just carry it out. 

 There is the case that's cited in the

 MR. GOODHART:  Your Honor, it can go through 

its law, the National Environmental Policy Act, the

4  expectation, if the Corps of Engineers -- did not happen 
in this case, but in the hypothetical case -- makes the

7  priority for other lands, and it changes its policy?  It

12  pay for what it's going to take from private landowners.

14  is that it can't make that change without paying, right?
 MR. GOODHART:  It -- it cannot make that

to put this water someplace, we're going to put it on

as of that time --

5
6  control natural erosion from a cutoff that had been 
7  created, the landowner could not show --
8
9  definition of the operable baseline that we can use in 
order to define whether or not there has been a taking. 
10
11
12  must say it may not be a bright line.  It is -- the 
13  analysis here that this Court has used throughout its 
14  physical takings cases will separate the torts from the

22  this case, for example, the court had evidence that this

2  late -- late winter and early spring, you have your 
3  releases, they dissipate, the water recedes, but you 
4  don't have extensive summertime flooding from a river.
5
6  certainly not in the southern part of the United States, 
7  these rivers do not overflow during June, July, August. 
8  This never happens.

 MR. GOODHART:  Yes, Your Honor.

14  intermittent, but permanently intermittent.
 MR. GOODHART:  Yes, Your Honor. 
15
16
 JUSTICE BREYER:  The flood comes like three 
17  months a year every year.  And the erosion, they say 
18  that part that's eroded belongs to the Government now. 
19  And if he comes back with his dirt and puts it in,

I would --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You know, but I want to 

 So what do you suggest would be a better, 
clearer rule for compensating for flooding where our 

1  okay, it's not perfect, but let's go with it.  There are 
2  people all over the country who have probably relied on 
3  this stuff.  And that would be so absent a better rule. 
4
5
6  problem is what's a trespass and what's a taking? 
7
8  cannot be the Federal circuit's rule that you can never 
9  have temporary flooding as a taking.  And I guess

12  know what your idea -- I understand the difficulties are 
13  there --
14
15
16  accept a lot you mentioned. 
17
18
19  asking -- which I just did ask -- is what's your idea of 
20
21
22  would be to remain consistent with how this Court 
23  analyzes the physical takings, not use anything from 
24  regulatory analysis here, but looking at these elements.
25

 MR. GOODHART:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and I'm willing to 

a substitute that would be better? 

 MR. GOODHART:  Your Honor, the substitute

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Because? 
 MR. GOODHART:  And because the Court said in 

1  need -- when they know that it's predictable, that it is 
2  foreseeable, as the court below found, that -- that 
3  their actions will place water for storage on land that 
4  they know they can purchase flood easements for --
5
6  Interior employee trespasses on Jones's land, trampling 
7  paths, and even limbs fall off trees.  That's a taking 
8  and not a trespass? 
9
10
11
12  the Cress case, it's the character of the Government's 
13  action, not the amount of damages resulting from it, so 
14  long as that is substantial.
 And in the cases, the Court has looked at 
15
16  what is substantial intrusion.  In Loretto, the Court 
17  said a permanent physical occupation on a rooftop in Ms. 
18  Loretto's building, small area, that is substantial, 
19  even though geographically it was very small, because it 
20
21  someone's property. 
22
23  very high. 
24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So our department employee 
trying to find a shortcut drives his bulldozer through

 And so -- substantial may not have to be

 MR. GOODHART:  Your Honor, I think we would, 

one-time situation, as your hypothetical.  And, again, 

1  Jones's land knocking down his favorite redwood, it's a 
2  taking? 
3
4  again, use the analysis, separate out the torts, where 
the action is direct, it's been predictable what would 
5
6  that would result in, the United States should know 
7  that, and then the intrusion or interference with those 
8  property rights is substantial, there will be a taking. 
9
 Usually that's not going to be the case in a 
10
11  here the court heard six consecutive years of this 
12  invasion of water.  The commission couldn't turn it 
13  away. 
14
15
16  from other cases, don't they? 
17
 The park ranger walking through can hardly 
18  be called a physical occupation.  He's harmed the land, 
19  but it's not a physical occupation.
20
21  that -- is that flooding the land is a physical 
22  occupation for the period that it's flooded. 
 MR. GOODHART:  It is, Your Honor.  Where 
23
24  it's an occupation, it's certainly clearer and more 
25

intrusive.  There can be invasions that don't amount to 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So our cases -- our cases 

treat physical occupations differently from other --

 What you're -- what you're arguing here is

 MR. GOODHART:  Certainly, Your Honor. 

 See, if that were the case, then -- then I 

word substantial a requirement that it have caused 

1  an occupation. 
2
3  here's what troubles me.  You say it has to be 
4  substantial.  But you -- can we -- can we fold into that 
5
6  substantial financial loss? 
7
8  could distinguish your case where a lot of valuable 
9  trees got destroyed.
10
11  Substantial --
12
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And I wouldn't say every --
13  you know, every flood that goes across a land, even two 
14  years or three years in a row, would not necessarily be

18  substantial is going to be made as a legal determination 
19  by the Corps, as a matter of degree.

22  Destruction has been -- as in the Kansas City Life case 
23  in 1950, the taking is to the extent of the destruction. 
24  Beyond that, though, it's looking at interference with 
25

4  Insurance case in 1950, Your Honor, was underflow
 
invasion of water percolating up on property in Missouri 
5
6  from the Mississippi River.  And that was found to be a 
7  substantial invasion where the property, the 1700 acres, 
8  was taken by the United States.  And the Court there 
9  said, when you destroy the use of that property for what 
10
11 
12
13  would help to know what you think if we accept your 
14  position would be left over for the Federal Circuit to 
consider on remand.  You -- you haven't asked to -- for 
15
16  outright reversal and have the decision of the Court of 
17  Federal Claims be the end of the matter.  So if we 
18  accept your position, then what issues would be open for 
19  the Federal Circuit to resolve on remand?
20
21  answering your question I would like to reserve the 
22  remainder of my time.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

ask for an automatic affirmance.

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 As has been pointed out, this Court has 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it's -- there is 

a little confusion about the Government's position, 

1  please the Court: 
2
3  consistently held in its flooding cases and reaffirmed 
4  in Loretto that a -- that a taking occurs in the context 
of flooding only if the flooding is the direct result of 
5
6  the structure itself and if it results in a permanent 
7  effect on the property such that it's an actual 
8  appropriation.  So --
9
10
11  there was in the court of appeals. 
12
 Is it -- I'm quoting from your friend's 
13  brief, and he says:  "The Federal Circuit adopted a 
14  categorical rule that temporary Government action can 
never be a taking if the Government does not intend to 
15
16  create a permanent flooding condition."  Is that an 
17  accurate statement of your understanding? 
 MR. KNEEDLER:  The -- I think the intent 
18
19  point, I guess I would modify that.  There are some 
20
21  standard.  In Dickinson, for example, the -- the 
22  modification was intrinsically permanent.  The landowner 
23  had corrected for it.  But it was intrinsically 
24  permanent until the landowner had done something about 
25

things that -- I think it would have to be an objective 

it.  So actually Dickinson is consistent with our --

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 What we have here are incidental 

say the Government is occupying the land when the 
Government builds the project. 

1  with our position. 
2
 But I do want -- there is a critical piece 
3  about this case that Justice Kennedy's questions have 
4  touched upon that I think it's very important for this 
5
6
 This case is not about flooding by the 
7  project itself.  The reservoir behind the dam, the 
8  easements, the flowing easements there, the spillway, 
9  the project is the Government and I think it's fair to 
10
11 
12
13  consequences downstream from the dam as a result of the 
14  flowage.  And there are -- Loretto, when it is summing 
up this Court's flooding cases, makes two points.  One, 
15
16  it says it has to be permanent, not temporary invasion; 
17  but it also distinguishes the category of cases in which 
18  there is conduct outside the landowner's property that 
19  has consequential damages within the property.
20
21  understand what you're saying.  Are you saying that if 
22  this landowner owned land behind the dam that was 
23  temporarily flooded as often as has happened here, that 
24  that would be a taking?
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't -- I don't

 MR. KNEEDLER:  No. I --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I didn't think you were 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  No, but what I'm saying is 

for the Court to depart from that. 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't think it's a question 

1
2  saying that. 
3
4  this would be a particularly bad or problematic context 
5
6
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, there are 
7  pretty clear findings in the Court of Claims on the 
8  question of causation, right? 
9
of causation, and if I could just point out two cases, 
10
11  one of which was cited in Loretto in its summing up of 
12  this Court's flooding cases is Bedford.  Bedford was a 
13  situation in which a revetment, as counsel pointed out, 
14  a revetment was constructed in the -- in the Mississippi 
15
16  Vicksburg.  It was -- it was clearly shown in that case 
17  that over time, over a period of 6 years, as in this 
18  case, downstream by 6 miles it resulted in permanent 
19  flooding of land as a consequence of that.
20
21  consequential injury downstream; it is not occupation by 
22  the Government. 
23
24  Government comes in and tells a landowner downstream 
that every March and April we are going to flood your 
25

River to protect erosion and access to the City of 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, so if the 

 But what the Court said is that is 

27
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't, and -- and let me 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  I don't think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No?  The Government 

1  property so that you can't use it, from now on, that's 
2  the way -- that's part of our plan, that's a taking for 
3  those 2 months, correct? 
4
5
6  says you will not be able to use your land because of 
7  what we are doing for 2 months -- you have been able to 
8  up to now, but from now on, for March and April, you 
9  can't.  That's not a taking?
10
11  explain why.  What we're talking about here is the Corps 
12  of Engineers operating a dam from which it has to take 
13  into account multiple considerations.  In this case, 
14  there was marina operators, there were farmers along the 
15
16
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'll grant you that 
17  it can decide whose land it wants to take.  I just want 
18  to know why that's not a taking. 
19
20
21  burdens.  This is why the Federal Government was invited 
22  in to construct these projects because along -- along 
23  the river there was very serious flooding.  So the 
24  Government puts in a dam to control the flooding, it has 
25

to release the flood waters, and the timing of the 

river, there were drainage districts. 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Because this is a classic 

example of the Government adjusting benefits and 

28
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if the Government 

we're going to do is we're going to have water trucks 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  I think that's a different 

situation because the Government itself is actually 

1  release of the flood waters is something that you have 
2  to take into account --
3
4  says we've got to release the flood waters and what 
5
6  pull up behind the dam, we're going to load them up and 
7  we're going to drive them down river to this person's 
8  property and we're going to dump the water there? 
9
10
11  putting the water -- I think that's very close to being 
12  the reservoir behind the dam.  But -- but typically, 
13  when the Government -- I think uniformly, when the 
14  Government is operating --
15
16 
17
18  be -- it would be specifically deposited on that 
19  landowner's land.
20
21
22  they put a pipe from the dam --
23
24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 
 MR. KNEEDLER:  -- to that person's land. 
But that's not what's happening when the Government's 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I thought --
 MR. KNEEDLER:  It would be the same as if 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But your answer is 

that would be a taking? 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  I think because it would

Court of Claims' findings are to the contrary.
 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --

2  for the basin.  It's not aimed at any particular 
3  landowner. 
4
5
6
7
8  Government knew that this water was going to go right
 
9  here, right?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it was not -- there is 
10
11  no suggestion that it was targeted at this land, which 
12  is -- which is I think something quite different.  This 
13  was -- this was an incidental consequence of what was 
14  happening downstream.  Again, in the Bedford case you 
15
16
17  incidental consequence. 
18
19  foreseeable is enough.  It was -- it could have been --
20
21
 Let me take a more -- a more dramatic 
22  example that I think illustrates this point.  This 
23  Court's decision in Sponenbarger which we cite in our 
24  brief, that a -- that case discusses a prior holding by 
25

this Court in a case called Jackson, which was a 

had permanent --

into the river and it caused it to overflow the -- the 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if the 

don't know -- I don't know the ecological way -- but the 
water has to percolate or whatever down in this area. 
So it goes onto this person's land and it cuts down $5 
million worth of his trees.  The same purpose, to assist 
in flood control.  No doubt that that's a taking, right?

1  situation where a levee, Government built a levee on one 
2  side of the river which had the effect of flooding 
3  property on the opposite side of the river because it --
4  it kept it from going to this side and channelled it 
5
6  land on the other side, and the Court said that is not a 
7  taking. 
8
9  Government decides for purposes of flood control -- I

21  flood your land and we know -- again, looking at the 
22  factual findings -- we know that will result in your 
23  trees dying, but because we're doing it for flood 
24  control, that's just too bad.  Different case when they 
25

 MR. KNEEDLER:  I think that would be --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay. 
 MR. KNEEDLER:  Unless there was some

the Government then comes down and says, we're going to 

go in with a chain saw than when they go in with the

directly cutting down the trees.  I think it's very hard 

1  water? 
2
 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  When they go in with 
3  the chain saw the Government is actually going on the 
4  property and the Government is, to use counsel's term, 
5
6  to explain consequences 110 miles downstream as being 
7  direct.  It's -- and there is no case that -- that 
8  Petitioner has pointed to with that sort of incidental 
9  consequence --
10
11 
12 
13 
14

18  that happens.  Because the Government builds a dam, a 
19  lot of other things happen.  They release water 
20
21  animals come in. 
22
23  people 200 yards down.  Some will be 200 miles down, 
24  200 -- you know.  Some will be helpful, some will be 
hurtful.  Can they never bring a lawsuit?  Can they 
25

JUSTICE BREYER:  What is the legal rubric? 
I mean what you're -- what I haven't thought of until 
you've been putting it this way is that the Government 
builds a dam.  When it does it, water backs up behind 
the dam, and that water might flood somebody's land. 
That's a taking, if it's at least permanent, and so 
forth. 

 Okay.  Now, the Government builds a dam, all 

sometimes.  They make electricity sometimes.  Different 

 All kinds of things can happen to different

and you can't even walk on it without a boat.  All 
right, that would be at least a regulatory taking. 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it would be -- it would 

1  sometimes recover?  How do we look at that?
 
2
3  Court's takings decisions, and specifically those
 
4  dealing with effects caused by something outside the

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, then, suppose what 
7  the Government said is, Mr. Smith, you live 150 miles 
8  from here, and we have a rule, and our rule is you can't 
9  cut down any of your trees, and you can't farm the land,

14

16  regulation, they send some water in to do it.  So should 
17  we analyze it as a regulatory taking? 
 MR. KNEEDLER:  It -- it has certain 
18
19  parallels in that respect in the sense that the 
20
21  dam, and its releases are going to help someone and hurt 
22  someone.  It can't be put in a position where it's going 
23  to have to pay compensation every time it chooses one --
24  one thing or another.

12  people and not others, that there's no taking.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- even that which would be 

1  Suppose there -- because of a spring melt-off or other 
2  factors, it's clear that the reservoir for several 
3  months of the year will be more extensive than it will

8  of some of the land behind the reservoir.

13  only temporarily flooded? 
14
15
16  the Court said that if you have a situation where 
17  property is permanently liable to inevitably recurring 
18  flooding, that that's the same thing as a permanent --
19  even though sometimes it's not -- it's not covered, it

is covered by this Court's decision in Cress, in which

with your articulation of your test. 

1  years, it was -- it was -- it was a series of individual 
2  determinations made by the Corps; but -- but for reasons 
3  that tie into the downstream effects, it was releasing 
4  water from the dam and was making a series of 
administrative decisions about how to operate the dam.

6
 It has a water control manual.  Downstream 
7  landowners are protected, not by retroactive award of 
8  damages under the Just Compensation Clause, but by 
9  public participation requirements --
10

claim?  Or, you're building an exception from when the 
15
16  claim can be applied to a downstream owner? 
17
18  Court's current precedence, there would be no claim 
19  downstream.

7
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, just before 
8  you get off, because I think part of the confusion, at 
9  least for me, is the difference between what the Federal 
10
11
12  any difference, it's not -- whether it's temporary or 
13  permanent, right?  The Federal circuit thought it was 
14  dispositive that this they viewed as temporary and not 
permanent.  So it seems to me that you're fighting, and 
15
16  you're fighting a lot of the court of claims' very 
17  exhaustive findings, to present a different argument.

14  can make these other arguments about it's too far 
15
16
 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, but -- but I think, in 
17  deciding what's temporary, you shouldn't divorce it from 
18  context.  And -- and here, the context is the 
19  consequences downstream.
20
21  depart from the Court's rule up until this point about 
22  permanence -- and there has to be -- something less than 
23  permanent will do, I don't think you should ignore the

17  she said that temporary versus permanent, the target 
18  should not be the Government's action, but the effect of 
19  that action; that is, if trees are killed and they 
weren't revived, the damage is permanent.  That's where 
20
21  we should vote, not whether the Government is going to 
22  do this year after year.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, the question would be 
whether it falls within the Cress test of whether it is

3  reservoir, but it's flooded once every other year.

6  permanently liable. 
7
8  seems to be that if it's downstream, somehow it's not 
9  the Government.  There's a series of administrative 
actions and it's not really the Government's water. 
10
11 
It's like -- it's like the old moral refuge that the

17  Court in Loretto, a modern takings case dealing with the 
18  question of physical occupation.  And the Court said 
19  that -- and it made two points.  Again, it said -- it 
made the temporary versus permanent point, but it also 
20
21  made the point about conduct outside the land that has 
22  an effect inside the land. 
23
24  have a series of temporary decisions --
25

 MR. KNEEDLER:  It -- it was basically -- I 
mean, it was the rationale of this Court's cases in --

 This case has both of those features.  You

property.  I mean, the electricity could, for example, 

1  project, let's say an electricity plant or high tension 
2  wires, you could require the taking of some land to 
3  build it.  Now, you've got that and you begin to run it. 
4  You could run it in such a way that it takes some of the 
5
6  because of some odd thing run around over somebody's 
7  land and kill all the chickens.  That wasn't expected 
8  but it happened, and it happened because of the way the 
9  Government runs the plant.
 Now, I guess there would be a taking in such 
10
11  circumstance if in fact, because of the way it's run, it 
12  makes that land which no one thought would happen, as a 
13  consequence of the project uninhabitable; wouldn't there 
14  be?
15
16  the Government -- if the Government is occupying the 
17  land when it happens, yes.  But there's -- as you've I 
18  think pointed out, there's a critical difference between 
19  a tort and a taking.  And there -- there can be 
20
21  that -- that cause injury. 
22
23  is to make some piece of land 4 miles away quite 
24  unexpectedly, but totally uninhabitable.  Now, what's 
supposed to happen there?  That's not just a trespass

14

16  may be a different matter. 
17
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So -- well, 
18  that's the part -- that's the point.  The reason they 
19  don't compensate there is it apparently had something to 
do with everybody suffering the cinders.  But where the 
20
21  cinders went out of the train and they ended up on just 
22  one person's property because there were some pipes or 
23  something, then it was a taking.

land has always been subject to flooding and, as we

8  flooding of 5, 4 or -- 3 or 4 days.

12
 MR. KNEEDLER:  But it is land -- it is land 
13  in a floodplain that would be suitable for any sort of 
14  construction or development.  It is land in a 
floodplain.  And they have -- they have not argued, and

12  with the Chief Justice the Government was actually 
13  transmitting the water.  It was essentially using the 
14  land as -- as a reservoir.  And that -- that's, I think, 
what Petitioner's counsel was trying to conjure up by 
15
16  saying the Government was using this land for storage.

 People who live in a basin where there is a

3  control of that.  The water has to be released.  And it 
4  has long been the case that the way that problem is --
that issue is handled about how it will be released is 
5
6  by ordinary administrative law principles, basically, 
7  with the Corps, in operating the dam, they have 
8  requirements of public participation.  In this case, the 
9  commission participated on ad hoc planning groups.
 This manual had not been updated in 50 
10
11  years.  Corps regulations say that manuals should be 
12  updated to keep apace of changing circumstances,

14  concerns, so that when that happens, the commission

17  commendable.  The Corps was trying to develop a 
18  consensus of downstream water users, which is why it 
19  convened this ad hoc working group:  The commission 
drainage districts, representatives of farmers, the

15
16  of Sponenbarger and Bedford and Sanguinetti say that 
17  when it's not the United States' structure or it's not 
18  the policy -- and the landowner cannot show that, that 
19  it's from storms or from something in nature -- that's 
not going to incur liability.  Even negligence may not 
20
21  incur liability unless it's direct that what -- how it 
22  caused, and then substantial intrusion. 
 And, Your Honor, I think --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is the baseline -- go 
back to Justice Kennedy's question -- is it before the

2
3  unpredictably before the dam, and possibly summer 
4  flooding of this kind could have happened, do you lose?
 MR. GOODHART:  Your Honor, under that --
5
6  under those facts, if it could have happened and the 
7  landowner knew that, and that that is -- that is a 
8  cause, not the United States, if -- if the United States 
9  takes away its flood protection and this land goes back 
to what it would be naturally, then the landowner can't 
10
11 
prove that it's direct from the United States.  The 
landowner would not recover in that instance. 
12 
13
 In this situation, the evidence --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even though after the 
14
15
16  happen, you would still lose?  If natural conditions --
17
18
19  caused this, you would lose?
20
21  super-induced invasions directly from the United States, 
22  the landowner is going to have that as a natural 
23  condition.  Here, that was certainly not the case.

 MR. GOODHART:  In the pre-dam or during the 

what was happening to the trees. 

 MR. GOODHART:  And I --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think that there is --

1

3
4  whole first 40 years of how this was operated.
 It was when it was adjusted that the United 
5
6  States used this land and then took the valuable timber. 
7
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not sure that's not 
8  open to dispute.  There is some argument here that 
9  rainfall that was naturally occurring contributed to 
10
11
12
13  at least that's what I understood some of the factual 
14  argument to be.
15
16  record is clear that this was directed naturally, 
17  probably without the -- without the interference or 
18  addition of nature.
