CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear -- we'll


hear argument next in No. 01-595, the United States


against Ruiz.


General Olson.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. OLSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The Ninth Circuit has created a new


constitutional rule for guilty pleas that is neither


required by the Constitution nor warranted by this Court's


previous decisions.  Its inevitable effect would be to


complicate and expose to collateral attack confessions of


guilt which -- which account for approximately 95 percent


of all convictions in the Federal system and to stifle the


market for plea bargains, which this Court has described


as an essential component of the administration of


justice.


The Ninth Circuit held that an accused cannot


enter a valid guilty plea unless he is first given all


evidence in the prosecutor's possession which would have a


reasonable probability of discouraging him from pleading


guilty.

 The Ninth Circuit's rule, new rule, is not a


logical extension of the Brady -- Brady v. Maryland, which


is premised on concern over the constitutional fairness of


criminal trials.  Brady and its progeny require disclosure


only when necessary to ensure a fair trial.  In fact, in


Brady itself, the Court was explicit to point out that it


-- that decision was premised on the avoidance of an


unfair trial to the accused.  The subsequent cases, which


have expanded upon or interpreted or explained Brady, have


been even more specific with respect to the limitations on


the scope of Brady.


In U.S. v. Agurs, the Court said the prosecutor


will not have violated his constitutional duty unless his


omission is of sufficient significance to result in the


denial of a fair trial. 


Something similar was said in U.S. v. Bagley. 


Brady's purpose is not to displace the adversary system as


the primary means by which truth is uncovered.  If it did


not deprive a defendant of a fair trial, there is no


constitutional violation. 


QUESTION:  Can we get to your main argument


about Brady, that is, Brady in all its aspects is a trial


right, not a pretrial right, in view of the plea agreement


in this case, which represents that you have already


turned over the prime Brady material and the only question

is the impeaching material?


MR. OLSON:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  The


agreement to which Justice Ginsburg is referring is set


out -- the two paragraphs of that agreement --


QUESTION:  45a and 46a of the petition for cert.


MR. OLSON:  Yes, and I also have it on -- on


page 12 of the joint appendix. 


QUESTION:  What -- what --


MR. OLSON:  Page 12 of the joint appendix.  It's


the --


QUESTION:  -- the petition.


MR. OLSON:  It's -- it's on page 14a of the


petition -- of the appendix to the petition for


certiorari. 


QUESTION:  It's the Government's representation


that any information establishing the factual innocence of


the defendant known to the prosecutor has been turned over


to the defendant.  And so my question is, isn't that, at


least in this case, a moot issue?  You do have the


question about the impeaching material.


MR. OLSON:  The answer to that, Justice


Ginsburg, is that both in the Sanchez decision and in this


case, the Ruiz decision, the Ninth Circuit went further


and made it clear that it was applying the rule that it


applied in this case to all exculpatory material which, if

known to the defendant, might cause the defendant not to


plead guilty.  Now, the undertaking that was made in the


particular proposed agreement here went a little bit


further in the direction of the defendant, which often


happens.  Prosecutors frequently will decide, for one


reason or another, to give exculpatory information of some


sort to a defendant.  But the Ninth Circuit went further


than that and made it clear that the rule that it was


enunciating applied to all exculpatory material, including


impeachment material, and that is the rule that's going to


be applicable in the Ninth Circuit.


So, even if this Court determined to limit its


decision to the -- the narrower scope, as articulated in


the second paragraph of that proposed agreement, we'd be


back here next year because it's quite clear what the


Ninth Circuit intends to do with its rule. 


QUESTION:  I -- I don't --


QUESTION:  The statement referred to on page


14a, the Government represents -- that -- that was not


pursuant to any court order, I take it, the Government


turning that over? 


MR. OLSON:  No, it was not, Mr. Chief Justice. 


This was a -- simply a -- a draft agreement which was, in


fact, prepared in response -- as a result of and in


response to the earlier Sanchez decision, which -- which

the Ninth Circuit had articulated.  This was an effort by


the prosecutor --


QUESTION:  I was -- I was going to ask why --


why is that second paragraph there?  It wouldn't have


occurred to me to --


MR. OLSON:  It's -- it's not in the record,


Justice Scalia, but it's my understanding that it's


something that is -- is developed particularly to deal


with the Sanchez case which the Ninth Circuit had already


decided, and the presumption that the Ninth -- the Ninth


Circuit's Sanchez decision went so far and not as far as


the -- that that covered the impeachment material, but not


other exculpatory material in the reverse.


So, however inartful this is, it was not in


response, Mr. Chief Justice, to a court order or any other


legal requirement, nor does it purport to articulate what


the law is.  It purports to undertake what the prosecutor


voluntarily was willing to do with respect to this


particular form of plea --


QUESTION:  Has this been used throughout the


country --


MR. OLSON:  No. 


QUESTION:  -- or just --


MR. OLSON:  This is -- this was developed just


in the San Diego -- the Southern District of California,

although other versions in other places, but there's no


standard national form for plea agreements.


QUESTION:  I -- I know what you'd like is that


we reach the question of this impeachment material and say


there is no such right in a -- in a plea agreement


context.  But how would I even get there?  They only get


an appeal here if there's a violation of law.  I never


heard of a violation of law consisting of a judge refusing


to depart.


And then assuming that there is some violation


of law in his refusal to depart, which I thought was


discretionary, how could he possibly depart?  And this is


important to you.  Because I don't see at the moment how


it would ever be a justification to depart, that a


defendant has entered into this program.  I mean, I can't


find anything in the guidelines where it says "you can


depart for a reason such as," and then fill in the content


of the program to get a two-level departure.


So, how -- how do we get to your issue and what


do I do about those two things which seem tremendous


blocks? 


MR. OLSON:  The Ninth Circuit -- let me answer


the jurisdictional point first.  The Ninth Circuit


perceived that it had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C.


3742(a)(1).

 QUESTION:  That's violation of law.


MR. OLSON:  A -- that the sentence was imposed


or the --


QUESTION:  Yes, in violation of law.  So, I


would ask them.  I'd say, what law? 


MR. OLSON:  And -- and that the Ninth Circuit


perceived that the district court felt that it was barred


by law from departing --


QUESTION:  There isn't much I can find in this


record that says that. 


MR. OLSON:  And -- and that the Ninth Circuit


felt that because this was a constitutional right that the


defendant was -- had that was being withheld from the


defendant because of the -- of the circumstances of this


case, that the -- the district court erroneously presumed


that it was prevented from going in a -- in a direction


that the Ninth Circuit felt that it could go. 


And I think that then ties in with your second


-- your second question with respect to the sentencing


guidelines and section 5K2.  The -- the court felt -- the


Ninth Circuit felt -- and it's not very clear, but -- and


-- and the Government is not objecting to the -- the way


the Ninth Circuit exercised jurisdiction at this point and


is not opposing the court's decision with respect to


jurisdiction at this point.

 The Ninth Circuit felt that under section 5K2 of


the sentencing guidelines, this would be a -- mitigate --


the -- the entry into the so-called fast track program was


a mitigating circumstance of a kind or a degree not


adequately taken into account by the guidelines in


formulating the guidelines.  It should result in a


sentence different --


QUESTION:  Those are supposed to be individual


things.  I mean, in other words --


MR. OLSON:  Well, but -- yes.


QUESTION:  -- I -- I see -- normally you could


say, okay, the Government doesn't oppose it.  We'll get to


the main issue.  But these look like tremendous


jurisdictional blocks to me. 


MR. OLSON:  It -- it -- I think the answer to


that latter point with respect to the individual


consideration is covered by the fact that this particular


program, under the circumstances of this district, are --


they may be -- it may be frequently occurring, but it's


individualistic in the sense that entering into this


program alleviates a substantial amount of work and -- and


provides a substantial benefit to the prosecutor in that


district without which the prosecutor may not be able to


enforce the law on all of the responsibilities of the law.


This is one of the most busy districts of the

United States because of the tremendous number of


narcotics crimes coming in across the border, multiplied


in a sense by the number of immigration violations that


take place.  So that this was an individualized


circumstance in that district.


Now, one could quibble about the appropriateness


of that, but that's how the Ninth Circuit perceived it. 


It perceived that it had jurisdiction on that basis, and


we're not objecting to it. 


It seems clear that not only, therefore, that


not -- that this right is not required by or implicit


within Brady, but that the language of the Court's


decisions interpreting Brady make it clear that Brady is


not supposed to go that far, that it only has to do with


the rights at -- at trial. 


Furthermore, the solution that the Ninth Circuit


proposed with respect to this is both overly broad and


underly inclusive.  If the Court was concerned, as it said


it was and as the respondent contends it should be, with


the potential of innocent persons pleading guilty, the


test itself, which is set out in the court's -- the -- the


Ninth Circuit's opinion on page -- I think it's 15a of the


appendix to the petition for certiorari.  About midway


through the page, the court says, the evidence is material


under the test announced in this case if there is a

reasonable probability that but for the failure to


disclose the Brady material, the defendant would have


refused to plead and would have gone to trial.


In other words, the test is not couched in terms


of the potential innocence of the defendant or the risk


that a defendant was -- was innocent.  It's couched in


terms of the tactical decision a defendant might make with


respect to whether or not to go trial. 


QUESTION:  He should know what the house odds


are before he -- before he rolls the dice by pleading


guilty. 


MR. OLSON:  Precisely.  In fact --


QUESTION:  Which is sort of a different concept


from -- from what Brady was about. 


MR. OLSON:  Exactly, Justice Scalia.  In fact,


this Court has frequently said that -- that there are lots


of risks involved in the -- in the defense of a case, a


criminal case, and -- and there are risks and benefits and


burdens and evaluations that must be taken into


consideration.


QUESTION:  What is the Government's obligation


with respect to advising the defendant or the court that


the elements of an offense have -- have been committed?  I


-- in all these hypotheticals, the cocaine supposedly --


there was supposed to be cocaine.  It's really talcum

powder or something, and the Government knows that.  What


-- is this all taken care by rule 11 or --


MR. OLSON:  Well, I think it's taken care of in


several ways.  If the -- the Constitution gives the


defendant a right to trial or a right to confront


witnesses, a right to counsel, reasonably competent,


informed counsel.  Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of


Criminal Procedure require a relatively exhaustive


procedure where the court makes sure that the guilty plea


is voluntary and intelligent and that the elements of the


crime, of course, are involved in whether or not --


QUESTION:  Well, does the Government have to


have a good faith belief that an offense has been


committed?  Is there -- is there some standard that binds


the prosecution?


MR. OLSON:  The standard -- the standards for


prosecutors in the United States -- for the United States


are set forth in the -- the U.S. Attorneys Manual.  It


requires prosecutors not to bring a case unless they


believe in good faith that there is a reasonable basis for


the case that's being brought, in fact a reasonable basis


for believing that there could be a conviction based upon


evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.  That's not a


constitutional standard, Justice Kennedy.


The constitutional standard is set forth in the

-- this Court's decisions with respect to the right to


counsel, the right to trial, the right to intelligent


information with respect to that.


Rule 11, which is a -- which is a joint product


of the courts and the -- and the legislature, sets out


elaborate procedures pursuant to which a Federal judge


will inquire with respect to the basis for the plea,


explain the rights that the defendant has violated, and


specifically requires the Federal court to find that


there's a factual basis for the plea.


Now, so that what I was saying was that is the


remedy, the so-called remedy, that the Ninth Circuit has


come up -- is -- is under-inclusive to the extent that if


it's concerned about -- it's over-inclusive to the extent


that it's concerned about innocent people pleading guilty


because it doesn't go to the -- the factual innocent.  It


goes to the tactical decisions, the rolling of the dice,


with respect to what are the chances of winning or losing


in court. 


QUESTION:  Is this true, Mr. Solicitor General,


that the rolling of the dice concept can apply to an


innocent defendant as well?  Supposing the -- the


defendant and his lawyer know there are three eyewitnesses


who were going to identify him.  They also know he wasn't


there, but there was somebody there who looks a lot like

him.  And so they've got a choice of either taking the


chance of getting acquitted, in the face of that evidence


and based on their own denial -- he doesn't have an alibi


-- and if he gets convicted, he has a very long sentence. 


And he gets an offer of a plea bargain, a very short


sentence.  I don't suppose there's anything unethical


about the lawyer trying to figure out what the odds are. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, no, there's nothing unethical


about the lawyer trying to figure out what the odds are. 


In fact, rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal


Procedure give fairly elaborate rights of discovery to the


defendant's counsel.  And at that plea agreement, the


judge will inquire with respect to whether there's a


factual basis for the plea agreement.


In fact, the judge in this case specifically


addressed that question to the defendant, asked the


defendant is it, indeed, true -- asked the defendant and


then the counsel interceded and said, yes, she was


bringing in her car 60 -- 60 pounds of marijuana.  And


then the judge turned to the defendant and said, is that


true?  And the defendant said, yes, I knew that it was --


QUESTION:  What is the lawyer -- what kind of


advice is the lawyer to give?  Hypothetically we have an


innocent client who has a very severe risk of being


convicted, and the lawyer would tell him there's going to

be a plea colloquy here, and if you don't acknowledge


this, the plea bargain will go down the drain.  Now, I


guess he shouldn't tell him what -- I don't know exactly


what the lawyer is supposed to do there. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, I don't -- I'm not sure


either.  It would all depend upon the circumstance.  There


is -- there is a possibility that this Court's recognized


in the Alford decision a possibility of making a plea


which is -- which is not incompatible with a defendant's


assertion of innocence.  But I think that in most cases


the defendant is the one who will know more than anyone,


the prosecutor or anyone else, whether the defendant is


guilty. 


QUESTION:  Right, but I'm assuming a case in


which the defendant knows he's not guilty, and


nevertheless, there's a risk that, because the odds are so


heavy if you get convicted, you go away for 20 years.  If


you have a 16-month plea bargain, you may want to not take


the chance. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, I understand that, Justice


Stevens.  That may happen in a particular case.  This


Court said in Bagley that Brady's primary purpose is not


to -- Brady's purpose is not to displace the adversary


system as the primary means by which truth is -- as the


primary means by which truth is uncovered.  And I think

that the answer to your question is that this system, no


system is perfect or ever will be perfect, but we do have


a panoply of constitutional rights.  We insist that the


defendant be adequately counseled.  We insist that the


judge through rule -- through rule 16 --


QUESTION:  So that in effect you're saying there


may be a hypothetical situation out there, but we've got


millions of cases.  Also, we've got to balance the two,


one against the other.


MR. OLSON:  Absolutely.  And I must -- I must


say that with respect to -- we're not talking about that


case here.  We're talking about a blanket rule which would


apply in 57 -- you know, 57,000-some guilty pleas in the


Federal system every year. 


QUESTION:  Well, the McMann and Brady cases too


said that a defendant may have to make some hard choices.


MR. OLSON:  The Court said that explicitly.


QUESTION:  Well, if we're talking about


balancing and basic fairness, I guess their argument would


be with 57,000 cases going -- that's 85 percent or 90


percent of all people plead guilty.  Most of those are


drug crimes.  When the prosecutor sits there with a drug


crime, he says, you plead guilty to a telephone count,


it's 8 months, or I bring you to a mandatory minimum


charge in trial and it's a minimum of 5 years.  And under

those circumstances, the person is quite tempted to plead


guilty irrespective of the facts.  And therefore, it


balances.  As you were saying, it balances the system and


it makes it somewhat more fair in that mine run situation


to understand what are the chances of being convicted if I


do go to trial. 


MR. OLSON:  Well --


QUESTION:  That would be the argument, I think,


the other way in terms of fundamental fairness. 


MR. OLSON:  And I would answer that in two ways. 


In the first place, I think the Chief Justice answered it


by referring to the Brady v. United States case.


QUESTION:  So, you'd have to say that you're


right, that that isn't what Brady said.  But in taking --


taking into account the reality of the criminal justice


system, where 85 percent of the people plead guilty, and


the prosecutor is armed with this tremendous don't plead


guilty or else sentencing system, that this creates a kind


of basic balance that -- in terms of fairness -- I'm


trying to get the argument out. 


MR. OLSON:  I understand, Justice Breyer, I


understand what you're saying.  And there's a certain --


there's a certain logic to it.  But if that is -- if that


was the case, then the Ninth Circuit's rule is under-


inclusive because if the defendant really wants to know

what the best chances are, rather than the exculpatory


material or the impeachment material, what he is going to


want to know is the inculpatory material.  And you made


the point about the other -- other prosecutions that are


being held over the defendant's head.  He's going to want


to know what -- well, what evidence do they have on the


greater offense that they're about to charge me with,


because I'm going to take my chances now and plead to this


lesser included offense.


So, if the Ninth Circuit wanted to accomplish


what you're talking about as the thrust of your question,


it would have gone -- and I suspect that it will --


QUESTION:  Well, you -- you wouldn't want it to


go further, would -- would you, General Olson?  You -- you


would not want us to adopt a rule that encourages -- that


enables innocent people to more intelligently plead guilty


when they're innocent? 


MR. OLSON:  No.  I'm not --


QUESTION:  I mean, it seems to me we should do


everything to discourage people who are innocent from


pleading guilty. 


MR. OLSON:  I -- I --


QUESTION:  What kind of a legal system is this


where we're going to design our rules to encourage guilty


people to plead -- or innocent people to plead guilty?

It's crazy. 


MR. OLSON:  This Court -- this Court has said


that it's perfectly appropriate in the adversarial system


for the prosecutor to find legitimate ways to encourage


guilty defendants to plead guilty. 


Now, we -- you're absolutely right.  It's --


QUESTION:  We're worrying here about innocent


people, and we're trying to encourage them to plead guilty


so that -- if they know everything about what the


Government has.  I mean, there's something wrong with a


legal system that -- that --


MR. OLSON:  But there's --


QUESTION:  -- is even contemplating such --


MR. OLSON:  -- Justice Scalia --


QUESTION:  -- such action, it seems to me. 


MR. OLSON:  -- nothing in this case that


involves that issue at all.  We have a guilty defendant


who has acknowledged under oath -- I think it was under


oath.  Usually it is, in the Federal court systems -- that


this person was guilty.  So, you are faced with the


possibility of drafting a rule -- or the Ninth Circuit


drafted a rule for a hypothetical situation not involving


the case before it, which was over-inclusive because it


includes the vast number of people that are indeed guilty,


and under-inclusive because it doesn't provide a remedy --

the best remedy which we would definitely not encourage,


but I would suggest would be the next step, possibly from


the same circuit, with respect to giving additional


information.


And it would be inconsistent not only with that,


but it would be inconsistent with what this Court has said


over and over again with respect to the value of competent


counsel, the fact that certain chances have to be taken,


that a defendant is not entitled to set aside a plea


because he may have misconstrued the weight or balance of


the prosecution's case, or there may have been mistakes of


law.  In one -- in -- in Brady v. the United States, in


fact, it was a misconstruction of whether or not the


defendant would -- could be -- could be put to death if


the defendant went to trial.  So, this Court has


recognized that there are those balances in the system. 


But what the -- what we urge upon the Court is


that there are so many protections, including the


discovery right, the fairly exhaustive --


QUESTION:  The discovery right would cover --


you did say there were some things that a defendant


perhaps would not know, and one of them you mentioned in


your -- in your brief is if you rob a bank and you don't


know whether it's FDIC insured.  That kind of information. 


How would that -- how would that come out pretrial?

 MR. OLSON:  That would -- that would come out


through rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal


Procedure, which is set out in the appendix, I think 3a to


5a, of our brief on the merits.  The defendant is given


pretrial considerable discovery rights to find out those


sorts of things, and if the defendant is not sure and,


after consultation with his counsel, wishes to go to


trial, there's -- the Brady rights do kick in at an


appropriate time to allow the defendant to prepare for


trial. 


What I'm saying is that -- that the combination


of the constitutional rights to trial and -- and


confrontation, the constitutional rights to counsel, the


-- the statutory rights to discovery, the statutory


obligations on a judge to make sure there's a factual


basis for the guilty plea, the obligations -- and we have


to assume under -- as this Court suggested in the


Mezzanatto case, a -- a good faith behavior by our public


officials that a prosecutor is not going to withhold


evidence in -- on -- where it knows that the -- this is an


innocent defendant.  Those are ample assurances,


especially in the context, as this Court has said over and


over again, that the best person to know whether there's a


factual basis for a plea of guilty is the defendant


himself or herself.

 I will say one more thing that is -- that seems


to me important with respect to the -- this -- the posture


in which this case comes.  If this Court were to determine


that there is a constitutional right -- and we think that


neither this Court's decisions nor the Constitution would


lead the Court to that conclusion -- the constitutional


right could be waived.  The Ninth Circuit said that a


defendant cannot, even if the defendant wanted to, plead


guilty.  Knowing that the defendant was guilty, the


defendant could not waive the right. 


Now, that has several implications.  It -- it


creates problems for the criminal justice system.  The


Brady -- the Brady right that the Ninth Circuit would


engraft on the system here would force prosecutors to


develop cases and use resources at the defendant's


initiative, on the defendant's time table.  It creates --


turns Brady -- the right, from a fair trial right into a


fair trial preparation right.


With respect to certain types of cases, it would


compromise conspiracy cases, racketeering cases, organized


crime drug cases, white collar cases where there may be


substantial warehouses full of documents.  In other words,


many prosecutors won't be preparing their case for


determining what witnesses they're going to use until


they're ready to go to trial.  Once they -- if they had to

disclose this information on the defendant's time table,


which the defendant -- if this rule were adopted by this


Court, the first thing a defendant would do is offer --


say, "I'm thinking about pleading guilty.  Give me


everything in your files." 


Now, a prosecutor in complicated cases is not going


to want to do that and -- and will refuse to engage in


that process or will -- once -- once it does so, there's


no more incentive for the -- for the prosecutor to enter


into the plea bargaining process.  So, it could be


damaging to the benefits of the defendants over and over


again that's received the benefits of the plea bargaining


system, which this Court has sanctioned and encouraged. 


QUESTION:  I don't want to cut into your -- your


reserve time.  Just one question.  If you prevail in this


case, what happens?  Does she get a longer supervised time


of relief?  Or is there anything that's still live in this


case as to this defendant? 


MR. OLSON:  The --she -- she --


QUESTION:  Or has she served the full time


anyway?


MR. OLSON:  -- she -- I don't -- I don't know


whether she's served the entire -- the sentence that was


given to her was 18 months in incarceration and a 3-month


-- a 3-year --

 QUESTION:  3 years.

that that would continue to go on.  That was at the very


low range, low end of the guideline sentence. 


QUESTION:  So there is still some -- something


at stake here?


MR. OLSON:  Yes, I believe so, Justice Kennedy,


but I'm not sure, 100 percent sure, factually I know the


answer to that. 


If I may reserve the balance of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, General Olson.


Mr. Hubachek, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN F. HUBACHEK


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. HUBACHEK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The Due Process Clause requires the disclosure


of materials --


QUESTION:  Before you get going, is the case


moot?  Is there something left on the 3-year probation


period? 


MR. HUBACHEK:  Yes, there is, Justice O'Connor.


QUESTION:  Thank you. 


MR. HUBACHEK:  Now, the -- the disclosure of


material exculpatory information is essential to ensure

the accuracy of criminal convictions.  And Ake indicates


there's a societal and individual interest in the accuracy


of such convictions that's paramount. 


The system that we have now, as has been


discussed already this morning funnels cases into plea


negotiations, and the -- the Court has said that's not a


bad thing, but it -- still, it funnels everybody, the


guilty and the innocent, into the same sort of result. 


Innocent people are provided the same substantial and


legitimate incentives to plead guilty as guilty people


are.


And if I could return to Justice --


QUESTION:  No.  I -- I object to that.  I -- I


don't think our system ever encourages or, indeed, even


permits an innocent person to plead guilty.  Our rules


require the judge to -- to interrogate the person pleading


guilty to make sure that, indeed, the person is guilty. 


There is nothing in our system that encourages or even


allows an innocent person to -- to plead guilty.  And I


would be horrified if -- if there were something like


that.


MR. HUBACHEK:  Well, Justice Scalia, the -- the


system does not -- first of all, I guess the first


protection would be a rule 11 type factual basis.  That's


not required in every case.  In fact, the Fifth Circuit

cases that the Solicitor General relies upon, both of


those were nolo or Alford type pleas.  So, there was no


factual basis provided at all in those cases.  Individuals


who don't know whether they're innocent or guilty -- they


don't have to provide a factual basis that's -- that's


incorrect or false.


QUESTION:  How many individuals don't know


whether they're innocent or guilty?


MR. HUBACHEK:  Your Honor, there are some. 


I've --


QUESTION:  I'm sure there may be rare cases, but


it -- it is rare.  Is it not? 


MR. HUBACHEK:  I'm sure that it's not


tremendously common, but the important thing is -- is that


individuals who are innocent do receive the same


incentives to plead guilty.  And I've cited some cases


from various State courts at pages 10 to 11 of the brief


where individuals pled guilty where substantial material


exculpatory evidence existed, several cases like Justice


Stevens' hypothetical involving identification testimony


where an individual was charged with an offense and was


told that there had been an identification made by what


appeared to be an otherwise unimpeachable witness --


QUESTION:  So -- so that's what your case comes


down to?  You want us to facilitate the pleading of guilty

by innocent people.  You -- you want us to set up a system


that will make -- will make that a more intelligent


decision so that we can put in jail a lot of people who


plead guilty even though they're innocent because it's a


good deal for them.


MR. HUBACHEK:  No, Your Honor, not -- not at


all.  I --


QUESTION:  I thought that's what you're saying. 


I don't know what other -- for the guilty person, you're


not worried about it.  You're -- you're asserting the


rights of the innocent.


MR. HUBACHEK:  Right.  It's the innocent person


who needs to receive this --


QUESTION:  Who needs to be able to plead guilty


so he'll -- he'll serve a sentence that he doesn't


deserve.


MR. HUBACHEK:  Well, Your Honor, the fact that


that happens exists already.  The rule that I'm asking for


is to provide material exculpatory information to


individuals who are not guilty which will, when they are


able to --


QUESTION:  But your client is guilty, and I


don't understand why what we're talking about is some


hypothetical.  You have to establish your client's right


and the argument is, if the case is going to go to trial,

you're entitled, before the trial starts, to get this


stuff, but you're not entitled to get it in the beginning


of the case.  And you are representing a guilty client and


asserting that right on behalf of your guilty client.


MR. HUBACHEK:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, the --


the posture of the case, as has been discussed, is that


there -- this is a sentencing issue where there's a


request for a departure based upon the -- this fast track


program.  Ms. Ruiz didn't participate in the fast track


program because she objected to the term of the plea


agreement which required her to surrender her rights under


the -- the Brady decision. 


QUESTION:  But she -- she pled guilty


nonetheless.


QUESTION:  She said she's guilty. 


MR. HUBACHEK:  Yes, she did. 


QUESTION:  And she didn't enter an Alford plea.


MR. HUBACHEK:  No, Justice Souter, she did not. 


But the -- the way that the case was presented to the


Ninth Circuit was that she had a constitutional right to


this information, if it existed.  I mean, there are


situations where the -- the marijuana, for instance, in


this case is concealed.  It's unlikely that an individual


who's merely a courier would ever have actual access to


it.  There is a recent spate of cases in Dallas where the

drugs that were seized turned out not to be drugs.


QUESTION:  That's all true, but this is --


you're asking for a really major change in the system.  I


mean, what the Government says -- and maybe it would be a


better system, but the Government says, once we go down


this path, here's what's going to happen.  And they sound


right to me.


The prosecutors, who are very busy -- very busy


-- and have a little time with the witnesses and they go


in and start talking about a plea, will now not be able to


do that.  They'll have to look into their witnesses, get


all the evidence together, get the impeachment stuff, give


it to the defendant, and 80 percent of them or maybe only


30 percent will say, the hell with this.  We'll go to


trial.  I'm not going to do it.  We'll go to trial.


And under the present system, particularly in


drug offenses, what that means for many, many, many


people, guilty and innocent -- let's say guilty -- they're


going to go away for very long times.  And therefore,


we're transforming this system into something like a


European system where you can't take guilty pleas, and


it'd be somewhere in the middle.  That's a major change. 


And, anyway, the Constitution doesn't requirement --


require it and it would work out the worse, they say, for


a lot of defendants.

 MR. HUBACHEK:  Well, first of all, Justice


Breyer, the -- this system has been in place in the


Southern District of California, which has this enormous


caseload and all these drug cases, for the past year.  The


term --


QUESTION:  Have they been giving all the


evidence, the impeachment evidence and so forth? 


MR. HUBACHEK:  Right.  The term that -- that Ms.


Ruiz objected to has been removed from the plea agreement. 


It's been going on for a year.  The pleas are proceeding


apace. 


QUESTION:  The same way?


MR. HUBACHEK:  The same way, Your Honor.  The --


QUESTION:  But let's -- let's go back perhaps to


Justice Ginsburg's question, that you say you're here on


behalf of innocent people who want to plead guilty.  But


your own client admitted that she was -- had 50 or 60


pounds of marijuana.  Surely, you've got to argue for a


rule that favors something like that who is not an


innocent person.


MR. HUBACHEK:  Well, the rule that I'm proposing


would, indeed, benefit both non-innocent and innocent


individuals.  But that's the case with every


constitutional protection.


QUESTION:  Well, wouldn't it be better to just

say we don't accept guilty pleas from innocent people? 


That's our policy. 


MR. HUBACHEK:  Well, the -- I don't think that


any judge or any prosecutor wants to accept guilty pleas


from innocent people. 


QUESTION:  And indeed may not do so.  That's the


rule.  You -- you won't accept a guilty plea from someone


who's innocent.


MR. HUBACHEK:  Well, the protections that are in


place don't fully account for innocence.  For -- for


example, even in a rule 11 decision -- in a rule 11 plea,


if you ask someone, did you sell the drugs or did you, you


know, shoot the person, that doesn't say anything about


whether or not there's entrapment.  It doesn't say


anything at all about whether or not there's self-defense. 


If a defendant pleads guilty in ignorance of that kind of


information, then in fact an innocent person could plead


guilty.  In Alford pleas or nolo pleas, there's no factual


basis provided at all.  And again --


QUESTION:  Wait a minute.  I don't understand. 


The person doesn't understand that there's a -- this


person doesn't have a lawyer who tells him, you know, if


you shot the person in self-defense, of course, you're not


guilty.  Is -- is that the hypothetical you're positing,


somebody who has such poor legal advice and he doesn't

know there's a right of self-defense?


MR. HUBACHEK:  The -- the concern here, Justice


Scalia, is not evidence that the lawyer has access to and


simply misadvises the client.  I understand that you have


to take the risk in many situations.  What I'm talking


about is evidence that would support such a defense, an


entrapment defense, or a self-defense defense that's not


available to counsel but is in the possession of -- of the


prosecution.


QUESTION:  Well, it would certainly be in


possession of the defendant.  I mean, it -- it's


impossible for him not to know whether he was acting in


self-defense.  The -- the only possible reason for -- for


giving him, this innocent person, this information is to


enable him to make an intelligent judgment to plead guilty


even though he's innocent.  And I don't think we're -- I


don't think we're supposed to encourage that.


I mean, we would have contradictory policies. 


Other provisions of our laws make it very clear that we


are not to accept guilty pleas from innocent people, and


you want to adopt a system that will enable innocent


people more intelligently to plead guilty.


MR. HUBACHEK:  Well, perhaps -- what I'm saying


is -- is that if information that supports the self-


defense theory that is not in the possession of the

defense but is in the possession of the prosecution, if


that evidence is turned over, that will make it more


likely that the innocent person will go to trial --


QUESTION:  Okay.  Let's --


QUESTION:  Is there -- is there any precedent


outside the Ninth Circuit that says Brady is an immediate


turnover right and not a preparation for trial right?


MR. HUBACHEK:  Yes, there is.  The Second


Circuit has adopted this rule since 1988, and again, while


the Solicitor General has come forward and indicated there


are numerous potential down sides to this type of


constitutional rule, the bottom line is -- is it --


QUESTION:  The Second Circuit has for impeaching


material as well?


MR. HUBACHEK:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Let me go back to a variant of


Justice Scalia's question.  It seems to me that your


strongest argument is the argument that does focus on the


-- the supposedly innocent defendant.  And -- and the


argument that I think is strongest with respect to that


category is the argument that those who enter Alford pleas


obviously are not doing so because they want to plead


guilty, despite their protest of innocence, they're doing


it because they think they face such terrible odds that,


in fact, it's better for them to collapse at the beginning

and get it over with.  And if these people are presented


with exculpatory, including impeachment evidence, they are


less likely to do just what Justice Scalia says we, after


all, as a system don't want them to do.


My question is, do you have any indication that


there is such a rash of unintelligent Alford pleas going


on that we should modify the entire system to respond to


this risk of Alford pleas that, in fact, would not be


entered if the disclosure that you ask for were given?


MR. HUBACHEK:  I don't have an -- an empirical


study that shows how many such guilty pleas are entered. 


I've cited on pages 10 to 11 of the respondent's brief a


number of cases in which there are potentially innocent


people who have pled guilty, individuals who didn't know,


for instance, that a witness saw the tire blow out on the


car before the car crossed over the median, indicating


that that person -- that the tire blowout, not the


person's driving was responsible for the accident.


Another case, the Gibson case, where the


prosecutor was actually told by the main identification


witness that she was changing her story, and that wasn't


turned over to the defense. 


In the Lee case, a situation where the


individual was charged with an offense and told that there


was an identification, and it turns out that the -- the

witness misidentified him and that then the -- the witness


was later shown, before a preliminary hearing, a picture


of the defendant.  So, there are cases out there in which


this risk exists. 


And if I could, I think that the -- one of the


problems I guess in getting across the point is that I


think the Solicitor General has misstated the import of


the Ninth Circuit's test.  The Ninth Circuit's test is not


solely a -- you know, we want to give you all the cards so


you can make a better strategic choice.  The -- the test


is derived from the Court's decision in Hill v. Lockhart,


and Hill v. Lockhart's test says would the defendant have


gone to trial if, in fact, he had received the proper


advice.  But then it says that --


QUESTION:  Well, but even -- even if you're


going to imply -- if -- if that's going to be your


standard, it seems to me that the Solicitor General has


got a point when he says if the Ninth Circuit test is


going to be applied and applied with your gloss, it can't


stop where it is now.  It's going to have to go the


further step and, in effect, require disclosure of all the


inculpatory evidence.  What's your response to that?


MR. HUBACHEK:  My response to that is -- is that


we're asking for a right based on Brady, and Brady doesn't


provide for --

 QUESTION:  Oh, but Brady -- I mean, Brady


ultimately comes down to a judgment about materiality, and


-- and materiality in the sense of -- of the kind of


evidence that disturbs confidence in the verdict is a


judgment that can only be made in the context of the


entire evidence of the case.  Brady judgments ultimately


are made after the fact.  And I don't see why that -- that


very fact if we're -- if Brady is going, ultimately, to be


our standard here, doesn't imply just what the Solicitor


General argued.


Before we can tell that there has been a


violation of the rule that you propose, a court would have


to know -- and indeed, before that, a defendant presumably


would have to know -- the -- the entire evidentiary world


of that case.  And that means you've got to know a lot


more than impeachment evidence or even exculpatory


evidence.  You've got to know what the inculpatory


evidence is.  So, it seems to me that what you're arguing


for, even with your gloss and even starting with Brady, is


essentially a global disclosure rule.


MR. HUBACHEK:  Well, I'd respectfully disagree. 


I think that the Hill v. Lockhart test, when specifically


the Hill case was discussing when defense counsel fails to


-- to find material exculpatory evidence, that the Ninth


Circuit test would apply at that point, but that that test

will ultimately devolve into what effect this evidence


would have at trial.  So --


QUESTION:  Hill -- Hill was an ineffective


assistance of counsel case, wasn't it? 


MR. HUBACHEK:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  So, we're not talking about any


obligation of the prosecutor in Hill.


MR. HUBACHEK:  No.  I understand.  But -- but


Hill talked about ineffective assistance of counsel in the


context of the failure to locate material exculpatory


evidence, essentially the same facts that -- that could


conceivably result in the withdrawal of the guilty plea.


QUESTION:  Yes, but the relationship between a


defendant's attorney and the prosecutor on the other side


are by no means the same.


MR. HUBACHEK:  I agree.  And Brady certainly


doesn't suggest that they're the same.  Brady in trial


requires that the prosecutor turn over the evidence but


not to tell the defense lawyer how to use it.  Well, we're


positing that the same sort of obligation should exist at


the pretrial stage.  The prosecutor has to turn over the


information but not go any further and provide advice as


to how it should be used. 


QUESTION:  It's so odd that it comes to us in a


case where there's no suggestion that we're dealing here

with an innocent defendant.  We're -- we're told nothing


about what's out there that would affect this case, are


we?


MR. HUBACHEK:  I -- I understand that this is a


case where there's a guilty plea and we're not making an


argument that she -- that Ms. Ruiz should be permitted to


withdraw her guilty plea.  However, if the Court adopts a


rule that the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit's


approach is incorrect, then defendants will not receive


exculpatory evidence before they plead guilty and


situations such as arose in the various --


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I assume there is, as the


Solicitor General suggests, some pretrial discovery right


that a defense counsel has.


MR. HUBACHEK:  Well, there's some pretrial


discovery right, but it's not extensive and oftentimes it


doesn't cover the types of information that has led to


potential miscarriages of justice, as I set out in the


brief.


QUESTION:  And in fact, the -- the relevant


discovery rule actually prohibits, as I read it, discovery


of some material that you say this rule would cover.


MR. HUBACHEK:  Right.  For instance, the --


the --


QUESTION:  Statements of witnesses, for example.

 MR. HUBACHEK:  Exactly.  Justice Stevens,


your --


QUESTION:  Which is -- which is a troubling


concept because one of the things we're sort of trying to


do here is balance the system-wide benefit of an -- a fast


track program, on the one hand, with the occasional case


where there's a risk of injustice that -- that concerns


you.  And it's that very balance that, it would seem to


me, must have motivated the draftsman of rule 16 and the


enactment of the Jencks Act that have developed some


rather elaborate rules as to just what rights you do have


before you plead guilty, and you're, in effect, saying


well, we should go beyond those as a matter of judicial


craftsmanship.


MR. HUBACHEK:  Well, the rule that we're


proposing would not supplant all of those rules.  This is


a narrow range --


QUESTION:  It would add to them, and that's it. 


There's -- there's a limited right of discovery under the


Federal rules, and you are urging an expansion of that


right essentially.


MR. HUBACHEK:  It -- it would expand it.  That's


correct.  However, it would expand it in only a narrow


fashion because the information that we would -- that the


defense would be entitled to would be limited by the

notion of materiality.  Much of the debate in Agurs and


Bagley was whether or not a more broad rule should be


adopted, but ultimately the -- the Court settled on the


materiality standard. 


QUESTION:  What we're doing is -- is you're


asking us to open up the plea bargaining process and


piecemeal to bring in a constitutional rule that would


affect one aspect of it.  Now, it's -- it's hard for me to


accept that, at least without knowing more about what are


the proposals around in the bar and elsewhere as to how


that process should be regularized.  Are there rules


suggestions, rules change suggestions, statutory


suggestions?  Where does this constitutional rule coming


in, in a sense, out of -- from somewhere suddenly affect


this -- the whole process?  Can I get a grasp of that by


reading something? 


MR. HUBACHEK:  I -- I can't direct you, Justice


Breyer, to any particular rule change proposals that are


out there.


Our argument is based upon the notion that


everyone agrees that the defendant is entitled to -- to


material exculpatory evidence at trial under the Fifth


Amendment and also that the -- that the Sixth Amendment


requires defense counsel to find material exculpatory


evidence to use at trial.

 Now, the -- the Sixth Amendment also requires


counsel to locate material exculpatory evidence before the


decision to make a plea is -- is made.  And the reason


that is is so that it will be a plea that's worthy of


confidence.  And that's -- ultimately the standard under


Brady is -- is essentially the same as under Strickland. 


We want a -- a proceeding that's reliable.


Under the current state of the law, if defense


counsel fails to find a piece of material exculpatory


evidence, that guilty plea is then, therefore, going to be


unreliable.  But if the same piece of -- of material


exculpatory evidence is unavailable to counsel, but in the


possession of the prosecution, that conviction is


considered to be reliable even if the defendant doesn't


get the benefit of it.


So, what we're proposing is -- is that there is


a complementary action of -- of both the Fifth and Sixth


Amendment rights pre plea and during the trial and that if


there is going to be an overlap in the Fifth and Sixth


Amendment rights it's got to be at -- where the interest


that those rights protect is at its highest, and that is,


protecting the innocent from pleading guilty.


QUESTION:  Under the fast track program, does


the defendant have to waive rule 16 rights?


MR. HUBACHEK:  The -- under the fast track

program, the defendant can't file any motions at all, but


the -- what happens is -- is that there is a pre-


indictment offer that's made and the pre-indictment offer


is usually accompanied by discovery in the form of -- in a


case like Ms. Ruiz's, the reports of the initial


inspectors and then the special agent who comes in and


does the interrogation and does the -- sort of a summary


of the other individuals' information. 


QUESTION:  So, those are available even under


the fast track program. 


MR. HUBACHEK:  That's correct.  That information


is provided. 


QUESTION:  Suppose you're right on your


constitutional argument.  I'd just like you to spend 1


minute addressing what I do not see how we get around the


simple fact that you have a client and your client is


saying that, as a matter of law, the judge had to depart. 


And not only am I unaware of any law that says the judge


has to depart, but in this case, I can't even find a


provision that would allow him to depart.


And -- and I -- they've said, oh, well, he was


under a mistake of law.  So, I've read the three sentences


quoted for that proposition, and I certainly don't see any


mistake of law there.  He says, the court has read and


considered the -- the documents, blah, blah, blah, and

I've decided this is -- the court feels that this is not a


proper case for departure.  So?


And in another part of the record, he says -- he


says, if you didn't sign an agreement, you have to live


with the consequence.


MR. HUBACHEK:  I -- I agree, Justice Breyer,


that there's no rule that you can say that a district


court is compelled to depart in any case.  The -- the


district court judge, when asked to depart because Ms.


Ruiz was being denied the fast track benefit because she


refused to agree to what she thought was an


unconstitutional provision -- the district court's only


response was -- is that was acceptance and offer.  The --


and the interpretation of that is -- is the district


thought it didn't have discretion to depart unless the


Government was agreeing --


QUESTION:  That's really not what he said.  I


mean, he just said you're not going to get advantage of


this because you didn't sign it. 


QUESTION:  He said it's just not proper.  I


mean, I wish he'd give us language that -- that would


indicate that he thought he couldn't depart, even if he


wanted to.  He just said it's not, in his view, a proper


case, but that's -- you know, that's fully consistent with


his discretion.

 MR. HUBACHEK:  The -- the district court's


comment related to whether or not -- he said to counsel


that there was offer and acceptance and -- and that's it. 


And that --


QUESTION:  What's bothering me is this, that you


could say, okay, let's just hold everything in abeyance,


get to the issue.  If we do that, why wouldn't this case


stand for the proposition that courts of appeals have


absolute authority to review every instance in which a


trial judge refuses to depart?  In which case there will


be tens of thousands of such instances every year going


right up to the court of appeals for review of the


question whether he should have departed.  Now, that's a


major change in the law, I think.  And how -- how could I


avoid that change and yet get to the issue?


MR. HUBACHEK:  Well, the Solicitor General


hasn't been framing the questions related solely to the


discovery issues, the Brady issue and the waiver issue. 


So, I don't think that the Court would be ruling on the


propriety of the -- of the Ninth Circuit's analysis --


QUESTION:  Your -- your answer is an easy one,


Mr. Hubachek.  Our -- our opinions are very clear that in


cases where we say nothing about jurisdiction, there is no


holding on jurisdiction. 


MR. HUBACHEK:  That's -- that's what I was --

QUESTION:  If we simply didn't -- if we -- if we

decision would stand for nothing.  But it's not very


responsible to do that where it's very clear where there's


that there's no jurisdiction.  That's -- that's the more


serious obstacle.


MR. HUBACHEK:  Well, perhaps cert was -- was


improvidently granted.  I mean, the -- Mr. Solicitor


General has come up and said that the -- the Government is


not challenging the -- the Ninth Circuit's ruling.


QUESTION:  Did you argue in the Ninth Circuit


that there was jurisdiction? 


MR. HUBACHEK:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Then I take it you certainly don't


take a different position here. 


MR. HUBACHEK:  No, certainly not, Mr. Chief


Justice.


QUESTION:  But our remedy would not be to


dismiss the writ.  Our remedy would be to vacate the


judgment of the court of appeals if the court of appeals


did not have jurisdiction. 


QUESTION:  You don't want that. 


MR. HUBACHEK:  No, I don't.

 MR. HUBACHEK:  With respect to the -- the --


with respect to the Fifth and Sixth Amendment claim that


we've made, the Second Circuit has also found a different


theory under which the -- the Court could find a Brady


violation, and they've indicated that the failure to turn


over Brady information is essentially otherwise


impermissible conduct under the Brady v. United States


case.  So, Mr. Chief Justice brought up Brady v. United


States, and I think that the Ninth Circuit's analogy to


Hill v. Lockhart and the Miller v. Angliker impermissible


conduct approach has both addressed the concern that


United States v. Brady would preclude. 


QUESTION:  But -- but, you know, to say we'll


just call it impermissible conduct because we want to get


it done isn't very satisfactory.  I mean, you have to say


why it's impermissible.


MR. HUBACHEK:  Right.  And our -- our point is


-- is that it's impermissible because the Fifth and Sixth


Amendments together protect the innocent from conviction. 


When the Fifth Amendment right to receive the information


-- excuse me.  When the Sixth Amendment right to have


counsel find this information attaches, then the Fifth


Amendment right to have the Government turn it over should


also attach because the same source of unreliability would


be present if, in fact, the defendant were to make the

decision to plead guilty without receiving material


exculpatory information. 


QUESTION:  But in order to make that argument,


as I understand it, you have to make an unreliability


argument divorced from a materiality argument.  Do you


agree?


MR. HUBACHEK:  No.  No, I don't because there is


a materiality requirement in Hill v. Lockhart. 


QUESTION:  How do we judge that materiality at


-- I mean, in Hill and Lockhart, when -- when you're


dealing with counsel, you can at least say, well, if -- if


they had been aware -- regardless of how the case would


have turned out, there's a way in which it makes sense to


say that if they had been aware of this kind of evidence,


they would have said we're going to trial.  We're going to


roll the dice.


When you're dealing with -- with essentially a


-- a Brady rule, you're not dealing with a will they roll


the dice or will they not kind of question; you're dealing


ultimately with the question of what was its effect on the


-- the soundness of the verdict, the soundness of a


result.  And the only way you can make that judgment is to


know everything that would be in the case.  In a sense


that's easy in a Brady situation because you're looking


back.  Here you can't look back.

 So, it seems to me that you've either got to


come up with an entirely new materiality or prejudice


standard, and the -- and the effectiveness of counsel


cases don't seem to me quite on point there.  Or you've


got to dispense with a materiality standard entirely and


say anything that would have had any tendency to exculpate


or to impeach in a way favorable to the defendant, if


denied, supports in effect a -- a claim for relief, which


is a nonmateriality standard. 


MR. HUBACHEK:  Well, Justice Souter, on page 16


of our brief, we have a block quote from Hill v. Lockhart,


and I really think that the test that was discussed in


Hill v. Lockhart covers the -- the concerns that Your


Honor is mentioning today.  And ultimately Hill v.


Lockhart concludes by saying that in -- in the case of


counsel failing to discover material exculpatory


information, which is essentially the same type of problem


that we're talking about here, it says that ultimately the


assessment will depend in large part on a prediction


whether the evidence likely would have changed the outcome


of a trial. 


Now, I certainly agree that it will be a more


difficult assessment to make without there actually having


been a trial, but we're asking that Your Honors adopt a


rule in which you would be -- the courts would undertake

exactly the same analysis that Hill v. Lockhart already


requires in the context of defense counsel failing to find


a piece of exculpatory information.  And -- so, we're not


at all asking that this analysis --


QUESTION:  But that is a different -- I mean, it


necessarily is a different standard from the Brady


standard of materiality which we have now.  Is it not?


MR. HUBACHEK:  Well, the Brady standard for


materiality, as was explained in Kyles, derives from


Strickland.  Hill v. Lockhart also derives its materiality


standard from Strickland.  So, I think it's --


QUESTION:  Well, let's go back to my question. 


They -- they may have a common ancestry, but in fact they


are not identical tests because they are applied in


circumstances that are by definition very different. 


MR. HUBACHEK:  Well, I -- I think that it's an


easier application post trial, but it's still the same


test that -- that's -- that we're being asked to apply in


the plea situation because Hill v. Lockhart says, look, if


counsel doesn't find the key piece of evidence and you


plead guilty, then we're going to go back and look and


see, well, what would have happened at a trial if you had


that key piece of evidence.  If there's a reasonable


chance you would prevail at trial --


QUESTION:  And in -- and in order to do that

intelligently, we've got to know what the trial would have


included, won't we?  And that either means, number one,


that the disclosure has got to go to, in effect, the


inculpatory evidence, or it means at the minimum, number


two, that the State has an opportunity to come in and say,


we'll tell you what the inculpatory evidence would have


been.  This is what we would have put in, and judged in


this context, it's not material.


One way or the other, either -- either the


necessary implication of your test or the -- the


implication that the State would have a right to respond


to it, it seems implies that in order to apply your rule


before trial, a -- a court, reviewing one of your claims,


would have to make a judgment about the -- the


significance of the evidence in the context of -- of an


entire trial, a whole evidentiary record that can be --


that can -- can be anticipated.


MR. HUBACHEK:  And that's the same approach that


Hill v. Lockhart requires.  But a prosecutor in making the


determination --


QUESTION:  Except in Hill it's easier because we


know that trial decisions are -- are often made without


knowing what the result would be.  They are decisions to


go ahead and have a shot at defending the case, and that's


a different -- that's a different standard from Brady

MR. HUBACHEK:  Hill is a plea case.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Hubachek.


General Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. OLSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


What the respondent is proposing and what the


Ninth Circuit adopted is an unworkable and undesirable


rule to solve a nonexistent problem.  And it's illustrated


by the facts of this case.  The footnote or the -- the


pages in the respondent's brief cite some cases in which


theoretically it might be that some driver who crossed the


line earlier might create a problem, but that is not this


case.  And there's no empirical evidence or any other


evidence in the record that would show that there's a


significant problem here.  The --


QUESTION:  Mr. Olson, would you address again


the jurisdictional problem here?  I mean, if -- if in fact


the district court judge had discretion about what


sentence to impose and could have -- and did exercise that


discretion, do we have to be concerned about --


MR. OLSON:  I think that is not an easy


situation, but I think that the Ninth Circuit believed


that however inartfully the district court expressed it or

incompletely the district court expressed it, that the --


that the district court was saying it didn't feel that it


had the capacity or the ability under the law to depart,


that it didn't have the discretion to do so.  That's what


the Ninth Circuit decided.  We argued otherwise to the


Ninth Circuit --


QUESTION:  I guess this is not a proper case


could mean that, I suppose.  I wouldn't put it that way,


but it could --


MR. OLSON:  It could mean that.  That's how the


Ninth Circuit -- Circuit perceived it.


QUESTION:  I'd even attempt not to say anything


about it, so long as I was not certain that there was no


jurisdiction. 


MR. OLSON:  We -- we believe that we -- after


looking at it carefully, we've decided that the Ninth


Circuit probably was right under the circumstances,


although you could argue it the other way, and that this


-- this is an issue that is presented clearly with respect


to the -- the legal standard that's been adopted to the --


by the Ninth Circuit and which is in play today. 


The -- the respondent says, well, pleas are


proceeding apace in California notwithstanding -- or in


the Ninth Circuit, notwithstanding the decision in this


case.  There is no evidence in the record to suggest that

this hasn't created a problem, and in fact, I'm informed


that there are cases that have not been brought and cases


that have been dismissed because of a concern about


complying with the rule in this case, because once that's


done, those cases are -- are potentially over with.  But


the fact is there's no evidence either way. 


Justice Breyer, you raised some questions about


whether we would be constitutionalizing a rule which would


change Jencks and change the discovery rules.  There --


there -- on page 26 of the Government's brief, we talked


about the fact that there have been efforts to change and


accelerate the discovery requirements and that those have


been soundly rejected for the very reasons we've been


talking about here.  And the Jencks standard is what it is


because there's very much concern over the safety of


witnesses when those statements are produced earlier in


the case.  And that's -- Congress has made that decision


quite consciously that those statements don't have to be


produced until the witness is actually called in trial for


that reason.


Let me finish by saying that with respect to


Hill v. Lockhart, that's a case involving a requirement


that a defendant have, under the Sixth Amendment,


competent counsel within the range of -- of competence


expected for counsel in criminal cases.  That's a Sixth

Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.  It is


not a -- a constitutional right to effective assistance of


the prosecution in deciding whether to plead guilty or


not.


What we have in this case is a rule which is not


required, which -- which would cause considerable


problems.  It would undermine the plea bargaining system,


which is important to the administration of criminal


justice in this country, and affect the finality of guilty


pleas, which is an important consideration as well.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, General


Olson.


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
