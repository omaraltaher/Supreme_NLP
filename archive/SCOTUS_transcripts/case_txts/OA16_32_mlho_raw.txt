CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

today in Case 16-32, Kindred Nursing Centers v. Clark. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Pincus. 

 

            

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

To determine whether a power of attorney 

   

 

 

 

 

confers authority to enter into an arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement, Kentucky applies the rule different and more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demanding than the rule for determining whether a power 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of attorney confers authority to enter into contracts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally. 

            

The question in this case is whether the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Arbitration Act precludes Kentucky from erecting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the special obstacle to enforce arbitration agreements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

signed by an attorney-in-fact.  To ask that question, we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe, is to answer it.  That's the very reason that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress enacted the FAA, to prevent discriminatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules targeting arbitration agreements. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose Kentucky had a 

  

 

 

 

 

statute providing that an attorney-in-fact lacks 

 

 

 

 

 

authority to do a -- a -- a number of things:  Convey

real property, move the principal's residence out of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state, invest in foreign real estate, a few more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples like that, or sign an arbitration clause --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

arbitration contract.  That's -- that's not this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute, I know. 

   

            

But at -- at some point, can arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clauses be included in a -- in a list of items that must 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be given special attention? 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  At some point they can, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  And I think the dividing line -- the statute, of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course, refers to rules that apply to any contract. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This Court has talked about contracts generally.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think that -- that means that the rule has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply to every single contract no matter what. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If the rule takes its meaning from a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

characteristic other than arbitration, to give an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, if a -- if a State had a law that said all 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

consumer contracts have to be in at least 10-point type, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surely the court -- the State could apply that law to an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration agreement associated with a consumer 

   

 

 

 

contract. 

            

The problem, obviously, arises if there's 

 

 

 

 

 

some gerrymandering that puts arbitration in a special 

   

 

 

 

 

 

category.  And -- and we think the rule here fails for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

several reasons, one of which is even the categories

that the State court said it was erecting really don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

hold up based on the objective evidence.  But also more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

importantly, the reason that arbitration was included in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this category is the very reason that the FAA forbids, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is the conclusion by the State that arbitration --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an arbitration contract is especially onerous, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore, should be classed with other especially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

onerous contracts.  That's exactly what the FAA was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

designed to prevent.  So that's the -- the problem here. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how about a different 

   

  

 

 

 

example, but more related in my mind right now. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Under Kentucky law, let's say, the power of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney requirements are strictly construed.  That was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

one of the principles that the court below used to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret at least one of the contracts.  And as a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general matter, it states that the State requires 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

express consent to confer power to waive any fundamental 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional right. 

 

            

Would this general principle be preempted by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the FFA -- by the FAA? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Well, let me distinguish 

  

 

 

 

 

between those -- those two general principles, Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor, if I may. 

   

 

              

I think a principle of strict construction, 

   

 

 

 

fairly applied across a wide category of contracts

probably is something; in other words, if it applied to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all powers of attorney probably is something that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pass muster under the FAA, again, recognizing that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court would have to take care that that notwithstanding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the general rule, there wasn't some 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination-in-fact against arbitration. 

 

 

              

I think the question about a fundamental 

   

 

 

 

rights line, let me answer that in two ways. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First of all, in this case, we don't believe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that's in fact what happened because we think there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are a number of fundamental rights that are not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorized in the group that the State court mentioned. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And, in fact, what the State court did was identify four 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or five especially onerous examples of intrusion on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental rights and say they -- these are all like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration.  It didn't say all fundamental rights, for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

example.  Foreign selection clauses may waive due 

  

 

 

 

 

 

process rights.  There's no indication that they're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

covered; the right to property, et cetera, et cetera. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think -- so that's not this case.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there were a fundamental rights rule, I think the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

problem that it presents is whether that intrudes on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment that the FAA made, that arbitration contracts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are not especially onerous as other waivers of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental rights may be; and therefore, I think that

case would -- it's obviously different than this one. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The Court doesn't have to reach it, but we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

think even in that case, grouping an arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract with a contract to enter into a guilty plea or 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

something like that, I think is troublesome because it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

really puts arbitration agreements in the very category 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress said they shouldn't be in. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What about if the category 

  

 

 

 

 

 

were fundamental rights that implicate the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual's life or health, so that you would have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have an express provision giving the attorney-in-fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorization to consent to various procedures that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terminally ill person might undergo, and if this were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put in that category? 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Well, I -- I -- I just want to 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

make sure I understand your hypothetical, Your Honor. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, in this case, what's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

involved here is care for a -- a person who is unable to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look after that -- that person's own care, an elderly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person, a disabled person in a -- in a nursing facility. 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

So what if that were lumped together with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent to surgery, consent to terminate feeding, or --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or breathing for a terminally-ill patient.  All of those 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

could be put into a category that implicate life or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

health.

MR. PINCUS:  They could.  I -- I don't think 

    

   

  

 

 

 

8 

an arbitration agreement would -- would fall into that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same category of implicating life and health.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and also, I think it's important to recognize that --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, again, here the State court didn't say that all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions implicating life or health are subject to its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special express requirement.  It -- it -- it identified 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a couple of -- an abortion or adoption. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, in Justice Alito's 

  

 

 

 

 

example, just to take it a little further, suppose the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nursing home said you cannot enter here unless you sign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the arbitration agreement, and this is the -- this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the only place where this person can go for care.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brings it closer to some of Justice Alito's examples 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because now there's a danger that the care can't be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rendered. 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Well, interestingly, what 

  

 

 

 

the -- the Kentucky court held in another case, Ping, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that actually a -- the power to make health 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions would be interpreted to include the power to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enter into an arbitration agreement if arbitration were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a condition of admission.  But in this case, because it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't a condition of admission, it didn't apply that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rationale. 

              

I -- I -- I think -- I guess the distinction 

   

   

   

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

here seems to me the decisions about health that we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about; operations, medicine, are a category of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

9 

important decisions that the State has the power to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide about. 

 

            

The -- the -- the problem with the -- with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the hypotheticals is that the FAA basically says the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State doesn't have the power to treat arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreements specially on the theory that they impose some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special burden on the parties to the arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement.  And so I think a decision by the State to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

lump them together with those other decisions runs afoul 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the FAA. 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But the --

  

 

 

 

MR. PINCUS:  Again, not in this case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But the context here seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

different from the arbitration cases that we've had in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recent years.  This doesn't involve an -- an arbitration 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the amount that you were charged for your cable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bill or for your telephone bill.  This involves a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation where an elderly person needs care. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And as Justice Kennedy's hypothetical 

 

 

 

 

mentioned, it may be that the only facility that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available, or all of the facilities, require the signing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of an -- an arbitration agreement which prevents the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assertion of tort claims and the -- the elimination of

the deterrents that they provide may really implicate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the care of someone who is vulnerable.  So this seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

like something that is close to or that it falls 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

squarely within the police power of a State. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, I suppose that there's a connection 

   

   

 

 

here to interstate commerce, I don't know what exactly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is, but on the assumption that everything is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

connected to interstate commerce, I assume that this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

falls within the FAA. 

 

 

 

            

But you see the problem?  This is really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking the arbitration precedence that we have handed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down in recent years into a different category of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests. 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Well, respectfully, I don't --

   

  

 

 

 

I don't think so, Your Honor.  The -- the courts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unanimously decided the Marmet case a few years ago, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which involved this precise context:  An arbitration 

  

 

 

 

 

 

agreement in the nursing home context.  And there, one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the arguments that was advanced in -- in opposing --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in supporting the rationale that the arbitration clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't be enforced was that tort claims and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nursing home context is different.  And the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

expressly rejected that criteria. 

 

 

 

            

And I think Congress's judgment in the 

   

 

 

 

 

FAA -- and Congress has specifically looked at the

nursing home context in recent years; there have been a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number of hearings and examinations -- is that there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't a difference between deciding claims in 

   

 

 

 

 

arbitration or in court.  And the amicus briefs filed in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case, I think, recite some of the empirical data 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, in fact, in the nursing home context and in other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contexts, arbitration results for claimants are quite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

similar.  The differences are it's cheaper, the process 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is cheaper and faster. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you do with the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument that this doesn't have to do with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement of an arbitration agreement?  It goes to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of whether the agreement was ever formed or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made.  That is, if it takes outside the power of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney, the power to enter into arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreements, so it's a question that goes to making that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement. 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Well, two answers, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I -- I -- I think it does go to enforcement because 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really the question here is what the Kentucky court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said:  We are interpreting the power of attorney 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

document in a way that renders the arbitration agreement 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

unenforceable.  I don't think anyone argues that any of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other requisites of contract formation were not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present.

12 

            

But, also, this Court has never drawn a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction between contract formation and 

 

 

 

 

enforceability in applying the FAA.  And I think to do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

so would open a dramatic hole in -- in the FAA, because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it would be quite easy for a State to say, for example, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an arbitration agreement requires notarization; no other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract does.  Or an arbitration agreement, to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

properly formed, must contain a provision that allows it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be revocable at will. 

 

 

 

 

            

And so it would be quite easy to -- to -- if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formation was ruled off limits, to allow very easy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumvention of the protections of the FAA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what about the 

  

 

 

 

 

Wellner -- the Wellner documents.  As I read what the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court said in the first part of its discussion about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, it just interpreted the power of attorney as not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reaching arbitration.  So there it was just exercising 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

its ordinary powers of contract interpretation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  I think Wellner is closer to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

the -- to the issue that the court confronted in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Imburgia, whether that really was an ordinary contract 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation.  And as we've explained, the argument 

  

 

 

 

 

 

for enforcing it is that it expressly provides the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority to contract with respect to personal property. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And it's been long settled under Kentucky law that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

choses in action, clauses of action are personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

property. 

            

The court didn't apply that precedent, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that seems to us to be exactly as in Imburgia:  The -- a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation where a generally applicable rule was not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

applied in the arbitration context. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, do you think every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

time a State court incorrectly interprets a power of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

attorney relating to -- as it relates to arbitration, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that raises an FAA preemption issue? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  I think the question is whether 

    

 

 

 

 

 

the State court's decision fails to put an arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement on an equal footing, as the -- as the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has said.  I -- obviously, there's not going to be the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occasion or the ability for the Court to review all of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those decisions. 

 

              

I think in this case there's obviously a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference between the Clark situation where there was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no argument that the power of attorney was ambiguous; in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, the State court said it wasn't.  That's just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applying a new legal rule.  In the Clark situation, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

there is this question about whether or not it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguous.  But we think under -- under any reasonable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test, it -- it really can't be said to be ambiguous, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given the long-standing rule under Kentucky law and the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Following up on Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Alito's question, and I know Ping is not before us, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applying your arguments to Ping, because the author of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ping dissented in these two cases, do you think Ping is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closer to the neutral application of a contract 

   

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation? 

            

MR. PINCUS:  I do, because the -- what the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

court relied on in Ping was the absence of any general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority to contract and the fact that the broader --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all -- what Ping provided for was the ability to -- to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invest funds, the ability to make health decisions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and the ability to essentially administer real 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property.  It didn't have a general clause relating to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the making of contracts or the making of contracts with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to personal property.

I'm sorry, Your Honor. 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no.  I was going to 

    

  

 

 

 

 

say, Wellner is a little closer. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Wellner is --

that --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But it seems to me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

MR. PINCUS:  The difference in Wellner is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that Wellner does have a very broad clause that provides 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the making of contracts with respect to personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property.  And given the fact that under Kentucky law, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal property includes choses of -- clauses of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action, choses in action, it's pretty clear. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

And also in Wellner and not in Ping was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate provision that gave the attorney the power to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring and prosecute lawsuits.  So if the -- if the -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fear was that that general power to contract with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to personal property somehow didn't extend to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation, there's a separate clause with respect to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

litigation. 

            

Now, the Kentucky Court said that clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alone isn't enough because it doesn't relate to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration or to contracting, but it seems to me the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

combination of them is pretty powerful in --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

powerful --

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's a pretty 

   

  

 

MR. PINCUS:  -- explaining what's going on. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's a pretty weak 

   

  

 

 

argument that they've automatically made a special rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

for arbitration.  They looked at, will the institute

settle and conduct litigation with no mention of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

alternative dispute resolution and conveying personal 

 

 

 

 

 

property, not necessarily contracting.  There wasn't a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

general contracting clause.  So I think there's 

   

  

 

 

 

arguments on both sides of that question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

If there is, what do you suggest we do? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. PINCUS:  Well, let me take a little bit 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

of issue with -- with your -- with the predicate of your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question, because the Wellner power does say to make, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

execute, deliver deeds, releases, conveyances, and 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts of every nature in relation to both real and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal property.  So I think that is a pretty broad 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

provision that -- that was not present in Ping. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And, Mr. Pincus, may I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ask you a question about the wrongful death action, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which everyone agrees does not belong to the patient; it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

belongs to -- to the survivors.  And the same issues of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negligence on the nursing home part would arise in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patient's suit as in the survivor's suit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, who determines which one goes first? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because if the -- if the survivor's action goes first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the nursing home is found liable, wouldn't the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nursing home be bound by that in the arbitration? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  I guess that, in the first 

    

 

 

 

 

 

instance, would be a question of Kentucky law, Your

Honor.  I'm not sure how Kentucky law in arbitration 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treats prior decisions.  And I also -- since there are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different parties, I don't know whether Kentucky law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

provides for offensive, non-mutual estoppel.  So I guess 

   

  

 

 

 

 

17 

those would be the questions that would arise in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context. 

            

Of course, the Court has said most recently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the KPMG case that the fact that there are claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that could be bundled together doesn't mean that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ones that are subject to an arbitration clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't be sent to arbitration. 

 

 

 

 

            

So just to -- to sort of return to first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles and -- and to elaborate on my answer to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor's question, I -- there are two -- two 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinct issues in this case.  One is the general 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

express reference rule that the Court announced and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied with respect to Wellner in particular.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule obviously also applies to the Clark power of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney -- I mean, applied in Clark with respect to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wellner power of attorney. 

 

 

 

            

There's the second question about whether 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the language that -- that I quoted is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiently clear that a decision by the State court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it is ambiguous triggers the same kind of a concern 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Court identified in Imburgia as -- as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

indicating that this is really a special rule targeting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

arbitration, as opposed to the application of a neutral 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle. 

            

Unless the Court has any further questions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'll save the remainder of my time for rebuttal.  Thank 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SALYER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Kentucky is a common law State in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

development of its power of attorney interpretive law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is not a uniform power of attorney act State. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Therefore, over time, the Kentucky Supreme Court and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower courts of Kentucky developed Kentucky's 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretive rules regarding powers of attorney case by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, again, over time.  And -- and this is the rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Kentucky Supreme Court has established in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case below.  The power to waive generally fundamental 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional rights must be unambiguously expressed in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the text of a power of attorney. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Now --

19 

to anything other than arbitration agreements? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. SALYER:  Is -- is there anything? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there an explicit 

  

 

 

 

 

reference -- to be effective, you've just told us, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power of attorney has to explicitly state the -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disputes will be settled by an arbitration. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

My question is whether there is any other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract that in order to be made effectively in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kentucky, it must be an explicit reference in the power 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of attorney. 

 

            

MR. SALYER:  Oh, I -- I understand your --

   

   

  

 

 

 

your question, Justice Ginsburg. 

 

 

 

            

From -- this is the announcing of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular rule, but logically, from here on out, any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such actions taken by an -- a -- an attorney-in-fact 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that might restrict the principal's free speech rights, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, by entering into a contract with a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

non-disparagement clause or some sort of confidentiality 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause, that would necessarily have to be spelled out in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a power of attorney. 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  In other words --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In other words -- in other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

words, for a number of years Kentucky had allowed powers 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of attorney and the first time that one was called into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

question under this theory was with reference to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration. 

20 

            

MR. SALYER:  Well, Your Honor, here --

  

 

 

 

 

 

here's the thing about Kentucky powers of attorney.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has been the law of Kentucky since 1912 that powers of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney are to be strictly interpreted and that the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the third party deals with the principal by an agent at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that third party's own peril.  Therefore, it is up to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and incumbent upon that third party to be very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear and understand what the agent is allowed to do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And -- and -- and the fact is that it is -- the reason 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that these cases have not come up is that the third 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties, the -- the banks, the -- the whatever that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are -- are receiving powers of attorney as authority of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agents for principals, they've always demanded very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explicit information in that power of attorney. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And this happens to be an instance where you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the third party who doesn't -- who doesn't actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want more explicit language in the power of attorney. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Have I answered your -- your -- yes, sir. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So in Kentucky, I issue a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

power of attorney to Jones and say, you have full power 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to protect, defend and maximize the value of all my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property.  Okay.  That's what it says. 

  

  

 

 

 

            

MR. SALYER:  Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE BREYER:  And someone claims that 

  

 

 

 

 

this piece of land over here that we thought belonged to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

Smith belongs to him under various deeds.  All right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. SALYER:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, the -- the attorney 

  

 

 

 

 

 

says, in my opinion, I want this tried before a judge 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because I think I'll get a fairer shake.  Okay. 

   

   

  

 

 

 

Illegal; right? 

 

            

MR. SALYER:  Are you making the distinction, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Your Honor, between --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you just said 

  

 

 

 

 

anything that waives the right to a jury is illegal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless it's explicitly there.  So, that's case one. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Case two, similar kind of argument, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyers for the two parties get together and say, we'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like to settle this case.  Illegal; right?  No power, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they can't do it in Kentucky.  Can't settle cases. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Can't have traces -- cases tried before a judge.  Is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that right? 

 

            

that --

 

            

MR. SALYER:  No, Your Honor.  That --

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, that's not right.  Oh, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

I see.  In other words, you -- you -- you -- why -- why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't it right?  Because after all, the fundamental 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

right of trial by jury is being -- you're giving the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

attorney the power to refuse to have a jury. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. SALYER:  Well, Your Honor --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So what's the difference 

  

 

 

 

 

22 

between that and the case we have, where we're not going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to have a mediator, we're not going to have settlement, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're not going to have a judge trial, we're going to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have an arbitrator. 

 

 

            

MR. SALYER:  Your Honor, the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

interpretive rule that the Kentucky Supreme Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enunciated was the power to waive generally fundamental 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional rights.  The -- the idea that -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the person is going to waive their jury rights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in -- in general from now on --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  All he did was say that in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the attorney's judgment, if he wants to go to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration and thinks that's best, he can do it.  Now, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I just don't see the difference between that and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implying, in the attorney's judgment, if he wants to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settle a case, rather than going to a jury, he can do 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  Or, if in the attorney's judgment, he would like a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case tried before a judge instead of a jury, he can do 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  And you're going to tell me that that's ridiculous 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to think that a general power of attorney would give the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney the right to say, no jury, judge trial.  No 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury, mediator.  Oh, but it makes perfect sense to say

23 

            

Now, if you're not going to tell me that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those are treated exactly alike, I will tell you in my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion right now you have discriminated against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration --

 

            

            

difference. 

            

MR. SALYER:  Well, Your Honor --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Unless you can find some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. SALYER:  It seems to me that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

analogue to what you're -- you're proposing would be an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance where the -- the attorney engaged with another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party never to have a jury trial with that party 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pre-dispute just for a -- for from now on.  Or that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're always going to go to mediation and never go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, that isn't this.  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

say that a attorney -- I'll be repeating myself.  I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

testing out whether it's really true.  Of course I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

highly suspicious as you can tell from my tone of voice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What I really think has happened is that Kentucky just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't like the Federal law.  That's what I suspect. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

So they're not going to follow it.  Now, that, of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course, you're going to say, no, they would never do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  So I'm trying to test this out.  And that's why I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked my question.  Because it seems to me that

arbitration as a means of settlement of a case, of a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute, mediation as a means of settling a dispute, a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

24 

judge as a means of settling a dispute, are equally and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

no different in the respect that none of those three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involves a trial by jury. 

   

 

 

            

So I just want to know -- and you have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already said, no, no, they're all different.  Well, that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to me proves that they're treating arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specially.  So I put my whole argument there because I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

want you to have an opportunity to reply. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SALYER:  Thank you, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

              

I -- I think that the -- the -- the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction that -- that would be made there is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're -- we're talking about an agreement that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pre-dispute and waives a -- this particular right 

   

 

 

 

 

 

vis-à-vis the nursing home resident and the nursing home 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potentially in perpetuity. 

 

 

            

And I guess the analogue to -- to a --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

coming to an agreement to settle pre-dispute would be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liquidated damages clause.  And I think that the -- that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Kentucky Supreme Court probably would not look very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favorably on an attorney-in-fact executing a liquidated 

   

 

 

 

 

damages clause with a nursing home to settle any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

potential personal injury that occurred at -- during the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nursing home resident's stay.

But I -- I actually want to get to -- to, if 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

I could, to a more overarching point in -- in this case; 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that is, the Federal Arbitration Act does not extend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court's powers of interpretation beyond agreements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to arbitrate.  Moreover, DIRECTV was the exception that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

proved the rule, and the rule applies here.  Excuse me. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This Court does not ordinarily instruct 

 

 

 

 

 

States in how to interpret the instruments and documents 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are governed by State law.  Now --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And maybe I missed 

   

  

 

 

 

your -- missed your point.  The FAA does not extend 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond what? 

 

            

MR. SALYER:  Agreements to -- beyond 

  

 

 

 

 

agreements to arbitrate and --

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Interpret --

  

 

 

 

interpreting them or anything with respect to them?  For 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, you're not arguing that if Kentucky had a law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying you can't have agreements to arbitrate, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would certainly be covered by the FAA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SALYER:  Yes, Your Honor, that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

that -- well, we believe, would be covered by the FAA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- and if that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was a decision of a court that said, under our common 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

law you can't have agreements to arbitrate, that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also?

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. SALYER:  Totally not.  That's what the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Federal Arbitration Act is directly directed at. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, since we're 

  

 

 

 

 

talking about laws that have an impact on agreements to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26 

arbitrate, I guess I don't understand the effect of your 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

principle. 

            

MR. SALYER:  Well, we're looking at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

black letter of Section 2, which provides that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreements to arbitrate shall be valid, irrevocable, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revocation of any contract. 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

  

 

 

MR. SALYER:  That pertains specifically to 

  

 

 

 

 

arbitration agreements.  And so what do we have here? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We have an absence of authority of the signator to this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration agreement.  That certainly should qualify as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a -- a ground for revocation of any contract, absence of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority. 

            

So that is as far as the Federal Arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act extends.  It extends to the enforcement of formed, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existing arbitration agreements.  It doesn't bootstrap 

  

 

 

 

 

them into place by -- Section 2 creates substantive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract rights, certainly.  The presumption of 

  

 

 

 

 

arbitrability in certain instances, the preemption of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State law in certain instances.  What it does not create

are other kinds of rights, such as the right -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27 

entitlement to the creation of agency in someone else's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency instrument. 

 

            

            

Have I answered --

   

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So -- and your reasoning, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I take it, that Kentucky could adopt a law that says 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agents lack authority to enter into arbitration on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behalf of the principal. 

 

 

 

            

MR. SALYER:  Well, technically, Your Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

that's correct.  However, this Court would not have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go that far in this particular case, because again, what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're talking about is interpreting a power of attorney. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And if you -- if you take a look at -- let's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use a comparison, the -- the spectrum of Volt on one end 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and DIRECTV on the other end.  We have instances where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court in Volt said that ordinarily, issues of State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract law interpretation are for the States.  And it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accepted the -- the lower California court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation of that -- that particular California 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract, even though it -- it meant that there was not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to be an arbitration.  On the other hand, in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

DIRECTV, the opposite occurred. 

 

 

 

            

And now what's really the difference there? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The difference there is where the decision maker has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effectively abandoned its interpretive role.  In

DIRECTV, one could certainly say that the California 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appellate Court in that case had abandoned its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretive role and rather imposed its own policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 

interests and -- and predilections on that -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract. 

            

To use another example -- now, this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

slightly different because it would fall under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10(b)4 deference standards -- but the difference between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Stolt-Nielson on the one hand and Oxford Health on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other.  You have an instance where an arbitrator simply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed a policy decision on its quote-unquote 

   

 

 

 

 

"interpretation of the contract," and in which case the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitrator had gone outside of his express powers under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that contract, and Oxford Health, where, even though 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was some suspicion that the arbitrator had gotten 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his or her interpretation of the agreement wrong, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonetheless, that arbitrator was attempting to interpret 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that arbitration contract, and this Court respected 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

Now, again, I understand that that was under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the 10(b)4 analysis.  But if you look in this case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clark refers to all contracts.  And I think my friend, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Pincus, is probably relying on a literal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation, well, all contracts means -- means all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts.  But we must recall that in Volt v. Leland 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

Stanford, what we had was also a potential literal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation, the Law of the place.  The law of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place, in that instance, the place being California, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, what is the literal law of that place?  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

law -- the law of that place is the law of the State of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California and Federal law. 

 

 

 

            

But the California court had determined that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the local understanding of the local usage of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phrase -- phrase, "law of the place," actually just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referred to California State law. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can I talk about --

   

  

 

 

 

 

focus a little bit on -- on Wellner.  What is your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

response to Mr. Pincus's argument that personal property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does include arbitration because choses in action are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal property? 

 

            

MR. SALYER:  Well, the -- my response to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kentucky Supreme Court certainly engaged in trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand the intentions of the words that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principals meant.  And it simply said that a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

principal -- no principal who grants the power to their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

son, their daughter, their -- their spouse, their --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their attorney-in-fact to buy and sell property or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engage in contracts involving property would ever think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about -- would allow that -- that attorney-in-fact to

engage -- engage in one of these arbitration agreements. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

            

In that -- in the earlier case regarding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

powers of attorney in Kentucky -- and that was -- I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe it's U.S. Guarantee & Trust.  It's an older 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

case, from -- from 1912.  The -- there's language to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect of giving the power for an agent to buy or sell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property does not intrinsically give that person the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the power to mortgage property, although one could say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that should naturally flow from -- from the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overarching language.  So that's the -- the sort of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

backdrop and context in which the Kentucky Supreme Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is operating. 

 

            

If I could turn for a second to DIRECTV, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

which is a -- obviously relied upon, to a large extent, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

by Kindred.  In that particular case, I think that this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court reiterated its basic assumption that ordinarily, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what a State instrument means is a question for State 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

law in the State courts.  And only in exceptional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances will this Court engage in a preemption, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and in essence, an independent review and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reinterpretation of that State instrument. 

 

 

 

 

            

And in DIRECTV, the two similar points that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seem to -- to stand out are that that California 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appellate Court singled out arbitration, singled out the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Arbitration Act for not incorporating Federal

Arbitration Act preemption into the way they read their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31 

California contract, the DIRECTV contract.  And they did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

so without attempting to tie that effectively to what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the parties might intend in the DIRECTV contract. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Here, we do not have that.  We have the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kentucky Supreme Court announcing an interpretive rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- and it may be difficult for them to -- to work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it out over -- over time, but again, that's the way the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common law develops, that if you have a general waiver 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a fundamental constitutional right by a power of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

attorney, that has to be spelled out in the document. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  We give the power of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

attorney to manage my patent, general.  A lot of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation.  The other side comes in and says, okay, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we'll settle.  I'd like you to sign this paper, and this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says what you will say and what you won't say about my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent.  Absolutely normal.  What you will say about 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

your patent, what you won't say about it in certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

areas.  Can't do that in Kentucky, huh?  Free speech. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Free speech. 

 

            

MR. SALYER:  Your Honor, Mr. Justice Breyer, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I think that's correct. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Can't -- can't give a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

power -- general power of attorney that will allow a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person to settle a patent case on perfectly ordinary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

terms. 

            

MR. SALYER:  Well, it doesn't make a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

difference --

 

32 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there any case that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

suggests that -- except this case, which happens to deal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with arbitration. 

 

            

            

MR. SALYER:  Well, it does have to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You see, I don't know how 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to -- the part I don't know how to deal with your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument is, is you say every time I think of examples 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that would be very weird, which is what I'm trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do, then -- then you say, oh, well, yeah, that's right. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You can't do that anymore in Kentucky.  And every time 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you say that, the law of Kentucky in terms of attorneys, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

powers of attorney is getting more and more peculiar. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's why I suspect something is going to happen there. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

So what should I -- what do you think? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. SALYER:  Well, Your Honor, I think that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the interpretive rule is -- is rather explicit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now -- now we say that you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot enter into a power of attorney giving the power 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of attorney the power to enter into normal patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settlements.

settlements?  What about business settlements where, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

know, there is a perfectly normal thing where a person 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

agrees not to compete, and in agreeing not to compete, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're agreeing not to go to certain places? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

            

            

MR. SALYER:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  For that business anyway, a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

lot of constitutional rights that might infringe.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

might if you didn't waive it.  I don't know. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SALYER:  Well, Justice Breyer, I mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

that -- again, that's a -- that's a question of what 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutes a fundamental -- constitute --

   

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah. 

  

 

MR. SALYER:  -- fundamental constitutional 

  

 

 

 

right.  Now --

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What do you say about the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

competing product? 

 

            

MR. SALYER:  Right.  That would, in fact, be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

a infringement on the principal's free speech.  Indeed, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in instances where there are settlements in personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury actions, often there are non-disparagement 

 

 

 

 

 

clauses. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Right, right.  And, by the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

way, he makes a product, you know, the person who's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given the power of attorney.  And as part of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagreement, the attorney -- a disagreement with OSHA.

He agrees that OSHA can come in and inspect his plant at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

various hours of the day or night.  That kind of power 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of attorney would be illegal also in Kentucky.  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is there any State that makes that kind of power of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney illegal or requires it to be explicit somehow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you could settle an ordinary OSHA case, you could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settle an ordinary competition case, you could settle an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary, you know, patent case on fairly ordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms, and it says when you give a power of attorney to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do that, you have to be explicit?  Is there any State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other than Kentucky in this opinion that has ever held 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such a thing?  Maybe there is. 

   

  

 

 

            

MR. SALYER:  Well, Your Honor, if I could 

   

  

 

 

 

 

use a -- a comparative example from the -- the UCC, we 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know that in ongoing transactions between commercial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties under the UCC, whether a -- a contract clause is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporated into the contract, if and when it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporated, may turn on whether or not that clause is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered material. 

 

            

Now, whether or not it's -- it's considered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material is a question of State law.  And as -- as I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand, they -- that has never been challenged at --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- some instances, that would -- that will, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, cause arbitration clauses not to be incorporated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in contracts and not be enforceable because they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

considered material and they haven't been negotiated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35 

properly. 

            

What -- what constitutes a fundamental 

   

 

 

 

constitutional right is, of course, an -- an open 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question, but it does seem that certain things such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speech, marriage, religious rights, those sorts of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things cannot be dealt with on a permanent basis 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

vis-à-vis another party by an agent without the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principal explicitly authorizing them to do so. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Furthermore, what the principal has 

 

 

 

 

explicitly authorized the agent to do so is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretive question regarding this -- this instrument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And just as a -- with a State statute, what a State 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

statute means is a question for the State supreme court. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What the principals meant was encompassed within these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

powers of attorney.  Ultimately, someone has to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

determine what that is.  And I posit that that -- that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be the State's supreme court. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what about the 

  

 

 

 

 

principle that making an arbitration agreement harder to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

form than other agreements violates the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Arbitration Act.  As Mr. Pincus mentioned, the main rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is equal footing.  Arbitration we thought to be on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same footing as all other contracts.  If you make the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration agreement harder to form because you have to

have this explicit reference than other contracts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't that discriminate against arbitration 

 

 

 

 

36 

agreements? 

            

MR. SALYER:  Perhaps it does, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

But, again, our -- our position is that the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Arbitration Act does not extend beyond agreements to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitrate, such that in the -- the instance of the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the UCC example that I just used where a State decision 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

as to whether or not arbitration clauses are considered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material might make that -- might make it harder to form 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the arbitration agreement as part of the larger 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial contract.  We believe that the Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Arbitration does not speak to that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

However, there are, on the other hand, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instances where if a State specifically singles out 

   

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration to make it more difficult to form, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe that the formation -- that the FAA would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something to say along those lines.  And the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example I would like to use in that instance is the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts of Casarotto, if -- if they were slightly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different. 

            

If the Montana statute hadn't used the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language in its subsection that unless the arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause is in -- you know, on the first page in bold 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

letters, then that particular clause is unenforceable.

If they -- if that statute had simply said, we do not

Act because it's not really a formation issue.  It's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

really an enforceability issue, relieving the parties to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the contract in Casarotto of the responsibility for what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they voluntarily signed in which there was a clear 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning. 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, you say you're 

  

 

 

 

 

distinguishing formation from enforcement, but we have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two separate agreements that both been formed the power 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of attorney that's been concluded, the agent has signed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the arbitration agreement.  So it's not a question of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the formation of those agreements; it's what -- what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they mean, what is the proper interpretation of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power of attorney. 

 

 

            

MR. SALYER:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  That --

  

  

 

 

 

 

that's correct inasmuch as -- the question here revolves 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around what the power of attorney means.  If the power 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of attorney encompassed the authority for the agent to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sign this agreement, then, as the Kentucky Supreme Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, the agreement will be enforced.  If it doesn't, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then there's no agreement.  And I'm saying -- saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Federal Arbitration Act does not bear upon

answering that question; that that is a function of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

38 

State law and of the State court's interpretation of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power of attorney instrument. 

 

 

 

            

So in summation, our -- our general --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our -- our general position is that the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Arbitration Act again does not extend this Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretive powers beyond agreements to arbitrate.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

does not extend them to powers of attorney.  However, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court need not even reach out to that particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle because we are talking about interpreting a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power of attorney, which, in the ordinary course of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State instrument, is up to the State supreme court to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to make that interpretation.  And this Court will 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only step in and substitute its interpretation for that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the State supreme court in the exceptional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances. 

            

And the only exceptional circumstances that 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court has identified in DIRECTV do not apply here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Kentucky Supreme Court did not single out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration for distinctive treatment, and the Kentucky 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme Court went out of its way to tie the -- its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation of the meaning and authority of the power 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of attorney to the intention of the principal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

No further questions.

Mr. Pincus, you have ten minutes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Just a couple of quick points. 

   

 

 

 

            

With respect to the -- the question about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the FAA is limited to arbitration agreements, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it's important to note that the text of the FAA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says that arbitration agreements shall be valid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract. 

            

So it's true the focus of the FAA is on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the arbitration agreement is enforceable or not, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but there's nothing in the FAA that prohibits its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application to an antecedent agreement if that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

antecedent agreement prohibits the enforcement of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration agreement on a ground that's specific to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration. 

            

And I think that's not only true of the text 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the statutes; it's true because the implications of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that rule would be quite dramatic.  For example, a State 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could just enact a statute that says a power of attorney 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

can never be interpreted to confer the ability to enter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into an arbitration agreement either at all, which my

friend, I think, acknowledged would -- would be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

40 

problematic under the FAA or could impose all kinds of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special requirements.  It has to be notarized.  There 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

have to be warnings about the dangers of arbitration. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And surely --

 

 

            

also --

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, the State could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. PINCUS:  -- that would --

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The State could also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

enact a statute that says powers of attorney can't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

waive -- can't waive fundamental rights.  Would -- would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that violate the FAA, in your view? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  I -- I think it would present a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

more difficult question than this case.  And let me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain why and then let me answer your -- your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question, Mr. Chief Justice. 

 

 

 

              

I think as -- as some of Justice Breyer's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions indicated, the rule here doesn't, in fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

embody that principle because it is both -- it -- it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underinclusive in two respects.  It doesn't even affect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all jury waivers because --

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah.  But I mean, 

   

  

  

 

 

legislators -- legislatures often pass statutes that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underinclusive or overinclusive.  So I don't think that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

distinguishes the case. 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Well, I think the question 

   

  

 

 

 

41 

would be just how inclusive is it.  If -- if it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreted -- if it is the same kind of --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It -- it says it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

embodies the rule that the supreme -- Kentucky Supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court adopted, which is that you can't -- you can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waive fundamental rights, and like a lot of statutes, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's going to require some interpretation.  But that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all it says.  It says, you can't -- you know, they're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worried about the scope of powers of attorney, and they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say powers of attorney in Kentucky cannot waive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental rights under the Constitution. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  And -- and I -- I -- I think 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

our answer to that question would be -- although the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court doesn't have to reach it here -- that lumping 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration agreements into that category of fundamental 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights is a judgment that the FAA precludes the State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from making because the judgment --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that -- that suggests 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that the arbitration is a preferred right, and I thought 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

that the idea of the FAA was to say it can't be --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever, dis-preferred, un-preferred, you know -- but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not to put it on its own separate plane, like you can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deal with this in the same way that you could deal with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any other fundamental right.

MR. PINCUS:  Well, that's why I say it would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

be a harder question, Your Honor, but -- but I think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

the -- the critical thing is here, it's quite clear from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State court's own opinion that that isn't the rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of decision here because the State court, as the dissent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

points out, the -- the express authorization requirement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't apply to jury waivers in a host of different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances, as Justice Breyer's opinions pointed out, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it also doesn't apply to lots of fundamental --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other kinds of fundamental rights. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But how do we really know? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Are -- are you saying that a court can never announce a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally applicable rule first in an arbitration case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Well, I think it -- it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

certainly is something that should raise a lot of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

suspicion.  Can it never -- I would never want to say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never, but I do think that this aspect of the case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presents a -- a more compelling argument for application 

   

   

 

 

 

 

of the FAA than Imburgia. 

 

 

 

 

            

In Imburgia, the threshold question for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court was, does the California State courts' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation of the phrase "law of your State" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually discriminate against -- single out arbitration? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's no doubt that this rule is singling out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration.  If that's what the court --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Suppose -- well, suppose --

  

 

 

 

 

 

43 

MR. PINCUS:  -- expressly says, the question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is how broad is it singling out. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It doesn't single 

  

 

 

 

 

out arbitration.  That happens to be the issue before 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  I mean, basically, it seems to me what it's coming 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down to is you just don't believe the Kentucky Supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court when it says this is the general principle.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're saying, well, I really think you're hostile to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration because I haven't heard that principle 

   

 

 

 

 

before and this is the first one.  But you know, if --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if the Kentucky legislature passes a law that does the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same thing, I mean, are you going to be suspicious of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them too just because arbitration might be the first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time it comes up? 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  I -- I think it -- it depends 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

on the circumstances and it depends on -- on how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

badly --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Suppose -- suppose we send 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this back and we say we don't really believe you.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think you're being hostile to arbitration, and they say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, prove it.  And in five cases involving other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental rights they do what Justice Breyer suggests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they don't really have any intention of doing, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they really do it.  They say no, we're -- we're really

serious about this.  We think powers of attorney are --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are -- are special things and we have to impose special 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44 

protections.  And then it comes up here, you know, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sixth time.  They say, and arbitration too. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

What do we do then? 

 

 

 

 

MR. PINCUS:  Well, I -- I guess a couple of 

   

   

   

  

 

 

things.  First of all, I -- I do think the Court has to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make a judgment, as it did in Imburgia, based on what's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before it at the time.  And what's before the Court at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this time is a rule created in the context of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration --

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I know, but I want --

   

   

  

 

 

 

MR. PINCUS:  -- premised on --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- what I want to hear you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

talk about, usually we don't presume that State courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are acting in ways that are not in accordance with law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Actually, we usually give them the benefit of a kind of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good faith presumption. 

 

 

            

So if you're saying, well, no, they have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove it first in five other cases before we'll believe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them that they really do mean all constitutional rights, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that seems, you know, an unusual rule to apply to State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supreme courts who we usually think are acting in good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

faith and in accordance with law. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Well, I don't -- I don't know 

   

   

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

that they have to prove it.  I think this Court has to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at the objective indicia, as it did in Imburgia, as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45 

it's done in other cases, to see what -- what is really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going on in a case.  And I think even the majority below 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not -- although it said all fundamental rights, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

five instances that it identified were not general, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental rights.  Free speech, for example, was not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one.  They are the most --

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. PINCUS:  -- onerous -- I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You have to look at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's going on in the case.  So in my case where you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just have a statute, there's nothing else to look at. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So how -- how -- I still don't get why that would be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalid. 

            

MR. PINCUS:  I -- I think the question in 

    

   

 

 

 

 

that case would not be whether it's going to be applied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the category of fundamental rights.  The question in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that case would be does the FAA permit a State to make a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment that contracts with respect to arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be lumped in --

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There's no talk 

  

 

 

 

 

about arbitration.  The word "arbitration" --

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PINCUS:  No, I understand --

MR. PINCUS:  -- but -- but there still is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question, I think.  What the FAA -- at bottom, what the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FAA said to -- was reacting to was State courts saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration is especially onerous and troublesome and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46 

we're going to require -- we're going to require special 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processes if we --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We understand that. 

  

 

 

 

 

But I'm talking about a legislative proposition.  And it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't say anything about arbitration.  It just says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

powers of attorney.  You can't waive fundamental rights 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless it's expressly stated. 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  I -- I think it would be a much 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

harder case.  I don't know --

    

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I know, but 

   

  

 

 

 

the problem is -- is that it is, in terms of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law-making authority, Kentucky would say to the supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court, you know, we make these rules through the courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as we did in this case.  And I just -- I guess I just 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't see -- I -- I don't think you've -- well, you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't come up with a distinction that persuades me, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that's important because I think, as Justice Kagan 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, we have to assume the Kentucky Supreme Court is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acting in good faith. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So isn't it that -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your answer is there's nothing wrong with that statute?

MR. PINCUS:  Well, I think -- I think --

   

   

  

 

 

 

47 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And that, in fact, what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes does, whether it covers arbitration or not, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a court holds that it does cover arbitration, you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to look to see whether the other things in there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like arbitration sufficiently or there are other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that aren't covered that are like arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiently, so that you could, at the end, draw a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion that this is or is not discriminatory. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There's nothing else 

  

 

 

 

 

in there.  The -- the first time --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PINCUS:  That's exactly --

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The first time the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute is applied, it happens to be to an arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  It happens to be to this case.  But you can't say 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

oh, look in the background of it.  It's all about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hostility to arbitration.  You can't --

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Well, I -- I -- I guess two 

   

   

   

  

 

 

answers.  Just to return to this case for a minute, I --

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I don't think that's the rule that's being applied.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it's clear, because the instances of fundamental 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights that were identified were one part --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Pincus, you 

  

 

 

 

 

understand that when your first answer is, let's go to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case, that's not the most compelling response.

MR. PINCUS:  I understand, Your Honor, 

    

 

 

 

48 

but -- but I -- I -- and to answer the question more 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broadly, I -- I do think there's a -- there's a question 

   

   

   

   

 

 

 

that the Court would have to answer in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance, whether, as Justice Breyer put it more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eloquently than I did, that the -- that arbitration is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being included in that category not because of some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special characteristic of arbitration, but because 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration agreements have the same characteristics as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all of those other things --

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All right.  Well, 

  

  

 

 

 

how would you do that?  That's the position that you and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe Justice Breyer are taking.  How would you -- how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would you go about that?  How would you say we've got to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide why arbitration is being included in this? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Well, and -- I would say, as an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

advocate at least, that the problem with that judgment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that what Congress said in the FAA is, in fact, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't say that arbitration agreements should be treated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like some special category of contracts just because of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a characteristic of arbitration.  There has to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

another reason.  And what the State is doing there is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying arbitration is especially significant because of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- of a characteristic.  It waives the jury right that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is intrinsic to arbitration, and I think that conflicts

with the Federal policy. 

 

 

 

49 

            

So, yes, the State could say that with all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental rights.  My argument would be it can't do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that with respect to arbitration and -- and I might 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lose. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  If -- so the -- as I -- as 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I understand the question better, one, of course the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature could enact such a statute. 

   

 

 

 

            

Two, if we have our first case arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and they say arbitration is included among it, then what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're job is is to read the opinion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, sometimes courts don't write enough in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the opinion for us to make the decision as to whether or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not it is being discriminated against, in which case we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

send it back and ask them to write more.  So is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what we should do? 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes or no, and your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

time is expired. 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  No. 

  

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. PINCUS:  I think you have enough here. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  Thank you.  You 

  

  

  

 

 

 

can answer it. 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  I -- I think the answer is no 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

because I -- I think there's enough in this opinion. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

50 

I -- I think for the reasons indicated in Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer's question, the -- the category here doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply to all jury waivers.  So the argument that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies even to the waiver of a jury right is not true, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it doesn't apply to all fundamental rights.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples that were given are the most onerous kind --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  He cheated --

  

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  -- of contracts you can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

imagine. 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Sorry. 

  

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The case is submitted. 

 

 

 

            

(Whereupon, at 11:23 a.m., the case in the
