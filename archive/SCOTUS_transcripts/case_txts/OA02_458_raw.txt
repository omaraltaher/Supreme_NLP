CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-458, Raymond Yates v. William T. Hendon.


Mr. Holifield.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. HOLIFIELD


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Petitioners believe that a sole owner may be a


participant in an employee benefit plan if another common


law employee participates in such plan, regardless of


whether that corporation or entity transacts business as a


sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation.  This


belief is based on a plain reading of ERISA, the plan


language in question here, the statutory scheme of ERISA,


the DOL regulations and the policy considerations beside


-- excuse me -- behind such regulations. 


When ERISA was passed, it incorporated the term


employee.  This Court dealt with that term in Nationwide


v. Darden and held that the term employee includes a


common law employee.  And -- and the term participant in a


plan says if you're an employee with a right to a benefit,


then you've met the definition of participant.  In just


looking at these two terms alone, Yates was a participant

in this plan and it's the petitioners' position as such he


had the rights to enforce the rights of ERISA.


If you further read, the terms of the plan in


and of itself support this.  This was an IRS prototype


plan and the plan allowed for sole owners, sole


proprietors, partnerships, or even incorporated entities


to participate as sole owners in the plan if they covered


other common law employees. 


On top of this, if you look at the ERISA


statutory schemes, when ERISA was passed, title I


addressed many different concerns.  As I've already


explained the definition of employee and participant


specifically include the person such as Yates as allowing


him to participate because he is an employee. 

Furthermore, if you look at, for instance, ERISA


section 1103(b), that provision excludes as an exclusion


for certain aspects to the trust requirements of ERISA. 


One of those specific exclusions if -- is that some or all


employees are employees as defined in the Internal Revenue


Code, and a specific reference is made to 26 U.S.C.


401(c)(1).  And so you -- you see a pattern here that the


IRS Code and the ERISA law being congruent in its


administration of plans and a specific reference to a


definition of working employers that includes self-


employed individuals, partnerships, and -- and people such

as that. 


When ERISA was passed, title II of ERISA


specifically dealt with changes to the tax code.  It dealt


with specifically amendments to code section 401. 


Since --


QUESTION:  Mr. Holifield, I'm curious whether if


-- if we were to agree with you that the petitioner could


be considered an employee under ERISA, do we have to then


go on and address the rest of this rather complicated


question on the alienation issue and so forth, or would we


remand on that?


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  It wasn't dealt with below, was it?


MR. HOLIFIELD:  No, it wasn't, Your Honor.  And


it -- it's -- certainly I could make an argument here that


Patterson and Guidry is controlling on that matter of


anti-alienation, but that issue wasn't the particular


issue --


QUESTION:  No.


MR. HOLIFIELD:  -- raised in this Court, and --


and not addressed in the lower courts.


QUESTION:  What is the -- what is that issue? 


Because I saw some -- I'm not sure that we're talking


about the same issue.  What is the issue that you say


wasn't addressed?

 MR. HOLIFIELD:  The issue that was not addressed


in the lower courts is there is the maybe potential


conflict with the Bankruptcy Code as far as preference


laws and the ERISA anti-alienation provision. 


QUESTION:  In other words, this $50,000 wasn't


put back until the eve of bankruptcy so even if -- even if


we agreed with you that Yates can be an employee, this


$50,000 still might constitute an unlawful preference.


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Your Honor, it -- it might. 


There's certainly language, I believe, in the Sixth


Circuit opinion and the district court opinion that they


both held that had -- certainly indicated it would be


dicta that had Yates been declared a participant in the


plan, they would have enforced the anti-alienation 

provisions, but there was no specific holding on that


point.


QUESTION:  And even if there was, that's not


before us.


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  We -- theoretically we could agree


with you that he's a participant and so forth but still


say send it back for the bankruptcy issue.


MR. HOLIFIELD:  That is within the prerogative


of this Court, Your Honor. 


When title II was enacted, it was enacted with

the -- an understanding that in 1942 the Revenue Act of --


was passed that allowed shareholder employees to


participate in a plan.  In 1962, Self-Employed Individuals


Tax Retirement Act was passed and that allowed sole


proprietors or partnerships to form a Keogh plan in which


-- and whether they could participate in a plan that only


covered themselves or allowed it if it covered other


employees.


ERISA was passed in '74, and it was passed with


an understanding that these tax code provisions were


there.  When Congress was amending title II of ERISA to


amend the tax code, it did not change any of these


definitions.  It clearly allowed these sole owners, these


working owners, if you'll let me call them that, to 

participate in these plans and had Congress wanted to


exclude them, they could have.  They knew how to exclude


people. 


QUESTION:  Does it have to be a working owner? 


Could it be someone who just owns shares and doesn't work


in the business? 


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Possibly, Your Honor.  Yes.  I


mean, that is -- very rare does that occur.  Typically you


may see that in a group health plan, but not typically in


a retirement plan.  You may see those types of things, but


there's nothing to prevent that.

 QUESTION:  That -- that would be pretty far


afield from the word employee.  I mean, one could be --


for example, did -- did Yates -- he was a -- a working


owner.


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Was -- were FICA and FUTA taxes paid


for his labor?


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Yes, Your Honor.  In the terms


of -- I think the record is critical on this that he's a


common law employee.  The retirement plan in and of itself


defined compensation as W-2 compensation, which means FICA


and FUTA, as you're inquiring, was withheld.  And so as a


W-2 employee, the monies that were contributed to this


plan were based on a percentage of his W-2 compensation. 

So from a common law standpoint, just pure corporate law,


he was an employee of that corporation who was handed a


W-2 as an employee of the Yates P.C., and it was based on


that compensation that his contributions were made to the


plan.


In title IV of ERISA, there's an exclusion for


plans maintained solely for substantial owners.  And the


point I'm making, whether you look at title I, title II,


or title IV, you see references to sole owners being in


there or not -- possible ways they could be excluded, but


none of them that would prevent them from participating in

plans such as this. 


And I think if you look at that, as well as look


at the DOL regulatory scheme that has come out of this,


the DOL opinion letters report this conclusion, be that


79-08A which is in the record at J.A. -- the joint


appendix at 271 and 273, the opinion letter 99-04A at 274a


and 283a.  You see an information letter that's actually


is part of UNUM Providence brief at appendix 1, and that's


a letter from Robert Dole to Susan Hoffman.  Each of these


is where the DOL has opined an opinion that people that


are working owners can be a participant in an employee


benefit plan.  And so I think the case law on that point


is pretty clear. 


And I think where the confusion comes into play 

is this definition of employee benefit plan in a reg that


has been misread by, I believe, two circuits on that


point.  And I think just a plain reading of the reg in and


of itself shows that working owners were intended to be


included in these plans if they had another participant in


the plan.  And --


QUESTION:  Here there were a couple of other --


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  -- plan participants at all times?


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Yes, Your Honor.  The


stipulation of facts point that -- that there were always

other participants in the plan besides the working owner


since these plans were formed in 1989.


And so just for the policy reasons behind that


is I think the preambles to the reg further shed light


about the definition of employee benefit plan.  And what


the Department of Labor was weighing here was do you


really want to have working owners that are the sole


owners, sole participants of the plan, have to comply with


the ERISA burdens.  In other words, is there a need to


tell the working owner, even though there's no one else in


the plan, you need to give yourself a summary plan


description?  You need to file an annual tax return


reporting about the plan.  You need to communicate COBRA


rights for a health plan to yourself. 


Presumably if you 

created that plan, you are in a situation that you are


aware of the benefits of the plan.  But as soon as you


have one other employee, then there's a necessity for you


to communicate those rights and benefits and explain the


terms of the plan.


And that seems to be a pretty reasonable reading


of what the DOL was trying to balance here.  In their


preambles, they even said, one, there's no reason to


protect any abuse here, and secondly, that's not a good


use of our resources to administer sole owner/sole


participant plans.  And given that background, I think

that's how that reg should be read.


QUESTION:  How does it come in?  I'm -- I'm --


just if you could clarify.  This is a little --


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Sure.


QUESTION:  -- complicated in my mind. 


But basically -- so we have all the


characteristics of a plan.  Now, you have to start first


by saying that Dr. Yates is an employee of the corporation


called Raymond Yates, P.C.  And then it's not a plan,


however, because he's -- wait a minute.  It's not a plan


unless -- if there are no employees.


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And an owner is not an employee for


that purpose.


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Correct.


QUESTION:  And so we look to see.  There is


another one, and therefore, what section 25103.3 took away


under (b) -- under (c) it gave back under (b).


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Or it gave back because there was


somebody else.


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Yes.


QUESTION:  But step one of that, we had to say


that he was an employee of the corporation.


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Yes, Your Honor.

 QUESTION:  And where does step one come from?


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Well, step one is just based on 


common law and the work -- and that is what this Court


held in Darden.  If you look at that, that --


QUESTION:  Okay.  So we have to say -- we have


to find -- we have to first find that he is an employee


and, in fact, these regs don't give a definition of that.


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Exactly.


QUESTION:  So we have to appeal to the common


law to say he's -- he's an employee under common law


principles of the corporation.


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Then (b) says -- (c) says he isn't


one for purposes of ERISA, and (b) says that really wrecks 

the whole thing unless there's somebody else.


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  And that's how it works.


MR. HOLIFIELD:  Exactly, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Okay. 


MR. HOLIFIELD:  And I think if you look at --


what the -- the holding in the Sixth Circuit, I really


think it really creates some policy problems for employee


benefit plans that are -- are pretty significant.  For


instance, the holding was that there is an employee


benefit plan here which -- with the issue you just raised.

And then it said, but there's not a participant -- Yates


is not a participant in that plan.  So you have this -- I


don't know what you call it because he's been under one


plan document since the passage of the plan, since it was


enacted, and so now there's a presumption that this aspect


of the plan is governed under State law, even though


there's never been a provision provided such as that.  The


plan document is the same plan.  And you could very easily


get fiduciaries in a situation like this having


inconsistent State law claims versus Federal claims.  You


could end up having situations that really make no sense.


And one of the -- the primary purposes of ERISA


was to avoid the very issue that that would cause and that


is they wanted a uniform administrative scheme for all of 

the States and now there will be, you know, 50 States


having different regulatory provisions regarding these


plans, plus the Federal regulations.  And what if they


don't co-exist in consistent remedies?


And so I think for those reasons, petitioner is


asking that Yates be declared a participant in this plan


and remand that for further proceedings. 


If you have no further questions, I'll reserve


the rest of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Holifield.  Is it


Holifield or Holifield?

QUESTION:  Holifield.  Mr. Holifield.


Mr. Roberts, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


MR. ROBERTS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Hundreds of thousands of shareholders, partners,


and sole proprietors who work for the businesses they own


are currently covered by benefit plans that also cover


other employees.  All of those different types of working


owners are participants subject to the rights and remedies


of ERISA, just like the other employees in the plans.  And


that's clear from the text of ERISA which contains several


partial exemptions, which Mr. Holifield referred to some


of, for certain plans that cover working owners, and those


exemptions presuppose that working owners may be ERISA


participants. 


In addition, working owners have long been


eligible to participate, along with other employees, in


pension plans qualifying for favorable tax treatment.  And


ERISA was intended to harmonize with those tax provisions


and it didn't revoke the ability of working owners to


participate in tax qualified plans.

 Coverage of working owners also furthers ERISA's


purposes of ensuring that employee benefit plans are


governed by a single set of regulations, of encouraging


plan creation, and of protecting plan participants.  So


there's no question that the other non-owner employees


that are covered by plans that also cover working owners


are participants subject to the rights and remedies of


ERISA.


And if the working owners in those plans were


not also ERISA participants, they would be subject to


different regulations and have different rights and


remedies than other employees in the same plan.  They


might even be prohibited from being covered by the plans


at all, and that result would place the coverage 

provisions of title I of ERISA at war with the tax


provisions governing pension plans and with the insurance


provisions of title IV of ERISA, both of which cover plans


in which working owners participate along with other


employees.


QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts --


QUESTION:  But what if --


QUESTION:  -- what -- what is the consequence of


the Sixth Circuit decision on the tax side of this plan? 


They said for the -- the retirement portion, it can't be


an ERISA -- ERISA plan, but would -- would the tax

benefits be lost as well?


MR. ROBERTS:  No.  The -- the -- it's clear and


it's accepted in the opinions below that it is a qualified


plan for -- for tax purposes.  But it -- there's a strong


possibility that if -- if the working owner, Dr. Yates, is


not an ERISA participant under title I of ERISA, that


title I would prohibit him from being in the plan at all,


which would be a very anomalous situation because the tax


code is encouraging him to be in the plan along with other


employees.  And title I of ERISA would be prohibiting what


the tax code encourages, and if it were a defined benefit


plan, which this one doesn't happen to be, it would in


fact be insured also under title IV of ERISA which insures


plans in which working owners participate along with other 

employees. 


And in addition, allowing working owners to


participate along with other employees, as I was alluding


to before, advances ERISA's purpose of encouraging


employee benefit plans because the ability to participate


themselves gives working owners an incentive to establish


plans for other workers.  It also could create economies


of scale in plan administration and investment and it


encourages owners to monitor the plans to ensure that


they're well managed and that they're well funded. 


So for all of those reasons, the Department of

Labor has issued the advisory opinion stating that owners


can be participants in ERISA plans.  The IRS and the PBGC


share that view, and it's entitled to substantial weight.


The -- the reason that the court of appeals


reached the contrary conclusion is it misread the


regulation that Justice Breyer was discussing with Mr.


Holifield earlier.


QUESTION:  You're -- you're not saying it's


entitled to Chevron deference, just substantial weight?


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  Skidmore deference, Your


Honor, on the interpretive letter, although --


QUESTION:  Do we need deference?


MR. ROBERTS:  No.  We don't think you need any


deference, Your Honor. 


The one point that --


QUESTION:  Well, I don't know why it isn't


Chevron, but I mean, what he's referring to is the


argument about the mysterious meaning of Mead, which if


you'd like to go into it, fine.


MR. ROBERTS:  I -- I have no desire for --


QUESTION:  I just want to know what the


Government's position is in this.  As I understand it, it


is not Chevron.  You're just -- Skidmore.


MR. ROBERTS:  We're not asking -- we're not


asking for Chevron deference.  As the Chief Justice

pointed out, we think that it's --


QUESTION:  I want to know -- I don't care what


you're asking for.  You do not think it's entitled to


Chevron deference.  Is that right?


MR. ROBERTS:  We read Mead to say ordinarily --


particularly since in Christianson, the Court was


confronting an opinion letter from the Department of


Labor, I would hesitate to suggest that an opinion letter


from the Department of Labor here and a statute that is,


as far as I can tell, no different in how it treats


opinion letters, would be entitled to greater deference


than --


QUESTION:  Well, you have Udall v. Tallman, if


you want to go into it --


MR. ROBERTS:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- where it's interpreting its own


regs.


MR. ROBERTS:  That's a different -- yes.  Yes,


Your Honor.  On the question -- on the question of the


Secretary's interpretation of her regulation as to limit


the definition of employee to only the regulation itself


and to not extend to the statute, on that point the


Secretary's interpretation of her own regulation is


controlling.  That would be Udall, Auer v. Robbins, which


is also a Labor Department case.  And I think there's no

question about that as well.


One point I did want to make is that we would


urge the Court to make clear in its opinion that all types


of working owners, not just those that are common law


employees, are -- are eligible to be participants under


ERISA.  And the reason for that is that there's confusion


on that in the courts of appeals and the very reasons --


same reasons that justify the conclusion that sole


shareholders can be ERISA participants also justify the


conclusion that sole proprietors and partners who are not


common law employees, if they are working for the


businesses, may be ERISA participants. 


QUESTION:  You -- you keep stressing working for


the businesses. 


What -- what is your answer to the 

question I asked Mr. Holifield about suppose you have a


single shareholder, 100 percent owner, but that doesn't


work in the business. 


MR. ROBERTS:  As a general matter, I think that


person could not be covered as a -- a participant.  The


person might be designated by a participant as a -- as a


beneficiary or in certain circumstances designated by the


plan as a beneficiary in connection with a participant in


the plan who was an -- an employee.  But the definition of


employee for ERISA is the same definition as under 401 of


the Internal Revenue Code which is common law employees

plus self-employed individuals who are people that are


providing personal services to the business and getting


earned income.  Responds to Your Honor. 


If there are no further questions, we would ask


that the judgment of the court of appeals be reversed and


remanded.


QUESTION:  If -- I just have one question.  If


-- if we follow your suggestion for the writing of the


opinion, how do you suggest we explain and cite Clackamas


County?


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, in -- in Clackamas, the


Court followed the same approach that the Court followed


in Darden.  And the first step in that approach is to look


to the statute.


QUESTION:  Look at the statute.


MR. ROBERTS:  And so we would say Clackamas just


doesn't come in because you look to the statute.  The


statute makes clear that all the types of working owners


can be covered, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Roberts.


Mr. Troutman, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. MARK TROUTMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. TROUTMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.  Mr. Chief


Justice, and may it please the Court:

 Justice Breyer, we -- we address this issue at


the very level that you -- you talked about, that first


common law level, and we think an important distinction


should be made in this case that this case is not about


working owners.  This case is about one working


shareholder, a sole shareholder.  And we think that makes


a substantial difference when you get down to the basics


of an organization and -- and you look at the fiduciary


duties a president, a director has to a corporation and


you look at the fact that when you have one shareholder,


there's one person that that duty is enforceable by, and


that's the same person that it applies to. 


On the other hand, in this -- in this Court's


opinion in Clackamas, you had four shareholders, and no 

matter what their interests were, those shareholders all


had fiduciary rights and expectations between themselves


and all had the right to enforce those fiduciary


obligations amongst them.  So there is some element of


control that those other shareholders have when -- when


you try to separate one down. 


But here, at its basic level, Dr. Yates is


controlled by no one.  So when you start talking about


common law applications of master/servant and control,


there's no one else to apply it to.  He answers to no one


in this corporation.  So we think --

 QUESTION:  I mean, for what purpose?  If you --


suppose I set up a corporation.  I'm the sole shareholder


and I enter into an employment agreement they pay me


$1,000 a month and I'm called the president, chief cook


and bottle washer, and employee.  Now, am I not an


employee under the common law?  The common law, say, for


purposes of tort, is there not respondeat superior so that


someone who sues me can get to the assets of the


corporation for purposes of liability --


MR. TROUTMAN:  There -- there is.


QUESTION:  -- of any kind?  Is there any


difference whether I happen to be the sole shareholder or


not?


MR. TROUTMAN: 


Well, we think there is a 

difference --


QUESTION:  Which -- what is it?


MR. TROUTMAN:  -- in this case because --


QUESTION:  No, no.  What is not in this case. 


What is it in general?


MR. TROUTMAN:  Well, in general you're -- you're


correct that -- that you would be --


QUESTION:  All right.  If I'm correct in


general, then what is it about this --


MR. TROUTMAN:  Okay.  In this case and in the


Clackamas case, the Court looked at what the common law

considers an employee.  And we think when you apply common


law concepts of control in a master/servant relationship


and when you get down to breaking down and applying the


elements that are referenced in the Darden case, that all


of these -- all of these elements, when you're applying


them to Dr. Yates, will indicate that as sole shareholder


he is more considered an employer than he is an employee.


QUESTION:  When you talk about control, Mr.


Troutman, you're talking about two different people


basically.  How much control does one have over the other. 


Here there is only one.


MR. TROUTMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor, and


that's why we think that when you have sole shareholders


and when you -- and when you're dealing with trying to 

apply a control to only one, it's almost an anomaly.  And


-- and --


QUESTION:  Well, but you -- you think then that


a sole shareholder for that reason cannot be an employee?


MR. TROUTMAN:  We think that for purposes of


ERISA, when ERISA is trying to determine whether a person


is an employee and an employer and where we're not given


much guidance by the statute, we don't think these --


number one, we don't think these other statutory


provisions give us guidance with a sole shareholder.  And


we think a distinction should be made within this category

of working owners between sole proprietors and -- and sole


shareholders.  And so while in -- in the common law


context in general, an employee may constitute or consist


of an -- of a sole shareholder, when -- when you're trying


to separate that person out under ERISA and plug that


person into one of those definitions under ERISA --


QUESTION:  Why does it have to be one


definition?  Certainly Yates is an employer, but why can't


he also be an employee?  Why -- am I right that you seem


to think it's got to be one or the other?  It can't be


both? 


MR. TROUTMAN:  We think under Darden -- yes,


Justice Ginsburg.  We think under Darden that when you


apply the factors that are listed in the Darden case, the 

control, the -- the providing of the instrumentalities,


the right to direct the work of other employees, we think


that that results in this instance with the sole


shareholder of classifying him as an employer, not an


employee.


QUESTION:  Well, he is an employer.  There's no


question about that.  But why can't he be an employee for


this purpose just as he is for taxes on workers like


Social Security and unemployment compensation?


MR. TROUTMAN:  Well, I -- I guess under that --


under that scenario then we would need to look at perhaps

what the employer -- how the -- how the particular person


is acting under the plan.  And if -- if we're talking


about is he taking money out of his paycheck and deducting


-- and contributing under ERISA, perhaps he's an employee. 


Is, on the other hand, he -- exercising his -- his


investment decisions as trustee, does he then come under


the definition of employer as someone acting on his


behalf?


Or in this instance, we have the -- we have the


debt that existed for -- for many years and contrary to


the specific terms of the plan, that debt was not repaid


by a specific --


QUESTION:  But that's an issue that everyone


agrees is open, that even -- even if he's classified as an 

employee, the creditors may have priority over the plan


with respect to that $50,000.


MR. TROUTMAN:  Yes, I agree with that, but what


I was going -- what I was -- what I was leading to was


that when he failed to make those quarterly deductions


that are required by the plan, he -- that more couches him


in terms of an employer because he's the -- he's got his


employer hat on, in other words, because he's the one that


would control what deductions come out of employees' pay


or not.  And -- and we think that's the very heart of this


-- this case.  And so if he's acting in that capacity,

perhaps --


QUESTION:  If he hadn't -- if he hadn't loaned


any money from the plan, then he would be an employee?


MR. TROUTMAN:  If he hadn't loaned any money in


the plan --


QUESTION:  Hadn't borrowed any money.


MR. TROUTMAN:  Borrowed any money.  We wouldn't


be here because it would have been --


QUESTION:  No, no.  But no.  But --


QUESTION:  He'd still be something I assume.


QUESTION:  That -- that's true, but we're --


we're asking what his status is.


MR. TROUTMAN:  I understand.  But now, there's


also -- we also make the point that perhaps there can be 

participation under the plan, but that doesn't necessarily


elevate him to this protected status as a participant. 


Under the Internal Revenue provisions, he is permitted to


participate under this plan, but the IRS -- I mean, the --


ERISA distinguishes between an employer and an employee in


those -- in those definitions.  So --


QUESTION:  I didn't get your answer to Justice


Ginsburg's question.  Had -- had he not borrowed the


money, would he -- would he have been employee?


MR. TROUTMAN:  He could have possibly been an


employee insofar as -- if -- if under Justice Ginsburg's

scenario, you look at the activities of the individual


under a specific set of circumstances. 


QUESTION:  Would he be a participant in the plan


lawfully under ERISA?


MR. TROUTMAN:  We don't think so.  We think that


he --


QUESTION:  Whether or not he borrowed money.


MR. TROUTMAN:  Whether or not he borrowed money. 


Our position is that he may have been able to participate


under the plan under the Internal Revenue --


QUESTION:  But you do concede that the


Department of Labor views it differently. 


MR. TROUTMAN:  The Department of Labor does view


it differently. 


QUESTION:  Shouldn't that have some weight in


our interpretation?


MR. TROUTMAN:  We think under the Harris County


case that is entitled to the respect to the extent that it


is persuasive.  But again, the -- the labor regulations


refer to this broad class of working owners, and we think


that there is a substantial difference between sole


proprietors, sole shareholders, and these other


classifications, for instance, the General Motors line


employee who gets stock as part of his pension plan.  We


don't think that -- you know, because he's not able to

control his job, he's still at the mercy of -- of


management.  We don't think that -- that stock ownership,


no matter how fractional, gives him any -- any rights to


control or act as --


QUESTION:  What -- what about partners?


MR. TROUTMAN:  Partners would be the same way we


think because obviously you're going to have more than one


person if it's a partnership.  But a partner, you know,


owes other fiduciary duties and an individual partner is


always subject to a fiduciary duty to his other partners.


QUESTION:  A partner -- say, there are two


partners.  They could be both employees and employers of


the business. 


MR. TROUTMAN:  No.  We think -- well, no.  Yes,


we would agree that if there's two or more, that that


distinguishes the situation from this case where you have


one sole person involved.  So, yes, partners could be


employees and deemed participants under -- under ERISA.


QUESTION:  But you don't just have one person


involved.  Isn't it correct you have a corporation which


is a person and you have a human person?  So there are


really two people involved.


MR. TROUTMAN:  You do, but you only have -- but


that -- that corporation, that legal fictional entity, can


only act through a human person, and there's only one

human person to act.  Dr. Yates, as president or director,


owes those fiduciary duties to the corporation, but as


sole shareholder, you know, in essence they're owed to


him.  So he -- there's no way to enforce those back.


QUESTION:  Well, the -- you know, you're -- if


-- you can't be appealing to the common law then if -- if


we're going to get the meaning of employee from the common


law.  The common law doesn't pierce the corporate veil


like that.


MR. TROUTMAN:  No, it doesn't. 


QUESTION:  You establish a corporation and


there's the corporation and there's the employee.  And the


fact that the employee happens to be a shareholder of the


corporation would have no relevance at common law. 

MR. TROUTMAN:  That's right.  We're appealing --


QUESTION:  So you're arguing something apart


from common law, something based on what?  Based on the --


the purposes of ERISA?


MR. TROUTMAN:  Yes, based on the purposes of


ERISA and based on this Court's opinion in the Clackamas


case where -- where it looked beyond the corporate


structure of the -- of the four shareholders there.  And


-- and in the -- in the footnote it specifically said that


-- of course, we had the EEOC guidelines of control and --


and all the others, but -- but the Court went beyond the

corporate veil there to say that these four shareholders


under the common law may more likely be classified as


employers than employee, at least under the ADA.


QUESTION:  But -- but that was because the


statute was, we thought in Clackamas, silent on the point,


and the Government's argument is that the statute is


controlling here.


MR. TROUTMAN:  The Government is arguing that


the statute is different in the -- from both Darden and


Clackamas in that it indicates that employees may -- or


that working owners may participate.  Our response to that


is two things.


One, when you break it down to sole shareholders


and go back to the purposes of ERISA, you know, the owners 

of the -- employers were not who ERISA -- Congress was


trying to protect.  It was the employees.


Secondly, when you look at other provisions like


the definition of an employer that says someone working on


his -- on behalf of the employee -- when you look at


sections 1052, 1053 of ERISA that clearly seem to


distinguish between an employer and employee, we submit


there are other inferences that may be drawn that perhaps


the same person cannot function in two different


capacities under ERISA.


QUESTION:  I mean, I don't understand what -- I

thought ERISA is to protect employees --


MR. TROUTMAN:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  -- let's say, other than the owner.


MR. TROUTMAN:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  All right?  So we put some of them in


the program, and then ERISA says, and by the way, if you


have a program like that, the owner can participate in it


too just like an employee.  So that seems to be the


purpose, to make sure you have some employees, and then if


you do, you let the owners and the executives, everybody


else involved can become as participants if they're


members or former members of the organization at least. 


So if that's the purpose, how does this defeat the


purpose?  There are some other members and he wants to


participate. 


MR. TROUTMAN:  If the -- we submit that what


this doctor -- what Dr. Yates is here as a sole


shareholder is more akin to an employer than an employee


and that when you start combining his interests with those


of other employees, that you start to muddy the purpose of


the congressional intent --


QUESTION:  No, no, no.  I'm just talking in


terms of purposes.  If you're talking in terms of


language, what they say is, A, the common law would have


considered him an employee of the corporation.  B, we have

the tax code which says -- doesn't happen to throw him in


as a member or former member.  It says he's a participant


because it says he's an employee.  We have the Pension


Benefit Guaranty code which again refers to him as an


employee, and then we have the language of the reg itself


which says he's not deemed an employee for purposes of


this section, words which wouldn't have been necessary if


he fell -- didn't fall within it in the first place.  And


then it says, for purposes of this section, which


certainly suggests that it could mean just purposes of


this section, otherwise he's in it.  And just to top it,


we have that's what the Labor Department thinks.


All right.  Now, that seems like a pretty good


set of considerations.


MR. TROUTMAN:  I understand.  I -- I would say


that under title IV, Justice Breyer, also the same


language is there:  for purposes of this section.  Then it


defines a substantial owner.  So we submit the same


limiting language that's in the CFR is also in the


provisions of title IV, and -- and as the petitioner


correctly points out in their brief, title IV does not


apply here.


So we think the policies of ERISA are -- are


furthered when you separate the two and you -- you know,


where Congress has intended to -- to protect employees,

and we think when the other provisions of the statute are


examined, that -- that this one person cannot occupy these


two positions of employer and employee.


QUESTION:  But as far as the tax exempt part of


the plan, that's okay.  You agree with -- I think I asked


Mr. Roberts that question. 


MR. TROUTMAN:  You did, Justice Ginsburg, and we


don't think there's any tax effect here by this decision. 


QUESTION:  On the point that would be left over


for remand, that is in any event, this was a -- was an


unlawful preference, was that something that you raised


below?


MR. TROUTMAN:  We did.  In fact, Your Honor,


that was the very first thing we raised and that was the 

first issue we focused on and the -- the bankruptcy court


instead chose this issue to rule on and pretermitted the


determination of the other issue.  We focused on the


exception under statutory section 1144, that ERISA is not


intended to preempt other Federal laws.  That decision was


not reached by the bankruptcy court.


And we -- we also thought it important -- we're


not going after Dr. Yates' interest as an employee in this


plan.  The -- the defendants are the plan administrator


and the trustee.  Under the Bankruptcy Code, our cause of


action is against the recipient, the plan, for the

repayment of the debt not Dr. Yates --


QUESTION:  You want the $50,000 that he paid


back into the plan.


MR. TROUTMAN:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor. 


So for those reasons, we think that -- that


Clackamas did not limit us to looking at the corporate


structure, and we think that ERISA is considered to


employees.  And we think the lower courts correctly ruled


so.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Troutman.


Mr. Holifield, you have 7 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. HOLIFIELD


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. HOLIFIELD: 


Your Honor, I would just -- just 

point out just a couple quick points here, and that is,


there's nothing in ERISA that prevents a person from being


or playing or acting in multiple roles.  That was


contemplated all throughout ERISA and it's in the briefs. 


Matter of fact, there's nothing preventing Yates PC from


being the trustee, the plan administrator, the plan


sponsor, and having all those roles.  This Court in Varity


v. Howe dealt with an individual in one speech who was


part of the time held to be the employer, part of the time


held to be a fiduciary communicating benefits in the same


speech.  So those roles can happen simultaneously in

certain aspects.  And so I would point that out.


And the other thing is -- is the term employer. 


There's nothing preventing a person being an employer and


an employee.  In fact, the definition of employer says


anyone acting as an employer, a person acting as an


employer, and the definition of persons specifically


includes individual, partnerships, joint ventures,


corporations, unincorporated organizations, associations,


employee organizations, mutual companies, this -- this


huge laundry list of entities, including down to a single


person.  So I'd argue that I don't think there's a


question about a person being an employer and even if you


assumed Yates was a sole proprietor and still being able


to participate in this plan based on the other regulatory 

provisions and statutes of ERISA.


And for those reasons, we'd ask that you reverse


the decision of the Sixth Circuit and remand it for


further proceedings. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Holifield. 


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
