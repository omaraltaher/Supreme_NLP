CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-651, Padilla v. 

(10:04 a.m.) 

Kentucky. 

Mr. Kinnaird. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. KINNAIRD 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The Kentucky Supreme Court announced a 

categorical rule so restrictive of the Sixth Amendment 

that the United States Government disavows it.  The 

court held that the Sixth Amendment never provides a 

remedy to a defendant who pleads guilty to a crime on 

the false advice of his attorney that he would not be 

deported as a result. 

The narrowest ground on which this Court may 

reverse the Kentucky Supreme Court is to hold that 

misadvice claims are cognizable under the Sixth 

Amendment. 

Any advice that a lawyer actually gives to a 

defendant on whether to plead guilty is advice affecting 

criminal liability.  Such advice must meet Sixth 

Amendment competency standards.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, other advice 

-- for example, advice about whether to take the stand 

--that can have significant collateral consequences – 

you know, he might lose his job or lose government 

contracts based on what he says, is that the sort of 

advice that would be covered in -- under your position? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  I think, for misadvice, the 

test would be whether it's a material misrepresentation 

that would be material to a reasonable defendant in 

deciding whether to plead guilty, so it would --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Only plead guilty? 

Not, for example, whether it would be material to the 

defendant in deciding whether or not to take the stand? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  I think to plead guilty is 

the key strategic decision that is in the -- in the 

client's sole duty and prerogative, to make that 

decision. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Why would it be limited to a 

decision to plead guilty?  What if a decision to plead 

guilty would have lesser immigration consequences than a 

guilty verdict after -- after going to trial?  Wouldn't 

you have the same situation there? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  I'm not aware of any 

consequences that would depend on whether the conviction 

was based on a guilty plea or trial.

doesn't fully apprise the client of the situation? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  And he goes to trial? 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Right. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  I think that -- that would 

only be a Strickland claim if this Court were prepared 

to rule that going to trial is ever prejudice under 

Strickland, and there is a circuit split on that. 

But the concern of the Sixth Amendment --

JUSTICE ALITO:  But do you see a difference 

in principle between the two situations with respect to 

the issue that is before us here? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  I'm not sure that there would 

be.  Provided the Court would recognize that as 

prejudice, I think they would all be under Strickland 

claims. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do you decide which 

of the many consequences your rule would cover?  I mean,

you are now talking about a narrow ground, misadvice. 

But you are also urging that when the lawyer is 

silent on a matter that he should inform the defendant, 

that, too, is covered. 

But whichever way you do it, how do you --

you say certainly deportation is a consequence that the 

defendant should be told about. 

What about -- how do you distinguish that 

from, say, you'll lose your driver's license, you'll 

lose your right to vote?  How do we distinguish the 

consequences that count and those that don't? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Your Honor, the issue here is 

simply the legal standard that applies to any -- any 

of these claims, and it would be the same two-part 

standard under Strickland v. Washington.  So there --

there is no need to draw lines. 

If this Court is troubled by a broad rule 

and is inclined not to issue a general rule, it may 

simply recognize deportation as among the few collateral 

consequences that is so severe and so material in a high 

number of cases in which it applies that the Strickland 

claim should be allowed to go forward. 

And it can leave for another day whether 

there are other consequences that are too burdensome for 

the system to recognize.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, we can't leave that 

for another day.  I mean, we -- we have to decide 

whether we are opening a Pandora's box here, whether 

there is any sensible way to restrict it to -- to 

deportation. 

What about advice on whether pleading guilty 

would -- would cause him to lose custody of his 

children?  That's -- that's pretty serious. 

What if pleading guilty will -- will affect 

whether he can keep his truck, which is his main means 

of livelihood, or whether -- whether it would be seized 

by the government as the instrument of his crime? 

There are so many pieces of advice which 

involve legal issues that -- that counsel can provide 

advice on. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Your Honor, I think that is 

precisely why we have the contextual inquiry of 

Strickland.  And, certainly, parental termination may in 

a given case be so severe a consequence --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sure. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  -- that it would be 

material. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sure. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  But that -- most of these 

failure to advise claims will be very difficult to plead

and to prove --

Official 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If we were in -- if we 

were in the contract, civil contract situation, and 

there’s a mistake, the usual rule -- Restatement of 

Contracts -- is that the -- the question is whether or 

not it's reasonable to have the party who made the 

mistake bear the risk. 

Suppose we just had an instruction, Rule 11 

-- I recognize this is a State case -- but we had a Rule 

11 instruction, which said the only thing the court is 

going to inquire about and the only thing that was of 

relevance to your plea are criminal consequences. 

You take the risk of any misadvice, any 

misunderstanding, with respect to collateral conduct. 

That's your risk, and it's part of the guilty plea.  If 

we said that, would that foreclose this kind of argument 

in your case? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  No, Your Honor, because the 

Sixth Amendment is a source of independent rights, and 

the question is:  What is the -- the lawyer's duty as 

distinct from the court?  And the lawyer has the 

distinct duty to assess the advantages and disadvantages 

of the plea --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, then there’s no way 

the government or the court can protect itself against

the -- these consequences, and there are any number of 

them.  Suppose he doesn't advise that there’s going to 

be civil liability in tort once he pleads guilty, 

because then that's a fact that's concluded and it's 

just a question of damages.  And as Justice Scalia 

indicated, there are many, many instances. 

I just see no way for the courts to protect 

themselves against -- against this.  And -- and if the 

client, or the accused, is told that he accepts these 

risks, he can say, well, you know, there may be some 

risks I don't know about, I'll go to trial.  He just 

accepts the risks. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  That may be true for a due 

process claim, Your Honor, but the lawyer still has an 

obligation to competently represent him, competently 

assess the legal risks, and advise the client.  Those 

are fundamental to lawyering.  And Strickland --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But even -- even if we 

accept that, wouldn't a competent counsel, after telling 

him the deportation consequences, then say:  But this is 

a case where the evidence is so strong against you, I 

advise you to take the plea rather than go to trial.  If 

you go to trial, you are likely to lose and you will get 

a longer sentence.  So does it matter in the end if 

competent counsel would have said, this is a good plea,

Official 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Yes, it certainly matters, 

because that goes to the question of prejudice at an 

evidentiary hearing.  The prejudice standard is 

subjective in the sense that it must account for the 

subjective risk preferences of the defendant as between 

incarceration and deportation.  But at an evidentiary 

hearing the defendant must be able to prove that he has 

a triable case, that a rational jury could find beyond a 

reasonable doubt -- or could find reasonable doubt, 

rather, as to at least one element of -- of the offense. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Your argument has -- has an 

appeal because removal is such a harsh consequence, 

particularly for someone like your client who had been 

in the United States for a long time.  But what troubles 

me about it is the situation in which the defendant 

claims -- you know, let's say 5 years after entering a 

guilty plea or after the passage of some time – that 

misadvice was given, and the -- the attorney on the 

other side is a busy public defender who by that time 

has handled 500 cases and is unable to remember what, if 

anything, was said about the immigration consequences of 

the case; there is nothing in the file.  I mean, how are 

those cases going to be handled? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, I think that, Your

Honor, that’s no different than any Strickland claim 

that would be brought in the same time frame.  And there 

are -- remember that ineffective assistance claims are 

almost always brought as collateral attacks, and there 

are many Federal and State strictures on bringing those 

claims, including time limits.  So I don't think there’s 

anything categorically different from the ordinary 

Strickland claim in your case. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, isn't there -- isn’t 

it different in that the ordinary Strickland claim 

concerns things that happen at trial and relate to 

strategy in a criminal case, as to which the public 

defender or other defense attorney is presumably –- has 

expertise?  But what's -- what’s the answer to this 

question:  The defendant takes the stand and says:  My 

attorney said that, don't worry about it, you are not 

going to get removed.  And the lawyer says: Well, here's 

my file; I have nothing in this whatsoever about having 

said anything about removal, and I can't remember the 

particulars of every single conversation I had with this 

attorney 5 -- with this client, 5 years ago. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Your Honor, I think witness 

recollection arises in any number of Strickland claims. 

And certainly I think that the courts can resolve that 

as to whether they found -- find that he proved by a

preponderance of the evidence that -- that that 

statement was made. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I suppose 

-- before a guilty plea is accepted, the district court 

judge is obligated to go through a colloquy to make sure 

the defendant knows the consequences of accepting the 

plea.  I would suppose if you prevail that that colloquy 

would have to be expanded to include something like:  Do 

you understand the deportation consequences, if any, of 

pleading guilty? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  No, Your Honor, it would not. 

The -- that's a due process inquiry that is implemented 

by Rule 11 in the Federal courts. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's -- that's --

with due respect, that's ridiculous.  If it's important 

enough to be required to be told to the defendant by his 

counsel, surely it's important enough to be advised to 

the defendant by the court before the guilty plea is 

accepted as -- as voluntary, which includes knowing –-

knowing the consequences.  It's a very strange line you 

draw between what we are going to hold counsel to and 

what we are going to require the defendant to be advised 

of by the court. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  I don't think that's true, 

Your Honor, and the reason is that there are all manner

of strategic types of advice that counsel give that are 

no province of the district court. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, do you think it 

would be wrong for a district court to say, now, I want 

to be very careful, and I'm going to add -- let's take 

Rule 11 as the standard.  It's a Federal case.  I'm 

going to add to Rule 11.  I'm going to say, in addition 

to the Rule 11 questions that you've all answered, I 

want to make sure:  Have you been advised about 

immigration?  Have you been advised about other 

collateral consequences? 

Do you think that would be error for the –-

or inappropriate for a district judge to do? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  It would not.  It would be --

it would probably be a salutary practice, and in about 

half the States, there is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The -- the judge would not 

be exceeding his -- his commission, his authority, to 

determine just whether this is knowing and voluntary in 

the sense of knowing -- knowing the criminal 

consequences of -- I mean, in the criminal system 

itself? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  No, Your Honor.  My only 

point is it would not be required under Rule 11 or 

required under the Due Process Clause.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it seems to me a 

careful district judge would have to do this if you 

prevail. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  It -- it would be a 

beneficial practice, but if the attorneys live up to 

their obligations to properly apprise the clients, then 

that is unnecessary, because the Brady voluntariness 

standard is predicated on an assumption that the 

defendant has been competently advised by his counsel. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You were about to say 

that in many States the trial judge does inform a 

defendant who is an alien of immigration consequences. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  It's -- it’s a much more 

limited advisement.  What they tend to advise is that 

you may be subject to immigration consequences.  But 

they don't actually make any determination.  And, again, 

that goes to the difference between the function of the 

counsel and a court.  The court is not aware of the 

defendant's circumstances.  It does no investigation of 

the case.  Counsel does, and counsel is the only one 

that actually advises you whether to accept the plea or 

not.  And that's the key distinction between a court --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but that's -- I 

don't see why that doesn't apply to the more fundamental 

question about whether the district court has to inquire

into the plea circumstances in any event.  I thought --

your answer to Justice Scalia that, oh, well, all sorts 

of things can come up at trial and the district judge 

doesn't have to inquire into those, I think proves too 

much.  It goes to -- and it departs from your focus on 

the guilty plea.  That's all the judge is inquiring 

about.  And I don't know why that obligation doesn't 

extend to a fundamental piece of information that 

would -- that would, under your theory, make acceptance 

of the plea involuntary. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Your Honor, I am not 

departing from the focus on the guilty plea.  The 

distinction is that the counsel has a duty to recommend 

whether the defendant accepts the plea or not.  And he 

cannot do that by simply focusing on -- in isolation, on 

the criminal consequences. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but what 

you’re saying is he has got to tell him all the stuff 

that’s necessary to make the decision to accept the plea 

knowing and intelligent, voluntary.  And I thought that 

was pretty much what the district court was doing when 

they have the colloquy.  That district judge wants to 

make sure the defendant knows what he is agreeing to. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  No, Your Honor.  I think that 

the -- the touchstone for the attorney's advice is

whether it's in the interests of the client.  And his 

duty is to inform the client -- and this is true of all 

lawyering -- to inform the client of the legal risks of 

the recommended course of action.  And if the law 

happens to attach the most dramatic and severe 

consequences under a civil law, but to attach them to a 

conviction, then -- and that consequence can only be 

averted in the criminal prosecution, I believe it is the 

duty of the criminal lawyer to advise.  But at a --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I would think that the duty 

of the criminal lawyer is to make sure that the 

defendant's guilty plea is informed, it is an informed 

guilty plea.  That is the same obligation of the court 

in the colloquy, to be sure that it's an informed plea. 

And if you say it's uninformed for counsel not to go 

into the myriad collateral consequences, then I assume 

it's -- it's improper for the court not to go into those 

consequences.  They both pertain to whether the guilty 

plea is informed.  That's counsel's responsibility. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Your Honor, I believe that 

counsel's responsibility is to ensure that he makes an 

informed strategic decision whether to plead guilty. 

That is no business of the court's, and I think that is 

the distinction.

MR. KINNAIRD:  For a misadvice claim? 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, assume that advice is 

inadequate -- to prove prejudice. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  First of all, what you would 

have to prove on the competency prong is that the 

misadvice was about an issue that was material to the 

strategic decision to plead guilty.

MR. KINNAIRD:  At the prejudice prong, you 

would you have to prove that this defendant -- and this

that a rational jury could have found beyond a -- could 

have found reasonable doubt as to at least one element

the prosecution case either.  You don't know exactly 

what witnesses they are going to call, what the strength 

of it is.  So you don't know whether there is going to 

be prejudice or not.  When you see -- it seems to me you 

have to make quite a prediction about what the case is 

going to look like to decide if there’s prejudice, to 

decide if the fellow is going to take the plea or not. 

And I'm just wondering how you do that. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, Your Honor, I think in 

these kinds of claims prejudice is generally going to 

require an evidentiary hearing.  And that’s why the 

Kentucky Court of Appeals sent this back for an 

evidentiary hearing.  But this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's -- it's going 

to require, I guess, kind of a mini-trial to decide if 

the person would have taken the plea.  You've got to 

know what the case -- his case looked like, what the 

prosecutor's case looked like, to see if it's something 

he would have made -- it would have made sense for him 

to go to trial or not. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  I don't think it would 

necessarily require a mini-trial, but that would be in 

the trial court's discretion. 

I would like to point out, though, that this 

was not an issue raised to the State supreme court.  And

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING AFFIRMANCE 

MR. DREEBEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

There is a fundamental difference between 

Petitioner's claim that defense counsel has a duty to 

advise his client about all of the myriad collateral 

consequences that may stem from a criminal conviction, 

which the government does not think that a defense 

counsel has under the Sixth Amendment, and the claim 

that is focused more precisely on misadvice given by 

defense counsel on a material collateral consequence to 

a defendant.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Dreeben, we 

learn in the first year of law school that the line 

between an affirmative act and failure to act is a 

difficult one to draw.  What if the lawyer says, you're 

going to face 5 years, and the defendant says, is that 

all that's going to happen to me?  And the lawyer says 

yes.  Is that a failure to advise or is that an 

affirmative misrepresentation? 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think it's certainly 

not an affirmative misrepresentation.  In context, what 

the defense lawyer's purpose is, is to counter the 

government's criminal case.  That’s what the Sixth 

Amendment provides a lawyer to do.  The government 

appears through its expert adversary.  The Sixth 

Amendment provides a counterweight to that in the form 

of a lawyer to deal with the criminal aspects of 

the case. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, then you are saying 

that the more the defense counsel strays from his only 

professional responsibility, the more at risk the 

government is.  That seems odd. 

MR. DREEBEN:  What we think, Justice 

Kennedy, is that the defense lawyer has two relevant 

duties here:  One is to counter the government's case, 

which means to provide advice to the defendant about his

rights, the nature of the charges, the evidence, and the 

affirmative defenses that may exist.  And that is a task 

that is somewhat broader than the court has in 

conducting a Rule 11 colloquy.  The court does not go 

into strategic matters in a criminal case with the 

defendant.  Defense counsel must. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think when we --

when we decide there's no right to counsel, like on 

collateral review, we don't even look at what happened, 

right?  We don't look and see whether the advice was 

ineffective, how bad the lawyer was.  The idea is if you 

don't have the right at all, you don't have the right to 

an effective lawyer. 

MR. DREEBEN:  That's right. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that right? 

Okay.  Well, these -- when you are talking about 

collateral consequences, you don't have a right to 

counsel on -- with respect to those collateral 

consequences.  I assume there's -- maybe there is -- is 

there a right to counsel when you are facing a 

deportation proceeding? 

MR. DREEBEN:  Certainly not by virtue --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then, if there 

is no right to counsel, why do we get into whether there 

is an affirmative misrepresentation or not? 

MR. DREEBEN:  Because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just like in a 

collateral -- habeas context, we don't care whether 

there’s an affirmative misreputation –-

misrepresentation, because there’s no right to counsel 

in the first place. 

MR. DREEBEN:  I think it's because the 

lawyer has an additional duty in the context of advising 

his client whether to take a guilty plea, and that is 

the duty to respect that the decision whether to plead 

guilty belongs to the defendant personally.  It's not a 

decision that can be exercised by proxy by the lawyer. 

And the lawyer's duty to respect that, whatever advice 

he gives, the defendant must be able to make his own 

personal decision, imposes a concomitant duty not to 

interfere with or undermine the defendant's ability to 

make an intelligent decision with the information he 

has. 

So if a lawyer chooses, when asked about 

collateral consequences, as many aliens will do –- will 

I get deported? -- the lawyer is perfectly free to say: 

I am not your immigration counsel.  You need a lawyer to

advise you about immigration.  I am your criminal 

lawyer. 

And that's perfectly fine.  But if a lawyer 

goes beyond that and says, don't worry about it; you've 

been in the country so long; you are not going to get 

deported -- with the understanding and the backdrop 

that this is an important factor in whether this 

defendant is going to decide to take a guilty plea or to 

go to trial -- then the lawyer has used his professional 

skills to undermine a personal decision that belongs to 

the defendant alone. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what about 

misadvice as to whether he will lose custody of his 

children, or misadvice as to whether his -- his truck 

which he owns will be confiscated by the government? 

MR. DREEBEN:  I would put them, Justice 

Scalia, all in the same general basket, which is to say, 

misadvice on a legal matter of importance to the 

defendant that could skew his decision to plead guilty 

may be deficient representation under Strickland.  I 

think what was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not the defendant, 

but a defendant?  In other words, I assume it's an 

objective inquiry you would make rather than a 

subjective one?

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, objective in the sense 

that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We assume, for 

example, that someone who is going to lose the custody 

of their children would regard that as important.  You 

don't want testimony about this guy doesn't care about 

the children, so it's not a big deal to him. 

MR. DREEBEN:  I actually think that would be 

quite relevant, because if any misadvice did not cause 

the defendant to plead guilty because it was irrelevant 

to him, then the defendant should not be able to get in 

the door with an ineffective assistance claim. 

And I also think if the defendant hasn't 

manifested in some way that the particular collateral 

consequence is important to that defendant, then the 

lawyer certainly has no obligation even under 

professional standards --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Won't -- won't your 

test result in a net loss to defendants?  I assume, if 

this is adopted as a rule, the affirmative 

misrepresentation rule, then every lawyer is going to 

say what you said they should say:  I'm here for the 

criminal case; I'm not telling you anything about 

anything else --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- as opposed to 

saying -- sitting down and saying:  Here's what you need 

to know.  And in most cases we expect the lawyer to do a 

professional job.  If you have got an alien, he is going 

to tell him:  Well, what -- you know, this will cause 

you to be deported. Instead, every lawyer now is going 

to say:  I'm not giving you any advice about anything 

else. 

MR. DREEBEN:  No, I don't think that it will 

lead to sort of defensive malpractice type of counseling 

where lawyers do not do the job that they feel that they 

should do, and experience tends to support that. 

The rule right now in 10 Federal circuits 

is there’s no duty to advise about collateral 

consequences.  Seven Federal circuits have a rule that 

affirmative misadvice about collateral consequences can 

support a claim. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why -- why do you have a 

rule?  I mean, I thought -- I’ve looked up six cases, 

and they all say, Strickland cases in this Court, that 

you look at all the circumstances.  Now, what I think is 

radical on your part -- but tell me it isn't -- is not 

what the rule is, but that you want one.

conduct of the lawyer meet professional -- prevailing 

professional norms?  And then we look to see, if it did 

not, whether that led to a situation where he would not 

have pleaded guilty but for the failure.  Okay? 

Now, the world is filled with 42 billion 

circumstances.  If we agree with you, we will have set 

in motion the great legal rule machine.  And there's 

nothing better than lawyers spinning off rules.  And we 

will be here from now until -- good, we won't have any 

docket problem, because what we'll be doing is reviewing 

rule after rule after rule after rule. 

So why has the government -- I think for the 

first time, maybe not -- told us to abandon Strickland's 

approach and start spinning off rules? 

MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Breyer, we have not 

abandoned Strickland's approach.  What we have focused 

on is, what is the Sixth Amendment right in the first 

place?  The Sixth Amendment right is not a right to have 

a State-provided lawyer who will advise you about child 

custody or about deportation or about --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  But it's easy -- I 

mean, you know one thing we are very good at here is 

making up hypotheticals.  So I imagine it wouldn't be 

that tough for me to think of a hypothetical where 

everyone knows this 90-year-old individual who has

actually never set foot in the country that he came 

from, and everyone knows that if he pleads guilty to 

this chewing gum offense where they have virtually no 

evidence, he will be sent back, at age 90, to that 

country. 

I would say any lawyer would say, be 

careful, because if we plead guilty, back you go, on the 

stretcher since you can no longer walk.  See, all I did 

was spin out a hypothetical. 

And the reason I can spin those out and why 

we have the Strickland rule is pretty clearly that you 

shouldn't have sub-rules here because life is more 

complicated than rules tell us.  Just look to see 

prevailing norm and did it cause the harm.  And that's 

why I am back to my question:  Isn't this the first time 

the government has asked us to adopt rules under 

Strickland rather than what it says --

MR. DREEBEN:  I think, Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- which is "case by case," 

underlined, italics, repeated in the cases? 

MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Breyer, I think that 

the fundamental point is that this is the first time 

that the Court has been asked to adopt a rule under 

Strickland that would require a lawyer, pursuant to 

Sixth Amendment norms, to give advice that pertains --

individual case and ask in this case, did the -- at 

least that's what I heard him; he's in charge of his own 

case.  But I heard him say, look to this case, and in 

this case, it falls below prevailing norms for a lot of 

reasons. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Breyer, the --

the lower courts that have looked at this I think have 

correctly recognized that there’s a distinction between 

saying that Strickland is a case-by-case inquiry into 

lawyer competence and saying that Strickland requires 

the lawyer to provide advice about collateral 

consequences that are not the criminal case --

JUSTICE ALITO:  But what are you going to do 

in the situation where the defendant is concerned about 

removal -- the removal consequences?  And this is --

let's say this is a case out in some rural jurisdiction, 

you have got a public defender or a retained attorney, 

and the -- the attorney is -- you know, provides 

advice based on the criminal law consequences and the 

client says:  Well, I'm also concerned about the 

immigration consequences.  And the lawyer says:  Well, 

immigration law is very complicated, and I'm not an

the client says -- and the lawyer says:  If you want to 

know about that you've got to get a deportation –-

you’ve got to get an immigration lawyer.  And the alien 

defendant says:  Well, I have no money; that's why you 

were appointed to represent me.  How am I going to get 

advice on the immigration law issue?  And the lawyer 

says:  Well, that's just too bad for you. 

And that's the line you want us to draw? 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Alito, I don't 

think that he has a right under the Sixth Amendment to a 

lawyer who will counsel him about the potential 

immigration consequences of a guilty plea.  That’s not 

what the Sixth Amendment was designed for. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What are the consequences 

to the lawyer?  I mean, let's assume you are a public 

defender, and you are confronted with this situation. 

Is it -- how -- how much skin is it off your teeth if 

you provide the advice, even though you are uncertain, 

and the advice turns out to be wrong?  What happens to 

the lawyer? 

MR. DREEBEN:  I don't know that anything 

happens to the lawyer, Justice Scalia.

happen is your client will get off. 

MR. DREEBEN:  There’s the professional --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  He’ll make a guilty plea, 

and afterwards it will be set aside. 

MR. DREEBEN:  There is a professional 

incentive to provide advice where you are competent to 

provide advice and not to provide it where you are not 

competent.  And I think that the focus on immigration 

consequences illustrates two things: 

One is this is an extraordinarily 

complicated area of the law, where it is very difficult 

to give advice.  And for a lawyer to be expected to 

master not only the criminal aspects of the case but 

also the immigration aspects of the case will only tend 

to divert attention from what the lawyer is really there 

to do, advise --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, why shouldn't we 

just adopt an amendment to Rule 11 in which the judge 

says, any collateral consequences with respect to your 

plea are not the concern of this court and will not be 

grounds for setting aside this -- this plea? 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the former part is

rulemaking capacity do.  The latter part is a Sixth 

Amendment question.  And I think it's highly notable 

that the rules committee for the criminal rules has 

twice considered whether to amend Rule 11, and is going 

to consider it again contemporaneously with this case, 

to require the judge to say to an alien defendant, you 

may want to take into account removal consequences of a 

criminal conviction. 

In other words, there are rule-based ways to 

address some of the concerns that Justice Alito raised 

without constitutionalizing a new area of collateral 

consequences that would impose new duties that actually 

would divert the lawyer from his criminal law function, 

whereas the misadvice line has not created those 

problems. 

And as I started to say earlier, the fact 

that 10 Federal circuits have said no duty to advise on 

collateral consequences, while 7 have recognized that 

misadvice on collateral consequences can provide 

relief, has not led to a series of difficult Strickland 

hearings that are unmanageable.  Justice Alito --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How do we know that?

is -- is out there as -- as a real possibility, but it

just doesn't occur to the -- the defendant, and the 

attorney doesn't even mention, you know, you might --

you might want to think about the removal consequences 

of this? 

MR. DREEBEN:  Then the client does not get 

relief for two reasons:  One is because we believe 

there’s no duty to give that advice.  But even if the 

Court disagreed with me on that, such a defendant could 

hardly show prejudice because he knew that he went into 

his guilty plea with uncertainty, at best, about 

removal. 

And I think it would be very difficult to 

show what he should have to show to establish prejudice: 

First, that subjectively he would not have pleaded 

guilty had he been given correct immigration advice; 

and, second, that a reasonable defendant would have had 

a basis not to plead guilty, because if the defendant is 

going to be convicted after a trial in any event, the 

same collateral consequence is going to ensue.  The 

defendant will not evade the collateral consequences of 

removal if the defendant was going to be convicted at a 

trial anyway.  And perhaps --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do you -- how do you 

know that?  In this case, Mr. Kinnaird told us the

packages. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think courts will 

evaluate that kind of a claim just the way they evaluate 

any other Strickland claim and decide whether there was 

any reasonable probability that such a defense could have 

prevailed. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  After -- after a 

mini-trial, which deprives the government of -- of its 

whole benefit from the guilty plea.  Governments accept 

guilty pleas in order to avoid the time and expense of 

going to -- to a trial.  And here you have to go back 

and find out what the evidence would have been, so that 

the court can make the decision you say is so easy. 

MR. DREEBEN:  This is the typical regime 

that the Court has dictated under Strickland, and it has 

not proved unmanageable in the courts that have adopted 

the limited misadvice rule that the government 

supports.

Official 

In Hill v. Lockhart, this Court again 

focused on voluntariness and said that voluntariness of 

the plea depends on counsel's advice and whether that 

counsel advice is in the range of competence of the 

attorneys in a criminal proceeding. 

Again, the focus was on voluntary.  And in 

Brady, this Court described a voluntary plea as "a plea 

entered by one possessing full knowledge of direct 

consequences."  Thus, reading the cases together, it 

would appear that the defendant need to have only 

knowledge -- full knowledge of direct consequences, and 

advice of counsel is just a tool to ensure that. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, a plea is 

something more than “I'm guilty.”  It is a strategic 

decision not to put the government to its burden of 

proof.  Your definition of voluntariness suggests that 

there is only one component to it, do I know what my 

rights are, as opposed to, do I know what they are and 

am making an informed decision to waive those rights. 

Your articulation of the rule leaves out the 

second component:  Am I making an informed decision to 

waive those rights? 

MR. LONG:  Well, I think under this Court's 

precedent, the informed right is to know what those

rights are, what is the weight of the evidence against 

you, and to make those strategic decisions.  But that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But how do you do that? 

I mean, your adversary's argument is, in their 

particular case -- and I know that you dispute this –-

there is a defense that could win at trial.  And the 

defendant comes in and says:  Okay, what are my choices? 

I go to trial and I may serve a longer sentence, but I 

don't go to trial, I may serve that -- I do go to trial 

and I serve that longer sentence, but it's here in the 

U.S. and not in my home country, where I might starve to 

death.  I think I’ll stay here and take that risk. 

You're -- you're sort of ignoring that 

component of information in terms of informing the 

strategic choice of whether to take the risk and go to 

trial. 

MR. LONG:  Well, we are not particularly 

ignoring it.  We are saying ultimately under the Sixth 

Amendment what is prudent or appropriate may not 

necessarily be what the inquiry is, but what is 

constitutional mandated.  And what is constitutionally 

mandated here is to provide the adversary to waive 

the -- put the Commonwealth's or the State's proof -- to 

weigh it, to advise about it.

goes to the Solicitor General's position, which is:  You 

may be right, an attorney doesn't have to give more 

information than what's necessary.  But doesn't the 

calculus change when the defendant says, this is 

important to me; give me accurate advice, if you are 

going to give me advice? 

MR. LONG:  Well, the calculus may change 

ever so slightly, but the -- I think the difference is, 

is that misadvice is still -- is not materially 

different than the failure to advise.  Ultimately, the 

-- the defendant still is left to -- to operate under a 

misapprehension. 

And the States are more than able to police 

this kind of conduct, and in fact the States have.  I 

think it's approximately 27 States that do add to their, 

quote, unquote, "Rule 11" and -- and require some sort 

of inquiry by the -- the courts.  And ultimately, it's 

the States or the individual courts through their 

rulemaking process or through legislative prerogative 

whereby this could better -- best be addressed, rather 

than constitutionalizing misadvice and trying to draw 

this really hard distinction between no duty and the 

duty to advise.

the facts, you think he is being charged with a fairly 

minor offense, a year maybe max, and he tells you:  You 

know, I have a family here, I've -- I've -- you know, he 

tells you this story where it is quite apparent to you

you -- in this case, if they didn't tell him, why has 

not such a lawyer failed to meet prevailing professional 

norms in my hypothetical? 

MR. LONG:  Well, Your Honor, the -- first of 

all, the prevailing professional norm or ethical 

obligations that have been enacted in Kentucky and in 

most States provide very general obligations and they do 

not actually speak to this kind of situation. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, I'm not saying whether 

-- you have just told me that any lawyer worth his salt, 

in my example, of course would tell the client, and –- in 

my case.  And so I just asked, then has a lawyer who has 

failed to do so not met the prevailing professional 

norm?  That has nothing to do with ethics or not ethics; 

it's how lawyers behave.  I don't see how you avoid 

answering that question "yes". 

MR. LONG:  Well, I don't know that it's 

necessarily a prevailing norm.  It's -- it’s a question 

of –-

would do it, everybody'd do it.  I don't know what a

Official 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but assuming it's a 

norm and that all lawyers do it, including those that 

know diddly about immigration law, the norm is to give 

bad advice.  And -- and here the norm was met, right? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. LONG:  Potentially yes, Your Honor.  And 

in fact it's really unclear what advice was given 

because, as my opponent has mentioned, there was not an 

evidentiary hearing, so what was actually said is 

unclear.  But I fear like -- that the misadvice 

distinction made by the Solicitor General's Office does 

-- 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Before we get to the 

misadvice, to put every -- dot every “i,” every lawyer 

would do it in my case; that's a professional norm.  If 

a lawyer fails to do it, he hasn't met the professional 

norm.  And a rule that's absolute would overturn 

Strickland in that respect, because Strickland says if 

you fail to meet professional norms, you are guilty of 

inadequate assistance of counsel, okay?  So Q.E.D. 

Now, what’s wrong with what I just said? 

MR. LONG:  Well, Your Honor, I would have to 

disagree a little bit.  I believe Strickland is not 

quite that expansive.  Strickland talks with regard to

professional norms and ethical standards as guides in 

determining competent counsel, and does not set them as 

hard, fast rules.  And in --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought the point is 

that -- I thought your point was that –- that Strickland 

does require professional norms to be observed, but it 

is professional norms regarding advising a defendant as 

to the trial consequences of his plea, as to those 

matters that are involved in the prosecution, and not as 

to collateral matters.  Isn't that your point? 

MR. LONG:  Yes, Your Honor.  The --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Those are the only norms 

that are relevant, what norms oblige counsel to advise a 

defendant regarding trial matters. 

MR. LONG:  Correct.  And under Strickland --

under the Sixth Amendment, criminal defense attorneys 

must focus on issues of guilt and innocence and penalty. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, everyone at the 

counsel table I assume agrees that the plea has to be 

voluntary.  But “voluntary” has various meanings: 

Number one, it is not coerced or forced.  Would -- isn't 

your argument that “voluntary” does not include being 

fully informed?

fully informed about every possible consequence which

Official 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well then, about important 

collateral consequences.  Is there -- are there any 

cases that address this point one way or the other? 

That is to say, the extent to which “voluntary” includes 

the component of being informed about major 

consequences, significant consequences of the plea?  Can 

I go anywhere to -- to read a discussion of this? 

MR. LONG:  Well, Your Honor, that's kind of 

a problem, I believe.  The cases that -- that do 

address this issue seem to focus on voluntariness and 

they focus upon the definition this Court espoused in 

Brady, and they uniformly come up with the -- with the 

conclusion that no affirmative duty is required.  They 

then jump from that position to the -- to a position 

where misadvice somehow changes the inquiry.  They fail 

to focus again on “voluntary,” where -- meaning full 

knowledge of direct consequences, and instead reached 

out to these kind of results-driven opinions that are 

kind of fueled by this feeling of -- of unfairness. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Long, you said that 

this is a collateral consequence; therefore, the lawyer 

has no obligation to advise the client.  But what was 

remarkable about the case that you rely on, Hill v. 

Lockwood, is the Eighth Circuit used the distinction

between “direct” and “collateral.”  In this Court, the 

opinion said nothing about “direct” or “collateral”; it 

just asked the question under Strickland, and it held 

that Strickland does apply to challenges to guilty pleas 

based on ineffective assistance of counsel.  But it --

staring the Court in the face was this direct versus 

collateral, and the Court was totally silent on that. 

It didn't consider it relevant to its determination. 

MR. LONG:  You're -- you are correct, Your 

Honor.  The -- and, again, that silence has then led the 

circuits to develop a rule.  And the predominant rule is 

that a voluntary plea following this Court's other 

decisions which it has -- where it has spoken, that the 

plea need only be entered by one possessing full 

knowledge of direct consequences.  The --

JUSTICE ALITO:  What about the situation 

where the -- the defendant would have made sacrifices 

and obtained competent immigration advice, were it not

defense attorney says:  Don't worry about it, you are 

not going to be removed.  And the defendant says:  You 

really sure about that?  Because, you know, if you’re 

not,  my relatives are going to get a second mortgage on 

the house and we are going to go hire an immigration

lawyer so we can be absolutely sure about that -- this. 

And the criminal attorney says: 

 

I'm an expert on this. 

I've just had, you know, six hours of CLE --

(Laughter.) 

-- on immigration law.  And in reliance on 

that faulty advice, the defendant pleads guilty and finds 

himself facing removal. 

MR. LONG:  Well, following the logic of this 

-- of the circuits and of this Court's guidance in 

Brady, again, the inquiry for voluntariness is on direct 

consequences, so it would not rise to a Sixth Amendment 

claim. 

Counsel may, nonetheless, be -- I'm not a 

very -- I’m not a very good counsel in that situation. 

However, as it was pointed out earlier, sometimes, 

criminal defendants risk ordinary error with their 

representation, and in fact, this Court has recognized 

that in numerous cases. 

In U.S. v. Ruiz, this Court kind of compiled 

a group of cases, including Brady, McMann, and Tollett, 

in which the defendant did, in fact, operate under 

misapprehensions with regard to things that we most 

often consider strategic, more direct obligations of the 

trial.

misapprehended the quality of the evidence and the 

penalties and such, and this Court ultimately found 

that, in all those cases, there is a certain amount of 

ordinary error that is risked when pleading guilty, that 

you risk a certain amount -- that your counsel may not 

have made the best strategic decision. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this 

question:  Supposing this wasn't a drug crime -- a 

sexual abuse of a minor, which would lead to all sorts 

of restrictions on where the defendant could live and 

report to as a resident, and the like, would there be –-

would that be a collateral consequence or a direct 

consequence, in the advice on that? 

MR. LONG:  I believe, Your Honor, that it 

would be a -- a fine line, that it would technically be 

a collateral consequence under the classic definition of 

collateral consequence, that being whether or not it 

falls under the control or discretion of the sentencing 

court.  The --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Even though the 

consequence is a -- is something required by the law of 

the jurisdiction imposing the criminal penalty, it would 

still be collateral? 

MR. LONG:  The popular definition -- or the 

most common definition focuses on whether it falls under

the discretion or power of the sentencing court. 

In those jurisdictions that have sexual 

offender registries, it is not a -- something that is 

discretionary with the court.  It is through the 

executive agency that that is enforced, just like 

parole, also just like your right -- to lose your right 

to vote -- losing your right to bear arms. 

All of those things happen automatically by 

action of law, yet they remain collateral because they 

do not fall under -- with -- under the discretion and 

power of the sentencing court. 

If I could remind you all -- I apologize for 

putting "you all" -- but -- my being from Kentucky is 

showing a little. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. LONG:  The modern rules of professional 

conduct are very, very broad, and there's -- I don't 

believe that it can be demonstrated that they were 

actually violated here, even under the alleged conduct. 

The prevailing norms that the ABA puts forth in its 

brief or the criminal justice standards are 

aspirational.  They -- they focus more on what --

MR. LONG:  I said -- in response to Justice 

Breyer, in the extreme circumstances, again, it would be 

my opinion -- not necessarily the opinion of this Court 

or necessarily it would fall under the Sixth Amendment, 

but that, if you absolutely knew and that a -- a severe 

collateral consequence is of great importance, you 

should explore it. 

The misadvice rule that the U.S. government 

kind of puts forth as the hybrid position does -- I 

do believe creates these collateral consequences as land 

mines to be avoided. 

I think it does, in fact, encourage criminal 

defendants to be -- or criminal defense attorneys to be 

silent in situations where they would otherwise be 

more free in offering that advice. 

And, again, offering the advice does not 

necessarily raise it to Sixth Amendment purview because, 

again, there are any number of things that are going to 

come up in that attorney-client relationship. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We are talking on a 

highly general level, but what's facing us -- this case, 

is there are certain crimes -- an increased number of 

crimes that are classified as aggravated felonies, where 

the rule is, if you are convicted of an aggravated 

felony, you are out of the country after you serve your

Official 

There’s nothing mysterious about that. 

There’s nothing intricate about making that 

determination.  So why wouldn't a lawyer whose client is 

an alien have an obligation, when there is an aggravated 

felony as the charge, to say this will be the 

consequence? 

MR. LONG:  Well, I think, in this case, we 

are focusing on the obligation created by the Sixth 

Amendment, and the Sixth Amendment obligation refers to 

the criminal proceeding and the criminal prosecution and 

then to aid in the defense. 

Like the -- and we would agree with the 

Solicitor General there, that the purpose for the 

criminal attorney in that situation is to counteract the 

expert of the Commonwealth or the State, is to ensure 

the fair and just determination of guilt, not to advise 

on collateral matters such as deportation, child 

custody, and the like. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You keep insisting on the 

collateral, although you recognized that in Hill v. 

Lockhart, the Court did not draw that line. 

MR. LONG:  Well, ultimately -- and this 

Court did not -- didn't draw any line.  It was silent on 

that point.  And given the -- the way the lower courts

have reacted in drawing the direct and collateral line, 

I think that's kind of where we have to go. 

That’s what the rule is of the lower courts 

and it’s the rule that has -- has been applied 

throughout the nation, and we are testing whether or not 

that rule makes sense, essentially. 

And I think, ultimately, there is a 

potential problem in treating deportation differently 

than other collateral consequences.  To do so –- I 

believe, at one point in Mr. Kinnaird's argument, he 

does make the point that deportation, because it is of 

such importance or that -- that it should be treated 

differently. 

But that is to suggest that it's so 

important in all situations and it is more important 

than collateral consequence that may affect citizens. 

Citizens will lose the right to vote.  They will lose 

their right to jury service, perhaps lose custody of 

their children. 

And there’s no principled reason to really 

treat deportation differently.  If the reason to treat 

it differently because it is viewed as so severe, it's 

truly then a subjective inquiry as what collateral 

consequence is severe to this client. 

And it ultimately prefers a class of

citizens -- those who are non-citizens -- over citizens 

who may have just as much importance placed on 

collateral consequences they face. 

Moving real quickly, if I could just touch 

briefly on the prejudice prong of Strickland.  First, 

I'm not -- well, I hesitate to say this a little bit, 

but it's not completely apparent on the record that 

counsel's performance was, in fact, deficient. 

He did not misadvise with regard to any 

direct consequence.  Padilla does not allege that he 

misunderstood any of the rights he was waiving, and at 

least -- and up until his reply brief, he made no bones 

about the fact that he was guilty. 

And, in fact, that solemn and sworn 

admission of guilt should not be lightly undone. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, the defendant might 

say:  I have been in the United States for 40 years.  I 

have a family.  I’d rather take my chances with a 

jury and get put away for a longer time because at least 

I'll be in prison where my children can visit me. 

MR. LONG:  Well, Your Honor, again, that is 

a risk that is taken when asking questions to your 

counsel.  It would not necessarily fall under the Sixth 

Amendment requirements.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. KINNAIRD 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Thank you, Your Honor. 

Three quick points.  In Hill, the Court did 

expressly hold that Strickland applies to the collateral 

consequence of parole eligibility, so it is not just 

for -- for trial consequences. 

And, secondly, Brady is predicated on an 

assumption that there is competent advice on the 

strategic decisions --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excue me, I'm not sure that 

parole eligibility could qualify as a collateral 

consequence. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  It certainly would under the 

-- Kentucky’s test, Your Honor, because it depends on 

such factors as the actual sentence, the prior 

convictions of the defendant.  Those are not things that 

are known at the plea colloquy --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It goes to the sentence. 

It goes to what the sentence will be, which is certainly 

part of the trial. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, under Rule 11, at least 

prior to the abolition of parole, there was no

advisement in the district courts -- the Federal 

district courts on that. 

The second point is that it is predicated on 

competency, and so the standard is not voluntariness. 

When you are in the Sixth Amendment, you go to the 

Strickland standard of incompetency, and then prejudice 

within the criminal prosecution.  And I emphasize that 

is what we have here, the forfeiture of a jury trial 

right.  We are not talking about prejudice outside the 

criminal prosecution. 

And, finally, while we agree with the 

government that the misadvice rule has proven perfectly 

manageable in the 30 or so jurisdictions in which it has 

been endorsed, there also have been a handful of 

jurisdictions --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why do you say that?  Why 

do you say that?  Or there has not been a revolution 

or what?  What -- how do you know? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, Your Honor, I mean, 

there’s -- I think that there are something like 700 

claims in over a decade or something like that. 

So we don't know, but it’s -- there has been 

no evidence, that we are aware of, that the courts are 

overly burdened by these, and there -- and even in the

says:  I don't know.  I'm not a deportation lawyer.  I'm 

a criminal lawyer, but my best guess is that you are all 

right. 

What happens there? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, Your Honor, I think 

those would be adjudicated under Strickland, and, 

remember, Strickland --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you can make a 

claim when the lawyer disavows knowledge on the 

question?  In other words, he is trying to be helpful, 

but he also warns the defendant. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Yes.  Under the broader rule, 

you would have a Strickland claim.  It would be very 

hard to prevail on that because you would have to show 

that it was unreasonable for him not to investigate 

the consequences --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  "To investigate"? 

So even if he doesn't know deportation and the client 

asks him, he has to investigate that?

MR. KINNAIRD:  He has to do whatever is 

required by competent representation. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, just to be --

MR. KINNAIRD:  That's the limited standard. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Just to be clear about the 

scope of your argument -- maybe you could just clarify. 

Which, if any, of the following would you not put in the 

same category as advice about immigration consequences: 

advice about consequences for a conviction for a sex 

offense, the loss of professional licensing or future 

employment opportunities, civil liability, tax 

liability, right to vote, right to bear arms. 

Are they all in the same category?  Or do 

you -- do you draw a line some place? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Your Honor, our principal 

position is that the Court should not draw lines, that 

that's the whole purpose of Strickland. 

I would say, in the vast majority of cases, 

for example, with the right to vote, the chances that 

that’s going to be material to a plea decision by a 

defendant, especially one facing significant 

incarceration, are probably almost nil, but this should 

be left to the -- to the traditional Strickland inquiry 

on a case-by-case basis. 

Thank you.
