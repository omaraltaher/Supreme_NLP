CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 01-800, Karen Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds.


Mr. Friedberg.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN C. FRIEDBERG


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. FRIEDBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


There is at least a little irony in the fact


that Dean Witter is the litigant here before you, about 27


years past the time when it started with Dean Witter and


Byrd the -- the move toward closing the courthouse doors


to public investors and forcing them into industry-run


arbitration.  Dean Witter is now back here attempting to


place a hurdle in the way of the public investor who


ironically at this point seeks to enforce an arbitration


agreement. 


The issue today before the Court is the extent


to which the industry and Dean Witter may now invoke court


involvement to interfere with a customer's claims before


arbitration and -- and to decide whether the customer's


claims are timely under a section of an arbitration code


providing for a time limitation on eligibility.  The issue


is who decides.

 It is clear that -- that over the years a


presumption has developed in favor of arbitrability where


there is an arbitration clause in a contract.  And the


cases say that that presumption can only be overcome by


clear and convincing evidence that the parties agreed to


have a court decide arbitrability issues within a --


within the scope of an arbitration agreement.  In this


case, there is no such evidence. 


The arbitration clause in the 1992 agreement


between the parties is as broad a clause as one can


imagine.  The client agrees that all controversies between


her and Dean Witter concerning or arising from any account


or any transaction involving Dean Witter and the client,


whether or not it occurred in the account, or the


construction, performance, or breach of this or any other


agreement between us.  It's an industry-designed


arbitration clause, meant to be as broad as possible.  The


intent clearly is to move cases against brokers by


customers out of the courts and into arbitration.


That -- that 1992 agreement was, of course,


followed by a 1997 submission agreement signed by


Ms. Howsam which merely states that as an undersigned


party, she and her trust submit the present matter in


controversy, as set forth in the attached statement of


claim, to arbitration in accordance with the Constitution,

by-laws, rules, regulations, and/or code of arbitration


procedure of the sponsoring organization.  In this case,


it's the NASD, but the -- the other self-regulatory


organizations and exchanges have similar rules to the 6-


year rule.


QUESTION:  It seems to me that some of the


language in First Options, which the respondent relies on


cuts against your case.  How -- how do you deal with that?


MR. FRIEDBERG:  Well, first of all, First


Options is a case in which there was a question about


whether an arbitration agreement existed, which is not the


case here.  And Justice Breyer, writing for the Court,


wrote that -- that in that situation, the presumption


shifts. 


The AT&T case -- clearly the -- when the


question is just the scope of an arbitration agreement,


but there is no question about the existence of the


agreement, there needs to be clear and unmistakable


evidence of an intent to have the courts decide rather


than the arbitrators decide.


QUESTION:  The respondents here, of course,


argue that because of the not to be submitted clause, the


6 years, that limits the scope of the -- of the


arbitration agreement.


MR. FRIEDBERG:  The -- the respondent, of

course, is -- is referring to rule 10304, which says that


-- that disputes which arose out of transactions or events


more than 6 years prior are not eligible for submission to


arbitration. 


First of all, that -- that rule is found in a


section of the arbitration code.  It's not found in the


agreement itself.  And it's found in a section of the Code


of Arbitration Procedure. 


QUESTION:  Well, so is 10324 which you're


relying on.  That is, the arbitrator shall be empowered to


interrupt and determine the applicability of.  I mean,


that's --


MR. FRIEDBERG:  Exactly, Justice Scalia.  And


the point I was -- was trying to make is that -- that the


code has to be read as -- as one code in that -- in that


respect. 


The -- it's also, I think, illuminating that the


-- the section, the 300 series of the code in which that


is found, is -- is not the eligibility section in the


sense that the 100 series is.  The 300 series is -- is


basically a procedural, instructive portion of the code


for the arbitrators to apply. 


There is some -- we -- we've made the argument


and -- and I think it's a valid argument -- that eligible


for submission can mean a number of things.  And -- and

that it refers, in this case to -- it could refer in this


case to when the arbitrators take the case under


submission, just as this Court takes the case under


submission after the petition, after the briefing, after


the arguments are made. 


There -- there is, of course, the need to get


the case in front of a tribunal in order to -- to decide


whether or not the case is timely.  So while the rule may


prevent the case from going all the way to the end zone,


it -- it certainly doesn't prevent the -- the litigant


from or the -- the person arbitrating from -- from getting


out of the starting gate. 


Moreover --


QUESTION:  Is -- is that your criterion, that --


that -- the -- on -- on the question of what -Â­


arbitrability turns on the question, do you get in front


of the particular person or tribunal at all as opposed to


how long do you stay when you get there?  In other words,


if -- if it's a question of whether you get there at all,


it's -- the question is arbitrability and the presumption


goes one way.  If the question is how long you stay there


if you get in front of that person, that's not an


arbitrability question and the presumption goes the other


way.  Is that -- that's your point. 


MR. FRIEDBERG:  That -- that is one point,

Justice Souter. 


The -- the other point that -- that needs to be


made is that whether or not this is part of the code, part


of an agreement, it falls within the John Wiley and Moses


Cone case law as opposed to the First Options holding. 


And in -- in John Wiley, if the Court will recall, there


were prerequisites, timeliness prerequisites, to filing


for arbitration, which the Court said, because there was


an arbitration agreement and there was no dispute about


that, were for the arbitrators to decide. 


In Moses H. Cone Hospital, there were -- there


were prerequisites of timeliness.  The -- as I recall, the


arbitration had to be filed within 30 days after an


opinion by an architect as to the disputed contracting


claims.  And so -- and -- and the Court -- the Court


clearly said in Moses Cone that the Federal Arbitration


Act establishes as a matter of Federal law that any doubts


concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be


resolved in favor of arbitration, whether the contract


involves construction of the contract language itself or


an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense to


arbitrability. 


QUESTION:  -- definition of the domain of


arbitrability?  You're saying shall be eligible for


submission just means that the arbitration forum doesn't

get to the merits if more than 6 years have elapsed.  But


-- so you say that's not a question of arbitrability but


how the arbitrator will proceed. 


What is your definition of arbitrability? 


MR. FRIEDBERG:  Justice Ginsburg, our -- our


definition of arbitrability I think has to be broader than


that.  But there is -- there is the merits arbitrability. 


There is the --


QUESTION:  Well, the question that doesn't go to


the arbitrator -- you're saying this one does.  It's just


he has to take it up first -- or she.  But we're dealing


with, if it's a question of arbitrability, the courts


decide it.  If it's not a question of arbitrability, but


the -- the range of other questions, then it's for the


arbitrator. 


So my question is, what -- the domain for the


court -- the question is it arbitrable is a question for


the court.  What is the content of that label, arbitrable?


MR. FRIEDBERG:  It's a hard question for me to


get my hands around, Justice Ginsburg, but there -- there


is no question that in the first instance the court has to


decide whether a claim is -- is arbitrable.  And -- and if


the court finds that -- that there is an arbitration


clause that covers the merits of the dispute, then the


court should defer to arbitrators on any question

regarding scope. 


QUESTION:  Well, now --


MR. FRIEDBERG:  I don't think --


QUESTION:  -- this -- this is a contract matter.


Right?  I mean, if -- if the parties clearly didn't want


the arbitrator to do this and wanted the court to do it,


you -- you don't dispute that the court would do it. 


Right? 


MR. FRIEDBERG:  Right. 


QUESTION:  So it's just a question of contract.


Now, you concede the point that arbitrability is


for the courts.  Right? 


MR. FRIEDBERG:  Right. 


QUESTION:  So presumably if 10304 had read no


dispute, claim, or controversy shall be arbitrable, okay,


under -- under this code where 6 years have elapsed, that


would -- would that exclude this from -- from the


arbitrator?


MR. FRIEDBERG:  I believe not, Justice Scalia.


QUESTION:  My goodness, it's using the exact


term that you concede sends it over to the -- to the


court. 


MR. FRIEDBERG:  Well --


QUESTION:  It -- what do you have to do beyond


using the -- the very word that you say bounces it to the

court?  They say it.  It shall not be arbitrable.  And


even that will not -- will not get it to the courts.  What


-- what does one have to do to get it to the courts?


MR. FRIEDBERG:  Well --


QUESTION:  And my next question is going to be,


is there a whole lot of difference between saying it shall


not be arbitrable and saying, it shall not be eligible for


submission to arbitration? 


MR. FRIEDBERG:  I'm not --


QUESTION:  And I don't think there is. 


MR. FRIEDBERG:  I don't think there is either,


Justice Scalia. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  Which is why you're fighting


me so hard on this.  Right? 


(Laughter.) 


MR. FRIEDBERG:  Precisely. 


I think what we have to do is look to the case


law, including the ATT case and -- and its progeny, and


First Options says the same thing really, that the court


has to decide in the first instance is there an


arbitration agreement.  Having decided -- and in this case


it's undisputed -- that there is an arbitration agreement,


then the question is, does it go to the substance of the


case or is it a matter of the scope?  And the cases say,


starting with the Gulf and Warrior --

 QUESTION:  What happened to the intent of the


parties?


MR. FRIEDBERG:  That -- that's what --


QUESTION:  I mean, you're talking as -- as


though this is some law being sent down from on high.  I


thought we established that step one is what did the


parties intend. 


MR. FRIEDBERG:  Right. 


QUESTION:  And you say that even if the parties


say it's not arbitrable, well, that doesn't matter.  We


still go through this -- this game that seems to come down


from on high. 


MR. FRIEDBERG:  But the question is who will


decide a certain issue of arbitrability, and AT&T and --


and Moses H. Cone and First Options even says that once


you find that there's an agreement to arbitrate the


substance of the -- the dispute, then the question is did


the parties, by unmistakable evidence, agree that the


courts, rather than the arbitrators, would decide that


scope issue.


QUESTION:  So then you're saying arbitrability


under our cases is not for the court necessarily.


MR. FRIEDBERG:  I'm saying --


QUESTION:  I mean, you can't have it both ways.


MR. FRIEDBERG:  There -- there's a --

 QUESTION:  If you say arbitrability is for the


courts, then if the -- if the agreement between the


parties says this is not arbitrable, that question of --


of whether those facts exist or not ought to be for the


courts. 


MR. FRIEDBERG:  I think that's true for that


threshold issue, but if we get to a point where all issues


that -- that may preclude ultimately submitting the case


to the arbitrators for determination have to be decided by


the court, then we're running afoul of John Wiley.


QUESTION:  I -- I didn't understand it that way. 


I thought the question was not what the parties intend. 


It's how we find out what they intend.  And I thought


we're trying to decide between a tough burden of proof


standard on that that favors courts and where you apply no


burden of proof standard or, if anything, favor the


arbitration.  In both instances, we're trying to find out


what the party intended.  But we assume that they intended


court unless there is clear and convincing evidence they


wanted this arbitrable.  Am I right? 


MR. FRIEDBERG:  I think you're wrong, Justice


Breyer, although --


QUESTION:  Because?  Then I may not have stated


it correctly.


MR. FRIEDBERG:  I think what -- what the --

again, what the initial issue for the Court is, did the


parties agree to arbitrate the substance of the dispute.


QUESTION:  Yes, of course, and I thought what 


my opinion said was that when we're trying to decide


whether they agreed to arbitrate or not, we apply a fairly


tough standard.  They have to show rather clearly that


they did. 


What were the -- what was the word you quoted at


the beginning from the opinion?  Didn't you quote a phrase


that said on that -- in deciding whether an issue is


arbitrable, we apply the standard of?


MR. FRIEDBERG:  I believe I quoted from the


Moses H. Cone --


QUESTION:  Yes.  I'm sorry.  You go ahead.


MR. FRIEDBERG:  -- decision which -- which says


-- which says that the presumption is in favor of the


arbitrator's deciding. 


QUESTION:  I'll get the phrase and then -- I'm


not communicating.  I'm sorry. 


QUESTION:  I -- Justice Ginsburg asked a


question that I'm also interested in.  Quite apart from


the reference of -- in the agreement to the fact that the


arbitrator shall decide this, your second argument, on


your first argument, what do you want me to say if I write


the opinion or another member of the Court writes the

opinion in your favor?  If the essence of the dispute


involves the particular issue, then that is arbitrable and


that's for the arbitrators to decide?


MR. FRIEDBERG:  No.  I --


QUESTION:  I -- I just don't know what you want


us to write.  It's the same question Justice Ginsburg had.


MR. FRIEDBERG:  Justice Kennedy, it's basically


what was announced in the AT&T case when it was sent back


to the court to decide who decides certain questions.  The


Court should decide in this case that where there's a


valid, written agreement to arbitrate the subject matter


or the merits of the dispute, particularly where the


arbitration clause encompasses all controversies and the


parties have not clearly and unmistakably reserved certain


issues of arbitrability for a court decision and -- and I


mean, within the scope as opposed to the basic dispute --


the presumption in favor of arbitrability should apply,


and issues relating to the scope of the arbitration


agreement are for the arbitrators. 


And in this case -- AT&T, when the Court sent


the case back to the lower court said, these issues are


for the arbitrators to decide unless you find unmistakable


evidence that the parties agreed -- and this is the intent


of the parties -- that the court would decide. 


I -- I would like to reserve --

 QUESTION:  Mr. Friedberg, do you disagree with


the Government?  The Government did say there are two


considerations.  The first one you agree with obviously,


whether the parties entered into a binding arbitration


agreement.  And then the Government says there's a second


question, that is, whether the subject matter of the


dispute falls within the scope of that agreement.  Those


are the two things.  You seem to be saying there's only


the one, did they agree to arbitrate.


MR. FRIEDBERG:  No.  I'm not -- obviously I'm


not doing a very good job of expressing our position. 


Where the subject matter of the dispute, the merits-


related issue -- as in First Options, it was the question


of whether the Kaplans owed money or not -- is within an


arbitration agreement, then any ancillary type dispute as


to timeliness should go to the arbitrators to --


QUESTION:  What -- what if I have an arbitration


agreement that says all -- all disputes arising from an --


an accident on the employer's premises shall be


arbitrable, and the issue is whether this accident


occurred on the employer's premises or not?  One of the


parties -- or the -- the employer contends that this


injury occurred elsewhere entirely.  Who decides whether


it occurred on the premises or elsewhere? 


MR. FRIEDBERG:  I think in the first instance

the court would decide that because the parties did not


agree to arbitrate any claims. 


QUESTION:  Why is that different from here?  The


parties --


MR. FRIEDBERG:  Because --


QUESTION:  -- did not agree to arbitrate any


claims that -- with -- with regard to an accident that did


not occur on different premises, but that incurred --


occurred more than 6 years before.


MR. FRIEDBERG:  Because --


QUESTION:  They didn't agree to arbitrate it. 


They said it shall be -- shall not be eligible for


submission to arbitration. 


MR. FRIEDBERG:  Because of the principle,


Justice Scalia, set out in the John Wiley case and the


Moses H. Cone --


QUESTION:  But I don't see how that principle


applies -- doesn't apply here, but applies in the other


premises situation.  I -- I just don't see any distinction


between the two. 


MR. FRIEDBERG:  I -- I think because the Court


has previously said that a timeliness issue is -- is a


procedural issue.  It's intertwined with -- with


substantive issues, of course, but --


QUESTION:  Well, can't you make it a -- I mean,

it's up to the parties, who are masters of their


agreement.  If they want to make timeliness part of the


condition of the arbitration, surely they can do it, can't


they? 


MR. FRIEDBERG:  They could but they didn't in


this case.


QUESTION:  What you're saying, I guess, is that


if the -- if the allegation of harm falls within the


subject of the arbitration clause, everything goes to the


arbitrator unless they have unmistakably said that some


subsidiary issue does not.  Is that --


MR. FRIEDBERG:  That -- that is what our


position is. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Friedberg.


Mr. Roberts, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


MR. ROBERTS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


For two reasons the question whether


petitioners' claims were submitted within the 6-year time


limit is for the arbitrators to decide. 


First, as this Court held nearly 40 years ago in


John Wiley, when the parties have agreed to submit the

subject matter of the underlying dispute to arbitration,


the question whether the dispute was presented within a


contractual time limit is presumptively for the


arbitrators even if the time limit is a prerequisite that


conditions the duty to arbitrate. 


Second, the time limit in this case is imposed


by the NASD Code of Arbitration Procedure, which the


parties incorporated into their agreement in full.


QUESTION:  What is -- what is the general


principle that Justice Ginsburg was asking for that


controls your first conclusion? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Okay.  Arbitrability is, as used


in the Court's cases, a term of art that includes two


questions.  One of those questions is whether the parties


are bound by a valid arbitration agreement and the other


question is whether the subject matter of their underlying


dispute is within the scope of that agreement.  And by the


subject matter of their underlying dispute, what I mean is


whether they agreed to arbitrate disputes about the


primary conduct that -- that is given rise to the -- to


the underlying claim. 


And what the Court held in -- in John Wiley is


once the parties -- once the court has determined that the


parties have agreed to arbitrate disputes arising out of


the -- the underlying conduct that's at issue, then

questions about their litigation conduct and how those --


how that dispute was processed after it arose -- those are


presumptively for the arbitrators to decide.


QUESTION:  What was the text in John Wiley &


Sons?  What was the language of the agreement?  Did it --


did the agreement say that no controversy shall be


eligible for submission to arbitration? 


MR. ROBERTS:  No, Your Honor.  The -- the


agreement didn't use that -- that language.  It said the


failure of either party to file a grievance within this


time limitation shall be construed and be deemed to be an


abandonment of the grievance.  But the point --


QUESTION:  Why?  That -- that seems to me -- let


me put -- it's the same question.  Let me put it to -- to


you another way.  Is there any difference between your


reading of this clause, shall be -- shall not be eligible


for submission to arbitration, and the -- the way you


would read a clause which said, no dispute, claim, or


controversy which -- which occurred 6 years previously


shall be --


QUESTION:  Arbitrable.


QUESTION:  No, not arbitrable -- shall be


remediable?  No award shall be given for any -- for any


occurrence prior to 6 years. 


MR. ROBERTS:  There -- there may be --

 QUESTION:  Now, that -- that would be a merits


question, and that's what I think was at issue in -- you


know, it's a statute of limitations. 


MR. ROBERTS:  The --


QUESTION:  This is not phrased as a statute.


MR. ROBERTS:  There may be differences, Your


Honor, but -- but the -- the time limit language, the


eligible for submission language, what that indicates is


that the timely submission of a claim is a prerequisite to


arbitration of the merits of the claim.  It doesn't say


one way or the other who decides whether that prerequisite


has been met.  It doesn't say that the timeliness question


is not arbitrable. 


QUESTION:  Of course, it says the --


MR. ROBERTS:  It says the underlying claim is


not arbitrable --


QUESTION:  Neither --


MR. ROBERTS:  -- if it's not timely. 


QUESTION:  Neither does a clause which says only


-- only events that occurred on the employer's premises


are arbitrable.  That doesn't say --


MR. ROBERTS:  No.


QUESTION:  -- who decides that either.  But --


but since it is an arbitrability question, you -- you


assume the court will decide.

 MR. ROBERTS:  You presume -- you presume that


because if the parties didn't -- didn't contemplate that


they would arbitrate about disputes arising from the --


from the underlying conduct, which that goes to, then they


presumably didn't think the arbitrators were going to have


anything to do with any questions connected with such a


dispute.  But when they did -- no.  Here -- here we know. 


QUESTION:  They didn't think they were going to


arbitrate about any matter that occurred more than 6 years


previously.


MR. ROBERTS:  When --


QUESTION:  And therefore, they didn't think the


arbitrator would be the one to decide whether it occurred


6 years previously or not. 


MR. ROBERTS:  They agreed and there's -- there's


no question about it that they agreed that disputes that


arose from petitioners' securities accounts would be


within the -- would the kind of disputes that they would


arbitrate.  And so when this claim arose, it was within


the scope of -- of the agreement. 


And the question here is not whether it's the


kind of claim that the parties agreed that they might


arbitrate about.  It's a question of whether a claim that


was arbitrable when it arose has become not subject to


arbitration because of the parties' litigating conduct.

And ordinarily people -- people would assume that the --


the forum that they've selected to resolve the underlying


dispute is going to resolve ancillary questions about how


the dispute has been processed and the litigating --


QUESTION:  There are all sorts of


characteristics of a claim:  where it occurred, when it


occurred, the people between whom it occurred, and so


forth.  You -- you've given us no -- no basis for


distinguishing one of those characteristics from another


as far as whether the court or -- or the arbitrator


decides. 


MR. ROBERTS:  I --


QUESTION:  I suggest that a very clear basis is


what the parties themselves have said.  When they have


referred to a particular characteristic as being non-


arbitrable, it means that the question of whether that


issue -- whether that -- that fact rendering it non-


arbitrable exists is a question for the courts.  That --


that would solve a lot of cases.  And I don't know how


else you -- you -- you distinguish where from when from


between which people. 


MR. ROBERTS:  My -- my distinction is between


and it's the distinction the Court drew in the John Wiley


case and that the courts of appeals have followed for 40


years except in -- in the limited context of the question

presented here.  It's the -- the distinction that's --


that's been embodied in the Uniform Arbitration Act, which


is cited on page 14 of the reply brief.  It's the


distinction between the primary conduct and whether


there's a limit on what primary conduct is subject to


arbitrability and other questions about -- about


litigating conduct. 


And the -- the rule that would focus on the


language of -- of the parties and parse that language to


see whether it's phrased as a limit of arbitrability, to


then decide whether the presumption in favor of courts


deciding the question of arbitrability imposes an extra


layer of complexity that doesn't -- it's not likely to


reflect the -- the real intent of the parties. 


The -- what we're trying to figure out is not


whether the parties thought this was a question of


arbitrability, but who they intended to decide the -- who


they intended to decide the question.  And the -- and when


the underlying claim is within the scope of their


agreement, it's likely that they intended that ancillary


questions would be decided by the party that they


committed the underlying dispute to.


But even setting that aside, here we've got


10324.


QUESTION:  Here where language is not very

likely to reflect their intent, it's -- their language

intent --


MR. ROBERTS:  Their language reflects their


QUESTION:  It's more likely to be reflected by


some arbitrary rule that if it relates to place, yes; if


it relates to time, no.


MR. ROBERTS:  It reflects their intent that --


that timely submission of a claim is a prerequisite to


arbitration of the merits of that claim.  But it doesn't


reflect their intent of who is to decide whether the


prerequisite is -- is met.  There's -- it doesn't say


anything about that. 


Rule 10324, which is also a part of the parties'


agreement, does say something about that.  It says that


the arbitrator shall be empowered to interpret and


determine the applicability of all code provisions.  And


the time limit is a code provision.  The clear import of


that, regardless of the issue that we're discussing, is


that the arbitrators are empowered to apply the time


limit.


And so, even setting aside the 40 years of law


that's settled by John Wiley and the distinction between


the subject matter of the underlying dispute and -- and


questions that go to the parties' litigating conduct, the

agreement here is clear and that --


QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, are you saying


essentially the parties have an agreement to arbitrate,


and that looks like very broad, any and all questions, and


then there's this code of procedure?  So what the NASD


code is directed to is how, if the arbitrator has


authority, the arbitrator is to proceed.  Is that


essentially what you're saying? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  It's -- it's concerned --


the -- the code is concerned with the rules of the


arbitrable forum, and it makes sense that the arbitrators


are the ones to interpret and apply those rules.  And


that's confirmed by Rule 10324. 


But -- but yes, the -- the question whether a


claim is timely submitted goes not to the character of the


underlying claim at the time it arose and whether claims


of that character are subject to arbitration.


QUESTION:  And haven't we got to take that


position?  Because otherwise we're just going to have


litigation chaos? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  That -- it's going to


completely undermine the purpose of arbitration, Your


Honor.  The reason that people agree to arbitration is


because they want cost effective and efficient dispute


resolution, and moving all these questions into antecedent

judicial proceedings is going to delay dispute resolution. 


It's going to impose added costs on the parties, and it's


going to undermine the very reason they agreed to


arbitrate.  And it's -- it's -- that's another reason why


it's just not likely that that's what they intended --


intended to happen. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, am I right in


understanding that this 6-year is a statute of limitations


for the arbitration forum? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Because it says nothing about if the


case were in court what the limitation would be. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  It's a forum-specific limit,


and that's another reason why it makes sense that the


forum that the limit applies to should be the one that --


that applies it.  It says that cases won't be eligible for


arbitration under this code.  It doesn't refer to whether


they might be pursued in other -- in other forums or other


venues.  It reinforces the -- the expectation that the


arbitrators would decide it which, in any event, as I


said, is -- you know, you can't get any clearer than a


rule that says that the arbitrator shall be empowered to


interpret and determine the applicability of all code


provisions. 


Thank you.

 QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Roberts. 


Mr. Starr, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. STARR:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


Let me begin with what we believe to be the


fundamental point in the case.  It has been mentioned in


the opening arguments, and that is, this is in fact


determined by contract.  What did the parties intend?


In response to the specific question posed by


Justice Ginsburg, the language of AT&T we think is quite


pertinent.  It says arbitrability simply means whether the


parties' agreement creates a duty for the parties to


arbitrate the particular grievance, not whether there's an


arbitration clause at that level of generality.


QUESTION:  But doesn't a grievance -- I mean,


isn't the point of speaking of grievance just what


Mr. Roberts said?  The grievance has got to refer to the


primary conduct causing injury.  If it is not limited to


that, in the absence of unmistakable language, then we're


going to have a trial before every arbitration if there is


any procedural or other defense that could be raised. 


MR. STARR:  We believe, Justice Souter, that the


language is in fact clear, of 10304.  Let me return to

that.


But let me go to your point with respect to


litigation chaos. 


QUESTION:  Wait.  Before you do that, do you


disagree with -- what he said the -- I thought that your


-- your -- you would accept what he says, but that -- that


your point is that the primary conduct causing the injury


under this agreement is conduct that occurred within the


last 6 years --


MR. STARR:  It is --


QUESTION:  -- and not conduct that occurred


before 6 years. 


MR. STARR:  It is going to the issue of what did


AT&T mean by the specific word grievance.  What I believe


10304 is is a clear statement by the parties, leaving the


First Options presumption aside, which works for us.  If


there is any doubt as to who decides, the presumption is


the courts decide.  But here we know, by virtue of the


plain meaning of eligible for submission.  When we couple


that, since this is an NASD rule -- and what we did not


hear from the SEC was what did the NASD intend.  What have


they said this rule, which has been --


QUESTION:  This is your submission argument,


your -- your argument based on the -- on the word


submission.

 MR. STARR:  It's eligible --


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. STARR:  -- eligible for submission. 


QUESTION:  But submission -- I just don't see


how submission can decide this case because you can say


the -- the ultimate issue is submitted when the -- when


the whole case goes to the arbitrator, or you can say it


is submitted when the arbitrator gets beyond procedural


issues and gets down to the issue of the primary conduct


that caused the injury.


MR. STARR:  Justice Souter --


QUESTION:  So I don't see how submission is --


is going to be the -- the deciding factor. 


MR. STARR:  Justice Souter, we would guide the


Court first to the word eligible for submission.  Eligible


-- and the NASD has described -- and we set this forth at


page 25 of the brief -- specifically what it means in this


context.  But eligible is a very familiar term.  It is


found in rule 6 of the Court, and what it means is if


you're not eligible, you don't get to this podium.  You


don't go to the forum. 


And the parties are -- I think what is


essentially dividing the parties here today is that there


is some sense that because of John Wiley & Sons, the


parties cannot agree to a temporal restriction.  That

makes no sense whatever, and indeed it's inconsistent with


the Federal Arbitration Act, Congress' policy. 


QUESTION:  But you can agree to a temporal


restriction and still not commit yourself as to who


decides whether that restriction is true.


MR. STARR:  And that guides us -- you're exactly


right, and so you then go to what is that temporal


restriction, and let's analyze that temporal restriction. 


We believe the words --


QUESTION:  But if the temporal restriction then


were phrased in terms of no relief shall be granted on a


claim arising, then it clearly would go to the arbitrator.


MR. STARR:  It might very well go to the


arbitrator --


QUESTION:  But it clearly would, wouldn't it? 


MR. STARR:  -- under -- under those


circumstances.  It all depends upon the specific language.


QUESTION:  So it depends on the wording of the


clause.


MR. STARR:  Absolutely.  But here, Your Honor --


Justice Stevens, we know -- and I would guide the Court or


refer the Court to page 25 where we summarize what the


NASD has said this is its rule.  The rule is applicable


throughout the industry.  This is commonplace.  This is


what the rule means, and it is called a -- a

jurisdictional limitation, a -- a substantive


jurisdictional limitation, and it gives the reason. 


QUESTION:  But how -- how does the party that's


dealing with the NASD know that this is -- I mean, why


should it be bound by what the NASD has said in other


contexts?  I mean, it's not a Government organization, is


it? 


MR. STARR:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the


submission agreement in 1997 -- and this is commonplace. 


In that submission agreement, the petitioner did, indeed,


agree to submit the issue for arbitration to the NASD


under the rules. 


QUESTION:  No, no.  To one of three -- I think


they agreed to submit to one of -- one of three or four


different arbitrators, and they happened to pick this one.


And if the other arbitrator had different rules, it would


have had a different result. 


MR. STARR:  But they -- they don't, and that's


the assurance I want to give and why it's odd that the SEC


has been silent on this.  The SEC has had, in terms of


what the industry knows -- this is common practice in the


industry, this -- this rule, the eligibility rule that you


could use at a university, are you eligible for admission


to this university?  Eligibility means qualified for our


justice.  Chief -- now Chief Judge Becker described in

PaineWebber v. Hofmann -- we quote that language at page


20.  12 years ago he said, looking at the dictionary, at


Webster's, it can only have one reasonable meaning, and


that is qualified for it.  One doesn't get in the door. 


And there needs to be a gatekeeper.  And it is,


under this Court's presumption -- this Court's law and


it's consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act as well


-- it makes sense for the courts to be the gatekeeper.


And I want to come, if I may, to Justice


Souter's concern about litigation chaos.  To the contrary. 


The rule that is being suggested here ushers in all manner


of difficulties and we would describe or refer the Court,


in particular -- this is in our brief -- to the Edward


Jones v. Sorrells case.  The Seventh Circuit had before it


the following kind of question.  Eligibility claim made. 


No one went to court, but an eligibility defense offered


to the arbitrators.  The arbitrators simply noted it.


Some of these arbitrations go on for years. 


Literally 2 years is not unknown in the industry. 


In that particular case, the arbitrators never


decided the eligibility issue. 


And the NASD has said this -- we refer you to


page 7 of our brief, as well as page 25.  There was a need


for the eligibility rule -- for that rule to be clear and


for there to be a gatekeeper.

 QUESTION:  Well, I thought that -- that what it


says, this rule says -- one interpretation of it,


plausible interpretation, is arbitrators decide the


eligibility question first. 


Do you agree, Mr. Starr, that this 6-year rule


is a rule for the arbitration forum?  That is, suppose


this dispute now goes to court and the court says, we


think that the 6-year limit has not been met.  Then the


customer says, fine, court, but under New York law, the


limit, if we're in court, is 10 years and I'm well within


that.  This is a limit, as I understand it, this 6-year


limit, is for the arbitration forum only, not for the


dispute.


MR. STARR:  That is correct.  But the issue is


who then decides whether this forum -- who is the


gatekeeper?  That's what's before you. 


QUESTION:  That's now -- now, that's my puzzle


because isn't it odd that a limitation period that applies


only in the arbitration forum is then decided by a court


where the court would have a different limitation? 


MR. STARR:  Not -- not at all because if there


is a different limitation -- and, indeed, 10304 draws the


very distinction between the eligibility requirement to


get in the door of arbitration as opposed to a statute of


limitation which might vary.

 Now, the 6-year limitation -- the eligibility


rule -- and we would guide the Court back to the meaning


of the word eligible for submission.  We think that's


clear, but we think it's clear for the reasons Chief Judge


Becker said.  But we would again refer the Court to what


the NASD has said.  It is a substantive jurisdictional --


QUESTION:  It said more than that.  I mean, it


said -- you quote it on page 25.  It said -- and this -- I


wanted to ask you how that got into the Federal Register. 


It said, the courts determine the scope of the agreement


to arbitrate, including whether a matter is eligible for


arbitration on subject matter, timeliness, or other


grounds.  And that's the NASD in the Federal -- what's it


doing in the Federal Register? 


MR. STARR:  Yes.  The self-regulatory


organization, which is what the NASD and the exchanges


are, submit their proposed rules to the SEC which could


change this at the stroke of a pen.  It has not done so


for lo these years while these issues have been


languishing in -- in the courts.


QUESTION:  I -- I would like to get back to the


question --


MR. STARR:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Well, why is these interpretations


that are not part of the agreement that the respondent or

the petitioner here signed -- why are they binding on the


petitioner? 


MR. STARR:  Because she agreed in the submission


agreement to be bound by arbitration under the code of


procedure.  It's an express agreement by her which she


signed, which goes back to paragraph 19 --


QUESTION:  Well, so we're just talking here,


when you say the NASD has said, this is incorporated in


the code of procedure which she agreed to be bound by?


MR. STARR:  No. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  I thought -- I thought you


said something else. 


MR. STARR:  What I tried to say is that the NASD


has described the reasons for the rule to which she


agrees.


QUESTION:  Well, why should that bind her?


MR. STARR:  It binds her only in the sense of it


helps the Court understand what the background of the rule


is.  She is bound the rule.  We are now moving to what


does the rule mean and what's the purpose of the rule.  We


think, Mr. Chief --


QUESTION:  Well, supposing I enter into a


contract with Sears and, say, I'll pay $300 for something,


and then Sears has a publication which says, you know,


here's the warranty and, okay, you get the warranty.  And

then Sears puts out a magazine and says, what we really


mean in this warranty is A, B, C.  Now, certainly that


doesn't affect the terms -- how you interpret the terms of


the warranty. 


MR. STARR:  There may very well be, under those


circumstances, an issue of whether there was a contract. 


The other side doesn't dispute that there is a


contract and that the NASD rule is a part of the contract.


QUESTION:  But it's the NASD's interpretation of


the rule.  I mean, if you have a private entity expressing


a view as to what the contract means, I just don't think


it binds the other side. 


MR. STARR:  I'm not suggesting binding


authority.  I'm suggesting that illumination is provided


by the NASD's explanation, which also goes to the purpose. 


Why is this?  Is this simply an arbitrary rule?  No.  It


is a rule that is borne of experience of the entire


industry --


QUESTION:  But, Dr. Starr, can I ask you a


question about the meaning of the rule?  It may not really


be germane to this ques -- but I've been puzzled. 


Supposing you had a case in which the conduct occurred 7


years ago and it was fraudulently concealed until 1 year


before the arbitration is requested.  Would that be


arbitrable or not?

 MR. STARR:  Well, there would be an issue that


the Court would then analyze what is the occurrence or


event.


QUESTION:  Well, I'm talking about the


occurrence is 7 years ago. 


MR. STARR:  And -- and in terms of purchase or


sale of security, it might very well that that would not


be arbitrable in this industry because of the occurrence


or event.  There are also, as the Court knows, statutes of


repose in the statute of limitation -- in -- in the


Federal securities context as well. 


But the point is the --


QUESTION:  So this is an absolute rule without


any tolling provision.


MR. STARR:  That's correct.  It -- it is a


absolute eligibility rule that simply tells the person --


and again, there's no choice here in the sense of if she


had gone to the New York Stock Exchange or the American


Stock Exchange because the rule is exactly the same.


QUESTION:  But I'd -- I'd like you to go back to


what I thought was the key question, Justice Ginsburg's


initial question.  What is this term arbitrability?


That the context -- I've gotten not to an


answer, but I've gotten to a beginning with First Options. 


First Options says that the question of whether you agreed

to arbitration is basically a matter of intent and apply


State law.  That's the basic rule. 


Then there's a subsidiary rule.  The subsidiary


is, but if what you're interested in is whether the


parties agreed to arbitrate the question of arbitrability


-- see Justice Ginsburg says what is that -- at subsidiary


rule, what you do is assume that silence means no because


only if it's clear and unmistakable. 


Then First Options goes on to say we'll give you


a couple of examples.  An example whether or not a


particular merits-related dispute is arbitrable because it


was within the scope of a valid arbitration agreement,


that is not a question of arbitrability.  Why not? 


Because the parties, after all, have a contract for


arbitrability.  They thought about the question of


arbitrability.  It won't -- it -- it's all very likely


that they wanted this whole thing to be arbitrable.  And


then they give you an example of where it is, where there


is no contract, where there is nothing, where the parties


never thought about arbitration, in all likelihood. 


Now, with those examples, it seems to me that


we're honing in on but we don't have yet an answer to the


question Justice Ginsburg asked.  Well, if there's a


contract and it's a thing they likely thought about and


it's sort of a minor subsidiary thing and, after all, it's

something that the arbitrator knows about and courts


don't, that would all say it's not about arbitrability in


the sense of requiring a special presumption.  But if


there's nothing at all in writing, if it's something


courts know about, there is. 


All right.  That's where I am.  That doesn't


help you because I think in this case, yours would fall in


the first category.  But, nonetheless, I'd appreciate a


response because I -- I need my thinking developed on


this.


MR. STARR:  Justice Breyer, I believe that the


question of arbitrability, the duty, and who decides that


question is guided by the -- is determined by the intent


of the parties. 


QUESTION:  And we agree with that. 


MR. STARR:  We now look to the contract. 


There's some discussion as what does the contract include. 


The parties have been in agreement that the contract


includes the rules, including 10304.  That is the most


specific and targeted provision, that we then go to that


rule, and we say, what is the parties' intent with respect


to whether this issue is eligible -- this matter, dispute,


claim, or controversy shall be eligible for submission. 


It does not say specifically the courts are going to


decide that.  Right?  But the First Options presumption,

since the language is not clear that the court shall


decide it, is that that is the baseline.  That is, in


fact, the default position unless, indeed, the parties


have clearly and unmistakably provided that that is an


issue for the arbitrator.


QUESTION:  Which brings you to 10324.


MR. STARR:  And 10324 is, in fact, a broadly


worded provision that says on its face that the


arbitrators are empowered to decide, to interpret, and the


like, the provisions of the code.


Several points.  The first is this is a very


general, as opposed to a quite specific, provision, and


when we then analyze it, and we analyze it in the context


of the remainder of the code -- and I would guide the


Court especially to rule -- or section 10104 that says


arbitrators shall be appointed --


QUESTION:  Where do we find that in your brief?


MR. STARR:  10104 is at page 35 --


QUESTION:  Thank you. 


MR. STARR:  -- of the brief, Mr. Chief Justice.


And that's 10304.  And then at the bottom


paragraph, 10104 says that arbitrators shall be appointed


by whom?  The director of arbitration only for cases that


shall be eligible for submission under the code.  In other


words, when we take the code and we look at various

provisions -- and we refer the Court to our footnote 8 on


page 36 of our brief where we identify, Justice Kennedy, a


number of provisions of the code that cannot, in reason,


be interpreted by the arbitrators.  The powers of the


director of arbitration, by way of example.  We enumerate


six examples.  I think they're more like 17, but when one


goes through the entire Code of Arbitration Procedure, one


will see a number of provisions that the arbitrators just


will not have occasion --


QUESTION:  But are not -- but that those --


those provisions are not ones that the court decides


either.


And I'd like you, Mr. Starr, to tell me why I'm


wrong, because I take it from your argument you would say


I'm wrong, in saying we have an agreement to arbitrate


signed by the broker and the customer.  That seems to be


as broad as you can get.  And then we have a code of


procedure which says, if you are going to use the NASD


auspices, these are the procedural rules, including


statute of limitations, which you should decide up front


and not after you've decided the merits.  Limitations


first, then merits.  If I think of this as the agreement


is the agreement to arbitrate and sets what's arbitrable,


then the code of procedure is how you proceed in the


arbitration forum.

 What is wrong with that division?


MR. STARR:  Because it is building in a


procedural versus subject matter distinction, a sort of


way of looking at the code as opposed to determining --


and you used the term, Justice Ginsburg, statute of


limitations.  This is not a statute of limitations.  We


would guide the Court again -- refer the Court to the


second sentence of 10304 which draws the distinction --


this also goes back to Justice Kennedy's question -- that


with respect to this -- the first sentence tells us, 6


years eligible for submission.  It's not eligible for


submission --


QUESTION:  Mr. Starr, can I interrupt? 


MR. STARR:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Supposing the -- the claimant files a


piece of paper saying the events occurred 5 years and 11


months ago, and the -- a company comes in and files a


piece of paper and says, no, they occurred 6 years and 1 


month ago.  It depends on how you interpret it.  Who's


going to decide which is right? 


MR. STARR:  That would be a question of -- for


the court.  It's a question of arbitrability.


QUESTION:  So just filing a defensive pleading


would oust the arbitrator of jurisdiction --


MR. STARR:  Oh.

MR. STARR:  No.  Under the -- I'm sorry.  If


you're suggesting that -- and this is the Sorrells


example.  The -- at -- there, there has been, in effect,


an agreement, as it were, to allow the arbitrators to take


that first cut which comes back to Justice Kennedy's rule. 


They can, if the parties agree, make the eligibility


determination, but if they make it wrong, that's Sorrells. 


If -- if the evidence is it's 6 months --


QUESTION:  Well, so -- so in my hypothetical --


MR. STARR:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- it would be the arbitrator's


initial task to resolve the question of fact. 


MR. STARR:  Only under the circumstances that --


I want to be very clear.  The issue of eligibility is, in


fact, a question of arbitrability and it's presumptive --


it is for the courts to decide absent clear and convincing


evidence.


QUESTION:  So then am I correct --


MR. STARR:  But --


QUESTION:  -- that if the -- if the claimant


files a claim saying it happened 5 years ago, and the


company files an answer saying, no, it happened 6-and-a-


half years ago, they would immediately refer that to the

court? 


MR. STARR:  Well, you're suggesting a procedural


issue, namely, filing an answer which suggests to me that


the company has, under those circumstances, agreed for the


arbitrators to decide that issue. 


QUESTION:  Why?  Why?  The whole reason for


filing the answer is to get it out of the arbitration.


MR. STARR:  No, I'm sorry. 


QUESTION:  That's why you file.  Go ahead. 


MR. STARR:  You can, under those circumstances,


say the arbitrators -- I will allow the arbitrators to


take this initial cut at that.


QUESTION:  But you can, but what if you don't


say that?  What if you say, I am saying it was 6 years and


1 month and for that reason this eligibility question is


jurisdictional and it goes to a court?


MR. STARR:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And that's


what --


QUESTION:  All right, and if that's what they


say, then they go to the court. 


MR. STARR:  That's right. 


QUESTION:  So all they've got to do is file a


paper and we're out of arbitration and into court.  And


your theory --


MR. STARR:  You're -- you're in -- you're in the

court.  I was trying to respond to the specific --


specific hypothetical, but the principle is yes, you go to


the court.  What you would do under those circumstances is


not file an answer.  You would, in fact, say you go to


court and you go to court --


QUESTION:  And it's the same thing if -- if you


say that the accident occurred somewhere other than in the


work place.  And it --


MR. STARR:  There's -- it's the same principle. 


You're saying this is an eligible arbitration.


QUESTION:  All right.  And -- and doesn't


that --


MR. STARR:  Are you going to stand -- I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  No.  You go ahead. 


MR. STARR:  I was just going to say the issue is


are you going to stand on your rights under the contract. 


In your hypothetical, they're filing an answer which is


exactly what happened in Sorrells.  It goes through


arbitration and eventually this is -- I want to provide


the Court again with the Sorrells exam --


QUESTION:  They make --


MR. STARR:  I'm sorry. 


QUESTION:  They make their submission in a


motion to dismiss, not in an answer.  They say this is not


proper -- suited for arbitration because the time, in

fact, is different. 


MR. STARR:  You -- the point is you would file


that in court.


QUESTION:  Can you step back one second -- one


second from these details you're in?  Because I'm seeing


it not as a matter of detail.  What we're after is the


parties' intent.  In most places in the law, the law of


arbitration in this area is either neutral or sometimes


favorable to arbitration.  But there is one exception. 


The one exception is where the parties may or may not have


agreed to arbitrate arbitrability.  And there we,


interestingly enough, use a presumption that's very


hostile to finding the intent to have the arbitrators


arbitrate arbitrability. 


Now, in terms of the reason for that hostility,


how does that apply here?  I would think, at first blush,


it shouldn't apply at all.  Why?  Because we're talking


about rules of an arbitration forum.  And rules of an


arbitration forum -- after all, they're more expert in.


And moreover, the parties have agreed to go to arbitration


in a lot of circumstances anyway, so they at least know


something of what they're talking about.  Why would we


want to apply so hostile an interpret -- hostile a


presumption as to what their intent really is in this kind


of an area?

 MR. STARR:  Justice Breyer, we're asking you not


to apply a presumption at all.  We want you to follow the


intent of the parties --


QUESTION:  Oh, well, fine.  If no exception --


if no -- if -- if that's really what you mean, then you do


not mean that there has to be clear and unmistakable


evidence.  What I mean by my assumption is these words,


clear and unmistakable evidence, because once we're out of


that box, then I think we're right into what Justice


Kennedy said and that's the end of the case.  But, I mean,


it's only those words, clear and unmistakable, that help


you, and that's what I mean by the hostile presumption.


MR. STARR:  But again, the presumption and the


analysis in First Options goes to where, in fact, the


parties have not spoken to this issue.  We believe the


parties have spoken to the issue through the NASD rules


for the reasons that we have stated, and that is, it's not


that we're seeking to build in some new presumption.  To


the contrary, we're suggesting --


QUESTION:  No, I know.  But would you agree --


you want it clear and unmistakable or not?  Is that the


standard or not? 


MR. STARR:  That's the standard with respect to


-- the First Options presumption works for us.  What we're


relying on is the intent of the parties as articulated in

the rules, and again, the NASD has said, here's the reason


for the rule.


QUESTION:  Can I -- can I ask you about the


rules, about 10324 in particular which deals with the


interpretation of provisions of code? 


MR. STARR:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  I assume your -- the -- the other


side says that -- that that provision gives the arbitrator


the power to decide whether 6 years have elapsed or not. 


If it did that, I suppose it would also give the


arbitrator the power to decide whether the injury was one


that occurred in the work place; that is, whether the


subject matter was also --


MR. STARR:  The same logic applies.


QUESTION:  I don't see how you could limit it to


the one and -- and not apply it to the other, could you?


MR. STARR:  I don't think that they could. 


QUESTION:  Shall be empowered to -- so how do


you read it?  Shall be empowered to interpret and


determine the applicability of all provisions.  How do you


read it?  Meaning what?  Once he has -- once he has


jurisdiction. 


MR. STARR:  Once the arbitrator has juris --


QUESTION:  Within the scope of --


MR. STARR:  -- arbitrators have jurisdiction,

they are empowered to interpret the code.  But it would be


passing strange to suggest that prior to arbitration a


number of the provisions of the code precede the


appointment of the arbitrators and go to the powers of the


director of arbitration.  Therefore, it makes no sense to


say that the arbitrators can by virtue of the all


language, which this Court has said in a variety of


contexts, TWA, any number of contexts, to the effect that


that breadth, if anything, raises ambiguity. 


I just to -- if I may respond, I believe again


the First Options presumption is the default presumption. 


But we would guide the Court and we rest our case on


10304 --


QUESTION:  So you don't think you even need it. 


You don't think you even need the presumption. 


MR. STARR:  That's correct, because we think the


parties' intent is clear and the NASD is clear with


respect to why this rule exists.  It exists because long,


stale claims, as good as the arbitration forum is -- and


it's a very fine forum.  It's been used in the industry


since 1872.  But it does not work for long, stale claims. 


You can't say let's arbitrate a claim from 1929 --


QUESTION:  Well, nobody is questioning the


6-year limitation, and the question is who decides it. 


And I'm still left with the anomaly that a limitation,

applicable only in the arbitration forum, gets decided by


a court.  It's not a limitation on court action.  It's not


an all-purpose.  It's not saying this -- these parties


will arbitrate -- will -- will have this dispute.  This


dispute will be dead after 6 years.  You've conceded that


that's not so.  The dispute might be alive for 12 years


depending on what the State law is.


Isn't it odd that -- to read a contract to say


that a rule governing only the arbitration forum and not


the court is decided by the court? 


MR. STARR:  It's not odd in this context where


the original agreement -- there was not, Justice Ginsburg,


an agreement, in paragraph 19 of the original client


access agreement, to arbitrate in some generic,


undifferentiated way.  It is to arbitrate under the rules


of either a self-regulatory organization or an exchange --


QUESTION:  But that would --


QUESTION:  Mr. Starr, I guess the same anomaly


occurs when -- when the dispute goes to whether the


primary conduct is covered.  Isn't there the same


anomaly --


MR. STARR:  It's the -- it's --


QUESTION:  -- if the court decides it?  And if


the court decides it, the arbitration can't go forward


even though the plaintiff may have a cause of action

before that court --


MR. STARR:  It's the --


QUESTION:  -- for the conduct that -- that is


not arbitrable. 


MR. STARR:  It is the same principle in terms of


to what did the parties agree.  And I think Justice


Ginsburg is resisting -- I'm inferring -- resisting the


idea that something that is in the code could somehow be


in the contract.  We would respectfully disagree and say


that will, indeed, create havoc in the securities --


QUESTION:  What I was saying is that there's a


difference between a code of procedure that says we agree


to arbitrate and then this is the rules governing the


arbitration forum when you're in arbitration.  The parties


have agreed to a code of procedure for arbitration. 


That's how I'm reading this. 


MR. STARR:  But, Justice Ginsburg, I would guide


you back to 10304 and its language and the term eligible. 


I think, with all due respect, that that interpretation


does grave violence to the term eligible for submission. 


Eligible cannot mean that you go to the university and


then they said, whoops, you're now out.  It cannot -- and


there needs to be a gatekeeper here --


QUESTION:  But it could be if you say that all


this is is a code of procedure, like the Federal rules.

 MR. STARR:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  And if that's what you -- if you say


we opt for arbitration and we opt for it to proceed under


this set of procedural rules.


MR. STARR:  May I briefly respond? 


QUESTION:  Very briefly.


MR. STARR:  Justice Ginsburg, our submission is


rigorously enforce the contract.  This is part of the


contract.  That is what Dean Witter v. Byrd says.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Starr.


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
