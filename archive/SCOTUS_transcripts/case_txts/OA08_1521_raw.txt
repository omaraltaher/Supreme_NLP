CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We’ll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-1521, McDonald v. 

(10:13 a.m.) 

The City of Chicago. 

Mr. Gura. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN GURA 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. GURA:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Although Chicago's ordinances cannot survive 

the faithful application of due process doctrines, there 

is an even simpler, more essential reason for reversing 

the lower court's judgment.  The Constitution's plain 

text, as understood by the people that ratified it, 

mandates this result. 

In 1868, our nation made a promise to the 

McDonald family; they and their descendants would 

henceforth be American citizens, and with American 

citizenship came the guarantee enshrined in our 

Constitution that no State could make or enforce any law 

which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of 

American citizenship. 

The rights so guaranteed were not trivial. 

The Civil War was not fought because States were

attacking people on the high seas or blocking access to 

the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.  The rights 

secured by the Fourteenth Amendment were understood to 

include the fundamental rights honored by any free 

government and the personal guarantees of the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Of course, this 

argument is contrary to the Slaughter-House Cases, which 

have been the law for 140 years.  It might be simpler, 

but it's a big -- it's a heavy burden for you to carry 

to suggest that we ought to overrule that decision. 

MR. GURA:  Your Honor, the Slaughter-House 

Cases should not have any stare decisis effect before 

the Court.  The Court has always found that when a case 

is extremely wrong, when there is a great consensus that 

it was simply not decided correctly, especially in a 

constitutional matter, it has less force. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What injustice has --

has been caused by it that we have to remedy?  Meaning 

States have relied on having no grand juries; States 

have relied on not having civil trials in certain money 

cases; they have relied on regulating the use of 

firearms based on us, the Court, not incorporating the 

Privileges and Immunities Clause in the way that you 

identify it.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What -- in which ways 

has ordered liberty been badly affected? 

MR. GURA:  Justice Sotomayor, States may 

have grown accustomed to violating the rights of 

American citizens, but that does not bootstrap those 

violations into something that is constitutional. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you saying that the 

rights -- if you could clarify your conception of 

privileges and immunities.  Am I right in thinking that 

to keep and bear arms would be included even if we had 

no Second Amendment, as you envision privileges and 

immunities? 

MR. GURA:  Justice Ginsburg, that is 

correct.  The framers and the public understood the 

term --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But -- just tell us the 

dimensions of what it is.  I mean, we have the eight 

amendments, so I know you say that's included.  Keep and 

bear arms would be included even absent the Second 

Amendment.  What unenumerated rights would we be 

declaring privileges and immunities under your 

conception of it? 

MR. GURA:  Although it's impossible to give 

a full list of all the unenumerated rights that might be 

protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause, just

as it’s impossible to do so under the Due Process 

Clause, at least with respect to the Privileges and 

Immunities Clause we have wonderful historical 

guideposts.  There are --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Gura, do you think it’s 

at all easier to bring the Second Amendment under the 

Privileges and Immunities Clause than it is to bring it 

under our established law of substantive due process? 

MR. GURA:  It's --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it easier to do it under 

privileges and immunities than it is under substantive 

due process? 

MR. GURA:  It’s easier in terms, perhaps, 

of -- of the text and history, the original public 

understanding of --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, no.  I'm not talking 

about whether -- whether the Slaughter-House Cases were 

right or wrong.  I'm saying, assuming we give, you know, 

the Privileges and Immunities Clause your definition, 

does that make it any easier to get the Second Amendment 

adopted with respect to the States? 

MR. GURA:  Justice Scalia, I suppose the 

answer to that would be no, because --

why are you asking us to overrule 150, 140 years of

prior law, when -- when you can reach your result under 

substantive due -- I mean, you know, unless you’re 

bucking for a -- a place on some law school faculty --

(Laughter.) 

MR. GURA:  No.  No.  I have left law school 

some time ago, and this is not an attempt to -- to 

return. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I mean, what you 

argue is the darling of the professoriate, for sure, 

but it's also contrary to 140 years of our jurisprudence. 

Why do you want to undertake that burden instead of just 

arguing substantive due process?  Which, as much as I 

think it's wrong, I have -- even I have acquiesced in it. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. GURA:  Justice Scalia, we would be 

extremely happy if the Court reverses the lower court 

based on the substantive due process theory that we 

argued in the Seventh Circuit.  And, indeed, had the 

Seventh Circuit accepted our substantive due process 

theory, which was our primary theory in the court below, 

we might not be here, or perhaps we would be here in a 

different posture. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that -- that court 

does not have the prerogative to overturn any of this 

Court's decisions, and I think it said -- said as much.

So it was kind of a pass-through in the court of 

appeals. 

But I really would like you to answer the 

question that you didn't have an opportunity to finish 

answering, and that is:  What other enumerated rights? 

What does the privileges and immunities of United States 

citizenship embrace? 

MR. GURA:  Of the unenumerated rights, 

Justice Ginsburg? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes. 

MR. GURA:  Well, the framers clearly used 

language that to them meant rights beyond those 

guaranteed in the first eight amendments.  And whenever 

they spoke about those unenumerated rights, they gave 

some concrete examples.  So I think that there might be 

two categories of unenumerated rights if a claim were 

before the court under that provision. 

If a right is, for example, the sort of 

right that was mentioned in the Civil Rights Act of 

1866, the piece of legislation enacted by a 

supermajority of Congress, where the Congress said, over 

President Johnson's veto, here are the rights of 

American citizenship, and they are -- they listed:  To 

make and enforce contracts; to sue, be parties, and give 

evidence; to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and

convey real and personal property.  That's the sort of 

right that would be easy to find because there is a 

contemporaneous source for telling us --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even though -- even 

though a large portion of the population at that time 

didn't have those rights? 

MR. GURA:  The large -- the population at 

the time that did not have those rights needed their 

protection, primarily in the South, which is why the 

Civil Rights Act --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  No, throughout --

throughout the nation at the time. 

MR. GURA:  I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did married women at that 

time across the nation have the right to contract, to 

hold property, to sue and be sued? 

MR. GURA:  Married women were considered 

citizens of the United States, just like children were 

considered citizens.  However, the law did not always 

protect people fully, and we've made great strides in 

this country giving a greater level of protection to --

to certain rights.  We understand certain rights better 

today than we did 140 years ago, and the fact that First 

Amendment rights weren’t fully respected, Second 

Amendment rights weren’t always respected, Fourth

Amendment rights were not always understood well --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does it work just one 

way?  I mean, if the notion is that these are principles 

that any free society would adopt, well, a lot of free 

societies have rejected the right to keep and bear arms. 

MR. GURA:  As we mentioned -- as we 

mentioned in our brief, this Court in Benton v. Maryland 

decided that henceforth American history and tradition 

are important to consider what rights are protected in 

this country.  It's true that our friends overseas who 

have more or less civilized, free societies don't 

respect rights to the same level that we do.  For 

example, England, which is a free society, has a 

monarchy.  They have hereditary lords in parliament. 

They don't have First Amendment protection. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But this -- then it's not 

one expression of this unenumerated rights, natural rights, 

or the rights that any free society -- basic to a free 

society.  So you -- you have to trim your definition. 

It's not basic to any free society. 

MR. GURA:  As understood by the people who 

ratified the Fourteenth Amendment.  It's not a 

free-flowing license, necessarily, for judges to 

announce unenumerated rights.  However, to the extent 

that we have unenumerated rights which the framers and

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, what about rights 

rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people? 

Would -- would that do the job? 

MR. GURA:  Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That happens to be the test 

we have used under substantive due process. 

MR. GURA:  That's correct and, as Judge 

O'Scannlain --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes. 

MR. GURA:  -- in the Ninth Circuit observed 

in the Nordyke decision, the Slaughter-House dissenters 

seemed to arrive at the same point, perhaps, that this 

Court did in the Glucksberg case. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Gura, can I ask you 

the same question Justice Ginsburg asked about:  What if 

there were no Second Amendment?  You say the right would 

still be protected under the Privileges and Immunities 

Clause.  What about -- would it also be protected under

Amendment?

importance of the right to protection -- and would that 

apply to the entire scope of the Second Amendment or just 

the right to keep the gun, a homeowner's right to keep a 

gun for self-protection against intruders into the home, 

under the -- without the Second Amendment, just the 

Liberty Clause? 

MR. GURA:  The Second Amendment is not so 

limited and neither is the right to arms, even outside 

the Second --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I'm assuming we don't have 

a Second Amendment for purposes of the substantive due 

process analysis.  I'm asking you what is the scope of 

the right to own a gun that is protected by the Liberty 

Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?  Is it just the 

right to have it at -- at home, or is the right to 

parade around the streets with guns? 

MR. GURA:  An unenumerated right to arms in 

the absence of the Second Amendment would be, perhaps --

probably identical to that secured by the Second 

Amendment, because the Second Amendment codified the 

understanding of that right that people have 

historically had in the country.  So there would not be 

a difference between the right to arms if it were a part 

of the Second Amendment or --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In -- in that 

context, is your position that the rights that are 

incorporated as essential to the concept of ordered 

liberty, do they bring all of our decisions with them? 

When you say the First Amendment is covered, does that 

mean New York Times v. Sullivan is incorporated as well? 

Or is it only some lesser version of the incorporated 

right? 

MR. GURA:  With respect to the substantive 

due process argument that we’re making? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes. 

MR. GURA:  We are not challenging -- we are 

not the party that’s before the Court that is 

challenging anything that has gone on before in terms of 

substantive due process.  We believe that those cases 

were by and large decided appropriately, and if the 

Court wishes to reconsider any of them for some reason, 

it -- that has really nothing to do --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, I understood the Chief 

Justice's question -- maybe I misunderstood it, but my 

understanding of the question as important is this: 

Under incorporation by reference, the States are bound 

by the rights in all -- with all of the refinements and 

sophistication with which we interpret them for the 

Federal Government.  It's the same.  You don't just

apply the core of the right.  You apply all of the right 

as it is elaborated by the cases. 

Is -- is that same consequence -- does that 

same consequence follow if we adopt the privileges and 

immunities interpretation that you are urging upon us? 

MR. GURA:  Yes, Your Honor, because --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  How does that work? 

I think that would be useful for either you or 

Mr. Clement, if you've thought this through.  Is this 

right different from others? 

MR. GURA:  Well --

JUSTICE BREYER:  There are two ways.  One is 

that -- look at -- all you have to do is look at the 

briefs.  Look at the statistics.  You know, one side 

says a million people killed by guns.  Chicago says that 

their -- their gun law has saved hundreds, including --

and they have statistics -- including lots of women in 

domestic cases.  And the other side disputes it.  This 

is a highly statistical matter.  Without incorporation, 

it's decided by State legislatures; with, it's decided 

by Federal judges. 

Now, think of this, too:  That when you have 

the First Amendment, or some of the other amendments, 

there’s always a big area where it's free speech versus 

a whole lot of things, but not often free speech versus

life.  When it's free speech versus life, we very often 

decide in favor of life.  Here every case will be on one 

side guns, on the other side human life.  Statistics, 

balancing life versus guns.  How are Federal judges in 

your opinion, rather than legislatures in the States in 

a Federal system -- how are Federal judges supposed to 

carry this out?  I want to see where we’re going. 

MR. GURA:  Federal judges should carry this 

out in the same way that was announced in this Court's 

decision in Heller.  So --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Heller, I didn't think, 

explained that with great -- I was dissenting, 

though.  I didn't think it explained it with total 

clarity, but that's a dissenter's view. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. GURA:  Heller stood for the proposition 

that some activities are within the core boundaries of a 

right, and so long as people wish to do something that 

is literally understood to be a part of the boundaries of 

the right, it is to be protected, and --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Let me be specific, suppose 

Chicago says, look, by banning handguns not in the 

hills, not hunting, nothing like that, nothing outside 

the city -- in the city, we save several hundred human 

lives every year.  And the other side says, we don't

think it is several hundred, and, moreover, that doesn't 

matter.  How do you decide the case? 

MR. GURA:  We decide that by looking, not to 

which side has the better statistics, but rather to what 

the framers said in the Constitution, because that 

policy choice was made for us in the Constitution. 

They --

JUSTICE BREYER:  You’re saying they can 

have -- no matter what, that the City just can't have 

guns even if they’re saving hundreds of lives -- they 

can’t ban them. 

MR. GURA:  The City cannot ban guns that are 

within the common use as protected by the right to arms. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  There’s a lot of 

statistical disagreement on whether the Miranda rule 

saves lives or not, whether it results in the release of 

dangerous people who have confessed to their crime, but 

the confession can't be used.  We don't -- we don't 

resolve questions like that on the basis of statistics, 

do we? 

MR. GURA:  That's correct, Justice Scalia,

of divergence from State to State.  And on that, I suppose, 

you would do statistics, wouldn't you?  Or the legislature 

would. 

MR. GURA:  Well, Your Honor, we do agree 

that statistics are not important to determine whether 

or not a right --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  For the judges.  For the

MR. GURA:  That's right.

legislatures.

fact that there is a constitutional right at issue, and

enumerated in the Constitution are entitled to a greater 

measure of respect.

MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Under this court's existing jurisprudence, 

the case for incorporating the Second Amendment through 

the Due Process Clause is remarkably straightforward. 

The Second Amendment, like the First and the Fourth, 

protects a fundamental preexisting right that is 

guaranteed to the people -- -

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Clement, would you 

comment on Justice Kennedy's question about whether that 

necessarily incorporates every jot and tittle of the 

Federal right into the Federal, keeping in mind that 

with regard to trial by jury in criminal cases, there’s 

a difference.  It’s nonunanimous juries.  Why does this 

incorporation have to be every bit as broad as the 

Second Amendment itself?

outlier.  For most of the provisions and as far as I 

know all of the substantive provisions of the Bill of 

Rights that have been incorporated against the States, 

this Court has incorporated basically all the 

jurisprudence that comes with that. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, what is the last 

case in which we incorporated a substantive provision? 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I guess maybe it's Mapp, 

is one way of thinking about it.  I mean --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mapp was a procedural 

case. 

MR. CLEMENT: -- I could quibble about that --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mapp was a Fourth Amendment 

case.  I'm asking you cases involving incorporation of 

substantive rights, as opposed to procedural rights. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  The procedural cases come 

in under the due process language, but the substantive 

cases comes under the word "liberty," and "liberty" 

picks up the First Amendment and so forth.  And I take 

it it's the word "liberty" that picks up the Second 

Amendment.  And if it does, why does it have to be 

precisely the same scope as the Second Amendment? 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, sure.  We could quibble 

whether -- I think of the Fourth Amendment as more of a

substantive guarantee.  But in any event, with respect 

to certainly like the First Amendment guarantees that 

this Court has incorporated through the liberty -- the 

liberty subclause, if you will, of the Due Process 

Clause, there too I think this Court -- certainly I 

understand this Court's jurisprudence as incorporating 

all of the cases that go along with that. 

So New York Times v. Sullivan is the law of 

all 50 States, et cetera, et cetera.  And I think that 

in a sense the virtue of that approach is probably even 

more apparent with the Second Amendment than it might be 

with some other jurisprudence --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I guess we -- I guess we 

have applied substantive due process with regard to the 

necessity of permitting homosexual conduct and with 

respect to the necessity of permitting abortion on 

demand.  We have not adopted a more rigid rule for the 

Federal Government than we have adopted for the States 

in either of those instances, have we? 

MR. CLEMENT:  That's also right, Your Honor, 

though I guess I would stress that I think that, 

whatever the debate’s about substantive due process when 

it comes to unenumerated rights, I think the gist of 

this Court's incorporation doctrine is that the textual 

provisions of the Bill of Rights stand in a favored

position with respect to incorporation.  And so Glucksberg 

has its discussion about the standard for unenumerated 

rights, but it starts that off by saying of course the 

Bill of Rights are different.  And, of course, the Bill 

of Rights, I think, as I read this Court's selective --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  They stand in a favored 

position, but we've never said had to be literally 

all the way down the line, or we couldn't have done 

the criminal jury -- nonunanimous criminal jury case. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Again, though, it's 

interesting that the one place that I -- that I see where 

the Court has not effectively translated all the case law 

is one of the procedural rights, the Sixth Amendment 

criminal jury right.  And I think with respect to the 

substantive rights -- and I think the alliance here or 

the similarity between the First and the Second 

Amendments are very stark in this respect -- this Court 

has incorporated essentially not just the amendment and 

not just the right, but all of the jurisprudence as 

well. 

And, you know, I would -- just to dwell for 

a moment if I'd could on the -- on the First and the Second 

Amendment, I think it's striking, very striking, that if 

this Court's not going to reconsider its Privileges or 

Immunities Clause jurisprudence, the Cruikshank case

actually stands as very good precedent for incorporating 

the Second Amendment, just as it was the precedent this 

Court relied on in incorporating the assembly and petition 

rights of the First Amendment in the De Jonge case.  And 

the reason is Cruikshank -- the whole reason that 

Cruikshank said the First and Second Amendments aren't 

privileges of national citizenship is because they were 

preexisting rights that didn't depend on the 

Constitution for their existence. 

That seems to me to be a pretty good working 

definition of what a fundamental right is, one that is 

so fundamental and basic that it preexisted our very 

Constitution.  And so it's not surprising that De Jonge 

cited Cruikshank as favorable precedent for 

incorporation. 

I think the exact same logic would apply to 

the Second Amendment here, and, as I say, I do think the 

consequence of that, certainly the most logical 

consequence, would be to carry over the jurisprudence 

under the Second Amendment.  Now, right now, that's not 

carrying over a lot, right?  That's carrying over the 

Heller case. 

But I think in a way that points up to the 

fact that one of the virtues of incorporation is that, 

because the Miller decision of this Court sowed

confusion, we don’t have substantial Second Amendment 

jurisprudence.  And I would think that it's going to be 

difficult enough to develop the Second Amendment 

jurisprudence that you wouldn't want to make it more 

difficult by having to develop a Federal Second 

Amendment jurisprudence and then some sort of shadow 

version of that jurisprudence for the States. 

And I think in the more recent incorporation 

cases, this Court was quite candid that it wasn't going 

to adopt sort of a shadow version of the Federal 

guarantee or some watered-down version of the Federal 

guarantee, but it really saw the virtue of incorporating 

not just the right but the jurisprudence that came with 

that right. 

And so I do think that's in a sense 

something that counts in favor of incorporating the 

Second Amendment and doing so through the Due Process 

Clause, the same way this Court has dealt with the other 

substantive guarantees of the Bill of Rights.  And I 

think if you apply that jurisprudence, the case really 

is very straightforward.  In fact, I think if you 

compare the First Amendment and the Fourth Amendment to 

the Second Amendment, they have the same textual 

guarantee to the people, they trace their origins to 

preexisting rights back to the English Bill of Rights,

back to even earlier constitutional history. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's true of the 

criminal jury trial right, too, all of those things? 

And yet we don't -- it's not exactly the same.  I just 

don't see why it has to be exactly the same.  I can 

understand your argument that it should be substantially 

the same, but I don't see that there's anything in the 

text of the Fourteenth Amendment that would justify 

saying it must be precisely the same, or of any of our 

cases. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well -- and, again, Justice 

Stevens, you know, since I think that -- that the 

incorporation clause is -- I mean, the incorporation 

jurisprudence is, to put it lightly, a gloss on the text 

of the Due Process Clause --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Incorporation 

jurisprudence is -- we haven't had an incorporation case 

for 30 years or more. 

MR. CLEMENT:  That's right.  That's right, 

Justice Stevens.  But I guess I would say is that, 

putting the Sixth Amendment to one side, which I think 

is a bit of an outlier in the jurisprudence here, I 

think the trend of all of this Court's incorporation 

jurisprudence has been more towards complete 

incorporation of the right and the jurisprudence.  So --

I mean, Mapp is a perfect illustration. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That still allows 

scope, once you determine that the right is 

incorporated, for recognizing that the States might have 

broader interests that the Federal Government doesn't 

have.  But I would suppose that would come up in the 

application of the right, rather than in an effort to 

determine whether parts of it are incorporated or not. 

MR. CLEMENT:  That's right, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and I think the same thing can be 

said for any other one of the other incorporated 

amendments.  So I think the same thing might be true in 

the First Amendment.  There are certainly going to be 

situations that the Federal government confronts that 

the State governments won't confront the exact analogue 

situation and vice versa. 

Now, you know, there may be unique issues 

about national parks that the States aren’t going to 

have to confront, and the jurisprudence can take that 

into account.  But I think that's far different from 

saying that we really are going to have this shadow 

jurisprudence for one of the provisions. 

And I think, again, to go back to Mapp just 

as an illustration, when this Court first incorporated 

the Fourth Amendment and said, well, we’ll talk about

the Fourth -- the exclusionary rule.  We’ll just 

incorporate the Fourth Amendment's basic guarantee.  And 

the trend of later cases was to say, no, kind of in for 

a penny, in for a pound --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  You’re -- you’re dead right --

MR. CLEMENT:  -- let's bring the 

jurisprudence with --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- about the majority of 

the Court, but it's interesting that during this whole 

period, Justice Harlan staked out a separate position on 

whether it should be just the substance of the right or 

the -- every detail.  And we have followed Justice Harlan, 

rather than the majority in a number of cases in -- in 

the recent years. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well --

about the way in which the Bill of Rights applies to the 

States? 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think if we are going 

to go back, maybe we should go back to the first Justice 

Harlan, who actually had an -- an approach, I think, 

that would be much more similar to the approach --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But there is a difference. 

MR. CLEMENT:  -- that we take in this case 

and that Mr. Gura takes in this case. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  There is a difference here 

with the other amendments.  There is a difference, and the 

other amendments -- you have the First Amendment’s, 

the First Amendment expression. 

Here we have right in the amendment written 

a militia-related clause.  And the way that -- the 

way -- the way that the right might be incorporated in 

respect to that is light years different from the way 

it might be interpreted if you think what it is, is the 

right to have a gun to shoot a burglar.  They’re just 

two separate things. 

And as to the first, it's pretty hard for me 

to see why you’d incorporate it, for reasons I won't 

go into.  As to the second, I understand it.  So we’re 

starting with a difference in purposes at the least. 

And shouldn't that make a difference in how you

I -- what I don't understand is why, given the way that 

this Court wrestled in the Heller decision with how to 

basically apply the operative clause in light of the 

prefatory clause, why one would want to come to a 

different conclusion --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because the -- one of the 

reasons --

MR. CLEMENT:  -- with respect to the States. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- at least, is that --

primarily a right to raise an army through Parliament

of that brief, and you’ll see the differences, even 

accepting Heller. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can respond if 

you want, briefly.

self-defense right, which goes a long way to understand 

why the Heller decision came out the way that it came 

out. 

And I would simply finish by noting that the 

one thing that I think we can come to a conclusion about 

Blackstone is the very fact that Blackstone dwelled on 

the right is good evidence that it's a fundamental right 

that should apply to the States.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. FELDMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The Second Amendment should not be 

incorporated and applied to the States because the right 

it protects is not implicit in the concept of ordered 

liberty.  States and local governments have been the 

primary locus of firearms regulation in this country for 

the last 220 years. 

Firearms, unlike anything else that is the 

subject of a provision of the Bill of Rights, are 

designed to injure and kill.  And the very same features 

that make firearms valuable for self-defense as the

JUSTICE SCALIA:  When is the last time an 

opinion of ours made that the test, implicit in the 

concept of ordered liberty?  It sounds very nice.  But 

when is the last time we used it?  I think it was 1937. 

MR. FELDMAN:  I don't believe it was, Your 

Honor.  The --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Has it been the basis of 

our decision in any case since Palko? 

MR. FELDMAN:  I think the -- the Court

Since then, it has used it in -- not in corporation cases 

as recently as the Glucksberg case.  It used it in Mapp. 

It has used it in other cases, but I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And it was also the Harlan 

view, although a separate opinion in the Griswold case 

and in Poe v. Ullman. 

Do you think that it best describes the 

approach that the Court has used over the years? 

MR. FELDMAN:  Yes, I do. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I was going to ask 

Mr. Clement what test he thought the Court used.  If 

you looked at all the cases, you think implicit in

reason why.  In 1833, this Court has held in Barron v. 

Baltimore, in a -- in a ruling that Chief Justice 

Marshall said was not a difficult one, although 

important, that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the 

States. 

As far as I know, no justice has ever 

disagreed with that -- with that ruling or suggested he 

was wrong in so ruling.  From -- it was -- the only 

reason -- and when the Fourteenth Amendment was passed 

and ratified in the late 1860s, again, the -- the 

framers did not directly apply the Bill of Rights to the 

States.  They gave us some generalities. 

And the Court has always understood that 

when it's applying the Due Process Clause, what it asks 

is not just is something in the Constitution, but is 

this something that’s so fundamental it's a necessary 

condition --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is the right to trial by 

jury implicit in the concept of ordered liberty? 

MR. FELDMAN:  I --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  My goodness --

MR. FELDMAN:  I think that it --

countries that don't give the right to trial by jury,

MR. FELDMAN:  I think it is in the following 

sense:  When you’re talking about a procedural right 

that’s embedded in a particular procedural system, you 

have to look at how that system operates and how the --

the right works within that particular system. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I think that's 

exactly -- that's exactly right.  And that is what the 

Court elaborated on in Duncan.  I do think the focus is 

our system of ordered liberty, not any abstract system 

of ordered liberty.  You can say Japan is a free 

country, but it doesn't have the right to trial by -- by 

jury. 

The -- the concept only makes sense, 

I think, if you limit it to our system.  Under our 

system, as you said, the -- the right to a jury is 

essential.

was addressing in Heller was not -- again, was not how 

important the Second Amendment right was, or how 

implicit it is in our system; it was what did it say and 

what did the -- what restrictions did the framers of the 

Second Amendment impose on the Federal Government. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I thought its 

rationale was that because of its fundamental character, 

the right to bear arms must be understood as separate 

from the qualifying phrase of the militia clause, all 

people, most people in the United States.  The public 

meaning of the Second Amendment was that there was an 

individual right to bear arms, and that's because it was 

fundamental.  If it's not fundamental, then Heller is 

wrong, it seems to me. 

MR. FELDMAN:  No, I -- I -- I don't think 

that that's right.  The question is what right -- what 

did they impose upon the -- as restrictions upon the 

government when the Second Amendment was ratified.  And 

as to that, it's not a question of whether it's 

fundamental any more than with the Grand Jury Clause or 

with the civil jury trial right --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't see how you 

can read --

MR. FELDMAN:  -- under the Seventh Amendment. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't see how you can

read Heller and not take away from it the notion that the 

Second Amendment, whether you’d want to label it 

fundamental or not, was extremely important to the framers 

in their view of what liberty meant. 

MR. FELDMAN:  I -- it was important, but 

actually what Heller says is this:  The Second Amendment 

preexisted the -- its inclusion -- or the right that's 

in the Second Amendment preexisted its inclusion in the 

Bill of Rights.  But the reason it was codified, the 

reason it -- the reason it was put into the Bill of Rights 

was because the framers were concerned about the Federal 

Government disarming the militia. 

The right of self-defense, which had been 

previously recognized and highly valued, I would agree, 

was -- had -- according to Heller, quote, “had little to 

do with its codification” --

Constitution.

as opposed to other ones that they didn't put there. 

It's either there or not. 

MR. FELDMAN:  That -- I agree as far as the 

Federal Government goes.  But now there’s a different 

question being asked, and the Second Amendment in this 

respect is unlike any of the other amendments that have 

been incorporated. 

The same -- very same reason why the 

First -- the various rights in the First Amendment were 

put there in 1791 is exactly the reason why it was 

held -- why it was incorporated and applied to the 

States under the Fourteenth amendment.

Heller said.  And here's the difference -- is, it is it 

is now urged that this right is fundamental because of 

its importance, the importance of firearms in 

self-defense.  That was true also in 1791, but it 

wouldn't have been in the Constitution for that.  That 

had little to do with putting it in the Constitution. 

This is a right that has always been subject to the 

political process and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, sure, and it's 

still going to be subject to the political process if 

the Court determines that it’s incorporated in the Due 

Process Clause.  All the arguments you make against 

incorporation, it seems to me, are arguments you should 

make in favor of regulation under the Second Amendment. 

We haven't said anything about what the content of the 

Second Amendment is beyond what was said in Heller.

you make is, well, given this context, you should not be 

able to have concealed carry.  Well, maybe that's 

right, but that doesn't mean you don't incorporate the 

Second Amendment to allow you to enforce that type of 

regulation. 

MR. FELDMAN:  No, I don't think so.  I think 

-- the argument that I’m making is that States and local 

governments under the political process, which as far as 

we know, if the only issue had been self-defense, the 

framers would have been satisfied to leave this to the 

States and to leave this to the political process, and not 

to put it in the Constitution -- that -- that -- that as 

far as the right to self-defense goes, that’s something 

that has always been effectively regulated through the 

political process and especially at the State and local 

level.  And through our history, as technology has 

changed, State and local regulation has altered to draw 

the balance that has to be drawn. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And your position is that a 

-- a State or local government could completely ban all 

firearms? 

MR. FELDMAN:  If the State and local 

government did that, I think would it raise two 

questions.  One question would be, there is always 

review under the Due Process Clause and under the Equal

Protection Clause for provisions that are arbitrary. 

And I’d want to know why a State had done that.  It’s 

certainly relevant that in the last 220 years, no 

State has done that or even come close, and, in fact, as 

the briefs on the other side of the case from some of 

the States show, they are quite in the opposite direction. 

But the second point would be --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I don't understand. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What is the due process 

liberty --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What basis would there be

that.

it in -- in this country.  The second question --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  The reason is guns are 

dangerous. 

MR. FELDMAN:  The second argument would be, 

the Court at that point, if in the very unlikely event a 

that a State or local government tried to do that, then 

the Court might have to wrestle at that point with the 

question of the relationship between self-defense and 

the right to keep and bear arms.  In other words, this 

Court has never said --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But would self-defense be 

part of liberty under the Due -- substantive meaning of 

the Due Process Clause? 

MR. FELDMAN:  I mean, if by that is, do you 

have a substantive right to self-defense, the Court 

actually has never answered that question, but I’m 

willing to accept that there is such a right for --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you’ve given -- you 

said there were two reasons.  So you have given us both 

in your answer to Justice Alito's question?

self-defense, has the State prohibited you from 

reasonable means of exercising that right?  But that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Without repeating that and 

just so I understand your position, how could some 

member of the Court write the -- this opinion to say 

that this right is not fundamental, but that Heller was 

correct? 

MR. FELDMAN:  I -- the Court would just say 

that what Heller held was if you look at the meanings 

that the words in the Second Amendment had, the common 

meaning -- as the Court said in the Heller opinion --

the common meanings that the word had in 1791, it 

imposed limitation on the state.  It took a preexisting 

right that had not been -- it was not codified in the 

Constitution, and it said, this self-defense right we 

need in the Constitution in order -- in order to protect 

the militia against being disarmed by the Federal 

Government. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That sounds an awful 

lot to me like the argument we heard in Heller on the 

losing side. 

MR. FELDMAN:  Well, it's actually what the 

Court said in its opinion.  What the Court said in its 

opinion is the reason it was codified was the concern 

that the framers had with the -- that the Federal

Government might disarm the militia.  Not self-defense. 

Self-defense according to the Court in Heller, quote, 

"had little to do with the codification of the right." 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  They said that is the 

reason it was codified.  They did not say that that is 

the function of what was codified.  The function of what 

was codified was to enforce the traditional right of the 

people to bear arms. 

MR. FELDMAN:  And that -- that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And to say that that wasn't 

the reason it was codified doesn't say anything about 

what it consists of. 

MR. FELDMAN:  That -- that's correct, and 

I'm not arguing today about what it consists of, but the 

point being that this was a right that had been -- that 

the framers as far as we know would have been satisfied to 

leave to the political process if it was just a question 

of the feature of it.  But today --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me see if I understand 

your argument.  I thought you said a minute ago that if 

a State or local government were to ban firearms 

completely, this Court might hold that that violates 

substantive due process because the right to use a 

firearm for self-defense is -- might be held to be 

implicit in the concept of ordered liberty; is that

Official 

MR. FELDMAN:  That’s correct. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And -- but I thought you 

began by saying that the right to keep and bear arms is 

not implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. 

MR. FELDMAN:  The right to keep and bear 

arms that was recognized -- I don't think actually the 

right to keep and bear arms itself is.  Perhaps the 

right to self-defense is, and then like other rights, 

similar rights, if the Court were to hold that that is 

constitutionally protected, the question would be is the 

State now giving you sufficient means to exercise that 

right?  Not whatever means you want, but sufficient means 

so that you reasonably can exercise that right.  I 

would think that would be the only way that that kind of 

analysis could go, if you start off from self-defense. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Feldman, let me take 

your argument at -- at its face value.  Let's assume 

that the only reason it is there and the only purpose it 

serves is the militia purpose.  Isn't that militia 

purpose just as much defeated by allowing the States to 

take away the militia's arms as it would be by allowing 

the Federal Government to take away the militia's arms?

MR. FELDMAN:  But that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- even if you assume that 

the whole thing turns around the militia prologue, that 

prologue is just as -- just as important with respect to 

the State's depriving the people of arms. 

MR. FELDMAN:  Yes, but I don't think the 

argument -- the primary argument that’s being made today, 

that this is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty or 

sufficiently fundamental or whichever other formulas --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You’re switching horses 

now. 

MR. FELDMAN:  No, I'm not.  No --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's just focus on your 

argument that -- that -- that deals with the prologue. 

You say this is different because of that prologue.  But 

that prologue has just as much force if the States take 

away the militia's arms as if the Federal Government 

does. 

MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I think that few people 

today would say -- and in fact few people in 1868 would 

say that the concern to protect the State militias is 

something that's so fundamental or essential to a 

concept of ordered liberty or central to our system that 

it has to be --

MR. FELDMAN:  -- protected --

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- Suppose it is.  Assume for 

argument's sake that it is.  Still, I take from what 

you are saying that -- let's make up an imaginary 

importance of ordered liberty chart, and we give it to 

James Madison and the other framers.  And he would say, 

insofar as that right to bear arms is important for 

the purpose of maintaining the militia, it's high on 

the ordered liberty chart.  Insofar as the right to bear 

arms is there to shoot burglars, it's low on the ordered 

liberty chart. 

And if that's what they’d say, it's 

conceivable that part of this amendment would go through 

and be incorporated; namely, that part which would 

prevent a law that would disarm people to the extent 

they couldn't form militias.  But that part which would 

disarm people to the extent that they couldn't shoot 

burglars, that would not be incorporated. 

MR. FELDMAN:  It -- that would be -- that 

would be possible, but another -- another way to look at 

it is that the question that the Court had -- the Court 

has never answered the question, is this implicit in the 

concept of ordered liberty or should this be

JUSTICE ALITO:  If we took the approach 

that Justice Breyer outlined, would -- why would we not do 

the same thing with respect to all the applications of all 

of the amendments that up to this point have been regarded

decisions?  So why would we not look at all of our 

decisions under the First Amendment and the Fourth 

Amendment and the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth 

Amendment, and rank all of those interpretations on some

to Justice Breyer was, we understand that the Second 

Amendment is in the Constitution and binds the Federal 

Government, but it has always been understood, from 1868 

on, that before an amendment applies to the States, you 

need something more than just finding that it’s in the 

Constitution, and --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Feldman, our 

selective incorporation doctrine under the Due Process 

Clause does suggest that there are some rights that were

Is it the ordered liberty concept alone in 

our jurisprudence that you are relying upon, or is it 

any other articulation of our incorporation doctrine

standard, but the Court has certainly looked at our

As far as today, it is true that 44 States 

have some kind of recognition of a right to keep and 

bear arms.  Now, some of those States -- a couple of 

them, at least, two to four -- recognize that only in 

connection with the militia, and it's really quite 

different from the right that this Court recognized in 

Heller.  Many other of the rights that are recognized in 

State constitutions include provisions that really would 

be unheard of, and that actually point to the reasons 

why this is not fundamental, like, say, freedom of 

speech or freedom of religion.  They have provisions 

that say:  Subject to such regulation as the legislature 

may prescribe, or the like. 

And that points out the other difference. 

Because firearms are -- the same features that make them 

useful for self-defense make them also useful as 

instruments of violent crime, suicide, and accidental 

death.  Their -- regulation of these items has -- is a 

part of our tradition and --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  "Subject to such 

regulation" certainly excludes banning them entirely,

MR. FELDMAN:  With that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- would make a nullity 

of the constitutional requirement. 

MR. FELDMAN:  The overwhelming consensus 

among the State courts in interpreting the wide variety 

of different types of provisions that they have is that 

it imposes a reasonable regulation standard that is not 

violated by banning a particular weapon or a particular 

class of weapons, as long as you are allowing some kind 

of firearm, and that is not the right that this Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And is that what you’re

MR. FELDMAN:  No, what I'm saying -- I'm

embodied in the wide variety of different State 

constitutions -- the overwhelming consensus is that what 

the States have determined as a result of their own 

processes and in light of their own conditions is that 

you can't ban all kinds of firearms, but you can ban 

some kinds of firearms. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's fine. 

MR. FELDMAN:  And that is -- and the kinds 

of firearms that have traditionally been banned --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  We said as much in Heller. 

MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  Well -- and the 

kinds of firearms that have traditionally been banned by 

the States and that actually the period around the time 

of the Fourteenth Amendment is a good period to look. 

At or around that time, there are numerous States that 

had regulations barring the carrying and even that go up 

to the point of possession of pistols and Bowie knives, 

which are not firearms, but are also arms under the 

Second Amendment, and so on.

they banned carrying them anywhere in the jurisdiction, 

and in such a way that -- and some of the judicial

these weapons from our jurisdiction.  And they were 

generally upheld at that time. 

Now, those were responding to local 

conditions at the time, and generally, the history of 

firearms regulation, because of the risk that firearms 

pose, has been that in this country, it has been widely 

recognized that in many places it's appropriate to carry 

firearms.  And many jurisdictions have found, and 

reasonably found, that allowing broad use, carriage, and 

whatever of firearms is appropriate, but there are some 

jurisdictions that have found that's not to be the case, 

throughout our history. 

And that has been a State and local decision 

that has worked through the political process in those 

jurisdictions.  And that political process here is 

another distinction between the Second Amendment and 

some of the other amendments that have been 

incorporated -- is that one basis, I think, for 

incorporating the other amendments and for applying them 

against the States has been that there is a concern 

about a discrete minority or a highly unpopular view 

that’s not going to get a fair shake in the political 

process.  I don't think that has ever been the case 

here.  And as far as I know, the framers didn't think 

that was the case with respect to the right to keep and

It's a right that gets controlled in 

accordance with local conditions, with local cultures, 

and with local views about the necessarily difficult 

questions about how best to protect public safety.  That 

is -- that has been a part of our -- of our history 

since 1860, since --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But there -- but there are 

provisions of the Constitution, of the Bill of Rights, 

that have been incorporated against the States, where 

the States have substantial latitude and ample authority 

to impose reasonable regulations, rights respecting --

rights respecting property, the Cruel and Unusual 

Punishment Clause.  We look to see what the political 

process does.  We look to see -- why can't we do the 

same thing with firearms? 

MR. FELDMAN:  Well, it's just that the end 

-- I have really two points I’d like to make about that. 

One is the analysis the Court used in Heller.  In 

Heller, what the Court said is:  This is not the time to 

balance things; you cannot ban handguns. 

Now, there may be local -- there have been 

local jurisdictions before and there are now ones where 

they feel allowing some firearms, but banning handguns, 

is the best way to achieve public safety and to increase

the zone of ordered liberty for their people.  And those 

things would be apparently impermissible under Heller. 

But even more than that, Heller construed 

the Second Amendment's "bear" -- the word "bear," "to 

keep and bear arms" -- to mean the same thing as "carry" 

in this Court's case in Muscarello, much later.  And to 

carry -- generally to carry. 

Many -- there’s a long history of 

regulation of not just concealed carry, as the Court did 

recognize in Heller, but of banning open carry 

in a variety of jurisdictions.  Again, generally, it's 

someplace that is -- it has a particular problem; it's a 

city or something like that. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you think there is 

existing authority with reference to other provisions of 

the Bill of Rights that would allow us to incorporate 

just the core of Heller with respect to the States? 

Just the core of the Second Amendment with respect to 

the States, along the lines to this question Justice 

Stevens was asking earlier? 

MR. FELDMAN:  Well, I think that there would 

be --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if so, what's -- what 

case do we look to for that proposition? 

MR. FELDMAN:  I think really this -- I

cannot offhand think of a case that would lead you to 

that -- would lead to that. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  If you look to Justice 

Harlan's dissent in Griswold, where he says the 

Fourteenth Amendment stands on its own bottom and it can 

be either more or less than the provisions of the Bill of 

Rights, and there’s no reason in the world why this 

Court could not adopt the same position here and say: 

Insofar it’s incorporated, it applies only within the 

home.  The Court had ample precedent for that. 

MR. FELDMAN:  And actually the other point I 

make is if you approach it from the other point of view, 

the case has not been made here -- it hasn't even been 

brought -- that the City of Chicago is denying people 

the -- the right to have any kind of firearm or the 

right to have any kind of reasonable means of 

self-defense. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Is it 

the position of the City of Chicago that we should rely 

on Justice Harlan's dissent in Griswold? 

MR. FELDMAN:  No. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then your 

answer to Justice Stevens is no, you’re not going to 

follow that approach, right? 

MR. FELDMAN:  No, what I would say is that

--

what I would say is that if the Court -- what I was 

saying is that if the Court approaches it from the 

standpoint of perhaps if there is -- if the Court 

chooses in an appropriate case to recognize a 

fundamental right to self-defense, it would then raise 

those kinds of questions.  And someone could make the 

case that they are being denied any right to 

self-defense or any reasonable right to exercise 

self-defense because of a jurisdiction's firearms 

regulations; the Court could address that.  That's not a 

claim that has been made in this case; that's not a 

claim that could be made in this case because --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  See, the right to keep and 

bear arms is right there.  It's right there in the Bill 

of Rights.  Where do you find the right to self-defense? 

MR. FELDMAN:  Well, I --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you want us to 

impose that one on the States but not -- not the 

explicit guarantee of the right to keep and bear arms. 

That seems very strange. 

MR. FELDMAN:  No, actually I -- I don't want 

to impose that on the States.  I think it's very 

unlikely that the Court would ever be called upon to, 

because our history for the last 200 years -- 220 years 

had been of reasonable State and local regulation of

firearms that responds to local conditions, to local 

threats of violence, and so on that occur.  And I don't 

see any reason to think that there will be a 

jurisdiction that would try to sufficiently ban firearms 

that people wouldn't have a reasonable means of 

self-defense. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The District of Columbia 

did.  That’s what Heller said. 

MR. FELDMAN:  Well, the District of Columbia 

in any event is controlled by Second Amendment as it --

as it's written.  That's not the question in this case. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Would you be happy if we 

incorporated it and said reasonable regulation is part 

of the incorporation?  And how do we do that? 

MR. FELDMAN:  Well, there is the reasonable 

regulation standard.  There’s an article by Professor 

Winkler that we cite in our brief, that goes very 

extensively through the ways that State courts have 

dealt with their own rights to keep and bear arms and 

have adopted, really by overwhelming consensus, that 

kind of a reasonable regulation standard, which 

generally recognizes --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that Heller --

Heller allowed for reasonable regulation.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that the Heller 

decision allowed for reasonable regulation, and it gave a 

few examples, as Justice Scalia mentioned. 

MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  Well, it's just our 

view would be that what Chicago has done here, which is 

permit you to have a -- permit you to have long guns but 

ban handguns, is the kind of regulation that throughout 

our history jurisdictions in their own -- that are most 

familiar with their own particular needs, their own 

particular problems, and in a position to balance the --

the need for self-defense with the risks to the use of 

firearms -- for violence, for accidental death, and for 

suicide -- that the City of Chicago has come up with 

something that is well within our tradition.  And --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What you’re urging is 

really a mixed blessing for gun control advocates.  To 

the extent we sever the Federal guarantee from what the 

States are obliged to comport with, we encourage a 

stricter Federal Second Amendment, one that forbids all 

sorts of regulations that the Federal Government might 

otherwise be allowed to do, because it doesn't matter --

the States can take care of it. 

I mean, you know, if -- if you sever the 

two, you’re encouraging a broader prohibition at the 

Federal level, and that's what -- Heller was very

careful not to impose such a broad prohibition 

precisely because it realized that -- that this is a 

national problem. 

MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I think that, if I may --

that the restriction that the Second Amendment imposes 

on the Federal Government should be and is controlled by 

what the meaning of that Second Amendment was in 1791. 

It shouldn't vary one way or the other with whether 

there’s incorporation against the States. 

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN GURA 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. GURA:  Sure. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Counsel, at the -- at the 

very outset of your argument, Justice Sotomayor asked the 

question which, as I understood it, essentially said what 

are examples of privileges and immunities that are being 

denied by the States that -- which denial would be 

remedied by following your proposal to overrule the 

Slaughter-House case? 

And let's leave the Second Amendment out. 

Let's assume the Second Amendment is a wash; it's either 

going to be incorporated or not going to be incorporated

the same -- to the same extent under either the Privileges 

or Immunities Clause or the Due Process Clause.  Leaving 

the Due Process -- the Second Amendment out of it, what 

privileges and immunities are now being denied citizens 

of -- of the United States? 

MR. GURA:  Well, apart from the Second 

Amendment right, which is being denied to people in the 

United States by Chicago at least, there are other 

rights -- other rights enumerated in the first eight 

amendments that were thought to be the personal guarantees 

as well as certain unenumerated rights which were 

understood to be part of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What are examples of 

those?  The jury trial in civil cases? 

MR. GURA:  The jury trial --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And grand jury.  What 

else? 

MR. GURA:  There’s not much left, Your 

Honor.  Those are the only two provisions of the Bill of 

Rights that have not been held incorporated under due 

process, which informs us that perhaps we should have 

the Second Amendment incorporated.  There’s no reason 

to treat it any differently.  With respect to the 

unenumerated rights that perhaps are not being --

under -- under your view, every State would have to use a 

grand jury to bring criminal charges; no more information. 

And that every State would have to have a civil jury, if 

any party in the case requested it.  Is that --

MR. GURA:  Yes -- well, it's not just what 

we’re saying; it's what the framers of the Constitution 

said.  And as Justice Scalia noted in Apprendi, the right 

to a jury trial, for example, may not be efficient, but 

it is free. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's a criminal case; 

that's quite different. 

MR. GURA:  That's right.  We're talking 

about the Grand Jury Clause; we have 28 States right now 

out of the 50 that allow prosecutors to pursue felony 

charges without indictment by a grand jury, but the 

other 22 States do require it. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'm -- we’re using 

up your time.  But --

MR. GURA:  Sure. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- do you want me to leave 

the bench thinking grand jury indictment and civil trial 

and jury case -- that's it.  There's no other -- what are

protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Either --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't trouble you. 

MR. GURA:  No, it does not, and it shouldn't 

trouble the Court because the Court addresses due 

process cases all the time without saying we’re --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, does it include the 

right to contract? 

MR. GURA:  The right to contract --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't that an unenumerated 

right? 

MR. GURA:  That is literally understood by 

the framers to be an unenumerated right under the 

privileged immunities.  We know that because in the 

Civil Rights Act of 1866, that's the very first right 

that they mentioned as something that people in the South 

should be enjoying, because they were not allowed to 

pursue a livelihood. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your approach --

your original approach would give judges a lot more 

power and flexibility in determining what rights they 

think are a good idea than they have now with the 

constraints of the Due Process Clause. 

MR. GURA:  No, Your Honor; our approach 

might actually provide judges with perhaps no more than

approach is rooted in text and history.  It's not a 

license for judges to make up unenumerated rights that 

they believe --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Privileges and 

immunities give you a lot more flexibility than due 

process, because it’s not limited to procedural --

where you don't have to deal with the hurdle that it's 

limited to procedural by the text. 

MR. GURA:  Sure.  If I may? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, you may. 

MR. GURA:  Thanks.  We believe that it's 

more limited because that -- that text had a specific 

understanding and that there are guideposts left behind 

in texts and history that tell us how to apply it, unlike 

the due process.  But at least we know one thing, which 

is that, in 1868, the right to keep and bear arms was 

understood to be a privilege or immunity of citizenship, 

and if the Court is considering watering down the Second 

Amendment, perhaps it should look to text and history. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

MR. GURA:  Thanks.
