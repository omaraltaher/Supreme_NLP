 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD BOURKE 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 (11:00 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

1

3
4  argument next this morning in Case 11-9953, 
5

11
 The Louisiana Court of Appeal in this case 
12  correctly found that the majority of the delay -- the 
13  seven-year delay was caused by the lack of funding, but, 
14  when moving to assess that cause under Barker, 
incorrectly determined that it was a cause beyond the 
15
16  control of the State and, adopting its earlier ruling 
17  under the State statute, found that it was a cause 
18  beyond the control of the State, in the sense that it 
19  was beyond the control of the local district attorney's 
20
21
22  within the control of your client? 
 MR. BOURKE:  He was unable to fund himself, 
23
24  Your Honor.  That is why he asked for the appointment of

Alderson Reporting Company 

MR. BOURKE:  In fact, in a sense, Your 

Honor, he had two counsel. 

 MR. BOURKE:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why? 
MR. BOURKE:  That is -- he was unable to

2  Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial?

6  move forward to trial because he was not provided with 
7  counsel adequately funded to advance the --
8
9  counsel, right?  During the whole time? 
10
11 
12
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  For part of it, he 
13  had two, and then there was not enough funding for the 
14  second, okay?  So he was faced with a choice.

provision, which the Sixth Amendment does not require. 
The Sixth Amendment just requires counsel, but Louisiana 
says, in capital cases, we are going to provide two 
counsel, and you can't go to trial until you have two 
counsel, okay? 

 MR. BOURKE:  No, Your Honor --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No? 
 MR. BOURKE:  -- that is not correct.  That

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I don't -- I don't

1  Louisiana law? 
2
 MR. BOURKE:  Louisiana absolutely does not 
3  provide a right to two counsel in capital cases.  The 
4  Louisiana Supreme Court, in Rule 31, provided that the 
court should appoint two counsel, but, also, it provided 
5
6  expressly that that created no procedural or substantive 
7  right. 
8
9
10
11  that you can't proceed without two counsel?  That's not 
12  the law in Louisiana?  I thought that's --
13
14  Louisiana. 
15

MR. BOURKE:  Mr. Lorenzi was lead certified 

counsel. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Lorenzi, yes.  He was 

trial.  The court of appeal did not predicate that on 

1  a case.  You should have proceeded to trial. 
2
 MR. BOURKE:  No, Your Honor.  In -- in this 
3  case, as the court of appeal correctly found, Mr. Boyer 
4  did not have adequate funding for the case to go to 
5
6  the need for two counsel.  The motion to determine 
7  source of funds was not predicated on Rule 31. 
8
9  counsel who was qualified, what was his name? 
10
11 
12
13  only one at the time who was qualified to be lead 
14  counsel? 
15
16
17  Court said, you don't have to do this.  You're his --
18  you're his attorney, but you have a right to be paid, 
19  and the State has to pay you.

So there was no obligation on the counsel's 
part to do anything; and he kept asking, please have a 
funding order, let me be paid, and I'll do my job. 

MR. BOURKE:  Correct.

because the two things don't talk to each other.  The 
Sixth Amendment doesn't impose a certification 
requirement. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well --
 MR. BOURKE:  -- a qualification minimum, so 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, the question is would 

only lead counsel under -- under the supreme court's 
rule qualify as competent counsel, for purposes of 
complying with the constitutional requirement?  Or would 
this certified second chair qualify? 

MR. BOURKE:  The -- there is no -- I'm

 MR. BOURKE:  Yes, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What? 
 MR. BOURKE:  The court of appeal twice 

appointed, the court of appeal twice found that the case 
could not proceed due to a lack of adequate funding, and 
the State --

1  can you establish that the one counsel that your client 
2  had throughout this whole -- whole proceeding would not

17
 It seems to me your client was faced with a 
18  choice:  You could either demand what Louisiana, in its 
19  generosity, has given to capital defendants, namely, the 
20
21  supreme court rule, it doesn't matter -- you could either 
22  demand that right; or you could demand your right to a 
23  speedy trial.  That was your choice.

14  another lawyer here, who will join him, is more senior 
and experienced and will double your firepower.  You can 
15
16  choose, Mr. Boyer, do you want to go ahead now with this 
17  guy?  Or do you want to wait? 
18
19  invidious choice between the right to counsel and the 
right to speedy trial.  It would be, we are giving you

4  expenditure.  There was no money for investigation. 
There was no money for experts.  And the associate 
5
6  counsel who had been appointed had been appointed solely 
7  and for the limited purpose as an assistant to 
8  Mr. Lorenzi, not to conduct the case in his own right. 
9
 If this issue had been raised in the trial 
court, this would have been clearly explained into this 
10
11  record.  It wasn't.  But the trial court and the 
12  appellate court of -- the court of appeal -- Third 
13  Circuit in Louisiana knew and understood that there was 
14  no investigative funding.  There was no expert funding.

18  It's a case where they'd found an assistant and were 
19  waiting for the first lawyer. 
20

 MR. BOURKE:  That's a very case-specific 
23
24  determination, Your Honor and, in Louisiana, at that 
time, rested with a judicial determination that the 
25

 Counsel was a part of that mix.  You never 

 So it -- it was a funding level tagged to 

the constitutional minimum of due process. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, a finding by the 

stamps -- is not a finding by the district court that 
there was not enough money to investigate and to buy 
stamps. 

1  investigative or expert expenses were reasonably 
2  necessary to ensure a fair trial within the meaning of 
3  the Due Process Clause.

 MR. BOURKE:  There was never --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The -- the big tag item

 MR. BOURKE:  No, Your Honor.  That was one 

mitigation and life investigation, along with the use of

And so, no, the big -- the big tag item 

1  potential expert witnesses, particularly in the case 

2  where there were all the indications of mental health 

3  problems and the like, are often equal to or, in some 

4  cases, greater than the cost of counsel. 

5
6  wasn't just Mr. Lorenzi's overhead and expenses.  The 
7  big tag item was providing adequate funding.  And to 
8  return to your earlier point, Justice Scalia, just to --
9  to make it clear, the Louisiana Supreme Court cases, 
which mandate that a case cannot go forward without 
10
11 
counsel, do not reference Rule 31 at all, or two 
12 
counsel. 
13
14  proposition that the case cannot go forward without 
constitutionally adequate counsel, counsel who can 
15
16  provide reasonably effective assistance. 
17
18  controlling Louisiana decision on not moving forward 
19  without effective assistance was Peart -- P-e-a-r-t --
which we cite in our brief, which said that the court 
20
21  will not allow a case to proceed without reasonably 
22  effective counsel.

 This case began in 2002.  At that point, the 

Official 

 MR. BOURKE:  Yes, sir. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  In your point of view, 

1
2
3  would it satisfy you if we say, the Louisiana court of 
4  appeal found the largest part of the delay involved the 
funding crisis experienced by the State of Louisiana --
5
6  that meant giving you adequate money for counsel. 
7
 Then they said, the progression of the 
8  prosecution was out of the State's control, as 
9  determined by this court, which I think referred to that 
funding crisis.  And we could -- and your view would be 
10
11 
that's what they said.  We don't know the underlying 
12 
facts, but that's what they said. 
13

MR. BOURKE:  That is what Judge Cook said 

and --

 Once an attorney is appointed, it is the 
1
2  State's obligation to ensure that adequate funds are 
3  available for the defense.  And I take "for the defense" 
4  to mean not simply counsel, but the witnesses, the --
5
6
 It is certainly true that none of the delay 
7  due to the lack of funds was, in any way, attributable 
8  to the defense.  That's, essentially, what you would 
9  like us to say? 
10
11 
12
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think it's enough 
13  that none of the delay was attributable to the defense. 
14  The defense has to complain, has to demand its right to

MR. BOURKE:  His lawyer was appointed, and

 And that's at page 3703 to '4 of the record, 

1  robbery -- there are other varieties, of course -- but 
2  intentional killing during an armed robbery.  And those 
3  are the elements of first-degree murder. 
4
 The State unpacked those two elements -- or 
two lesser included offenses, to second-degree murder, 
5
6  which is intentional killing, and armed robbery.  And 
7  the State, in fact, conceded that, had the charge 
8  remained a first-degree murder charge, then the armed 
9  robbery charge would have created a double jeopardy 
10
11
12  where counsel for the State indicated that the armed 
13  robbery charge could be added because the primary 
14  charge, the -- the first-degree murder, had been dropped

17  first-degree murder, there may be double jeopardy 
18  problems.

22  That is what --
23
24  the basic problem in this case, as I understand the

 But, because they had unpacked that charge 
from murder and armed robbery down to murder and, also, 

question presented, is should the State be responsible 

to second-degree murder, and specifically said,

4  to the counties, it's going to be much better, and the 
5
6  knowing who the counsel are.  And so it's all handled by 
7  the county. 
 Then one county has a disaster, a hurricane 
8
9  in that county, particularly.  Is that not a reason for 
delaying?  Or does the State have to immediately step in 
10

the State.

What we have asked in our briefing for the 

Court to do is to also provide some guidance on the 
weight that should be given to delay resulting from the 
lack of funding because in this case --

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If we provide -- if we 

1  delay, particularly since the prosecution chose the 

2  death penalty -- you know, I don't like having to do 

3  that and -- but it seems, to me, that's what the 

4  question presented at least requires. 

MR. BOURKE:  Well, Your Honor, it -- I think 
5
6  it would be open to this Court to answer the question by 
7  saying the court got it wrong at the first step by 
8  failing to attribute it to the State and then remand for 
9  full consideration of weighing, in light of that.

16  continuances that Mr. Lorenzi requested that relate to 
17  the funding?  "January 10, 2003, Lorenzi requests a

19  problems."

"August 5, 2003, Lorenzi moves to continue

9  Louisiana Court of Appeal did with them, which was to 
10
11 
12
13  declined to adopt the State's argument that it was Mr. 
14  Lorenzi's fault.  And the reason it did that was because 
the lack of a funding hearing caused no delay at all in 
15
16  the conduct of this trial. 
17
18  produced no funding, no ruling or order, and had no 
19  influence on the date of the trial.  And, of course, the 
20

 Furthermore, all of those continuances,

23  which were joined in by the State, were related to 
24  trying to identify and find funding for this case and

for this man.  None of them were for a dilatory purpose.

6  Justice Alito's problem seemed, to me, to get back to

17  a defense without money.

first of which is he filed a motion under 
State v. Wigley, and that is Appendix X of your Joint 
Appendix. 

In that motion, he identified 

State v. Wigley, and, although he referenced wanting 
expert resources as well, he primarily based that motion 
on his entitlement to attorney's fees.

that question.  Opposing counsel said that it -- it

4  gone ahead with one attorney, as far as I'm concerned. 
5
6  Justice Scalia.  And, if you look at Appendix LL, which 
7  is the hearing on the motion to quash, Mr. Lorenzi says, 
8  point blank -- in that appendix, he says, "I was not 
9  going to proceed to file substantive motions until I was

 couldn't be appointed counsel in a death case under 
 Louisiana's rules.

 there is a provision in Louisiana law -- law that allows 
someone to move for the admission and the certification 
 of somebody as capital counsel, which was the procedure 
 employed in this case.  That is perfectly permissible. 
 But Miss Lehman, at that time, was a very

 But it is -- some of it has to be that

MS. SIGLER:  Well --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know plenty of lawyers

 worked on other capital cases in advisory positions.  So 
 she --

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me -- let me give you a 
 holding -- this is an incredibly factually complicated 
case.  We don't usually take cases that are so 
 fact-bound, but we've taken it. 

 (Laughter.) 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me give you a rule that 
 we might adopt.  If the failure to provide funding makes 
it impossible for some period of time for a case to be 
 tried, then the delay is attributable to the State. 

 Would you agree with that? 
 MS. SIGLER:  If the failure to provide 

 funding is a deliberate attempt on the State to 
interfere with the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, 
 then I would agree with that. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You also agree, right on 
 this subject, that the only sentence that I can find --
 I haven't read it totally carefully -- but, in the lower 
court opinion, that has to do with this is the sentence 
 I read before. 

 And it says, "The first three years he was 
 incarcerated, he was charged with first-degree murder,

 Now, when I look at those words, I am not 

 100 percent certain what they mean.  So it would be 
 helpful -- but I don't want --- you're not going to do 
it -- I'd like to -- are you -- would you concede that 
 that statement means they're saying that the State, for 
 speedy trial purposes, is not to be held accountable, 
 really, at all, for not providing the money, insofar as 
 that's a cause of the delay? 

Is that a conceded point?  Or is that 

 something I have to spend quite a lot of time going 
 through?

 Appendix D, as I stated earlier, the other Barker 
 factors are discussed.  And the continuance motions that 
 were filed by defense counsel are mentioned with regard 
 to the assertion of the right; they are not necessarily 
mentioned with regard to the State. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, you are right.  Most 

 of this opinion -- and almost all of it is about the 
 other factors.  Now, I agree with you, that's what it 
 looked like.  But we do have this sentence. 

So how am I supposed to figure out whether 
 that sentence really means what they say?  Or just is 
 something they threw in to make the opinion more 
 difficult for us to understand?

 Circuit was referring to was this Court's 
 Barker v. Wingo jurisprudence.  This Court has stated, 
 repeatedly, that even if something --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, okay.  Well, then, 

that's it.  They're referring to Barker.  Okay. 

 So when they say it's out of this State's 
 control, as referred to in Barker, which is our case, 
 then what they mean is that it's not something that the 
 State had anything to do with, so they shouldn't be 
blamed for it. 

 MS. SIGLER:  I think that they are 

 attempting, in some fashion, to reconcile some of this 
 Court's later statements in the Barker jurisprudence, 
 which this Court made it clear, in Vermont v. Brillon, 
that certain actions are not going to be attributed to 
 the State for speedy trial purposes --

 MS. SIGLER:  Okay. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you agreed with the --
 the principle that I mentioned, except that you want to 
draw a distinction between the failure to provide 
 funding and the deliberate failure to provide funding? 
 Is that a real difference? 

 MS. SIGLER:  Absolutely. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Can the State inadvertently 

failed to provide funding? 

 MS. SIGLER:  I think that this Court has 
 always recognized, in the Barker jurisprudence, that 
 negligence is a very different factor in how it weighs 
 against a State than a deliberate attempt to violate a 
constitutional right to a speedy trial. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How can --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  When we said in Krillon 

 delays resulting from a systemic breakdown in the public 
 defender system could be charged to the State, so that 
suggests systemic breakdown doesn't necessarily mean 
 deliberate.  It just means there has been a breakdown, 
 and the result is that the person can't get to trial. 

 And if -- I think -- if Justice Alito could 
 even read that again and if you think about it, in light 
of this statement in Krillon, that systemic breakdowns

 are systemic breakdowns, whether or not they are 
 deliberate. 

 MS. SIGLER:  Well, Justice Kagan, I think 
 that the best evidence or the fact that there was no 
systemic breakdown is the funding hearing itself, 
 Appendix JJ. 

 At that funding hearing, there are extensive 

 discussions about other capital cases within the State 
 that are being tried the entire time this case is 
pending, including one case that we referred to, 
 State v. Reeves, in Calcasieu Parish, a capital case 
 that went to trial in less than four years, that 
 included a retrial. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let's say you have a 

case where the -- the defendant wants counsel, can't 
 afford counsel, and the State says, we'd love to provide 
 counsel for you, but we're broke, we just don't have any 
 money to provide counsel, but, maybe in a year, we'll 
 have money to provide counsel. 

Now, what do we do with the delay between 
 that point and -- and the -- the point, a year later, 
 when the money becomes available? 

 MS. SIGLER:  Well, I think, from that 

 scenario, we would have to look at the State's 
intention.  I certainly think that, if the State flat

 out said, I'm sorry, you're not getting counsel for a 
 year, then we would have to attribute that factor to the 
 State more heavily, even though it does appear that, in 
 your scenario, it's more of a negligence problem than a 
deliberate we're not going to fund you problem. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose it is negligent. 

 For -- for a year, this person isn't represented because 
 the State keeps sending the checks to his cousin of the 
 same name.  I mean -- you know, they didn't do it 
purposely.  He just happens to have a cousin, this 
 lawyer, of the same name, who doesn't tell him he's 
 getting these checks out of nowhere. 

 So he can't hire the expert.  Absolute 

 negligence.  I mean, that's not to be attributed to the 
State? 

 MS. SIGLER:  No, Justice Breyer.  Clearly --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there any authority for 

 that?  I mean -- you know, maybe you'd discount it 
 because it wasn't deliberate, but no attribution 
whatsoever? 

 MS. SIGLER:  Well, you discount it, 

 Justice Breyer, and you attribute it to more of a 
 negligence standard than you would a -- an absolute 
 failure or refusal to provide counsel.  And this Court 
has done that repeatedly.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  What's the 
 difference between saying, I'm broke, and I want to pay 
 the prosecutor because they kept paying the prosecutor, 
 I want to pay for the prosecutor's investigation, but I 
won't pay you?  What -- what is the difference in 
 applying the negligence versus deliberate standard? 

 I mean, look, in the end, States are always 
 strapped, but I don't know a State who doesn't make some 
 income.  They make a choice about where they want that 
income to go.  And it may be, in your judgment, a more 
 legitimate decision, but why is the situation less 
 negligent -- why is it negligent and not deliberate? 

 Why is the choice one, not the other? 
 MS. SIGLER:  Because, Justice Sotomayor, I 

believe in this Court's decisions, under 
 Barker v. Wingo, the choice aspect -- the deliberate 
 intent aspect has been looked at by the courts in 
 deciding how much of the blame is to be assessed against 
 the State. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, then answer the 

 question.  Why isn't the choice to say, I -- I'm broke, 
 so I don't want to pay you, I'm going to pay the 
 prosecutor -- which happened, the prosecutors were being 
 paid throughout.  They had enough money to investigate, 
but we're choosing not to pay the defendants.

 Why isn't that a deliberate choice? 
 MS. SIGLER:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, that 
 choice was not made in this case.  There was available 
 funds.  What we're here -- we're here today --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Available funds to pay 

 the lawyer? 

 MS. SIGLER:  There were available funds in 

 2003.  I was referring to that letter in the record 
 that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The -- the court itself 
 said, repeatedly, that the cause of the delay was the 
 funding crisis, the court -- I think we have to accept 
 that as being the case, that the funding crisis -- the 
 effort to get this lawyer paid failed, time and again. 
And it was the court determination that it is the 
 funding crisis that caused the delay. 

 MS. SIGLER:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, the 
 funding crisis that the court ruled on was present in 
 2006.  It was not present in 2003, when this case 
started.  Mr. Lorenzi, himself, identified a source of 
 funds -- funds to pay him. 

 And when we hear Chief Public Defender Ron 

 Ware testify at that motion for funding hearing, at

 attorneys from this account throughout this time period. 

 The fact that there weren't funds readily 

 available in 2006 is directly attributable to Petitioner's 
 counsels failing to move his funding herein forward in 
2003, when he first identified that source of funds. 
 This is not a case in which there was never any funding. 

 This was a case in which defense counsel, 

 for whatever reason, delayed a resolution of the funding 
 issue, an issue that he, himself, identified as one --
without any resolution, he was not going to go forward 
 with substantive motions. 

 The onus -- the -- the blame -- or more of 
 the blame in this case, on the funding problem, belongs 
 with the Petitioner, not the State of Louisiana, whether 
we mean the prosecution --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not going to argue 

 the funding issue because I've got to go look at the 
 record again. 

 But let's assume that the record doesn't 
support your claim because, as I read the decisions 
 below and the record that I saw, there wasn't funding 
 available until -- I think it was 2006 or '7?  And so, 
 somehow, there's a disconnect between what you're saying 
 and the record.

 that there wasn't money, despite whatever you're saying. 

 What's your position then?  Then it's not 

 deliberate?  It's still negligence. 

 MS. SIGLER:  Justice Sotomayor, I maintain 
that position, and I believe it to be consistent with 
 this Court's repeated analysis under Barker v. Wingo 
 jurisprudence. 

 You do look at the intent of the State as 
 either a negligence factor, akin to more of a neutral 
factor, a deliberate factor, or a valid reason for the 
 delay.  And I would also suggest to Your Honor --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So there could never be 

 a systematic breakdown, in your judgment, because any 
 time the State gives resources to something else, it's 
not deliberate -- it's not a systemic breakdown. 

 MS. SIGLER:  Justice Sotomayor, I would 
 invite you to look at the motion for funding hearing 
 again.  There was money allocated to indigent defense by 
 Louisiana.  It has increased -- and this is public 
record, and it's partially supported by the funding 
 hearing. 

 That money has increased from 9.4 million in 

 2006 to 20 million in 2 -- I'm sorry -- in 2005, to 20 
 million in 2006, to $33 million today.  House Bill 1 of 
the State legislative website.  That is the precise

 amount prosecutors are awarded by the State. 

 I would, again, suggest that this is not a 

 case of systemic breakdown.  And I think that, as a 
 policy matter, this Court should be reluctant to rule 
against the State of Louisiana, which, as Justice Scalia 
 noted, has been so generous in trying to provide capital 
 indigent defendants with specially qualified counsel, 
 which is more counsel than they're even entitled to 
 under the Sixth Amendment. 

And I would also urge this Court to be 

 cognizant of its own repeated statements in the past, 
 that this is a very severe remedy with regard to letting 
 a convicted murderer free. 

 I'd also like to address, before I sit down 
and turn this back over to Mr. Bourke, Justice Ginsburg, 
 earlier, you had addressed the question of whether or 
 not the armed robbery was, in fact, still a valid 
 charge. 

 Contrary to Mr. Bourke's assertion before 

Your Honor today, if you look at Appendix 254A, there is 
 a writ of opposition that was filed by the Petitioner 
 before the Louisiana Supreme Court.  And, at 254A, he 
 says -- and I quote -- "Even if the murder indictment 
 were quashed, Mr. Boyer faces the armed robbery 
prosecution."

 The Third Circuit also rejected Mr. Bourke's 
 current double jeopardy argument and stated specifically 
 that there was no speedy trial problem with regard to 
 the armed robbery. 

Thank you.

 Mr. Bourke, you have about 3 minutes 

 remaining. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD BOURKE 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. BOURKE:  Thank you.  And I have a few 
 points of clarification that I want to make, just in a 
 very quick fashion. 

 Justice Sotomayor, there was no funding in 
2001, 2002, 2003.  It was never there.  If Your Honor 
 looks at the Louisiana Supreme Court opinion in Citizen, 
 it will describe the Turner case funding hearing in 
 2001.  Mr. Lorenzi was stuck with that one as well. 
 There was no money. 

Mr. Lorenzi did, indeed, submit bills in 
 2003 because a new procedure had been announced, and 
 that's at page -- Joint Appendix page 401 to '3.  You'll 
 see the correspondence showing he did submit bills, and 
 there was no money. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There was money

 allocated, but, if I understood the record correctly --
 by the State -- the funding was grossly inadequate to 
 cover all the needs? 

 MR. BOURKE:  Right.  It was -- it was 

underwater.  It was oversubscribed.  It --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Bourke, would you 

 respond to the last point made by -- by opposing 
 counsel? 

 MR. BOURKE:  Yes, certainly. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You did state -- it's in 

 Appendix J -- "Even if the murder indictment were 
 quashed, Mr. Boyer faces the armed robbery prosecution." 

 MR. BOURKE:  Yes, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You told us, today, that 

that's not the case, that the armed robbery prosecution 
 goes down the drain.  Which -- which is true? 

 MR. BOURKE:  The passage you're referring to 

 is from a writ application purely limited to the 
 application of the State speedy trial statute, which 
does accord a new clock to every new filing. 

 So, under Louisiana State statutory law, the 

 armed robbery started the State statutory clock again, 
 but that is not the case for the Sixth Amendment --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  As to the murder or as 

to the independent robbery count?  It's not a lesser

 included offense, the robbery count. 

 MR. BOURKE:  The armed robbery was a lesser 
 included of first-degree murder, but it is not a lesser 
 included of second-degree murder.  Our double jeopardy 
argument was the same force was applied in both, the 
 force for the murder and the force for the armed 
 robbery, so that's completely irrelevant. 

 But that was a State statutory argument 

 about the armed robbery charge, which has no 
application in the case in front of us. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Boyer -- why would --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Go ahead. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why would we get to that 

 question?  I mean, no courts below have dealt with it. 
It has been briefed to us in a grand total of two 
 paragraphs, I think.  There would be no reason for us to 
 get to that question. 

 MR. BOURKE:  It -- it is well beyond the 

 question presented, Your Honor, I agree. 

Your Honor, the --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And so -- so, from that 
 point of view, we can assume that there is a robbery 
 conviction that is still out there. 

 MR. BOURKE:  He has a murder and armed 

robbery conviction from the same incident.  It's the

 same charge as the first-degree murder.  It's just 
 unpacked. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or assume that there isn't, 

 right? 

MR. BOURKE:  That -- that is why this Court 

 would remand to allow the -- the local court to deal 
 with it and ensure that that's accurate. 

 Justice Breyer, the reference to our 

 earlier -- the decision of this Court and the supreme 
court is a reference to the earlier decision on the 
 interlocutory writ application, the earlier decision 
 that a lack of adequate funds prevented the prosecution. 

 And if Your Honor looks at Joint Appendix, 
 at page 126, which is part of the opinion of the Third 
Circuit, you will see, earlier, in their opinion, they 
 discuss their own earlier ruling in the supreme court --
