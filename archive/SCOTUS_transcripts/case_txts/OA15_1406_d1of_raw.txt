ORAL ARGUMENT OF PIERRE H. BERGERON 

 

 

 

 

 

                

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

              

A direct causation standard is necessary in 

 

 

 

 

 

light of the historic restrictions on a court's inherent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority, and it provides courts with a workable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

framework that they customarily apply in the sanctions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context.  Respondents, in fact, acknowledge that a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

direct causation standard applies, sometimes, but not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always. Their two-teared suggestion, however, does not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide concrete guidance to the district courts and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would inevitably lead to the expansion of the inherent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority. 

            

One of the reasons this Court has been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reticent about any sort of broadening of the scope of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the inherent authority is because the due-process issues 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and separation of powers issues combined with a court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

determining the violation acting essentially as 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor and fact finder and then imposing the

penalty. And --

 

 

4 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you -- am I to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

take that your -- I think what I read from your brief is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we should draw the line that we drew in Bagli 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between compensatory damages under the contempt inherent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power and punishment damages that require criminal civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures. Is that the same thing you're asking us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to --

 

            

same thing. 

 

            

Chambers? 

            

MR. BERGERON:  Yes. That's essentially the 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how do you deal with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BERGERON:  So we deal with Chambers a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple of different ways.  First of all, Chambers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

factually distinguishably different from our case 

 

 

 

 

 

because Chambers was based purely on pervasive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misconduct that was so bad that it tainted the entire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case because there was no -- there was no good faith 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense at the end of the day. We have the good faith 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense here. 

 

            

            

But secondly --

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Wasn't, that wasn't that 

  

 

 

 

 

what was found here was that it was pervasive from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very first effort to get discovery continuing through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the settlement? 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  No, Justice Ginsburg.  In 

  

  

 

 

 

5 

fact, what the Court found ultimately was it recognized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it did not resolve the question whether the Heat Rise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test was dispositive.  And it said plaintiffs believe it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be helpful, but it did not make a determination of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  And in light of that, we had good-faith defenses 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as to even if the tests were produced, that there was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still a design defect.  And beyond that, there were also 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

causation defenses as to the ultimate cause of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accident, whether that was driver error or whether there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was impact damage. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But weren't you given the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity -- maybe you can clarify this -- the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court said, well, if we're wrong about giving all of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel fees, then we will deduct -- what? -- some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$700,000 based on Goodyear's filing of the amount that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should not be recovered because it was unrelated to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Goodyear's bad conduct. 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  Correct.  So there's two 

  

  

 

 

 

points on that. 

 

 

            

First of all, that was -- how that evolved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was the Court had already ruled against us on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causation point; so we had lost that battle.  And then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when we -- when the plaintiffs finally submitted their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fee application, we took a fallback position and said,

at a bare minimum, this needs to be carved out.  So we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't waived that, but I think the second --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And you represented that 

  

 

 

 

 

that was the cost that was not attributable to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Goodyear's misconduct. 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  What we represented was that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it was related to the medical costs, the medical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages -- proven up the medical damages, as well as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuit of the other defendants.  So that would be one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subset of the -- of the costs that were not caused by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the misconduct, but it wasn't the total one. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And what's significant about that as well is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the court said it's impossible to make this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calculation.  But then the court did, at least to a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain extent, make a calculation based on the evidence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was submitted. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, your test is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the direct directness of the causation.  And I -- I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess I'm curious as to how you would apply that in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice.  I mean, if you take a case, for example, they 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't get the Heat Rise test, they get something else 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that isn't as, in their view --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  Right. 

  

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- dramatic or 

  

 

 

 

 

compelling. 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR. BERGERON:  Right. 

  

 

7 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And they have to go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

through all sorts of -- they're preparing somebody to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testify about this other test, and they incur $100,000 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in expenses to do that.  Is that something that would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly caused by the failure to disclose the Heat Rise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test? 

            

MR. BERGERON:  I think there's a couple of 

    

   

 

 

 

different ways you can look at it.  I think we -- we --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we gravitate towards the Fox test, which is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incremental harm.  So if you're going to engage in that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation anyway, and you're going to engage in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prepping that witness anyway --

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, let's say 

  

 

 

 

 

they're not.  They say, you know, if we get the Heat 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rise test, that's -- that's much more dramatic.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't need to worry about, you know, this less 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compelling test. 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  I think there certainly could 

    

 

 

 

 

be situations where -- where the proponent of fees would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, we would not have taken this deposition if we had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had this document, for instance, and then that would --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that could be something that they would then recover 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for. 

              

I think generally what you're looking at

is -- is the incremental costs going above a baseline. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And that's --

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's always a 

  

 

 

 

guess-estimate to start with.  Guess-estimate, I use it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

in its colloquial sense of you're -- you're looking at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what happened and you're cutting broadly at the lines 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because you can never set the line precisely. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But as Justice -- as the Chief Justice said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the Heat Rise test, there was one expert that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questioned, but would have been questioned in a totally 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

different way if the proper tests had been disclosed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Why was that causal decision by the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court wrong? 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  Well, we think that they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

could recover for that expert.  And, in fact, you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court never got into the actual analysis of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causation. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, but they -- they --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court asked you to tell them what you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought wasn't caused, assuming that you accepted the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court's findings. 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  Well, in fairness, the 

  

 

 

 

 

district court told us we -- we were not going to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able to do that.  And we -- that's -- that's how the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

700,000 came up, because we took a fallback position and

tried to say, well, at a bare minimum, these things are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so far attenuated, so far removed from any misconduct, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

that has to be removed.  But you need to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, to be precise about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that, what were you asked by the district judge to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

submit? 

            

MR. BERGERON:  So what happened was before 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the district court issued its November 2012 order, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had raised -- they -- they had requested all sorts of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedies for sanctions, and we had raised the causation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point, the causation limitation.  The district court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

rejected that in the November 2012 order and said, no, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you get everything. 

 

 

            

And so in response, the plaintiffs filed a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three-page fee application that said give us everything, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

along with all of their time records. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

So then in response to that, that's where we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed our opposition and said, you know, that's where we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised the issue of -- of the 700,000 as being too far 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

removed.  But we --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So why isn't it 

  

 

 

 

 

appropriate, given that the plaintiff was put to a great 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expense and probably got less in the settlement than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they would have gotten if Goodyear had lived up to its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discovery responsibilities, why isn't it appropriate to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

say instead of making the plaintiff prove every single 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

item that's attributable to the discovery fault, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be the defendant's expert to point out what --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what items were not attributable? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  I think there's both a 

    

 

 

 

 

practical and a legal answer to that.  The practical 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

answer is because they are the ones that incurred the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees, they are in the best position to say these fees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were incurred as a result of the misconduct.  And I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think if you look at all the sanction regimes, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden is on the proponent to establish the propriety of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the award. 

 

            

The legal answer is that Bagwell, although 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it doesn't squarely address this point, does seem to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicate that it is the proponent that needs to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish the causation link.  And I believe, Justice 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg, your concurrence seemed to -- to echo that as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well.  And then when you look at Alyeska, that case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, look, we want to be apprehensive about shifting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the litigation burdens, admittedly in a slightly 

   

 

 

 

 

different context, without legislative guidance.  And, 

  

 

 

 

 

of course, that's part of the problem here is there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no legislative guidance, which is the reason that there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needs to be a causation check on the inherent authority.

back to the question that the Chief Justice asked you. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You said that you favored the approach of Fox v. Vice, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is a but-for test. 

   

 

 

            

            

MR. BERGERON:  Right.


  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's would you have incurred


  

 

 

 

 

 

this cost anyway even --

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. BERGERON:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- without the misconduct. 

  

 

 

 

 

But Fox v. Vice never uses this language of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directness, which seems to me actually much more in line 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with proximate cause inquiries. 

 

 

 

            

Now, Fox v. Vice, you know, never addressed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proximate cause either way.  It wasn't a proximate cause 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

fact pattern.  This actually seems not really a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

proximate cause fact pattern either; it just seems as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though it's a -- you know, should there be a but-for 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

test. 

            

So I guess I'm wondering, where does this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

language of -- you say "but for," but you also say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"direct."  What do you mean when you use those two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms? 

            

MR. BERGERON:  We borrowed "direct" from 

  

 

 

 

 

Cooter & Gell and from the other sanction regimes that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all have various iterations of what I call direct 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

causation.  Now, they may refer to it as direct effect;

they may refer to it as direct result.  But at the end 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the day.  That's what they're applying. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

Now, we looked at Fox v. Vice and saw 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially the same analysis, because what those cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are trying to determine in -- in the other sanction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regimes is, what is the excess cost?  And Fox approached 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that slightly differently, looking at it -- calling it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incremental costs, calling it but-for.  So, essentially, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we think the tests are synonymous.  And the reason that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a little bit different than, say, proximate cause 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is because we're dealing with the American rule and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and coming up with an exception to the American rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But, obviously, the exception is not -- it's not an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all-or-nothing claim, and obviously Fox made that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, suppose we say that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the Fox v. Vice but-for test is something along the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lines of what we should be applying here.  So how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does -- in your reply brief, you basically say that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court can "never."  You don't -- you don't just say in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case it was wrong.  In your reply brief, you say a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court can never say, look, the case would have settled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right away, and all costs ought to go to the victimized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party. 

            

Why is that?  If it's a but-for test, why 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't a court on a proper set of facts say, look, if

this -- if this abuse hadn't occurred, this case would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just never have gone on? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  We think that that is just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

far too speculative to satisfy a direct causation test. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And, obviously, in this case, it really illustrates the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point, because the district court said, I'm pointing to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Goodyear's experience in other cases.  But in those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases, it went all the way to or through trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

But -- but the other problem with this is --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I don't know what --

   

  

 

 

 

 

what -- too speculative.  I mean, the Court says, look, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I understand that I have to find this; you know, that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's more likely than not.  That's how we make findings 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about what costs would have been incurred anyway. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Would -- you know, there's never any certainty.  We're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always saying more likely than not, would this cost have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been incurred?  I think none of the costs of this suit 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have been incurred if this abuse hadn't taken 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place. 

            

MR. BERGERON:  But we think the problem with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is it ends up being a shortcut for causation. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And -- and the Court, then, is excused from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

performance of the task of actually looking at what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misconduct was and how that impacted the fees incurred. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I think it's pretty easy to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

think of hypotheticals and how they might be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

unrealistic, in which the eventual disclosure of some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

piece of information that should have been disclosed a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot earlier is so fatal to the defense that the case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be settled as soon as that came to light. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You think it's impossible to imagine 

 

 

 

 

 

something like that?  Suppose there were some internal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Goodyear document here that said, you know, we are going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to sell this.  We are going to market this to RVs, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we know it's really not suitable for RVs.  And so if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people put it on an RV and they are driving around in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hot climate, the tire is going to explode. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, if you had an internal document like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, it wouldn't be very hard to say, wow, once this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes out, we are going to have no option but to settle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the issue of liability. 

 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  And I can certainly imagine 

   

  

 

 

 

such a document.  But the problem with that is if the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

document shows that the entire litigation is not in good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

faith, I think that's a different issue.  That's getting 

   

   

  

 

 

 

closer to Chambers. 

 

 

            

But if it doesn't do that, the problem with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using a potential settlement date as the barometer for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

causation here is -- I can't tell you how many 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mediations I've walked into when knowing my client's

risk tolerance and what I thought the other side was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to say, I said, this case is going to settle. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Absolutely it's going to settle today and it doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen.  It just ends up being too speculative because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can't -- you would have to really pierce the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

privilege on both sides to get any sort of determination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as to whether they would actually settle. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, but if a lack of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

certainty like that is going to prevent a judge from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually making an award, then people on the other side, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people who are victimized, are going to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undercompensated in case after case after case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  But I don't think that that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the case here because, obviously, if a direct causation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

test is applied and they get the incremental cost that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they would have received in the absence of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misconduct, then they received the appropriate 

 

 

 

 

 

compensatory award and it satisfies the due process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerns. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Justice Sotomayor asked 

  

 

 

 

you at the outset about the Chambers cases.  I just 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't find really strong language in this Chambers case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from which to imply a causation or draw a causation 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion.  And Bagwell doesn't even cite Chambers. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  Right.  Chambers was not 

  

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

engaging in the same causation analysis that we are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about today. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, it wasn't.  I know. 

    

  

 

 

 

Clearly it was not.  But why shouldn't it have? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

MR. BERGERON:  Well, because what Chambers 

  

 

 

 

 

was recognizing was it did acknowledge that all of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees were caused by the misconduct, and it did point out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the entirety of the case was built on a fraud, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was no good faith defense to the litigation.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in that circumstance -- and, of course, the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court in Chambers says, this is unique.  And it probably 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a unique situation. 

   

 

            

But then when we move to Bagwell, the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point about Chambers is it was built on the foundation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of contempt.  And so it was built on the contempt cases 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in distilling a rule from those.  But then that changed 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with Bagwell because we have the clarification on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction between criminal and civil, and Bagwell was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawing that line at causation.  And that's why, to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent there is any tension between Chambers and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bagwell, Bagwell should prevail on that point. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Am I to understand the 

   

  

 

 

 

question presented -- as presented was whether there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a direct causation standard applicable to an award under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a court's inherent powers.  And you're now saying we

wanted a but-for incremental cost analysis to define 

   

 

 

 

 

 

17 

direct cause.  Then ask your adversary how he would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

define it if it was going to be applied. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But you're also asking us to actually apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it in your case.  And to review the district court's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

findings de novo or on abuse of discretion? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  The district court would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reviewed under abuse of discretion.  And our point is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court applied the wrong legal test which constitutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an abuse of discretion.  We think ultimately that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court should remand to the district court to allow the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court to apply the direct causation test that the court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declined to apply the first time around. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  When the district court gave 

  

 

 

 

 

 

these two awards, the 2.7 and the 2 million, do you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand that to have been 2.7 if I'm not bound by a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause requirement; 2 million if I am? 

   

   

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  I think that's how the court 

    

 

 

 

 

 

envisioned it, yes, Justice Kagan. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So then why hasn't that been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

done already in the district court?  In other words, if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're right, that there is a causation requirement 

   

 

 

 

 

 

here, we send it back to the district court, hasn't the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court already performed that calculation? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  I think that would be what

the Respondents would say.  And their whole argument on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is that we waive anything beyond the 700,000.  My 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point is that we preserve that and, therefore, the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

would need to go through and -- go through the exercise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of actually applying a direct causation test on these 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts as they are here. 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think what -- if you look at what the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court did, it found very specific dates of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misconduct.  So you could look at those dates of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misconduct, what those episodes were, and then compare 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them to the time records. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What's the difference 

  

 

 

 

between the 2 million and the 2.7?  What is the $700,000 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in there; costs for what? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  The $700,000 represented the 

  

 

 

 

 

fees incurred in pursuit of the other defendants, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because there were two other defendants in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying litigation besides Goodyear.  So saying, 

  

 

 

 

 

look, if you're pursuing those other defendants, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly not being impacted by the misconduct of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Goodyear. 

            

And then the second was proving up medical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages because you're going to have to prove up --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  When you gave this 

  

 

 

 

 

figure to the district court you said, in your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

submission, "Goodyear reviewed plaintiffs' billing

entries and created a category of cost."  I'm quoting 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you.  "Unrelated to the alleged harm and outside the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scope of the court's order." 

 

 

 

 

            

So if that was your definition of what was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unrelated to the harm, what's left for the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court to do? 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  And I understand that.  I 

   

  

  

 

 

understand the point we made.  We did preserve in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first footnote of that filing that we were preserving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our Miller argument which had been raised previously. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Miller was a Ninth Circuit decision, they didn't impose 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct causation in our view. 

 

 

 

 

            

And so our point is we understand if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagree with us and say, we waive that; then that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be the remedy.  My point, though, is that because the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct causation analysis was never done in the first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place, there would need to be a remand for that exercise 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to take place. 

 

 

            

And I think it's important as you look at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the district court found, and this gets back to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, why is this not like Chambers.  The district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court found that the discovery costs were inflated by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the misconduct and that the case would have been more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complicated -- was rendered more complicated by the

misconduct.  But that assumes that there was a baseline 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

for how litigation should have proceeded.  And then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

there is a difference, and that difference there is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

capable of determination.  And that's the point that we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are raising in terms of that this is something that can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be quantifiable. 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What costs do you concede 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you're responsible for? 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  We would concede we are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

responsible for the direct harm flowing from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misconduct that the district court found.  And that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would include the expert discovery, the deposition of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Osborn and any related preparation or follow-up  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that deposition, the efforts to get the tests, if there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was discovery requests or negotiations or discovery, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps a status conference, the Olsen deposition where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the district court found misconduct in the preparing for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and following up on that deposition, and then the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearings where the misconduct occurred and any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preparation for those. 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So how much is that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BERGERON:  I don't have a number for 

    

   

 

 

 

you, Justice Kagan. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that's not anything like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the full 2 million?

MR. BERGERON:  It's not.  It would not be. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

And ultimately, I don't want to be exclusive here 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the challenge is we never had an actual fee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application that says, these are the categories of fees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that were incurred as a result of your misconduct and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then we could respond to that.  We never had that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the district court said, you get everything.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they said, we want everything.  And so they may have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other categories that they would say and then we would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debate that before the district court. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You said you wanted to use 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Fox v. Vice standard, and part of that is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but-for causation inquiry.  And part of that is a pretty 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear statement that we don't expect district court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judges to be, you know, green eye-shade accountants, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think what we called them. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. BERGERON:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  To go over each, you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

hour of an attorney's work.  We understand the district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts are going to have to make some broad categories 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and some guesstimates.  Do you agree with that too? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  We do.  I mean, there is 

    

  

 

 

 

 

certainly going to be discretion by the district court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We actually think that this test is going to be easier 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to apply at the end of the day, because if it's

incumbent upon the proponent to say -- to internalize a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

direct causation but-for test, and then make the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments and say, these are the categories of fees that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were incurred as a result of misconduct and then here is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the concomitant fee -- time entries, that would be --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you -- what do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you do then with the plaintiff's position that this case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have settled much earlier, which the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge accepted? 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  And we would say that that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an inappropriate basis for the reasons I said earlier, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

an inappropriate basis as a substitute for causation. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Allowing the court to use a cutoff date and just sweep 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything going forward would be inappropriate.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

even if you disagreed with me on that, as Judge Watford 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

noted in dissent, there was no record support for that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion by the district judge. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose there was a 

  

 

 

 

 

finding made in another case that the case would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settled much earlier.  Then what? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  Then I would go back to my 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

first point which is that's an inappropriate basis upon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which to obviate the need for causation, that the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should not be getting into a temporal line drawing in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms of how we determine what fees may or may not have

been caused by misconduct. 

 

 

 

23 

            

Instead, it would be looking at, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what are the categories that were caused by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misconduct and making those calculations going forward. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But -- but once you start -- once you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sanction the ability to just draw a temporal line in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sand, then I think that makes it too easy for courts to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

avoid, actually, the -- the hard work sometimes -- some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases can be easy -- but the harder work of going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through and looking at the -- the ultimate time entries. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if you're not -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I -- I thought you admitted earlier that it wouldn't be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate for us to say that could never happen, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe I misunderstood your answer. 

   

 

 

            

But suppose we think that there could be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances in which a court could say this would have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settled based on the fatal nature of the disclosure. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This would have settled sooner, had it been properly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclosed.  You would have to fall back on a rule that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says this is never -- it -- although a court is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes permitted to do this, legal rule has to be it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to be done only in the clearest of cases or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something like that. 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  Well, and that's why I go 

   

  

 

 

 

 

kind of with my -- with my first point, which is we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

24 

shouldn't be -- once you start going down -- once you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

open the door to that, I think there is a problem on the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application.  And what we are trying to do is provide a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule that is workable and can be internalized by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is it odd that the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In other words, the more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

egregious the -- the -- the violation the harder it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to show causation.  That seems odd. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  Well, no, Justice Kennedy, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

disagree.  Because the -- the point is if you -- if you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engage in more misconduct, you are going to necessarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generate more fees in response to that, and there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously a deterrent effect of this award. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

The -- the lead counsel no longer practices 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law, Your Honors, and this order is going to follow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Goodyear for years.  And -- and this is -- whether the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

award is $2.7 million or a million dollars, it has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant deterrent effect, and obviously, we are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealing with follow-on litigation going beyond this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But that this is something that, at -- at the end of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day, if there is an appropriate causation test applied, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then the proponent of sanction gets made whole by that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it satisfies any due process concerns.

you're saying well, you should use a causation test, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can't ever consider the likelihood of settlement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

But the likelihood of settlement might be -- might not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be here, but might be in another case, quite relevant to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the question of what fees have been caused by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misconduct. 

            

MR. BERGERON:  It -- and I -- so what I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would say to that is yes, you could envision a case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where that might happen.  At -- at -- on the facts of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case, it couldn't.  But if -- and obviously, my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preference is a rule of law that would said you can't, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but if you left the door open for that, that would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one possibility. 

 

            

            

If I could reserve the balance of my time.

of a causation link, completely, that simply is not the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case here. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How does it -- what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the causation link between their misconduct and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees incurred with respect to other defendants? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EGBERT:  Well, one thing is -- well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's -- there is two answers to that, Your Honor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

One is that, on a very simple level, if we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had the very strong evidence of the -- that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concealed here that showed that the tire was defective, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- because of the -- the Heat Rise test and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence, that it may have been that we would not have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needed to go against any of the -- the other defendants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at all. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but I mean 

   

  

 

 

 

the -- as I understand it, the allegations with respect 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the other defendants did not have relationship to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Heat Rise test, and if -- if -- or -- if that's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, you're saying well, we would have gotten enough 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money from Goodyear; we wouldn't have cared about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money from the others? 

 

 

 

            

MR. EGBERT:  No, Your Honor.  This was a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

situation where there -- there was an accident and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- there was -- the other defendants were the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

builders of the chassis of the motor home and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

other -- the builder of the motor home, and then the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the tire manufacturer.  So we knew somebody was at fault 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27 

there. 

            

If we knew that it was clearly Goodyear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because of the concealed evidence that was so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

devastating to their case, it's possible that the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there would be no need to go after the other chassis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maker who had nothing to do with the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, is that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

standard?  It could be possible? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. EGBERT:  Well, Your Honor, it -- it's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the standard is that we are asking district court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judges to make factual determinations.  And in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, we've got a district court judge who has sat 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through five years of litigation.  She knows what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues -- what the critical issues are in the case.  She 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knows whether or not that evidence that was withheld and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately disclosed was crucial to that, and that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what she characterized it as.  She said it was crucial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence on a central issue. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Did the other defendants 

  

 

 

 

 

contribute to the settlement that was ultimately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reached? 

            

MR. EGBERT:  Your Honor, I do not believe 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that to be the case.  They -- they were out of the case

earlier on than Goodyear was. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  You -- you just said, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought, that the Ninth Circuit accepted a causation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

requirement.  Did you just say that? 

  

 

 

 

 

28 

            

            

MR. EGBERT:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I didn't read the -- the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Ninth Circuit opinion that way.  I'm looking at page 32A 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the appendix of the petition.  The Ninth Circuit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reads Chambers to mean that all attorneys' fees may be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

awarded once the sanctionees begin to flout their clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discovery obligations and engage in frequent and severe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuses of the judicial system, and then it goes on to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say that -- that the district court -- that there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't -- that the Supreme Court expressly rejected the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

linkage argument made by the sanctionees. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So that doesn't seem to me to be accepting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any kind of causation requirement; rather, to say where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've got very frequent and -- and pervasive abuse, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get everything. 

 

            

MR. EGBERT:  No, no, Your Honor.  There are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

other sections in the opinion, and I'll talk about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

portions that you just read. 

 

 

 

 

            

But they -- the Ninth Circuit says the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court did all it was required to do in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case in determining the appropriate amount of fees to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

29 

award as sanctions to compensate the plaintiffs for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages they suffered as a result of sanctionee's bad 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

faith.  And then they went on, they expressly said in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this -- we next consider how close a link is required 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between the harm caused and the compensatory sanctions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Part of the confusion that exists here is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Goodyear argued -- when they argued direct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causation initially, and even in the Ninth Circuit, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were arguing a different concept than they do today. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What they were advocating for was that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial court judge needed to go through the billing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statements, and with respect to each line item, directly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

link it to a specific instance of misconduct.  The trial 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court judge says, I don't have to do that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

When she rejected that direct causation, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was that that was sanctionee's argument of that concept 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that she was rejecting.  She didn't reject the concept 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there had to be a causation, some compensatory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspect of this. 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why did she say --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Judge Watford --

  

 

 

 

 

Judge Watford disagrees with your reading of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority, right? 

 

            

But here --

 

 

MR. EGBERT:  I think he does, Your Honor.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why -- why did the district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

court set two standards, the 2.7 and the 2.0, if she 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought that she was bound by causation?  I thought that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- that the whole idea of those two was, one was, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm bound by a causation requirement and one was if I'm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not. 

            

MR. EGBERT:  No, Your Honor.  It -- it's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

close to that, but what it was, was that, if I'm bound 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by what they are saying that I'm bound by, that I have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to go through each of the billing record -- each billing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line item and link it to an individual instance of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misconduct, if I'm wrong on that, then I'm going to give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- I'm going to do an alternative award. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And -- and let me address for a moment what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was asked earlier about whether or not that's been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waived.  Because they did, in fact, make the argument 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the 700,000 were all that was causally linked. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They didn't argue anything else was -- was suffered from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the causal link deficiency. 

 

 

 

            

What they argued was just the 700,000.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they -- they now claim that they preserved it in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

footnote in their -- in their papers.  But what's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant is if you look at their Ninth Circuit brief, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they didn't argue anything beyond the 700,000 there, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either. 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

31 

            

So it's really in this Court for the first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time that they seek to expand beyond the 700,000.  We --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we say that's too late, that they -- they had a chance 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to argue the causal link deficiency and they did, but it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was only to 700,000, and that they should be held to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  The Ninth Circuit did not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hold that there was a waiver, did it? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EGBERT:  It did not.  It didn't address 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the contingent award at all.  It didn't even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mention it, Your Honor. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You said you were going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

respond to Justice Alito's statements from the Ninth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit.  I have another one to give you. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, this is the closest, it seems to me, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as to a standard that comes from the Ninth Circuit, that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court awarded the amount that the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonably believed it cost the Haegers to litigate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against a party during the time when that party was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acting in bad faith.  So it seems to me that the Ninth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit was viewing this chronologically.  When the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

party was acting in bad faith, all of those costs are --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and fees are appropriate. 

 

 

 

            

MR. EGBERT:  Well, I -- I disagree 

   

   

  

 

respectfully, Your Honor.  I think what the Ninth

Circuit concluded based on the totality of the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court's extensive findings was that this evidence that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

was concealed and all the related deceits were so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important to the plaintiff's claims and so devastating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Goodyear's defense that it -- that it caused the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entire litigation as a whole to be a sham.  And that's 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the language that the Ninth Circuit said, we're -- we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to -- we believe that the whole thing was a sham. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so to use a train analogy, most sanction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases involved misconduct that merely delays the train 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or perhaps ultimately -- you know, causes a detour.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately, that train arrives at the intended station. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In this case, the -- what the district court found, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the Ninth Circuit agreed, was that the train 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jumped track and it went in an entirely wrong direction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It didn't even try the case that the claims that -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my clients had.  It -- it tried the case based on a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

false set of facts and never, ever -- it was never --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the misconduct was never discovered during the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course of this litigation, it was a completely empty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

charade.  It didn't try the real facts of this case.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tried what Goodyear allowed us to have only. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so because the whole thing was a sham, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court appropriately said, you know, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole thing was wasted.  It was a wasted effort and, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

therefore, I'm exercising my discretion in -- in holding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the whole thing should be reimbursed.  I've got to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put you back in the position you were before you started 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

down, jumped track, and went in the wrong direction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely.  And that's what she awarded. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

And -- and who gets to make that kind of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision?  That's a factual determination.  The judge in 

   

  

  

 

 

 

this case was entitled to make a determination of what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was the central issue in the case?  How crucial was this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence to that central issue?  What was the impact of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not having that?  I think all of those are the types of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factual determinations that we want district court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judges to make. 

 

 

            

And to Justice -- and to Justice Alito's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical, there can be situations where the -- it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can be so devastating that it really could be -- a court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could appropriately find that it would have settled at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this point and that -- this is such a case.  This is a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case where the judge, in the exercise of her discretion, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made that determination and that we should be -- the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the appellate court should be upholding that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you do with Judge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Watford who said that that finding that it would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settled much earlier is not supported by the record?

criticism, Your Honor, was that there were other cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

in which the tests were disclosed and they didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settle. 

            

But here's the important point, and this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undisputed:  Judge Silver specifically found -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

district court judge specifically found that unlike in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our case where we had an expert that said -- admitted --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Goodyear's own internal expert admitted that anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above 200 degrees would cause problems for the tire, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause separation, they didn't have that evidence in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those other cases.  All they had was the test results 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that showed it was above 200 degrees, significantly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above 200 degrees.  It's the combination of both that is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so damning.  It's the --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you describe for 

  

 

 

 

 

me your definition of direct causation or causation? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EGBERT:  Causation, Your Honor.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

prefer causation. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Give me a definition. 

   

  

 

 

MR. EGBERT:  The causation is that it has to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be the result of or caused by.  It's just the "but for," 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's what we've been -- what the case law has been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operating under.  There is no use of the word "direct" 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in prior case law, and there needs --

Fox, than the definition and the words Fox used? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35 

            

MR. EGBERT:  Well, I think it's -- I think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

it's a very similar concept. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But why?  Why get into 19 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

different meanings of "cause" in the law?  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

proximate cause is normally defined as a but-for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

condition and foreseeable. 

 

 

            

            

MR. EGBERT:  And -- and, Your Honor --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And if we start having --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

why should we have some other definition here? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EGBERT:  I -- I agree.  I do not -- we 

    

    

   

 

 

 

 

have not advocated for adding additional language or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modifying --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why don't we just say, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

look, there's an argument here and you look at what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court said.  She didn't say really that I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to look and see if there's but for and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreseeability.  And, moreover, she said cause and then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

she said, well, maybe it's not. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So it's sort of ambiguous what she did. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Send it back to the Ninth Circuit, say it's proximate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause, that's the test, you apply it.  Did she do it? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If not, send it back to her.  Good-bye. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EGBERT:  Your Honor, to begin with,

with respect to cause generally is a separate issue. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

36 

But in this case, we submit there's no basis for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remanding to the trial court for any further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consideration because she already took their causation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument at full face value and adopted 100 percent of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their argument and entered the contingent award.

Circuit, too? 

 

            

MR. EGBERT:  Well, there's no -- there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

nothing to be left.  There's been a waiver of their 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument.  And -- and her -- this Court could simply say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the contingent award should be in effect. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but I'm not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sure that she, in calculating the $700,000, applied an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate proximate cause analysis.  I mean, those are 

    

 

 

 

 

 

things like the other defendants and all of that.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, I'm not sure that unless you accept the idea -- I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand your argument, well, it would have settled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and, therefore, every -- every expense was caused.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems to me that saying the only ones that were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proximately caused -- that were not proximately caused 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were the $700,000 is a bit of a stretch. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EGBERT:  Well, she -- she didn't have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make that determination, Your Honor, because they made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the argument.  They came forward and said that of this

$2.7 million --

 

 

37 

            

argument. 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh.  So your waiver 

  

  

 

 

 

 

MR. EGBERT:  The waiver argument.  Exactly. 

  

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Which was not --

  

 

 

 

 

 

not -- the Ninth Circuit did not rely on the waiver 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument. 

            

MR. EGBERT:  The -- the Ninth Circuit did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not address the contingent award at all and so didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need to get into whether or not there was a waiver.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ninth Circuit affirmed on the basis of the larger award. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So here what we have is, if -- if we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to say that the trial court used the wrong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard, then we have to say, well, do we need to send 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it back to -- to use the right standard?  They're --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're arguing that the right standard was that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should -- she should have used a different causation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard.  But they've already made that argument to her 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and they've told her that if you accept our argument, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adds up to $700,000.  She accepted their argument 100 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I -- I suppose 

   

   

  

 

 

the idea would be that in an opinion, we would provide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

greater guidance on exactly what type of analysis is to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be applied.  And if the district court wants to go ahead

and say, well, that's exactly what I did, well, then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38 

they -- they can take the case from there.  But I mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply because -- and -- and as I look at the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calculation, I understand why the 700,000 would be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

carved out, but I don't think it can be regarded as the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application of proximate cause across the board. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EGBERT:  Well, I think it certainly was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the application of whatever it was the party was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguing.  And -- and my concern is that we're going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give the party a second bite at the apple. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe we don't have to.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean, you -- but I have, she said -- the key words here, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court said is, she said the case is more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likely -- more likely than not would have settled much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

earlier.  When?  Then she says, but, of course, the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence might have made plaintiffs realize they had a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

winning trial and they would have refused to settle. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. EGBERT:  And then she said --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What? 

  

 

MR. EGBERT:  -- ultimately, I conclude that 

   

  

 

 

 

the most appropriate award given these circumstances is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to award all of the fees and costs incurred. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the reason for that, Your Honor, was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the entire litigation became a sham, because we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

were litigating a false set of facts and it -- and she 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

said that it permeated every aspect of the litigation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

Those facts aren't -- those findings are subject to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

great deference and we -- we ought to be deferring to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- those findings.  And she sat through five years 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this litigation and then had two years' worth of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sanction proceeding --

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but you say it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was a sham, but I -- and maybe you disagree, but 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Goodyear in its -- in its reply brief, details the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good-faith defenses it had that were unrelated to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Heat Rise test; in other words, about the cause of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accident, whether other parties were involved, that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tire was already damaged, the -- you know, all sorts of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other things, including ones that went to the question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of damages, which surely would have been pertinent in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the case would have settled. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EGBERT:  And that's Goodyear's version 

  

 

 

 

 

of the facts.  That's Goodyear's argument about here's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the findings that she could have.  There's evidence to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

support these concepts.  But those were arguments and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts that were presented.  Their version was presented 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the trial court.  The trial court looked at that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

version, looked at the contrary version, and made a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination of what she found to be the facts.

it's hard for me to see how the district court would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a position, except perhaps in an extraordinary case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to make the calculation, oh, the parties would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have settled this.  I mean, you're involved in this; 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

your friend on the other side is.  You know, discussions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about whether to settle the case and a lot of different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things go into that calculation, and sometimes they --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they line up and sometimes they don't. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But for the district court to -- to make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that determination, it seems to me that that would be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very hard calculation.  I mean, things like the extent 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

to which your clients need the money, the extent to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which your clients -- what their expectations were, what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their stomach for going on with more years of litigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, I don't know how a district court factors in all 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

those considerations. 

 

            

MR. EGBERT:  Well, Your Honor, even if we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

accepted that -- that factual finding by the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court as merely an indication of how critical and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crucial this evidence was to the case, then we can apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that to her other findings unrelated to, well, it would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have settled immediately. 

 

 

            

She also found that this misconduct was so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pervasive and -- that it permeated every aspect of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation.  That's -- that's the basis on which the

Ninth Circuit ultimately said that she found that it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a sham.  That the entirety of --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about -- what about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Goodrich's argument that the defect in the tire, all of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was beside the point because the cause of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accident was road debris?  Road debris forced this car 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to swerve off the road. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. EGBERT:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That would have happened 

  

 

 

 

 

even if you had a 100 percent fit tire. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EGBERT:  Your Honor, you're -- you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

right that they're -- that they make arguments that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court could have and indeed should have found 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise.  What they're in effect doing is they're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying, hey, there's other facts out here that if viewed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in our favor would help us and would contradict what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court judge found. 

 

 

 

            

But just because there are two possible, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable findings of fact from the evidence doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean that the trial court judge was clearly erroneous in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making her determination.  It's her determination.  --

  

  

 

 

 

 

as long as it's not clearly erroneous, her determination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should stand, not what Goodyear says was also a possible 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation of all the facts. 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think that's what that goes to, Your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

Honor.  Here, there are other arguments that they could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

make.  Indeed they did make other arguments.  And at the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end of a very long, excruciating process, the judge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

stuck her neck out and made findings of fact.  And those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

findings of fact are not clearly erroneous.  And because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're not, they should be the basis on which we make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the determination here in this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I'm not sure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you would call it -- it's not a typical finding of fact 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to say that based on all of the, you know, issues in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms -- I think the parties would have settled.  I find 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it more likely than not.  I mean, it has factual 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements, but it's much more of a judgment determination 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

than simply this is what happened or this is what would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen. 

            

MR. EGBERT:  Your Honor, I -- I agree that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

it is an unusual finding, but I do think that it is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nevertheless a factual finding.  And I -- and I think 

   

   

   

  

 

 

that if we're going to put the burden on trial court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judges to grapple with cases in which the -- we're not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking -- again, we're not talking about something that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

slowed the train down.  We're talking about something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the district court judge found was pretty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

monumental, went to the very heart of this case.  And if

JUSTICE BREYER:  And the one key thing, all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of that, we know there has been sham litigation in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43 

world.  And she says maybe the plaintiffs wouldn't have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settled.  Who knows?  You probably know.  But who knows? 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the key word she leaves out, and there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is some evidence she thought she was doing something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different -- namely, the 700,000 -- is that she applied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a proximate cause standard.  She doesn't say she's doing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  There is some indication to the contrary. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So to be -- I'd just repeat myself that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't have to decide all those things but for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard.  And you go back to the Ninth Circuit, one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extra proceeding, and then you make your -- your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument right there exactly what you're saying and say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, she did apply the right standard.  And even if she 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't, we lose the 700,000. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EGBERT:  Well, Your Honor, that is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

certainly a possible procedure, but we see no need to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even send it back to the Ninth Circuit to further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

embroil the plaintiffs in what has already been an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraordinary long process. 

 

 

            

Here, I think that the easiest part of this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case is that the -- Goodyear had an opportunity to make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its causation argument.  It did.  And it argued to the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tune of only 700,000.  What can possibly be served by

broader finding, the more, the more -- the more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44 

aggressive finding by the district court judge --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Assuming the bad faith 

  

 

 

 

 

that the district court found -- not making a judgment, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because that hasn't been proffered before us.  But if, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in fact, you were subjected to the bad faith the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found, then sending it back just costs you more money; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right? 

            

MR. EGBERT:  That's -- that's all that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

accomplishes from my perspective, Your Honor.  It just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

further delays and costs more money for my clients, who, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I believe, have already been adequately victimized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through this process. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the money -- and this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is an award of counsel fees, so the money would go to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel, not the plaintiff? 

 

 

 

            

MR. EGBERT:  Your Honor, that's -- that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

outside the record, but I can tell you that it's --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's not how it works under the agreement with -- with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the client. 

 

            

We would ask the Court to make -- to take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very careful look at not only the aspect of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settlement piece of it that Justice Breyer has -- has

focused on, but it's also an alternative finding.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was one of her two findings that allowed her to -- to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

award the entirety of the fees and costs incurred. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The other one is that the misconduct was so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

severe and pervasive that it permeated every aspect of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the litigation.  Now, that's not a -- a speculation as 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

to who would settle or not.  That's a distinct finding. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What does that mean?  Is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that different from saying that it caused everything? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

To say that it permeated everything, is that the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing as saying that it -- it caused everything? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EGBERT:  I -- Your Honor, I -- I think 

    

   

   

 

 

 

it is.  I think that's what the district court judge 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meant.  If you look at the entirety of her 66-page 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision, I think that's what she was getting to, that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this was so significant in the context of these specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts that it -- it changed everything.  We -- in -- you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, they talk about, well, what -- what would you put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on your list of what we can recover?  Well, every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deposition, we asked the wrong questions.  Every motion, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we made the wrong argument.  Everything -- every effort 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was done was affected by --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the question, then. 

  

 

 

 

 

That's the legal question.  It's very suitable for us. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If, in fact, it is the case that a district court would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

not have awarded $15 or 15 million, whatever it is, this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount, it would have found no causation or would not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46 

have found causation and would not have awarded the fee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but for the fact it was absolutely egregious, does that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permit the district court to award the fee? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, that is a pure legal question.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

where -- where do you stand on that?  I mean, that, it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems, on the basis of the precedent -- Rule 11, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mineworkers, and so forth -- the answer to that question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is no, unless you're going to criminal proceedings. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Now, where do you stand on that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. EGBERT:  I agree 100 percent, Your 

    

 

 

 

 

Honor, that --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but I've asked the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question.  I haven't -- I mean, which side? 

    

   

 

 

 

            

MR. EGBERT:  I stand on the -- the side that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says that it does have to be compensatory.  Simply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot say, well, this was very bad. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 

  

 

MR. EGBERT:  There has to be causation.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

our position had -- I think we read both the district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court decision and the Ninth Circuit decision as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole.  Admittedly, there -- there are lines that one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can pull out that create confusion, particularly in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court decision, because she was looking at some

Ninth Circuit decisions that created confusion for her. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But at the end, both of them acknowledged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there's a causation requirement, and we do not shy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from that.  We -- because you would then be in the realm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

of having to use criminal -- the heightened criminal due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process protections.  But that -- that is not our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation. 

            

We believe that the two alternative findings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of fact are sufficient for the award of all of the fees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and costs that were incurred.  And, again, when I say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all of them, I'm talking about from a -- a point early 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on in the litigation, not from the very beginning, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

early on throughout the end because the Court and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ninth Circuit agreed that the entirety of the litigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was a sham. 

   

            

Yes, there -- there were other things that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were done in terms of medical depositions, but they were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all done in the context of an empty charade.  And when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you do things in the context of an empty charade, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're still empty.  And so we would -- we believe that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court did not abuse her discretion in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making those findings and that they should be affirmed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PIERRE H. BERGERON 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. BERGERON:  Thank you. 

  

 

 

The district court did not apply the result 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of or cause by test that Mr. Egbert just articulated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It never went down that path, and the -- what they seem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be arguing in their brief was that there is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction between, as Justice Breyer was noting, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

truly egregious from the less egregious, which was how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court tried to draw the line. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As we pointed out, that's not an effective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way of drawing the line.  You could never have a test 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where you would say, well, this is truly egregious; so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we obviate the need for causation.  This is less 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

egregious, so we have to have more tailoring.  And they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't provide a satisfactory response to that. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

On the point about what we argued at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ninth Circuit, we did make the point -- we argued that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court's entire determination was not based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the correct legal standards, so we asked the whole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing to be remanded to the district court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There is something --

  

 

 

 

 

I -- I do understand that.  But one argument they have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made that -- that I had not thought of the case in,

Justice Breyer said, we don't know what would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened.  That's what the district court said.  Could 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

have settled right away.  It could have gone to trial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

for more money. 

 

 

            

His argument that -- which he was really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying was this was a sham litigation, because with the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper information, everything related to your client, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at least, would not have happened the way it did. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Things would have been a very different litigation. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

From that moment on, whether through settlement or not, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you wasted their time and the court's time, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything was infected by the failure to give the Heat 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rise test. 

 

            

            

            

Why isn't that put forth, if you --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BERGERON:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He used the analogy of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you derailed the train to take another route it didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to travel. 

 

 

            

            

MR. BERGERON:  Right.  Well, the --

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why isn't the travel 

  

 

 

 

 

 

on that route compensable? 

 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  Well, the problem with that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Your Honor, is that was the Ninth Circuit's gloss on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the district court did.  The district court never 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made any finding that there was sham litigation here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

In fact, the district court expressly declined to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50 

resolve, you know, how significant this test was at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end of the day.  And if you look at the district court's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

findings about this misconduct, they are all related to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this test.  And this test is one component of the design 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defect claim.  There were other claims that did not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

survive summary judgment, failure to warn, manufacturing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defect.  Those were all unrelated to this test. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So there is a lot of stuff in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation.  Choice of law debates.  I mean, pursuit of 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

other defendants.  There are so many things that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened independent of this Heat Rise test that were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not a waste and would not need to be redone if you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumed that the case -- you know, the test came out on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the day before trial and you had to figure out well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what would you need to redo at that point. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

And I think this gets back to --

   

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  She did say more than not. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

She did say more -- this case, more likely than not, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have settled much earlier.  And you'll be arguing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about she used the wrong word earlier.  They are not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguing about that apparently. 

 

 

 

            

So more likely than not, it would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settled.  Therefore costs that do, in fact, flow from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fact that it didn't settle are costs that you have

to pay.  It sounds like a causation standard. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BERGERON:  But, Justice Breyer, we 

  

 

 

 

 

51 

disagree that it is a causation standard.  In fact, for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a lot of the reasons the Chief Justice raised earlier. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, there is so many issues that go into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether or not you have a settlement and just because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was -- the district court believed that they may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have settled earlier, but, again, the court didn't say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when we would have settled earlier and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

below? 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You make that an issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BERGERON:  Yes, we did.  I mean -- and 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

obviously Judge Watford agreed with us in the Ninth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit because we made that point -- made that point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there, as well. 

 

 

            

One of the other things I want to emphasize 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that the -- part of the reason we need a meaningful 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causation test is to bring this in line with -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inherent authority in line with the other sanction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regimes so that courts cannot basically avoid the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements of the other statutory and rule-based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sanction regimes by a liberalization of the causation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

requirement under inherent authority. 

 

 

 

              

A good example of this is Rule 37.  Rule 37 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governs production of documents and the failure to

produce documents.  That could have been something the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

52 

district court relied on here, and there is a causation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement.  So the district court should not be able 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to avoid Rule 37, go to inherent authority and get a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broader sanctioning power. 

 

 

            

So for all those reasons, Your Honors, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respectfully request reversal.
