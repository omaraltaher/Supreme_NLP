CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-1371, Missouri v. Seibert. 


Ms. Mitchell.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF KAREN K. MITCHELL


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. MITCHELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Miranda's core ruling is that an unwarned


statement may not be used in the prosecution's case in


chief to prove guilt.  In this case, the prosecution did


not seek to admit an unwarned statement, rather the


statement that was offered was preceded by a meticulous


recitation of Miranda warnings, an express waiver of


rights, and was the product of non-coercive questioning.


A fully warned and otherwise voluntary statement


is not tainted by the existence of a prior unwarned


statement even if the officer intentionally initiated


questioning without warning and that is true for two


reasons. 


First, because an officer's intent does not


render the unwarned statement actually involuntary.  The


unwarned statement is merely presumptively compelled, and


once warnings are administered, that presumption ends and

the suspect has the information necessary to make a


knowing and intelligent decision about waiver. 


QUESTION:  May I just interrupt?  You say the


second warning removes the presumption as to the earlier


unwarned statement.  Why? 


MS. MITCHELL:  Going forward, Your Honor, yes.


QUESTION:  Going forward, but not going


backward.


MS. MITCHELL:  No.  No, Your Honor.  Only going


-- it -- it ends the presumption at that --


QUESTION:  So that you still have the


presumption that the earlier statement was involuntary.


MS. MITCHELL:  Yes, Your Honor.  It ends the


presumption that that -- at that point going forward


because it provides the --


QUESTION:  And is that true if the -- if the


conversation after the warnings includes interrogation


about what he said before? 


MS. MITCHELL:  It would depend on how that


happened, but under the facts of this case, yes, it would


still remain true. 


There are essentially -- under Miranda, there


are two elements that we have to look at in determining


whether a statement is admissible, and that is whether you


have a knowing, intelligent, voluntary waiver and whether

the statement is in fact voluntary.  If there is a


reference back, as there was in this case to the previous


statement, it could be a problem if that is part of the


waiver element.  And I believe that's what this Court


indicated in Elstad itself.  If the officer used that in a


way that affected the knowing nature then of what the --


the information that was imparted and made the waiver


therefore defective, it may be problematic.  However, as


in this case, where there's simply a reference back during


the -- the questioning, after there is a waiver and a


decision to go forward, that alone does not affect the


voluntariness of that subsequent statement. 


QUESTION:  Would it -- would it affect it if the


officer said, now, an hour ago you told me X?  Were you


correct in saying that or not?  Would that be permissible?


MS. MITCHELL:  I think so.  After the decision


has been made to waive and the individual has decided to


proceed forward and talk, I believe that's correct, Your


Honor, because --


QUESTION:  No, please finish. 


MS. MITCHELL:  -- because it does not -- it is


not sufficient to overbore the individual's will, which is


the question at that point because we're at the voluntary


analysis at that point.


QUESTION:  The difficulty I have with the

argument is the premise that you state -- is in accepting


the premise that you state, and that is that a second


interrogation that falls on the heels of the first --


here, I think there was a 20-minute break -- can really be


separated as a matter of simple psychology.  I -- I have


difficulty in accepting the plausibility of a conclusion


that the -- that the ostensible waiver in the second case


is really a free waiver as distinct from sort of throwing


up one's hands and saying it's too late to say no now. 


It's the -- it -- there's a basic implausibility in your


case.  What -- what can you offer on that point?


MS. MITCHELL:  Well, first, Elstad addressed


that exact issue and came to the opposite conclusion.


QUESTION:  But -- but Elstad -- I mean, let me


-- and maybe that's the way I should have focused the


case.  In -- in Elstad, you did not have a -- let's say, a


-- a systematic questioning of the -- of the sort that


went on here.  Here the -- the police did, indeed, engage


in a kind of first-round interrogation, and the -- the


intensity of their pressure to get answers in this case


seems to me qualitatively different from Elstad.


MS. MITCHELL:  It is different, Your Honor. 


There clearly is a continuum.  But the appropriate


question is whether the first statement was involuntary or


not.  If in fact that questioning and that pressure had

been great enough to make that first statement


involuntary, then absolutely it would create the kind of


taint that could carry forward even after subsequent


warnings were given.  I think that is the lesson of


Elstad.


But Elstad draws that distinction between actual


coercion and presumptive coercion, and where it is merely


presumptive -- it does not rise to the level of actual --


then that does not carry forward. 


QUESTION:  But that's -- comparatively speaking,


I -- I think maybe that was -- that was relatively easy to


tell in Elstad.  Here, it's going to be a serious issue,


and it seems to me that in order to litigate this issue as


the threshold issue to determining whether the second


waiver or as part of the litigation as to whether the --


the ostensible waiver really is a waiver and the second


statement really is voluntary, we're right back in the


morass of litigation, which is one of the principal


objects of Miranda to avoid in the first place.  We -- we


said, look, this -- this litigation is very difficult. 


It's difficult to engage in this litigation and produce a


-- a clear and reliable answer.  It seems to me that --


that the position you take forces us right back into that


litigation position that we tried to get away from in


Miranda itself.

 MS. MITCHELL:  Well, two observations on that,


Your Honor. 


First, the Court has not really ever gotten away


from the totality of the circumstances analysis.  The


Court has continued to employ it as the primary


analysis --


QUESTION:  But you want us to wade deeper. 


You're -- you're absolutely right.  There's -- there's no


-- there's no easy way.  But your way would make it more


difficult.  Your -- your way would promote litigation,


wouldn't it? 


MS. MITCHELL:  I -- I don't know that I agree


with that because I don't see this as different from where


you are in Harris where you still have to do a full-blown


analysis of voluntariness.  It is somewhat different than


the two-prong analysis that is done in every case where


voluntariness is at issue because you have the warnings


and then, arguably, the totality of the circumstances


analysis is somewhat easier.  But, nevertheless, in a


situation such as Harris, where you're making on the front


end a determination on voluntariness, I think it is very,


very similar to what -- what we are suggesting here.


QUESTION:  Ms. Mitchell, do you take the


position that we have to conduct a voluntariness inquiry


in -- as to the second statement --

 MS. MITCHELL:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- after the warnings were given?


MS. MITCHELL:  Yes.


QUESTION:  You agree with that. 


MS. MITCHELL:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  And in doing that, do you think that


the officer's use of the initial confession to get the


defendant to admit what went on is irrelevant to that


voluntariness inquiry --


MS. MITCHELL:  I would not --


QUESTION:  -- or just that it isn't sufficient


to determine the outcome? 


MS. MITCHELL:  I think it --


QUESTION:  What -- what is your position


exactly?


MS. MITCHELL:  I think it is not sufficient to


determine the outcome.  I would not say it is irrelevant.


QUESTION:  But it is relevant in the inquiry.


MS. MITCHELL:  I would not say it's irrelevant


because I think, as the Court has looked at totality of


the circumstances and what is necessary to show coercion,


basically the Court has looked, I believe, at two


elements:  the conduct of the officer and if it is


coercive, and the effect on the individual considering


their personality, character traits, and so forth.  In

Elstad, when -- in talking about the effect of the cat out


of the bag on the individual, the Court talked about some


subjective disadvantage that the individual might have,


and so I suppose that type of analysis could lump that


within the characteristics of the individual that the


Court would look at in determining a totality of the


circumstances analysis. 


QUESTION:  I -- I don't -- I don't understand


your -- your position on that point.  It -- it seems to me


that if there has been no coercion in the first


confession, how could -- how could it possibly be relevant


to whether the second confession is voluntary, whether


there had been a prior admission?


MS. MITCHELL:  I don't think it can control,


Your Honor, and I don't --


QUESTION:  I didn't say control.  How could it


possibly be relevant?  Unless you're saying what is


relevant is whether Miranda was observed, which has


nothing to do with whether it was necessarily involuntary.


MS. MITCHELL:  And I suppose I would draw the


distinction between the questioning and the answer, which


I think is a distinction this Court drew in Elstad as


well.  I don't think the questioning is relevant at all to


the subsequent statement, and certainly I would agree with


what you're saying.  When there's no coercion, it should

not -- there's no taint that carries forward. 


But if it is to be considered at all -- and


perhaps it shouldn't be, but in a totality of the


circumstances analysis, if there is a reference back and


the Court wants to consider that as part of the totality,


it seems to me the Court might look at from the


perspective of whether it in some way affects the


individual. 


QUESTION:  What -- what you're inviting courts


to do is to say, well, he wouldn't have made the second


confession had he not made the first one which was


unwarned under Miranda and therefore the second one is


also presumptively -- that's what you're inviting.


MS. MITCHELL:  I don't think so.  That -- that


fact alone could never carry the day, and I think that was


made very, very clear in Elstad where that was --


QUESTION:  Of course, it can't carry the day,


but it's -- it's one of the totality of the circumstances. 


Right?


MS. MITCHELL:  Correct.  But just the reference


back I don't believe makes it any -- really affects it or


makes it any -- any different than the fact that the cat


has already been let out of the bag --


QUESTION:  May I ask you just a broader


question?  Is there anything -- if your submission is

correct, is there any reason why a police department


should not adopt a policy that said, never give Miranda


warnings until a suspect confesses?


MS. MITCHELL:  I think -- I think there are lots


of reasons why -- why police departments would not do


that.


QUESTION:  Why not? 


MS. MITCHELL:  There is a risk associated with


taking this type of an approach, and as our officer


indicated here, he was rolling the dice.  He did not


indicate that he did this in every single interrogation


he -- he --


QUESTION:  So what has he got to lose is what I


have to understand.  Because if the -- if he doesn't


confess anyway, you haven't lost anything.  He wouldn't


have confessed with the Miranda warning.  If he does


confess, then you've got a shot at getting it in after


giving him the Miranda warning.


MS. MITCHELL:  What --


QUESTION:  Why would you not -- why would you


not always adopt that policy? 


MS. MITCHELL:  Well, what officers want when


they do an interrogation generally is an admissible


statement for all purposes, not for some limited purpose. 


And so what they are looking for is to maximize that

possibility, and they know that -- that the vast majority


of people, according to studies, percentage-wise do in


fact waive and give a statement.  What they risk then is,


by not giving the warnings on the front end, is that that


alone will become a factor in the analysis in determining


whether or not that first statement was voluntary.  If


the --


QUESTION:  But not if you get the rule that --


that you're asking for here, other than this factor.


And then that gets back to the question I want


to ask and I think it bears on what you're telling Justice


Stevens.  Can you tell me what relevance, what weight,


what significance do we attach to an earlier unwarned


statement? 


MS. MITCHELL:  In and of --


QUESTION:  It is a factor in the totality of the


circumstances?  Is that -- is that what you're telling us?


MS. MITCHELL:  No.  What I'm saying is in this


-- as in this case, where there is a reference back, I


think the Court could look at that as one factor when it's


determining totality of the circumstances and whether the


statement is voluntary or not.  Just the fact that there


had been previous interrogation or previous questioning


without warnings in and of itself I do not believe, under


any circumstances, could carry forward.

 QUESTION:  When you say reference back, Ms.


Mitchell, you mean the interrogator refers back to the --


MS. MITCHELL:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- earlier statement. 


MS. MITCHELL:  As occurred in this case.


QUESTION:  And the reference back could cause it


-- could cause the later statement to be involuntary


because?


MS. MITCHELL:  Well, I don't think it would


cause the -- the statement to be involuntary in and of


itself, but --


QUESTION:  I know not in and of itself, but it


-- it tends to show that the prior statement -- that the


later statement is involuntary.  Unless it tends to show


that, it's irrelevant.  Now, why is it that it tends to


show that? 


MS. MITCHELL:  I think if the Court were to


consider that, it would be one factor bearing on how the


other circumstances or other parts of the police conduct


affected that individual because in the analysis in


Elstad, the Court looked at this question of the effect on


the individual of having spoken before.  So it would not


be the -- the previous questioning because that --


QUESTION:  The -- the only way it could have any


bearing, it seems to me, is that the person would have

said, what the heck, I've already coughed it up, I may as


well -- I may as well do it again.  And you think that


that makes the second one involuntary.


MS. MITCHELL:  I don't think that makes the


second --


QUESTION:  Well, I don't think it does either.


MS. MITCHELL:  I don't --


QUESTION:  And if it doesn't, I don't see how it


can at all be relevant. 


MS. MITCHELL:  Well, Your Honor, if the Court is


looking at the totality of the circumstances, what we're


saying is that may be one circumstance the --


QUESTION:  When we said totality of the


circumstances, I -- I had always thought we meant totality


of the relevant circumstances, you know, not whether it's


a Tuesday afternoon or not. 


QUESTION:  Is time relevant?  Suppose as soon as


the officers got what they wanted from Mrs. Seibert, they


didn't give her a 20-minute break to have a cigarette,


they said, fine, we got it.  Now we're going to redo your


Miranda rights nice and slow and then go right on with the


questions.  Is there any significance to the time and


place?  That is, she was -- she was in the same room with


the same officers.


MS. MITCHELL:  Correct.

 QUESTION:  Suppose it had been one continuous


episode, but in the middle of it, they gave her Miranda


warnings.


MS. MITCHELL:  We do not believe that that would


make any difference, Your Honor.  As this Court indicated


in Elstad, a waiver that is otherwise voluntary and


knowing is not ineffective for some specific period of


time simply because there was prior interrogation.


QUESTION:  It's -- it's simply that the closer


the interrogation, the less likely that there is in fact a


voluntary waiver.


MS. MITCHELL:  I don't believe so, Your Honor,


because what -- what you're looking at to determine if


there's a voluntary waiver is whether the individual had


the information, specifically the legal information, they


needed to make a decision.  That is giving them their


warnings and -- and in a way that clearly communicates


their rights to them, and then they have an opportunity to


make a decision. 


QUESTION:  No, but it's -- it's more than simply


a -- I mean, there's -- there's no question that the --


that the crucial element is a decision made with


appreciation of legal rights.  But the other crucial


element is that the decision to waive them be voluntary.


MS. MITCHELL:  Correct.

 QUESTION:  And it seems to me the closer you are


to the prior statement, the closer you are to saying to


yourself, what have I got left to waive?  Sure, I'll go


ahead.  I've already done it. 


MS. MITCHELL:  I think --


QUESTION:  And -- and that's not a -- that's not


a function of -- of knowledge of law.  It's a function of


proximity to the prior statement. 


MS. MITCHELL:  Well, two things on that.  I


think Elstad indicated strongly that time was not


relevant.  It would be relevant if we were doing an


attenuation analysis, but we're not because there wasn't


underlying coercive conduct, one. 


Two, I think if you look at cases such as Bayer,


this Court has indicated that, you know, once the cat is


out of the bag, the cat is out of the bag.  And perhaps,


if you want to look at it that way, it always has some


lingering effect, but that is not sufficient to make the


second statement involuntary.  So how long that break


is --


QUESTION:  Do you know -- do you know why we --


we have the common phrase, I think I'll sleep on it?  We


have that phrase because we're -- we're likely to make a


-- a more intelligent decision if we have more time.

 MS. MITCHELL:  But on the other hand, Your


Honor, I think this could be more equated to buyer remorse


where someone has done something and they thought, wow, I


wish I hadn't done that.  And then they're told exactly


what their rights are, and it's like, wow, okay, I have an


opportunity to change what I have just done.  And that's


what I think really is going on here when the warnings are


read to the individual, and so, no, I do not believe that


the passage of time is relevant.


If there are no other questions at this time.


QUESTION:  That -- you're reserving your time,


Ms. Mitchell? 


MS. MITCHELL:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Very well.


Mr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


An officer's failure to give Miranda warnings


before taking an initial statement does not presumptively


taint the admissibility of a subsequent statement that has


been preceded by Miranda warnings and an express waiver of


Miranda rights.  And the reason is that the risk of

compulsion that is inherent in unwarned custodial


interrogation and that makes the first statement


inadmissible is counteracted once Miranda warnings have


been given.


QUESTION:  May I ask whether you -- you to


comment on one -- what if we required that the second


warning include a statement that you realize what you said


up to now would be inadmissible in your trial? 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  That is exactly the requirement


that this Court rejected in Elstad, and the only


difference between this case and in Elstad identified by


the Missouri Supreme Court is that here the initial


failure to warn was intentional.  And the -- the fact of


intentionality adds nothing to the level of compulsion


that is experienced by the suspect during the initial


interrogation.  It adds nothing to the psychological force


that operates on the suspect who has confessed once as a


result of unwarned -- during unwarned questioning and the


giving and subsequent administration of Miranda warnings


is no less effective in providing the information that is


necessary to make a knowing and voluntary decision --


QUESTION:  That's -- that's what's not clear to


me, that -- that -- it seems to me you're absolutely on


the right track in saying that Miranda has, as one of its


basic purposes, dealing with cases where there may or may

not be compulsion.  We're not sure.  And this gets rid of


the risk, so that that's a very good way of describing it.


And then it seems to me in this kind of case we


have two risks.  One was the risk that really it was


compelled -- the first statement.  And second is the risk


that really that first statement does lead to the second


confession.


And so to obviate those risks, would it make


sense to say in any case where the police knowingly or


reasonably should have known they're supposed to give


Miranda warnings in the first case, you can use the second


statement but only if the government shows that, first of


all, that first one wasn't compelled?  Second, it shows


that the Miranda warning was given before the second.  And


third, it shows that a time has to have elapsed sufficient


to make that Miranda warning reasonable, reasonably


cutting the causal connection that you want it to cut. 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  No, Justice Breyer. 


QUESTION:  Because? 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Because start with Elstad which


rejected any requirement of a break.  And -- and Elstad


also said that the risk of compulsion that is inherent in


the initial interrogation and that makes that inadmissible


is counteracted once the Miranda warnings have been given,


whether or not there has been a significant break between

the initial and the second interrogation.


Now let me address your question about


reasonable and knowing and whether that should make a


difference.  The fact that the warnings were known, that


-- that this was a custodial interrogation situation, the


fact that the officer may have been unreasonable in


thinking it was not -- neither of those adds anything to


the level of compulsion that is experienced by the suspect


during the initial --


QUESTION:  It does not.  You're right, but what


it does do is provide a tremendous incentive for the


police to run around the Miranda warning, and when they


run around it, we could get back, if they do it enough,


into the circumstances before Miranda that were bad


circumstances and called for Miranda.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  But the difference between this


situation and Miranda is that what Miranda addressed was a


situation where you were relying solely on a voluntariness


inquiry to determine whether the statements that were


admitted were compelled.  And the Court has determined


that there is an unacceptable risk in that situation when


all you're relying on is the totality of the circumstances


that a compelled statement will be admitted.  In this


situation, you are not relying --

 MR. GORNSTEIN:  -- totally on the --


QUESTION:  Mr. Gornstein, I -- Miranda, whatever


it has become, has all over it inform at once, and what


we're talking now is, no, Miranda isn't inform at once at


all.  It's -- it can be.  Don't inform until, until you've


gotten enough, and then.  Now, that seems to me quite a


different thing.  Anyone reading the Miranda decision


says, oh, yes, these are the things the police are


supposed to say up front.  And now you're saying, no, it


doesn't really mean that at all.  It means don't inform of


your rights until, somewhere in midstream.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Justice Ginsburg, how I -- how I


would describe it is that you are required to give Miranda


warnings if the government is going to be able to


introduce this -- the statements as substantive evidence


of the defendant's guilt.


QUESTION:  But, Mr. Gornstein, you're just


making a different compelled inquiry.  Now you're not


asking whether the warned statement was compelled, but


you're asking in every case whether the earlier statement


was compelled so that you'd have the police have a policy


of always refusing to give warning, but say, well, don't


question him for more than 8 or 9 hours or something like


that because you run the risk of compulsion.  But it seems


to me you're going to get that same factual inquiry with

respect to the earlier statement that Miranda was designed


to prevent -- to avoid with respect to the later


statement. 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  But the difference, Justice


Stevens, is that -- that yes, there will be inquiry into


the voluntariness of the first statement and the second


statement, but the difference is that the only statement


that is being admitted is the second statement.  And


that's --


QUESTION:  But you -- you agree that's


inadmissible if the earlier one was compelled.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well, not automatically


inadmissible if it was compelled, Justice Stevens.  There


would be a --


QUESTION:  Oh, I misunderstood you. 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  No.  That would be presumptively


taint -- it would presumptively taint the subsequent


statement and then you would look to the --


QUESTION:  No.  I'm -- I'm assuming it's clear


from the evidence the first statement was not merely


presumptively compelled but actually compelled. 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  No.  What I'm saying --


QUESTION:  Would it not automatically follow the


second would be inadmissible?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  No.  Then -- then the situation,

Justice Stevens, is you would look to a taint analysis to


see whether other additional factors cured the initial


compulsion and made the second statement voluntary.


QUESTION:  Mr. Gornstein --


MR. GORNSTEIN:  But what -- what I -- I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  No.  Please finish your answer. 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  I -- I just wanted to get this


one -- one thing answered which is that when you are


looking at the second statement and admitting it, you --


it is a statement that has been preceded by Miranda


warnings.  There is an express waiver of Miranda rights.


There's a finding of voluntariness of the first, a finding


of voluntariness of the second, and as to that statement


at that point, there simply is not an unacceptable risk


that that statement has been compelled.


And on the other hand, there is a serious cost


to the administration of justice when you exclude from the


jury's consideration what -- a statement that is warned


and voluntary and very highly probative evidence of the


defendant's guilt.


QUESTION:  Mr. Gornstein, you in -- in the


answer you just finished giving and I think throughout


your argument, you were making -- I think you were making


the assumption that there are two inquiries that should be


made in the situation that you envision.  One is the

voluntariness of the first statement, the unwarned


statement.  Second is the voluntariness of the second


statement, following the warnings.  Do you agree that


there is a third inquiry and that is the voluntariness of


the waiver?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Okay. 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  There has to be an inquiry into


the -- there has to be a knowing and intelligent waiver. 


That is for sure.  And if the officer does anything to


pressure the suspect, as the Court said in Elstad, to


force a waiver, then that would invalidate the subsequent


statement. 


QUESTION:  And -- and don't you think that the


-- the situation presented by this kind of case -- for


purposes of -- of judging the voluntariness of the waiver,


don't you think that the situation presented by this kind


of case is significantly different from the situation


presented by Elstad?  Because Elstad did not involve a


systematic interrogation.  This did.  Isn't it fairly true


to say as a general rule that following a systematic


interrogation, there is less likelihood of a truly


voluntary waiver of the right to silence than in the


Elstad situation?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well, I -- I think what is fair

to say is if it has crossed over into compulsion, yes. 


But if all there is is a risk of compulsion and -- and


that's what makes the first statement inadmissible, then


whether or not there's a greater risk in the second


situation of compulsion than the first --


QUESTION:  I'm trying to keep it simpler.  I --


I grant you that if there was compulsion, the risk is


greater.  I'm -- I'm suggesting that without having to get


into the question and making a final determination of


whether we're going to label the first statement a subject


of compulsion or not, isn't the very fact that there has


been a systematic interrogation in a case like this a fact


that makes it less likely, not more likely, that the --


that the Miranda waiver, when it comes, will not be a


voluntary waiver? 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  The longer the interrogation,


that makes it relevant to the inquiry.  But once Miranda


warnings have been given, that is sufficient to cure any


risk of compulsion no matter how high.


QUESTION:  It's -- it's -- but that's -- you're


-- you're getting to question three again.  I'm talking


about question two --


MR. GORNSTEIN:  I'm sorry.  Then I think that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY M. BARTHOLOW


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,


and may it please the Court:


I'd like to get directly to what Justice Souter


just mentioned, that when there's a systematic


interrogation, things are different. 


QUESTION:  What do you mean by a systematic


interrogation? 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Well, I think what Elstad said


and why this situation is so much different from Elstad is


that it cited cases where there had been a systematic


interrogation where there was a deliberate elicitation of


questions --


QUESTION: 

I -- I realize there may be cases,


but how about you defining what you mean by a systematic


interrogation?

 MS. BARTHOLOW:  When police officers


deliberately elicit incriminating statements from a


suspect, then --


QUESTION:  In other -- it -- it doesn't have to


go over any period of time?


MS. BARTHOLOW:  I don't believe -- I don't


believe time is the critical factor.


QUESTION:  Isn't that the whole point of


interrogation, is to elicit statements? 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Not in all circumstances, and I


-- I think sometimes, especially what the Missouri Supreme


Court said there's a risk to this practice.  For instance,


when officers engage in this practice to locate physical


evidence, that wouldn't necessarily be a problem for the


Missouri Supreme Court. 


But in Elstad, this Court cited, for instance,


United States v. Pierce out of the Fourth Circuit and for


the proposition that the more in the without more test of


Elstad -- the more would be a thorough custodial


interrogation at the station house.  That would provide


more, where there's a simple failure to administer


warnings without more --


QUESTION:  And -- and why should that be?  It


seems to me that perhaps underlying your position is that


you want us to say that there's simply more likelihood

that there's going to be a statement after the Miranda


warning if there's been a -- for your -- to use your term,


a systematic interrogation before.  I'm -- I'm not sure


that we have the empirical data to say that the defendant


would be more likely to talk after he's been questioned


and the Miranda warning comes late.


Is that what is behind your -- your argument? 


And if so, is -- is that something on which we can act? 


Suppose that he is more likely to give a statement after


there's been a systematic interrogation.  So what, if it's


not coerced? 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Well, Your Honor, the -- in


Elstad, this Court cited Westover which the cardinal fact


of Westover, as you said in Mosley, was that the failure


of police officers to give any warnings whatsoever to the


person in custody before embarking on an intense and


prolonged interrogation of him would result in coercion.


QUESTION:  So -- so what we're -- so what we're


concerned about is the fact of coercion.  Nothing --


nothing more? 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  I think in this case you have


coercion, but I think --


QUESTION:  Let's talk about the -- as a general


rule.


MS. BARTHOLOW:  No.

 QUESTION:  So all we're talking about is the


risk of coercion, or are we talking about preserving the

cetera? 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  All of those.  I think you're


concerned about the risk of coercion. 


QUESTION:  Well, but I thought Miranda was only


concerned with coercion.


MS. BARTHOLOW:  No.  The -- Miranda was --


QUESTION:  As an end -- as an end result. 


Obviously, it's a prophylactic rule. 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Miranda was certainly concerned


about the risk of compelling statements being -- and also


being admitted at trial.  That was a main concern of


Miranda.


But I -- I think what we're talking about here


is whether the waiver was voluntary and whether the second


statement was voluntary and the risk of subjecting a


suspect to lengthy, intense custodial interrogation.  We


cannot presume that the waiver and subsequent statement


was --


QUESTION:  But -- but can you tell me why that


is?  Is he afraid that he'll be beaten -- or she in this


case -- or has the will be broken down so that the


decision is a little more clouded and -- and it would have

been clearer to the person if the warning had been given


at the outset?  These are -- these are matters of


psychology that Elstad told us that we really should not


be speculating about. 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Well, Miranda -- and in


Dickerson it cited this portion of Miranda where it said


custodial interrogations by their very nature generate


compelling pressures which work to undermine the


individual's will to resist and compel him to speak when


he wouldn't otherwise do so freely. 


QUESTION:  The question I think -- or at least


mine is that if you're talking psychology, the policeman


who knows from nothing, never heard of Miranda,


accidentally says, did you commit the fire?  Yes.  Okay? 


That statement doesn't come in.  And then later on he asks


it again after the right warning.  That's case one.


Case two.  The policeman, knowing everything


about Miranda, thinks to himself, ha, ha, ha, I've got a


great trick here.  Did you commit the crime, the fire? 


Yes.  And then later on he asks him the question again


after warnings. 


In terms of the psychology of the defendant


answering the second time, whether that policeman was a


fool or a knave seems beside the point.  And so if your --


if -- if your whole argument is one of psychology, I don't

get it.  Now, that's -- maybe there's more to your


argument than just the psychology of the -- the criminal


or the defendant -- the criminal defendant the second


time.  And if so, I want you to respond to that. 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Well, Your Honor, I think we're


worried about suspects being coerced and compelled into


giving statements that aren't according to their free


will.  We're --


QUESTION:  Which statements are you talking


about?  The first or the second?


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Both.


QUESTION:  Both, okay.  How does the first work?


MS. BARTHOLOW:  I'm not sure I understand the


question, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  If in fact you're worried about


policemen subtly coercing the first statement, why do you


have to stop admission of the second statement? 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Well, the first statement is


automatically excluded pursuant to Miranda.  The reason


why we need to exclude the second statement as well is


because by using the first statement, by referring back to


the first statement, also by pressuring the waiver to get


the second statement, it's not as clear as it would


normally be that the second statement is voluntary after


the suspect has been subjected to the lengthy

interrogation before. 


I mean, police officers wouldn't roll the dice


if they knew it didn't work.  This officer had used this


tactic for 8 to 10 years because he knows it works.


QUESTION:  Work to do what?  To coerce or to


persuade or something else?  That's -- that's what I'm


trying to get from you.


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Well, it undermines the free


will.  It's -- it -- the tactic is used to prevent the


exercise of free will.  Had she been given the warnings at


the outset, she may well have invoked or asked for an


attorney when pressure was too intense on her.  What we're


leaving --


QUESTION:  Well, could you argue that once you


know what questioning is like for, say, an hour and then


you get the warning, you have a better idea of whether you


want to go through with this or not?  Again, these are


empirical things that I'm -- I'm not sure we're qualified


to judge.  Maybe -- maybe we must. 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  I think, Your Honor, once --


once she had been subjected to the lengthy interrogation


and they got that statement from her that they had


pressured out of her, then when she -- they said, you


know, for -- for instance, they would have an incentive to


say, okay, now what you just told us we're going to put on

tape and I will be back here with a tape recorder and we


will put it on tape.  This is what a judge and a jury is


going to hear.


QUESTION:  It's true if -- if we accept that --


that the first statement was pressured out of her.  I


mean, I assume -- I assume that what we're proceeding on


here is the belief that it was not coercion in the first


instance.  I think everybody agrees if it was coerced in


the first instance, the case is over.  Is that what you


mean by pressured out of her, or -- or the mere -- the


mere failure to give Miranda warning constitutes pressure?


MS. BARTHOLOW:  I don't think the mere failure


to administer the warning may create the pressure, but


it's when the officer embarks upon the -- the specific


questioning and interrogation to get -- deliberately


elicit an incriminating response, then you have this type


of coercive environment or coercive manner of questioning


that Elstad was concerned with.  And I think that's why


Elstad's opinion cited Pierce and Westover for the types


of questioning that would necessarily or -- or run the


great risk of coercing the defendant into confessing. 


QUESTION:  Well, and -- and if it did coerce,


then -- then Elstad said its rule would not apply.  Wasn't


Elstad only saying that when this exists, there may be


possible a finding of actual coercion, but it's -- it's

not assuming that there is actual coercion whenever that


exists or -- or making a total exception from the rule


that it laid down for situations in which there was what


you call -- what -- what do you call it?  Orderly


interrogation or programmed interrogation?


MS. BARTHOLOW:  I'm just looking at the language


of Elstad and when it said it's an unwarranted extension


of Miranda, it was saying just the simple failure to


administer the warnings unaccompanied by the actual


coercive tactics or the manner of questioning when that is


coercive or if -- if the environment that it's being done


in is coercive, such as the, you know, station house, then


-- then there would be no presumption, then the second


statement wouldn't be compelled.  But when you have those


factors, when there's the great risk that it's being --


that the statement is being made under the threat of


coercion or pressure or where the environment is -- is


coercive, then you do have the presumption.


QUESTION:  Well, when it speaks of coercive


environment or coercive tactics, I -- I assumed that what


it meant is that the prior confession was coerced.


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Well, Your Honor, I -- I believe


that under Miranda when the Court said that the custodial


-- custodial interrogation exerts inherently coercive


pressure, I think that means when they question and

deliberately elicit an incriminating response that is


compelling, and --


QUESTION:  Well then, why have we allowed


admission of so many statements, you know, impeachment,


public -- public interest, that sort of thing, that result


from a situation where there weren't Miranda warnings


given if -- if simply station house interrogation always


produces coercion? 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Because there, Your Honor, I


think that the Court was balancing the interest of law


enforcement against the interest of allowing a suspect to


get on the stand and later lie at trial.  It affected the


truth-seeking function of the trial, which is greatly


impacted here because here --


QUESTION:  We -- we would not balance if there


were actual coercion.  I mean, once you find actual


coercion, the game is over.  You don't bend the law into


balance.


MS. BARTHOLOW:  In -- in terms of whether you're


going to admit the second statement, in the presence of


the potential for coercion or actual coercion, then the


burden needs to shift to the State.  When they've employed


these tactics that generate the risk of compulsion, they


need to show that that risk never manifested itself.


QUESTION:  But you're -- you -- you -- in what

you just said, you say, you know, potential for -- for


coercion, coercion.  Those are different things. 


Coercion, in -- in the sense we've used it in the Fifth


Amendment cases, means that the confession is involuntary,


and as Justice Scalia says, there's -- there's no


balancing there.  But you're using it in a different


sense, aren't you? 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  I'm saying that if in this


context where it was actually coerced, then no, her


statement would not have been admissible to impeach her at


-- at all if she had been -- testified at trial.


QUESTION:  But -- but no lower court has found


that the statement was actually coerced or that the


confession -- the statement was involuntary because of


tactics of the government. 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Well, I believe the Missouri


Supreme Court found that only in circumstances other than


these would that first statement have been found


voluntary.  That's the language of the opinion.  They also


found the waiver involuntary in citing the Westover-type


analysis.  The two cases that they relied on --


QUESTION:  Well, I thought what the court did


was make its decision on the basis that the Miranda


warning was intentionally not given and that that was the


reason that the supreme court found that the statement

could not be admitted.  It -- it didn't turn on actual


coercion, did it?  What did the trial court find on that?


MS. BARTHOLOW:  The --


QUESTION:  No actual coercion. 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  The trial court didn't make any


specific fact-findings about voluntariness.  The -- all it


was concerned was -- with that Miranda wasn't given.


QUESTION:  Wasn't given, and the reason that the


supreme court felt that it had to be suppressed was


because the decision not to give Miranda was an


intentional decision by the officer.


MS. BARTHOLOW:  I believe that was part of the


analysis, but the reason they found the waiver involuntary


was because of the continuous nature of the interrogation,


and it cited the Westover-type cases for that.


QUESTION:  What about -- suppose our reason --


QUESTION:  We took the -- we took the case to


answer the question of whether or not Oregon v. Elstad is


-- is abrogated when the initial failure to give the


Miranda warnings was intentional.  I mean, we -- that's --


that's what we're here to decide.


MS. BARTHOLOW:  And I think, Your Honor, when a


police officer deliberately embarks upon a tactic to


undermine the free will of a suspect in a coercive setting


that Miranda acknowledges is a coercive setting, that that

does make a difference because it -- it impels the police


officer into using tactics that otherwise wouldn't be


permissible, such as referring to the unwarned statement


to get a waiver --


QUESTION:  Well, I would have thought you'd look


at what happened in the second discussion after Miranda


warnings were given to determine whether it was voluntary


-- a voluntary statement or not.  Was there a knowing and


voluntary waiver of those rights given at the second


statement?  Isn't that the proper inquiry?


MS. BARTHOLOW:  I believe it is, Your Honor. 


I 

-- and that's why I -- I went back to the Missouri Supreme


Court's opinion where they found that the waiver was


involuntary based on the totality of the circumstances in


the interrogation, that the --


QUESTION:  But -- but the question presented is


based on Oregon v. Elstad.  It quotes it.  Is the rule


that a suspect who has once responded to an unwarned yet


uncoercive questioning is not thereby disabled from


waiving his rights?  I mean, that's -- that's what we're


here to decide. 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Well, Your Honor, maybe the


premise of the question presented was incorrect that there


was no --

brief in opposition make the point that you thought that


it was -- it was coerced?


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Yes, Your Honor, we did.  We


cited Westover. 


QUESTION:  You're talking about the second one


now.  Sorry.  Is what you -- were you finished?  Go ahead. 


Finish it. 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Well, I don't want to --


QUESTION:  Finish the Chief Justice's --


MS. BARTHOLOW:  I don't want to leave any doubt


that I -- that the first statement we are asserting in the


first instance was actually coerced.  I mean, we disagree


that --


QUESTION:  Well, as I -- may I interrupt you and


ask you to -- whether this distinction captures your case? 


I -- I have understood you to be saying that the -- the


first statement was -- was coercive in the sense that


Miranda spoke of a custodial interrogation as being


inherently coercive.  It was not, on the other hand,


coerced in the sense that it was the product of beating


him over the head with a 2 by 4.  And as I understand it,


you have been saying, look, any unwarned Miranda -­


unwarned statement that is given in custody shares the --


the character that Miranda said it had, inherently


coercive atmosphere.  But that doesn't mean the same thing

as -- as coercion carried to the point of hitting him over


the head.  Is that the distinction that -- that underlies


your argument, or am I putting words in your mouth?


MS. BARTHOLOW:  I don't believe that what the


police officers did here would have rise -- rose to the


level of Fourth Amendment due process involuntariness, no.


But I do believe it violated the Fifth Amendment bar on


coerced, compelled testimony. 


QUESTION:  To go to the question that I think


was presented, let's make my assumptions and let me


overstate a little bit. 


My first assumption is it's intolerable to have


policemen going around purposely -- purposely -- violating


the Miranda rule.  Now, assume that conclusion, though I


know it's arguable. 


Now, if that happens, if they deliberately and


purposely have not given these warnings when they knew


they should, that would create a situation where they


might do it a lot and we'd have a lot of coerced


confessions we couldn't ever prove.  Okay?  So I consider


that -- let's call it bad. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  All right.  Now, if -- if we make


that assumption, then the question is, well, can the


police, nonetheless, introduce a second statement that was

done after warnings?  Now, there are three possible


positions:  always, never, and sometimes. 


So I'm exploring the sometimes.  Now, I want to


know if -- what kind of a rule might you think was okay on


the sometimes.


Now, one thing I thought of is if they can show


-- not you, but the prosecutor can show that that first


statement taken was not coerced and that, second, they


really gave the warnings the second time, and that, third,


something happened to cut that causal connection because


the average person would think, of course, I've got to say


what I said before, otherwise they're going to do


something really terrible to me.  All right?  So -- so


what -- now, I'm looking for passage of time, I'm looking


for something else to cut the causal connection.


But I'm looking really for your view on this. 


If the answer is sometimes, if the answer is never, but if


it is sometimes, what kind of a sometimes? 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  I believe that sometimes the


second statement may be admitted, and that's what Elstad


said.  Even in the presence of actual coercion, they said


that it could be dispelled.  And --


QUESTION:  Okay.  Sometimes you say it could. 


Now, what kinds of things would dispel it and what isn't


dispelled about your case?

 MS. BARTHOLOW:  I think if there was a passage


of time, it would dispel it, and that certainly didn't


occur here.  Even in Westover, there was a 15- to 20-


minute break by the time the police stopped questioning


and the FBI started questioning, and that came out at oral


argument.  Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall said there


was a break.  So there was no break here. 


QUESTION:  Is that enough?  If -- if there's an


interval, same place, same officers, but it -- is


everything -- everything turn on how much time there is in


between the two?


MS. BARTHOLOW:  I'm not sure it could entirely


turn on that, but for instance, if questioning had


occurred the next day, I believe that would be a -- a


sufficient break.  And I think the Missouri Supreme Court


cited another of our State cases, State v. Wright, where


this exact thing happened, questioning occurred and then a


day passed, and then questioning occurred again, and that


was sufficient to break the causal link. 


I think if officers embarking on this type of


calculated, unwarned questioning then add to their


warnings, when they finally give them, that what you said


can't be used against you, if they would have added that,


that might have helped an attenuation analysis.  But I


think clearly none of that occurred here.

 I think the -- another problem with this case


and this type of tactic is that it affects the truth-


seeking function of the trial, the jury, and what it's


finding because the first thing the jury hears is when the


tape is played and they hear immediately a waiver of


rights and --


QUESTION:  Let -- let me interrupt you for just


a minute, Ms. -- is -- is it agreed that the break here


was 20 minutes?  That's what the Supreme Court of Missouri


majority opinion says.


MS. BARTHOLOW:  I believe it was 15 to 20


minutes.  20 minutes, if according to the court, yes.


QUESTION:  Thank you. 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Going back to the truth-seeking


function of the jury, when the jury is listening to the


statement, they are presuming that she immediately waived


her rights.  They know nothing of what occurred before,


and the only way that we can challenge that and show that


maybe this confession shouldn't be given the weight that


it -- it otherwise would have is that she underwent this


lengthy interrogation.  And the only way we can bring that


for the -- before the jury is to show them that she, in


fact, made an unwarned statement.  And that -- it


precludes our ability to defend her by not being able to


show under what circumstances she ultimately made that

waiver. 


It also allows the -- the unwarned statement to


come in because on that tape recording you have the


officer mentioning that she made an unwarned statement,


and the jury is never supposed to hear that.  So here you


have the jury thinking, well, she made two statements.  It


must be the truth. 


QUESTION:  Well, it's not a complete answer to


your argument.  Of course, you can have an initial


suppression motion before the court.  I -- I see the --


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Right.  I mean, and when that's


denied we are still able to show the circumstances under


which the confession was made are relevant to the weight


to be given to it.  I mean, the jury can always weigh the


credibility of the suspect and -- in assessing the weight


to be given to her confession.  And we cannot challenge


that here without referring to the unwarned questioning. 


If there's no --


QUESTION:  Of course, your argument would still


be the same if this was all coercive, and to the extent


the statements are repetitive, it's just cumulative.  I --


I do see your point. 


Let me -- let me ask you this.  In response to

said, well, why won't police do this all the time and why


would they have the incentive to make this standard


procedure?  And the answer I thought was that if you're


going to waive your rights, you're going to waive your


rights, so it doesn't make any difference.  But that seems


to me to actually help your side.


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Yes, Your Honor.  And -- and I


guarantee you that if this Court says that this practice


is okay, it will become embedded in police procedure just


like Miranda has been because the police --


QUESTION:  If -- if the answer is if they're


going to waive, they're going to waive, then there's no


reason why not they don't give the warning at the outset.


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Exactly.  I mean, they have more


incentive not to warn, especially because they talked to


her before on two occasions.  They -- and I think they


tape recorded her interview with them on the -- February


14th, hoping that she would make some sort of


incriminating statement, and when she didn't, then they


engaged in this practice to subject her to the intense


custodial interrogation to try and get the -- the warning


from her.  But they weren't -- I mean -- excuse me -- the


confession from her.  But they weren't going to warn her


because they were afraid she might invoke.  And I think


this Court in Escobedo said, you know, we shouldn't fear

that a suspect is going to assert her rights if she knew


about them.


QUESTION:  Escobedo was pretty much overruled by


Miranda, wasn't it?


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Yes, Your Honor, but I think the


-- that specific principle would remain and that this


Court would agree with that we should not have to fear


that a suspect will invoke their rights.  I mean, that was


the whole premise of Miranda is that they have to be made


aware of their rights so that they have the free will to


invoke them if -- if they are not willing to be subjected


to the intense pressure of the custodial interrogation.


QUESTION:  Ms. Bartholow, you -- you've asserted


that the question presented is not -- is not really


accurate, that -- that the Missouri court, in fact, had


found that given the totality of the circumstances, one of


which was the intentional failure to give Miranda


warnings, the second statement was -- was coerced.  And I


find that in fact that your brief in opposition did make


that point. 


Now, if -- if the question presented as set


forth in the petitioner's brief is not accurate, what do


you think would be accurate?  Would -- do you think it


presents the question at least of whether the intentional


failure to give a Miranda warning is one of the factors

properly considered in determining whether the second


confession is voluntary or not?  It at least presents that


question, doesn't it?


MS. BARTHOLOW:  I think it presents that


question.  I don't -- I don't think the Court should


proceed on the assumption that the initial statement was


voluntary, and that is -- that's always been our first


line of defense, is that this wasn't a voluntary statement


because under Elstad -- under Elstad the Court said that


when a suspect is being subjected to a coercive


environment or where the manner of the questioning in the


case is coercive, then the standard Elstad rule doesn't


apply.


And -- and especially because when Justice


Brennan tried to posit this two-step interrogation that it


would become all the rage and specifically -- I mean, the


description of Justice Brennan's two-step interrogation


mirrors this -- this exactly.  This Court said that's


apocalyptic.  We are not encouraging that.  We do not want


police officers or prosecutors to -- to use that tactic. 


And -- and unfortunately, I believe law enforcement took


the invitation of Justice Brennan's dissent perhaps and


didn't listen to what you said in the majority opinion. 


I think this tactic is bad for the police.  It


is bad for suspects, and it is bad for courts.  It's got

three strikes against it.  And the test that we would ask


you to apply is that when police officers deliberately


withhold Miranda in order to elicit an incriminating


response when they knew or should have known that Miranda


was required, then the second statement will be presumed


compelled unless and until the State can show that it has


been attenuated from the first. 


And if there --


QUESTION:  Why does the intentionality or not of


the failure to give the Miranda warning have anything to


do with whether the second confession is voluntary or not? 


I mean, I can understand why it's -- it's a nasty thing


and you don't want the -- you don't want the State to do


an end run around Miranda, as you understand Miranda, but


why does it have anything whatever to do with the coercive


-- with the coerced or non-coerced nature of the second


confession?  The -- the woman would feel just as coerced


whether the failure to give it was -- was intentional or


non-intentional it seems to me. 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  I -- I think the subjective


intent of the officers will inform what the officers feel


they are allowed to do during the questioning session. 


The -- the FBI itself required warnings long before


Miranda and it was because it made the -- the


interrogators respect the person's rights, and that's why

the warnings were required.  If the officer intends to


disrespect those rights and leave the Fifth Amendment


unprotected, then I think there's a grave danger that they


will use tactics that they used here, that they will refer


to the unwarned statement to pressure the waiver, that


they will refer to the unwarned statement to get the


second statement, and that there will never be an exercise


of the suspect's free will.


QUESTION:  Well, but Justice Scalia's question,


if you have the officer in good faith makes a mistake,


what difference does it make to the defendant? 


MS. BARTHOLOW:  Well, I think in the absence --


well, when there's a good faith mistake, I don't think


you're going to run into the types of coercive pressures


that were applied, and that's what Elstad was.  You had


one or two questions at the suspect's house.  You know,


we're here to talk about a burglary.  Do you know these


people?  Yes.  Well, we think you were involved in that. 


Yes, I was there.  Period.  You know.


There was a question whether there was custody


or not.  I don't think this Court would have found custody


in the first instance.  And there was a real question


about whether that constituted an interrogation at all. 


And I think in those circumstances -- or -- or if an


officer just didn't know that they hadn't been Mirandized

by the first officer or something, when there's clearly a


good faith error on the part of the police, then this test


would not be required.


Thank you.

Ms. Mitchell, you have 4 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KAREN K. MITCHELL


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. MITCHELL:  Thank you, Your Honor. 


On the issue of systematic interrogation that


came up several times during the argument, that is


relevant only if it rises to the level of making that


first statement actually involuntary.  And I think that's


clear from the Elstad opinion itself.  At one point during


the Elstad opinion, specifically in footnote 2 of the


majority opinion, the Court is talking about lower court


decisions where the -- the lower court did not apply the


attenuation-type doctrine.  And referring to some of those


cases as involving, quote, clearly voluntary, unwarned


admissions, the Court then goes on and cites a number of


cases that involve actual station house interrogations, in


many cases much longer than the interrogation we have


here.  Specifically, I'd point the Court to the Derrico


decision cited in Elstad.


So just the idea that you have a traditional

station house-type interrogation is not enough.  The


question is, does it render the first statement


involuntary and therefore capable of tainting the second


statement? 


In this case the question of voluntariness of


each statement was raised in the initial motion to


suppress, and even though there were not extensive


findings by the trial court, they denied those motions to


suppress.  And that issue was not raised again in either


of the appellate courts in Missouri, and the Missouri


Supreme Court did not reach that issue.


On the question of what the Missouri Supreme


Court held, three points I think are very important.  The


court starts out by phrasing or -- or characterizing its


decision as such.  Essential to the inquiry is whether the


presumption that the first statement was involuntary


carries over to the second statement.  The court then goes


on and throughout the opinion makes the decision to, in


fact, carry that presumption forward.  It focuses on


intent and finds intent to be an improper tactic, as this


Court used that phrase in Elstad, which is the predicate


then for applying a fruits-type analysis and requiring


attenuation, which is exactly what the Missouri Supreme


Court does.  And that is why we sought cert in this case.


As to this -- the -- the apocalyptic issue and

Justice Brennan's discussion in Elstad, Justice Brennan


talked about a number of situations, including the


application of Miranda to the Fourth Amendment, including


the use of statements by police officers to garner a


waiver which did not happen here, and other things that


are simply inapplicable.  This case is not that situation.


Finally, what we are asking this Court to do is


to reverse the Missouri court decision that focused on


intent, deterrence, and the carrying forward of the


presumption to taint the subsequent statement because each


of those findings are inconsistent with this Court's


holding in Elstad, and instead to apply the framework of


Elstad to this case and to reverse.


If there are no further questions. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Ms.


Mitchell.


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
