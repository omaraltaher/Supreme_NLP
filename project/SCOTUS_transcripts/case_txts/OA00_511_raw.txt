ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. BARR


            9            

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 00-511


           10              

MR. BARR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


           11    

the Court:


           12              

I'd like to start with a brief illustration that


           13    

I think will help crystalize the legal issues, both the


           14    

so-called forward-looking issues and the historical cost


           15    

issues.  The illustration itself starts with a forward-


           16    

looking perspective. 


           17              

Now, any firm that operates and builds a network


           18    

incurs three costs going forward.  Let's say I, the


           19    

hypothetical new entrant capable of coming in today and


           20    

instantaneously deploying the most efficient network


           21    

possible today, I would have to expend my baseline


           22    

facility costs.  And let's say the FCC is right.  Let's


           23    

say that costs about $180 billion to reproduce the system


           24    

today from scratch.  Then I would face my operating costs


           25    

that are dictated by the network that I just built.  Let's

            1    

say those are $75 billion a year.  And then I would face


            2    

the incremental capital investment that I would make each


            3    

year to upgrade and expand the network.  Let's say that's


            4    

$30 billion a year. 


            5              

Now, let me show why under TELRIC no firm that


            6    

actually makes expenditures can recover them.


            7              

QUESTION:  What -- what was your second cost,


            8    

the 75? 


            9              

MR. BARR:  The 75 is operating costs dictated by


           10    

the network that I've deployed. 


           11              

QUESTION:  Per year? 


           12              

MR. BARR:  Per year, which is how much our


           13    

operating costs are per year.


           14              

QUESTION:  And the first was -- was the --


           15    

the --


           16              

MR. BARR:  Building the network from scratch.


           17              

QUESTION:  Just -- not the -- not the debt --


           18    

debt service on building it?


           19              

MR. BARR:  No.


           20              

QUESTION:  But the building it.


           21              

MR. BARR:  Yes. 


           22              

QUESTION:  That's a -- that's a one-time cost.


           23              

MR. BARR:  Yes. 


           24              

QUESTION:  Not an annual.


           25              

MR. BARR:  That's the sunk capital cost.

QUESTION:  But you're using the depreciated


            2    

figure, the 180 --


            3              

MR. BARR:  No.  I'm starting -- I'm starting --


            4    

yes.  That's the -- that's the initial construction.  I'm


            5    

-- I'm not talking about me as the incumbent.  I'm talking


            6    

about someone new coming in today. 


            7              

QUESTION:  You -- you presented three questions. 


            8    

Is -- is your illustration and what you're about to


            9    

discuss devoted to all three questions or to one in


           10    

particular? 


           11              

MR. BARR:  I'm going to show -- it's devoted to


           12    

all three, and I'm going to show how TELRIC does not,


           13    

going forward, permit the recovery because it bases


           14    

compensation, for someone who has already expended money


           15    

on the network, on the imaginary cost structure of a


           16    

hypothetical entrant who can be unconstrained and who's


           17    

capable, at any given time, of instantaneously deploying


           18    

and ubiquitously deploying a brand new network that's the


           19    

most efficient at that point.


           20              

Now, if you look at my $180 billion that I've


           21    

just spent on building this network, in the world of


           22    

TELRIC, I now face the prospect of people springing up on


           23    

a daily basis who are capable of taking advantage of any


           24    

new technology and any change in demographics and


           25    

configuration to beat the efficiency of my network.  And

            1    

my -- and -- and with that hypothesis, I won't be able to


            2    

recover my costs unless I have a high rate of return and


            3    

fast depreciation. 


            4              

QUESTION:  But we've said in -- in a number of


            5    

cases, going back 50 years, that if you're talking about


            6    

an unreasonable rate of return or a taking or something


            7    

that has constitutional implications, you -- you can't


            8    

attack the method because different methods can work out


            9    

differently.  You have to point to some unjust final


           10    

result.  And there hasn't been any final result here. 


           11              

MR. BARR:  Well -- well, Your Honor, I think


           12    

that what the Court has done is made distinctions between


           13    

ends and means.  Now, there can't be discretion under the


           14    

Constitution as to how much is due.  That can't be


           15    

discretionary or else there's -- that eviscerates the Just


           16    

Compensation Clause. 


           17              

What -- our view is that when you have a regime


           18    

of compelled service, where the Government says, you got


           19    

to spend the money to provide a mandated service, the


           20    

taking occurs at the point of expenditure.  And that means


           21    

the Government has to give me a chance to get that -- a


           22    

fair opportunity to get that money back. 


           23              

Now, what the Government has discretion over is


           24    

the means as to get me that money back. 


           25              

QUESTION:  They're probably going to be set by

            1    

State commissions, are they not? 


            2              

MR. BARR:  Excuse me, Your Honor?


            3              

QUESTION:  Aren't -- aren't these costs and fees


            4    

going to be ultimately set by State commissions applying


            5    

the FCC rules?


            6              

MR. BARR:  The rates themselves will be set by


            7    

-- by the State commissions, implementing a methodology,


            8    

and we are complaining about the methodology because --


            9              

QUESTION:  Well, but that's just what the cases


           10    

say you can't do, it seems to me, going back to the


           11    

Stone's opinion 50 years ago, the opinion of the Court in


           12    

Duquesne, that you can't attack the methodology unless you


           13    

can point to something wrong in the actual fee that you're


           14    

allowed or the rate that you're allowed.


           15              

MR. BARR:  Well, Your Honor, I think that the


           16    

Court has always reviewed methodologies.  Now, sometimes


           17    

rates can be evidence of a defect in a methodology, but it


           18    

doesn't have to be.  And in the Duquesne itself, the Court


           19    

said if the methodology is not compensating you for a


           20    

methodological risk to which you are exposed, that's a


           21    

problem today, and that is our claim, that the methodology


           22    

itself exposes us to a risk of not recovering what we


           23    

spend.  And -- and we are entitled to compensation for


           24    

that risk. 


           25              

If the taking --

            1              

QUESTION:  Excuse me.  Just a risk?  It's -- I


            2    

mean, but there's always a risk, I suppose, until you get


            3    

the final determination by whoever the ratemaker is.  I


            4    

thought our prior cases held that so long as -- so long as


            5    

it's possible under the -- under the rate structure for


            6    

you to be compensated fully, you have no complaint until


            7    

-- you know, until the final -- the final rate is


            8    

determined.  At that point, you can come in and complain,


            9    

but the mere possibility that they may pick the wrong rate


           10    

surely is not enough to give you a takings claim. 


           11              

MR. BARR:  Well, if -- if we are correct that we


           12    

are entitled to a fair opportunity to recover our costs


           13    

and the Government decides that they're going to spin a


           14    

roulette wheel, I can't come in and say that's a problem? 


           15    

That exposes me to risk? 


           16              

The reason we have -- why do we have


           17    

methodologies set in the first place instead of later --


           18    

instead of later proceedings?  We have them to set up


           19    

front a promise to pay that sets investor expectations and


           20    

ensures that the users, not the Government, is going to


           21    

end up footing the bill.  That's why we have ratemaking. 


           22    

And this Court has always reviewed methodologies to


           23    

determine whether or not they comport with the


           24    

constitutional standard and whatever Congress has directed


           25    

in the statute.

            1              

Now, it's very important that we focus on the


            2    

difference between the ends and the means.  What is it --


            3    

what do you mean when you say, well, the Government has


            4    

discretion over methodology?  It can't mean that they have


            5    

discretion as to how much is ultimately due.  That takes


            6    

the Court out of the business and just eviscerates the


            7    

Just Compensation Clause. 


            8              

What it means is that once it's determined that


            9    

I have an -- I should get an opportunity to get my costs


           10    

back, the Government can expose me to risks.  The


           11    

Government doesn't have to guarantee it and sign me a


           12    

check.  They can measure my recovery with some other


           13    

formula, as you pointed out in your concurrence opinion in


           14    

Duquesne, Justice Scalia.  They can formulate the


           15    

methodology in -- in another way.  But when you formulate


           16    

it in another way, when you untether recovery from


           17    

historical costs or my expenditure, that creates a risk. 


           18    

Now, sometimes it may create an opportunity in an -- in an


           19    

age of inflation.  In an age of deflation, it may cause a


           20    

risk.


           21              

QUESTION:  But numerous cases have said that the


           22    

ratemaking agency is not required to follow -- to adopt


           23    

historical costs as the method of fixing rates. 


           24              

MR. BARR:  That's the method, but the objective


           25    

has to be an opportunity of getting me back my costs.

What -- when -- when I am required to spend


            2    

money by the Government -- when I'm required to spend


            3    

money by the Government -- let's say it would cost the


            4    

Government a billion dollars today to provide a public


            5    

good and service.  And the Government, instead of spending


            6    

that today, which anyone would have to spend, comes to me


            7    

and conscripts my private capital into building this thing


            8    

for a billion dollars, and then later says, well, I don't


            9    

have to worry about getting you back a billion dollars. 


           10    

That's not my business.  I have discretion over a


           11    

methodology. 


           12              

The question -- what is meant by discretion on a


           13    

methodology is that the Government can expose you to risk


           14    

as long as it compensates you for the risk.  And that's


           15    

exactly what Duquesne said. 


           16              

QUESTION:  Now, you say this case is different


           17    

from previous rate cases.  In the previous rate cases, the


           18    

expenditure has been made and the question is fair


           19    

compensation, just compensation.  You say here you're


           20    

being asked to expend an additional out-of-pocket sum, and


           21    

you're entitled to know what the methodology is at the


           22    

outset.  Is that --


           23              

MR. BARR:  No.  I'm saying that all the --


           24              

QUESTION:  Is that your point? 


           25              

MR. BARR:  No.  My -- my point is that all

methodologies are the Government's promise to pay at the


            2    

time it takes the property.  The Government takes a


            3    

property in a forced -- in -- in a regime of compelled


            4    

service, the taking occurs when I spend the money.  If I


            5    

have $1,000 --


            6              

QUESTION:  But that's true in any ratemaking


            7    

case. 


            8              

MR. BARR:  Right. 


            9              

QUESTION:  And -- and the Chief Justice and


           10    

Justice Scalia are saying our cases say we have to wait to


           11    

see what the rate is.  I thought your position was, well,


           12    

this is different because we have an initial outlay that


           13    

we're required to make now.  I'm not trying to -- maybe I


           14    

misunderstand your argument. 


           15              

MR. BARR:  Well, no, that's right.  The reason


           16    

we have methodologies and the reason I'm entitled to know


           17    

that I have a fair opportunity to recover it is that I


           18    

shouldn't be forced to spend money, to lay out money


           19    

unless have a fair opportunity to get it back. 


           20              

QUESTION:  No.  But your whole argument is


           21    

assuming that by adopting this particular methodology, it


           22    

is some kind of a necessary conclusion that at the end of


           23    

the day, you're going to be getting less of a return than


           24    

you would have gotten if an historic cost methodology had


           25    

-- had been employed.  And that simply is not true.  We

don't know whether that is so or not. 


            2              

MR. BARR:  Well, actually, you know, we do know


            3    

whether it's so.  I was just about to explain on the


            4    

forward-looking basis.  But -- but --


            5              

QUESTION:  Then -- then why haven't you come in


            6    

telling us about rates that you were getting that in fact


            7    

are bleeding you dry.  You haven't made that argument. 


            8    

That's not your case. 


            9              

MR. BARR:  Well, because I'm not -- well, there


           10    

are two reasons.  One, we're not complaining about a rate. 


           11    

A rate is evidence of a defect.  It is not an -- we're not


           12    

-- we're not complaining about a specific application. 


           13    

We're complaining about a systemic defect in the


           14    

methodology. 


           15              

QUESTION:  And -- and I could understand your


           16    

argument if that systemic defect had a -- by -- by some


           17    

logical necessity, the conclusion of compensating you for


           18    

what, on traditional standards of review, would be a


           19    

confiscatory rate. 


           20              

MR. BARR:  Yes. 


           21              

QUESTION:  But there is no such necessity that I


           22    

can find in your argument.  I just don't see where that


           23    

step comes in. 


           24              

MR. BARR:  There are --


           25              

QUESTION:  You don't concede that necessity, do

you? 


            2              

MR. BARR:  No, I don't. 


            3              

QUESTION:  Otherwise, you would think that a --


            4    

that spinning a -- spinning a wheel of fortune would be an


            5    

adequate methodology. 


            6              

MR. BARR:  Right.  Rates --


            7              

QUESTION:  No.  You wouldn't.  You wouldn't


            8    

concede that. 


            9              

QUESTION:  I -- I agree with you that -- that we


           10    

would not accept a spinning wheel as -- as being adequate,


           11    

although spinning a wheel might give you compensation.  it


           12    

might not give you compensation.  Who can say?


           13              

MR. BARR:  In -- in the Duquesne case, the Court


           14    

said even a small shift in methodology warrants an


           15    

increase in the risk of premium because you are always


           16    

entitled to get pay for -- to whatever risk you're exposed


           17    

to.  That's what methodological risk is. 


           18              

There are two things on the face of this


           19    

order --


           20              

QUESTION:  And where -- and where does the


           21    

increase in the premium take place?  It takes place in


           22    

State ratemaking, doesn't it? 


           23              

MR. BARR:  The problem here -- the problem here


           24    

in this order -- there are two --


           25              

QUESTION:  But that is correct, isn't it?

That's -- that's where the --


            2              

MR. BARR:  No.  The -- the decision took place


            3    

in the Federal proceeding, and it took place in paragraph


            4    

688 and 702 of the order.  And if we could look at those


            5    

paragraphs, we pointed out --


            6              

QUESTION:  Where -- where do we find them?


            7              

MR. BARR:  Joint appendix 385-386 and joint


            8    

appendix 395. 


            9              

We pointed out that if you're going to make up a


           10    

world in which our compensation is constrained as if we


           11    

had intense competition today, then you should use the


           12    

same methodology in imputing what the rate of return and


           13    

what the depreciation would be.  You can't imagine I'm in


           14    

a world of turbo-charged technological risk and not give


           15    

me that rate of return.


           16              

On page -- at paragraph 688, the Government


           17    

said, well, you know, you might be entitled to -- we


           18    

understand your argument about a higher rate of return,


           19    

but you don't have that competition today.  And our point


           20    

is you've created a dichotomy between two different


           21    

worlds, a world that you say is intensely competitive, in


           22    

fact, in which our network is a commodity, and a world in


           23    

which you say competition will be gradual and we're still


           24    

a bottleneck.  They've created a dichotomy. 


           25              

Then they say, you get your costs back, your


15

            1    

direct costs back, as if you were in a world of intense


            2    

competition.  But when it comes to making the -- that


            3    

exposes us to a methodological risk.  The risk of


            4    

investing a dollar in a world where you -- where you have


            5    

a historical cost methodology and investing it under


            6    

TELRIC is a different risk.  When -- when it comes to


            7    

making that adjustment, they say, you can't do that. 


            8    

We're going to flip-flop.  We're going to pretend you're


            9    

in a world of gradual competition, and that's on paragraph


           10    

702 where they say, you start with your existing closed


           11    

market rate of return and your closed market depreciation,


           12    

and the only time you can make an adjustment is to adjust


           13    

for actual competition.  Well, actual competition is a


           14    

different risk because I'm being exposed to imaginary


           15    

competition. 


           16              

QUESTION:  If all of that is true and you're


           17    

exposed to so much greater risk, I assume that your costs


           18    

of capital will be much higher.  It will be much harder to


           19    

borrow money.  And so all of those risks will ultimately


           20    

be reflected in the amounts that the State ratemaking


           21    

agencies will have to allow you for cost of capital.


           22              

MR. BARR:  The States -- the issue here is the


           23    

cost of capital in the UNE business, our wholesale


           24    

business.  Paragraph 702 prohibits the States from taking


           25    

into account our historical costs, and it says you have to


16

            1    

set the rate of return without a view toward recovering


            2    

those costs.  You cannot adjust for the risk.  The rule


            3    

itself, rule 505, and paragraph 702 -- the whole point of


            4    

a methodology is to say if -- if I'm going to shift to


            5    

some other basis of compensation other than historical --


            6              

QUESTION:  I don't really read 702 as saying


            7    

what you say it says, Mr. Barr.  Maybe I'm missing


            8    

something. 


            9              

MR. BARR:  Well, Your Honor, it -- it does say


           10    

that you use -- you start with the current rate of return


           11    

and the current depreciation.


           12              

QUESTION:  Correct. 


           13              

MR. BARR:  It says that we bear the burden in


           14    

the State proceedings of showing a business risk, and then


           15    

it goes on to say that the business risk relates to actual


           16    

competition.  And -- and, indeed, in the universal service


           17    

proceeding, paragraph 254 and 5 --


           18              

QUESTION:  But it also makes the very point


           19    

Justice Scalia made, that we recognize the incumbent LEC's


           20    

are likely to face increased risks by reason of the


           21    

increased cost of capital.  It does refer to --


           22              

MR. BARR:  Yes.  They're talking about economic


           23    

costs of capital.  And the key question is, which economy


           24    

in this hypothetical world?  Is it the real economy, or is


           25    

it your hypothetical world?  Their rule says, increases in

            1    

rate of return are based on actual competition.  We are


            2    

being exposed today to our pricing as if we lived in a


            3    

world of intense competition, in which our product is a


            4    

commodity, where we would need a very high rate of return.


            5              

And in their universal service proceeding where


            6    

the FCC applied this methodology, it applied existing


            7    

closed market rate of return and existing depreciation


            8    

schedules.  In its opening brief on page 8, it said, we


            9    

are authorizing the States to change the rate of return


           10    

based on actual levels of competition, but the


           11    

methodological risk is not actual competition.  The


           12    

methodological risk is their cost recovery rule.  They're


           13    

mimicking an intensely competitive market. 


           14              

We gave examples in our brief where


           15    

Massachusetts tried to make different rates of return and


           16    

they castigated them for using a different rate of return


           17    

in the wholesale business than in the retail business.


           18              

In the retail business, we are exposed to actual


           19    

competition.  In the wholesale business, we are exposed to


           20    

hypothetical intense competition where our network is


           21    

deemed to be a commodity, and that's the only price we can


           22    

derive.  If we sell a product in the retail market, we get


           23    

an opportunity to get our historical costs.  If we sell it


           24    

in the wholesale market, we're deprived of that because


           25    

the -- the cost is brought down without a corresponding

increase. 


            2              

There are two things on the face of the order --


            3    

two things on the face of the order that are blatantly


            4    

illegal -- on their face, without looking at a rate. 


            5              

The first is it says, we are creating a


            6    

methodological risk, and we're not going to allow an


            7    

adjustment of the rate of return to reflect that


            8    

methodological risk.  We will not even let you look at the


            9    

delta, the risk of a delta between your historical costs


           10    

and whatever this comes out to be. 


           11              

The whole point of a methodology is you have to


           12    

look at the delta.  Even Smyth v. Ames said you just don't


           13    

look at a reproduction cost.  You have to look at in


           14    

relation to historical cost. 


           15              

So, number one, in the rule itself they say you


           16    

cannot look at historical costs.  You can't say, you know,


           17    

what's the risk here between one and the other and adjust.


           18              

The second thing that is facially illegal and


           19    

again has nothing to do with rates is how do they value


           20    

our input.  If we're right that the taking occurs at the


           21    

point of dedication, at the point of expenditure, then we


           22    

have a right to have our property valued when we spend it. 


           23    

When I spend operating costs, I have a right to a fair


           24    

opportunity to get those back. 


           25              

QUESTION:  But that's true of any utility in

those cases that we've -- we've decided over the --


            2              

MR. BARR:  And they don't.  They don't.  What


            3    

they say is when they value our expenditure, they apply --


            4    

their --


            5              

QUESTION:  Just -- who is they?


            6              

MR. BARR:  The FCC rule. 


            7              

QUESTION:  Okay. 


            8              

MR. BARR:  Okay.  The FCC rule values our


            9    

expenditures based on TELRIC, but TELRIC is the efficiency


           10    

that can be achieved by someone who doesn't have a sunk


           11    

network and therefore has no path dependencies and


           12    

therefore whose incremental cost is going to be lower than


           13    

ours.  And -- and what they say is, you spend $75 billion


           14    

for operating expense?  Well, our TELRIC guy -- you know,


           15    

he could do it for $50 billion.  So, you're getting credit


           16    

for $50 billion. 


           17              

And then on my incremental expenditures, if I --


           18    

once I build a network and I have it in the ground, I'm


           19    

path-dependent.  If I build a set of telephone poles to


           20    

this subdivision, and the next year a subdivision opens up


           21    

over here, okay, the most efficient way for me to provide


           22    

it is to maybe do a nice, big, long line over there, and


           23    

that might cost me $10 million.  The FCC says, we don't


           24    

care because at that point in time, we're going to


           25    

hypothesize that someone can build a blank slate network

and do it for 5 because they have the luxury of building


            2    

it to meet that capacity on a blank slate.


            3              

QUESTION:  Is the Government going to tell us


            4    

that there are other ways you can recover that cost


            5    

through depreciation or --


            6              

MR. BARR:  No, because the thing they're -- the


            7    

thing they're depreciating is the TELRIC price.  This is


            8    

-- this is the weirdness of the Government's rule.  I


            9    

spend $10 billion.  It's necessary, prudent.  It's the


           10    

most efficient way for me to produce.


           11              

QUESTION:  Are they going to tell us you get it


           12    

back on the cost of capital? 


           13              

MR. BARR:  No. 


           14              

QUESTION:  Or is your answer the same because


           15    

it's just the capital based on the TELRIC --


           16              

MR. BARR:  Their briefs talk about cost of


           17    

capital.  Here's the -- here's the rub.  When they say,


           18    

well, we're going to value that as if it's 5 because


           19    

someone else could be more efficient, a hypothetical


           20    

person in a perfect market could be more efficient, so


           21    

we're going to give you 5.  But don't worry.  Something


           22    

might happen to the rate of return.  The rule itself says


           23    

you cannot adjust the rate of return to recover the


           24    

historical cost.  You can't.  And the rate of return


           25    

they're going to give us is on the 5, not on the 10, and

            1    

the depreciation is of the 5, not on the 10. 


            2              

There are two defects here.  We're entitled to


            3    

-- to the value of what we have to spend.


            4              

What they do is they take --


            5              

QUESTION:  What about costs of capital?


            6              

MR. BARR:  Excuse me? 


            7              

QUESTION:  Can you get it back in costs of


            8    

capital?  What costs of capital do they allow you?


            9              

MR. BARR:  They allow the cost of capital that


           10    

exists in a closed market.  The pricing that they give us


           11    

is the pricing that they say would exist if our network


           12    

were a commodity.  They don't change for the risk.


           13              

In other words, if today I spend $10 billion and


           14    

that's prudent and necessary, and I -- I'm in a closed


           15    

market or a market that's just been opened and I get 15


           16    

percent or 12 percent, that's scenario one. 


           17              

Then they turn around and say, these same


           18    

facilities you're now going to have to sell to somebody


           19    

else, not in the retail market where you get 15 percent on


           20    

$10 billion.  Now you have to sell them to your


           21    

competitors, and there you're going to get 15 percent on


           22    

$7 billion.  And -- and the point is that the risk now


           23    

that my stuff is going to be valued at 7 instead of 10 is


           24    

a risk, and the only way I can get compensated is by a


           25    

higher rate of return.

QUESTION:  But your point there -- the answer to


            2    

Justice Scalia's question, I take it, was forgetting your


            3    

first problem -- that's your first problem.  Right?  The


            4    

one you brought up at the beginning. 


            5              

MR. BARR:  Correct.


            6              

QUESTION:  The fact that they're pretending


            7    

actual competition is what makes the difference, but what


            8    

the problem arises out of is the fact that they're pricing


            9    

on a hypothetically perfectly competitive market.


           10              

MR. BARR:  Right. 


           11              

QUESTION:  That's your first point. 


           12              

MR. BARR:  Right. 


           13              

QUESTION:  If that point were wrong, then the


           14    

answer to Justice Scalia, I take it, would be, there's no


           15    

other problem.  I mean, if they did that right and they


           16    

lowered your new investment from $10 million to $5 million


           17    

because that was TELRIC, in principle, they could get the


           18    

money back for you by giving you a higher rate of return


           19    

on your -- on your TELRIC estimated cost of capital.


           20              

MR. BARR:  The rule says no.  But -- but if you


           21    

change the rule, you theoretically could do a high enough


           22    

rate of return.  But it doesn't solve the problem. 


           23              

QUESTION:  Where does the rule say no?  Give us


           24    

the -- the exact text where the rule says no. 


           25

QUESTION:  395? 


            3              

MR. BARR:  And it also asks -- it's not in the


            4    

record.  It's a separate ruling, but the universal service


            5    

proceeding, paragraph --

QUESTION:  This is -- this is on -- this is at

395 of the joint appendix? 


            8              

MR. BARR:  Yes.


            9              

And this is how it has been implemented by the


           10

QUESTION:  And -- and can you show us the


           12    

language there? 


           13              

QUESTION:  Yes.  Where?  What's the language?


           14              

MR. BARR:  That the -- that the existing rate of


           15    

return and existing depreciation are reasonable starting


           16    

points.


           17              

QUESTION:  Starting points. 


           18              

QUESTION:  Yes, starting points.

QUESTION:  Are you talking about rule 707?

of showing actual competition -- actual competition.  It


            2    

is not a reasonable starting point even if it was a


            3    

temporal exercise because we are being exposed today to


            4    

intense competition through the rule.


            5              

QUESTION:  Now, but you're saying rule 702


            6    

prevents you from getting back what you otherwise should


            7    

have through capital costs?


            8              

MR. BARR:  Yes.  In fact, they've admitted it in


            9    

their brief. 


           10              

QUESTION:  And where -- and where -- what


           11    

language in rule 702 are you relying on? 


           12              

MR. BARR:  I'm relying on the -- on the whole


           13    

first half of that paragraph where they say, you start


           14    

with existing.  We have the burden of showing business


           15    

risk, and then the remainder of that paragraph talks about


           16    

actual competition. 


           17              

It's not in the record, but it is a separate


           18    

order.


           19              

QUESTION:  Okay.  But I -- since you're --


           20    

you're relying on it heavily for a particular proposition,


           21    

I think you ought to be able to come closer than you have


           22    

to point out exactly what language supports your position.


           23              

MR. BARR:  We recognize that incumbent LEC's are


           24    

likely to face increased risks given the overall increases


           25    

in competition in the industry, which might warrant an

            1    

increased cost of capital.  That's the standard, whether


            2    

there's actual competition. 


            3              

That's what they say in paragraph 688.  We said,


            4    

look, in the TELRIC world, we need a higher rate of


            5    

return.  They say USTA's argument unrealistically assumes


            6    

that competitive entry would be instantaneous.  The more


            7    

reasonable assumption of entry occurring over time will


            8    

reduce the costs associated with sunk investment. 


            9              

Our point is entry is instantaneous under TELRIC


           10    

because that's the hypothesis.  We're priced as if there's


           11    

instantaneous entry. 


           12              

QUESTION:  At the bottom of page 83a, toward the


           13    

end of rule 702, it says, States may adjust the cost of


           14    

capital if a party demonstrates to a State commission that


           15    

either a higher or lower level of cost of capital is


           16    

warranted without the commission conducting a rate of


           17    

return or other rate-based proceeding.  That would seem to


           18    

allow the State commissions to -- to do what you want


           19    

done.


           20              

MR. BARR:  That paragraph -- I think a fair


           21    

reading of that paragraph and the way it is read and


           22    

applied including --


           23              

QUESTION:  What about the language I just quoted


           24

            1              

MR. BARR:  I would distinguish it by then


            2    

looking at the rule, which is rule 505, and that's on


            3    

joint appendix 51 and 52.  And it tells you what you


            4    

cannot consider in setting forward-looking costs,


            5    

including forward-looking cost of capital.  And (d) says


            6    

-- page 52 -- the following factors shall not be


            7    

considered in a calculation of the forward-looking


            8    

economic cost of an element.  Embedded costs. 


            9              

Now, cost of capital under (b)(2) is the cost of


           10    

capital to recover the TELRIC price, not your historical


           11    

price.  How can --


           12              

QUESTION:  But isn't -- isn't --


           13              

MR. BARR:  -- (d)(1) on its face -- excuse me,


           14    

Your Honor. 


           15              

QUESTION:  No.  I just want to go back to


           16    

something I don't understand.  Isn't (d) -- I'm sorry. 


           17    

Yes.  Isn't (d)(1) simply talking about the TELRIC method


           18    

as opposed to the ultimate ratemaking methodology?  In --


           19    

in -- I'm sorry.  As opposed to the ultimate determination


           20    

of what would be an appropriate rate using TELRIC


           21    

valuation.


           22              

MR. BARR:  That's right, and that's a directive


           23    

to the State. 


           24              

QUESTION:  Okay. 


           25              

MR. BARR:  That's a directive to the State.  The

States cannot --


            2              

QUESTION:  But that is not -- if -- if you


            3    

understand by the distinction what I understand by the


            4    

distinction, it is not a directive to the State which


            5    

binds them in the ultimate rate that they can set.


            6              

MR. BARR:  It binds -- yes, it does bind me. 


            7    

The rate -- the rate cannot --


            8              

QUESTION:  Then I don't understand it. 


            9              

MR. BARR:  They cannot consider in -- in setting


           10    

the cost of capital historical costs.


           11              

QUESTION:  Well, but they don't have to consider


           12    

it if they give you a high enough rate on your TELRIC


           13    

costs.  Let's assume they have --


           14              

MR. BARR:  How do they determine what's high


           15    

enough, Your Honor? 


           16              

QUESTION:  Let's assume that your past costs


           17    

were, indeed, $10 million, and they're saying, well, it's


           18    

just 5 because somebody else could do it for 5 if they


           19    

came in right now.  So long as they give you a higher


           20    

percentage on that 5, you're going to be in just as good


           21    

shape as if they were giving you your 15 percent on the


           22    

10.


           23              

MR. BARR:  And how do they determine what's high


           24    

enough unless you have a standard?


           25              

QUESTION:  They can determine on the basis of

what your risk is.  And -- and --


            2              

MR. BARR:  The risk of what? 


            3              

QUESTION:  -- it's very -- it's -- your risk of


            4    

continuing to put in capital which will -- which will not


            5    

-- which you will not be able to have taken into account


            6    

in setting the rate.


            7              

MR. BARR:  Well, I think, you know, your


            8    

concurrence in -- in Duquesne, Justice Scalia, made a very


            9    

fundamental point, which is you can't talk about return on


           10    

risk without implying a standard.  What's the risk you're


           11    

compensating me for?  What's the risk you're compensating


           12    

me for?  It's the risk I'm not going to be able to recover


           13    

my capital.


           14              

QUESTION:  But now --


           15              

MR. BARR:  How -- how can you figure that out


           16    

without looking at what my capital is in relation to what


           17    

you're allowing me? 


           18              

QUESTION:  Right.  That may all be true, and I


           19    

have only one question to ask, and I'm asking it.  I don't


           20    

know the answer, and I -- it may help or not help.


           21              

But when I read the briefs, I noticed you


           22    

started with the valuation of the capital base of around


           23    

$340 billion-$350 billion.  And then when we look at the


           24    

depreciated base, it comes to around $140 billion-$150


           25    

billion across the country.

            1              

And I got the impression from the brief, that if


            2    

-- if that's the valuation -- mirabile dictu my Latin


            3    

professor used to say.  The rate of return is okay.  That


            4    

-- that however miraculously they've come to this -- to


            5    

this result -- and I've read the criticisms.  They give


            6    

you a quarter of the telephone pole.  They -- they deduct


            7    

22 percent for there being competition.  They assume that


            8    

the most efficient firm has the administrative costs of


            9    

all the firms.  They do all the things on depreciation


           10    

that you say.  They do the same thing on capital.  And


           11    

yet, somehow the result seems to be that you're earning a


           12    

fair rate of return on the depreciated value of the


           13    

capital, namely $140 billion-$150 billion-$160 billion, in


           14    

that range. 


           15              

Now -- now I'm asking a question to get an


           16    

answer.


           17              

MR. BARR:  That was mixing the apples and


           18    

oranges.  The -- that -- that's mixing the original cost


           19    

of the hypothetical network with the depreciated value of


           20    

our network.  What's relevant is what's our capital charge


           21    

that's allowed or our depreciation expense. 


           22              

Before TELRIC came along, I was recovering,


           23    

let's say, $340 billion over 10 years, and I'm halfway


           24    

through, generally.  So, I have about 170 to go in 5


           25    

years.  They come along and say under your new network,


30

            1    

you're going to get 170 because that's how much a new


            2    

network would cost, not one that's half depreciated, and


            3    

you get to recover that over 10 years.  So, now my


            4    

depreciation expense has been halved. 


            5              

QUESTION:  So, what you're saying is in response


            6    

to what I said, that I am wrong in saying that the TELRIC-


            7    

set depreciation, capital return, and other numbers -- I


            8    

am wrong in saying that they will earn you a fair rate of


            9    

return on $140 billion.  To the contrary, they will earn


           10    

you only half the return you're entitled to on that 140.


           11              

MR. BARR:  Correct. 


           12              

QUESTION:  And I can find that in the -- is


           13    

there anything on that in the record? 


           14              

MR. BARR:  There's a -- well --


           15              

QUESTION:  No. 


           16              

MR. BARR:  Well, by using the same depreciation


           17    

schedule and hypothesizing a new network, that reduces my


           18    

-- that reduces my capital charge. 


           19              

Now, we have shown --


           20              

QUESTION:  The capital charge will fall from


           21    

$140 billion.  A TELRIC valuation of those FCC numbers


           22    

which are on the two pages that they have all -- a TELRIC


           23    

valuation of that will not end up with the number 165, 7


           24    

-- 70 billion approximately.  It will end up with the


           25    

number 70 or 80.

MR. BARR:  No.  They will end up -- they will


            2    

say we're going to imagine you have a new network and can


            3    

depreciated it over the next 10 years, when in fact I have


            4    

a network that I have 5 more years to depreciate 170 on. 


            5    

The effect of that is to half my recovery because in 5


            6    

years I have to buy a new switch, and I strand what I


            7    

haven't yet recovered. 


            8              

QUESTION:  But you're saying the commission sets


            9    

the depreciation period and binds the State commissions by


           10    

that? 


           11              

MR. BARR:  The State -- well, yes.  They -- the


           12    

-- the commission tells the States what to do.


           13              

QUESTION:  And the commission says, 5-year


           14    

depreciation -- 10-year depreciation, not 5, or 5 not 10. 


           15    

That's -- the commission forces that on the States?


           16              

MR. BARR:  Yes.  The commission says --


           17              

QUESTION:  Can -- can --


           18              

MR. BARR:  -- economic depreciation --


           19              

QUESTION:  Okay.  Can you point to a -- a


           20    

commission statement to that effect? 


           21              

MR. BARR:  Yes.  This is -- this is a separate


           22    

proceeding, but it's their application of TELRIC.


           23              

QUESTION:  Okay.

QUESTION:  What are you reading from? 


            2              

MR. BARR:  Paragraph 250 of that order.  It's a


            3    

-- it's a published opinion, but it's not part of the


            4    

record. 


            5              

QUESTION:  It's not in the record? 


            6              

MR. BARR:  It's not in the joint appendix, but


            7    

it's a -- it's the parallel proceeding to this where they


            8    

were setting TELRIC for our universal service prices. 


            9              

The first sentence of paragraph 4:  The rate of


           10    

return must be either the authorized Federal rate of


           11    

return on the interstate or the State-prescribed rate.  In


           12    

other words, they're saying it has to be -- the same rate


           13    

of return as you have in the retail business has to be in


           14    

the wholesale business. 


           15              

QUESTION:  Or -- or the State -- was this last


           16    

part, or the State-prescribed rate?


           17              

MR. BARR:  Retail rate.  The retail rate. 


           18              

QUESTION:  Well, but would you read again the


           19    

sentence? 


           20              

MR. BARR:  Yes.  It has to be either the Federal


           21    

interstate -- that's a retail rate.  Okay?  And the only


           22    

risk there --

return for intrastate -- intrastate services.  These are


            2    

retail rates based on the --


            3              

QUESTION:  These are -- these are rates of


            4    

return.  Now, tell me how it is that that -- those


            5    

statements with respect to rates of return determine a


            6    

depreciation period. 


            7              

MR. BARR:  Well, the next paragraph, paragraph


            8    

5, says that we agree with those commentators that argue


            9    

that currently authorized lines should be used because the


           10    

high cost areas are unlikely to face a serious competitive


           11    

threat.  Again, they are using existing depreciation based


           12    

on a world of gradual competition in our retail business


           13    

and they are applying it to prices that they are


           14    

formulating based on the hypothesis of radical competition


           15    

that has commoditized our product and reduced our direct


           16    

cost by half. 


           17              

Now, the fact is this is a bifurcated


           18    

proceeding.  The Feds set the methodology.  The States set


           19    

the rates.  The Federal Government has told the States


           20    

what to do, and you'll see in our brief that example where


           21    

the State tries to use a different rate of return, the FCC


           22    

slaps them down.  It's very clear. 


           23              

Now, they've made an admission in their own


           24    

brief on page -- on their reply brief, which -- on -- on


           25    

page 12, note 8.  And they say that the -- the risk is not

just the -- this is footnote 8.  It says, the risk is not


            2    

just the risk of actual competition, but obviously you


            3    

have to have a methodological risk adjustment. 


            4              

QUESTION:  What part of footnote 8 are you


            5    

relying on? 


            6              

MR. BARR:  That second consideration is


            7    

notwithstanding the incumbent's contrary suggestion


            8    

implicit in any determination of the true economic cost of


            9    

capital. 


           10              

Our problem is that's not what the order said. 


           11    

That's a post hoc brief.  And if this Court were to rule


           12    

that the rate of return has to be adjusted based on the


           13    

hypothesis of actual competition, that takes care of part


           14    

of the problem.  But that's not what the rule says.  It's


           15    

not what it was implemented as, and now they are making


           16    

this concession in their brief.  Now, that's only part of


           17    

the problem. 


           18              

The other problem under forward-looking is


           19    

they're using it to value our network at the time of


           20    

dedication, and our expenditures -- as I explained, when


           21    

we spend money, they act as if we're not really spending


           22    

that amount of money.  We're somebody else.  And what


           23    

they're using is the Government coming up and taking


           24    

someone's property and saying I'm going to mimic away your


           25    

opportunity to recover it.  I'm going to imagine it in a

            1    

world in which you do not have the opportunity of


            2    

recovering your property.


            3              

If that -- if that is the principle, that the


            4    

Government can take property and then in the name of


            5    

mimicking competition, say, you're not going to have the


            6    

opportunity recover it, what's the limiting principle of


            7    

that rule?  You can mimic -- when I put in $1,000, I need


            8    

the opportunity to get it back.  That's what I'm


            9    

surrendering, to deploy it, to redeploy it, to use my wits


           10    

to enhance and preserve its value.  When I expend the


           11    

money into a regime of compelled service, that's when


           12    

those opportunities go away.  And that's the point of the


           13    

taking.  I'm locked into spending the money.  The


           14    

Government tells me who to serve, what to charge, what


           15    

quality to provide, and I can't redeploy it elsewhere. 


           16              

In that circumstance, the Government can't say,


           17    

now I'm going to define your opportunity in this business


           18    

as an opportunity that doesn't give you the opportunity to


           19    

recover your cost.  Because then that's just a roving


           20    

license to go around, take property, and say, now I'm


           21    

going to imagine you don't have the opportunity to recover


           22    

it. 


           23              

The Just Compensation Clause says, if you take


           24    

away $1,000, you're taking my opportunity as to that


           25    

$1,000.  You have to give me back an opportunity as to

            1    

$1,000.  And if this is -- if this is how you value


            2    

property -- I mean, this Court has been very clear, if


            3    

you're going to invoke a market, it better be a real


            4    

market.  You have to have a real observable market.  And


            5    

this Court has held that when the Government comes along


            6    

and takes assets like this, it's the opportunity cost.


            7              

This case is just like Monongahela.  There the


            8    

State gave a company a franchise to build a lock and dam


            9    

and gave it tolls to recoup its costs.  So, it had a


           10    

franchise, a State franchise with tolls.  The Federal


           11    

Government said, we think this thing is worth X,


           12    

appropriated the money, and took the lock and dam.  The


           13    

Court said, well, wait a minute.  You've come and taken


           14    

this lock and dam.  Opportunity costs.  You can't just


           15    

make up a value for it. 


           16              

QUESTION:  But here -- here no property is taken


           17    

in the condemnation sense of the word.  That was a


           18    

condemnation proceeding.  Just compensation.  No property


           19    

of yours is actually taken here in that sense, is it? 


           20              

MR. BARR:  No, that's wrong in two respects. 


           21    

First, there's actual occupation of our facilities to our


           22    

exclusion.  They can occupy and exclude us from use of our


           23    

facilities. 


           24              

QUESTION:  Well, have they done so? 


           25              

MR. BARR:  Yes, 6 percent of our lines have been

            1    

taken in this respect. 


            2              

Now, but in any event, we have an -- I mean,


            3    

this is a utility case.  This is not a regulatory taking. 


            4    

And the quid pro quo for us having spent all this money is


            5    

an expectancy.  That creates an expectation interest. 


            6              

QUESTION:  Yes, but I don't think it comes under


            7    

the Just Compensation Clause.  The cases involved -- you


            8    

know, go back to Smyth against Ames -- have not talked in


            9    

terms of just compensation.  They've talked in terms of


           10    

fair return and due process.  There is a constitutional


           11    

principle involved, but I don't think it's the Just


           12    

Compensation Clause.


           13              

MR. BARR:  Well, Your Honor, I respectfully


           14    

disagree because I think the reason -- when you dedicate


           15    

property and there's a taking, the reason the Government


           16    

has to come up with a methodology to pay is precisely


           17    

because it has to promise to pay at the point of the


           18    

dedication.  The methodology is the promise to pay.  It's


           19    

saying, you put this in, here's how you're going to get


           20    

your money back.  That's why we have ratemaking.  It is


           21    

the Government's promise to pay.  It creates an


           22    

expectation.  And here they promise -- and this takes


           23    

us --


           24              

QUESTION:  You're saying every -- every breach


           25    

of contract by the Government is a taking.  I mean, that

-- that's a little extreme, isn't it?  I mean, every


            2    

time --


            3              

MR. BARR:  This Court has recognized --


            4              

QUESTION:  Every time the Government enters a


            5    

contract, it creates an expectation, and whenever the


            6    

Government breaks a contract, it's a -- it's a taking.


            7              

MR. BARR:  It's not a contract, Your Honor. 


            8    

This is a dedication by a utility, and there are three


            9    

things going on here, which this Court has always


           10    

recognized create a property interest, such as in -- in


           11    

Russell v. Sebastian. 


           12              

Number one, the Government requires us to serve. 


           13    

This is compelled.  Okay? 


           14              

Number two --


           15              

QUESTION:  Compelled because you agreed to it. 


           16    

That was part of the contract.  You put up the money and


           17    

you'll -- you'll have to serve and we'll provide you with


           18    

a reasonable rate of return.  That was the deal. 


           19              

MR. BARR:  A return in order to give us a fair


           20    

opportunity to get our money back. 


           21              

And in determining what the methodology was for


           22    

our initial investment, the Government said, okay, guys,


           23    

you put in all this money -- and now I'm shifting to the


           24    

historical part of the case.  You put in all this money,


           25    

and here's the deal.  You will be -- you will not have the

            1    

risk of devaluation, and therefore, we're not going to pay


            2    

you a high rate of return.  So, we got low rates of return


            3    

for all these years.


            4              

And now they're retroactively saying, we're


            5    

changing our mind.  We're going to -- we're going to start


            6    

revaluing your property and we're going to apply that


            7    

against your historical cost.


            8              

QUESTION:  Mr. Barr, may I ask -- one piece of


            9    

this case is you made this investment for your local


           10    

telephone business.  That -- that continues.  That's not


           11    

touched by anything we're talking about now.  You get that


           12    

rate on your -- what is the vast majority of your


           13    

business.  That investment -- you get that rate set by the


           14    

local public utility commissions as -- as always.  Isn't


           15    

that so?  So, your telephone service business isn't


           16    

touched by any of this. 


           17              

MR. BARR:  These use the same facilities.  So,


           18    

this is occupying the facilities we use for our retail,


           19    

and then it deprives us of using --


           20              

QUESTION:  But you're getting back the lion's


           21    

share.


           22              

MR. BARR:  Well, yes, but that's like going to


           23    

GM and saying give away your Chevys because you're still


           24    

making money. 


           25              

QUESTION:  And then there's another piece of it

            1    

that I'd like you to tell me how it fits in, and that is


            2    

the quid pro quo of you can get into for the first time a


            3    

new business, that you can get into the long distance


            4    

business.  Doesn't that have some kind of value?


            5              

MR. BARR:  No.  I think if there was going to be


            6    

some quid pro quo in the statute, Congress has to define


            7    

it.  Otherwise the Government agency can go up to someone


            8    

and say, you know, we waived some procedure for you in the


            9    

INS, and therefore now we're going to take away your car. 


           10    

Their quid pro quo has to be spelled out by Congress. 


           11              

But in any event, we didn't get a special favor. 


           12    

It said, once you purge yourself of any defect, you can


           13    

act like everybody else. 


           14              

One final point that's very critical here, which


           15    

is the language in the statute in 252, which goes on -- it


           16    

doesn't say just -- just and reasonable in 251(c).  It


           17    

says just and reasonable.  This says something else in


           18    

addition as opposed to Hope where the Court said there was


           19    

no further specification of how rates were to be


           20    

determined.  It says, here determinations of rate have to


           21    

be based on the cost of providing. 


           22              

That provision can only make sense and only has


           23    

an office in the statute if it is somehow delimiting how


           24    

just and reasonable rates are to be determined.  The


           25    

Government's view is, just and reasonable, that gives us

            2    

here, and that can only be reasonable -- reasonably --


            3              

QUESTION:  Well, no.  It also argues that the


            4    

word cost is ambiguous. 


            5              

MR. BARR:  Not in the context -- you have cost


            6    

and you have value methodologies.  If the office of that


            7    

statute -- of that provision is to delimit discretion as


            8    

to what kind of methodology -- the -- cost on its face


            9    

refers to a cost-based methodology, not a value


           10    

methodology. 


           11              

I reserve the balance of my time. 


           12              

QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Barr. 


           13              

General Olson, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

MR. OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


           17    

the Court:


           18              

The colloquy that we have just heard illustrates


           19    

why this Court has said over and over again in the context


           20    

of ratemaking, in precisely the context we're talking


           21    

about here, that the Court evaluates results not


           22    

methodologies; impacts, not means; and consequences, not


           23    

techniques. 


           24              

QUESTION:  Do you think that really means that


           25

scheme that says we're going to spin a wheel, and if it


            2    

lands in the right place, you're going to get a good rate,


            3    

if it lands in another place, you're going to get a bad


            4    

rate? 


            5              

MR. OLSON:  Well, there might be --


            6              

QUESTION:  We couldn't say that that is


            7    

irrational and -- and -- does -- is not designed to


            8    

provide a fair rate of return?  Don't you have the burden


            9    

of showing that this is at least designed to -- to provide


           10    

a fair rate of return?


           11              

MR. OLSON:  This Court has said that the


           12    

challenger of a rate has a heavy burden to make a


           13    

convincing case that the outcome is confiscatory.  Now,


           14    

that burden can't be achieved -- Justice Ginsburg's


           15    

questions at the end of this colloquy illustrate that


           16    

there are a number -- and -- and the questions about


           17    

depreciation and cost of capital illustrate all of the


           18    

things that -- the reasons why this Court has avoided


           19    

deciding whether a methodology is acceptable or not.


           20              

QUESTION:  You -- you can't meet that burden


           21    

with a wheel.  You can't meet that burden with a wheel. 


           22    

You're really saying that you can come up with a wheel and

challenges the way the commission is setting rates has to


            2    

-- has to present to this Court an explanation for why


            3    

that the system that's developed, whether it's spinning a


            4    

wheel or whatever -- and I -- I won't engage in that


            5    

hypothetical because we've got a several hundred page


            6    

record that looked into various different arguments with


            7    

respect to various different methods of recovery.  It


            8    

listened to various -- the FCC listened to various


            9    

different experts.  It listened to the incumbent local


           10    

exchange carriers' various different theories.  It has


           11    

explained why it did.  It developed a forward-looking


           12    

technology, a method of evaluating the entry fees that


           13    

would be based upon the statute.


           14              

QUESTION:  But it -- it seems to me that


           15    

necessarily a hypothetically most efficient market will


           16    

invariably, necessarily result in a rate that is less than


           17    

their actual cost.


           18              

MR. OLSON:  Well, no, I don't agree.


           19              

QUESTION:  I mean, it just -- that just has to


           20    

be.


           21              

MR. OLSON:  No, it does have to be.  And this


           22    

Court should wait to see whether that really happens or


           23    

not. 


           24              

In the first place, this Court has said over and


           25    

over again that the ratemaker has the responsibility and

obligation and right under the Constitution to consider


            2    

the goals of the statute, different theories, mixed --


            3    

mixed methodologies, and all of those things so that the


            4    

Court -- we can't determine -- there's a lot of


            5    

allegations in the briefs and in this entire case about


            6    

the draconian impact of this methodology. 


            7              

But as the colloquy that took place here with


            8    

respect to both depreciation and return of capital


            9    

illustrated, in the precise paragraphs that my opponent


           10    

cited with respect to these things illustrate the point. 


           11    

Once the forward method -- forward-looking technology


           12    

method is applied, the State -- the States are determining


           13    

the rates which these carriers will receive for the


           14    

elements.  And they may be only elements of the system. 


           15    

They get to continue to operate the system, to make


           16    

profit, to reimburse themselves for whatever costs they've


           17    

embedded.  They've said that they're not challenging the


           18    

rates.  They're not challenging the outcome because once


           19    

the forward-looking technology that the FCC specified in


           20    

detail after long, detailed, methodical consideration --


           21    

said that then the States will look at questions of


           22    

depreciation and cost of capital. 


           23              

The paragraph that you read back, Mr. Chief


           24    

Justice, the sentence in paragraph 702, which is on page


           25

            2    

State commission that either a higher or lower level of


            3    

cost of capital is warranted, et cetera, et cetera. 


            4              

QUESTION:  Warranted by what standard? 


            5              

MR. OLSON:  By the circumstances and -- and the


            6    

constitutional obligation to set a reasonable rate under


            7    

the statute considering this methodology and limited by


            8    

the constitutional standard that this Court has


            9    

articulated as the lowest reasonable rate, a rate that is


           10    

not confiscatory. 


           11              

QUESTION:  Are actual -- are actual costs


           12    

relevant in determining --


           13              

MR. OLSON:  Well, this Court --


           14              

QUESTION:  -- what's ultimately reasonable?


           15              

MR. OLSON:  Well, this Court has repeatedly said


           16    

that it has refused to constitutionalize the embedded cost


           17    

or historical cost formulation.  Most recently it said


           18    

that in the Duquesne case. 


           19              

QUESTION:  But warranted must have some specific


           20    

standard.  There must be some principle by which we can


           21    

see if it's warranted.  And -- and their contention is


           22    

that when you automatically guarantee them a lower than --


           23    

than cost -- than cost recovery, it must necessarily be


           24    

unwarranted.


           25              

MR. OLSON:  That argument is made, but it's not

substantiated by anything in the record in -- in this


            2    

long, elaborate TELRIC articulation of -- of numerous


            3    

standards, both with respect to cost of capital and


            4    

depreciation because the very next paragraph --


            5              

QUESTION:  Never mind the next paragraph.  What


            6    

about the end of that sentence that -- that you didn't


            7    

read?


            8              

MR. OLSON:  Well, but that says --


            9              

QUESTION:  -- a higher or lower level of cost of


           10    

capital is warranted without that commission conducting a


           11    

rate-of-return or other rate-based proceeding.  And the


           12    

argument is made -- and it seems to me a reasonable one --


           13    

that that, in effect, says, without looking at embedded


           14    

costs because that's what a rate-based proceeding has --


           15    

has traditionally been.  In other words, that -- that


           16    

sentence suggests that you cannot set the -- the higher


           17    

level -- higher or lower level cost of capital on the


           18    

basis of how much embedded cost the utility has.


           19              

MR. OLSON:  Well, it must say that because


           20    

that's precisely what it said in the statute.  Section 47


           21    

U.S.C. 252(d)(1), which is replicated on the joint


           22    

appendix at pages 21 to 23.  Congress specifically said


           23    

now that based upon the cost -- and by the way, it is cost


           24    

of providing, not cost.  It says cost of providing --


           25    

parentheses, determined without reference to a rate-of-

            1    

return or other rate-based proceeding.  So, the fact that


            2    

the FCC put that in its calculation of cost of capital was


            3    

required by the statute.


            4              

QUESTION:  I don't care if it's required by the


            5    

statute or not.  I care whether it -- it gives these


            6    

people any shot at getting back the -- the capital that


            7    

they've invested, with a promise by the Government, that


            8    

they'd be able to get a fair return on it.  I don't care


            9    

if it's required by the statute or required by the FCC. 


           10              

MR. OLSON:  Well, you may not, Justice Scalia,


           11    

but the -- but the cases presented on alternative bases --


           12    

the heavy burden that the local exchange carriers must


           13    

carry here is proving that the embedded cost, historic


           14    

cost requirement is either in the statute or in the


           15    

Constitution.  We demonstrate in our briefs -- and it's


           16    

relatively clear that it's not required by the statute,


           17    

and we submit it's not required by the Constitution either


           18    

because --


           19              

QUESTION:  You're saying it doesn't matter if


           20    

they -- if they end up not getting a fair return on


           21    

billions of dollars that have been invested with the


           22    

Government's assurance that they -- that they get a fair


           23    

return.  Is that what you're saying?  It doesn't matter.


           24              

MR. OLSON:  I'm not saying that.  I'm saying


           25    

that ultimately this Court may have to decide whether it

            1    

gets a fair rate of return for what it is losing, the


            2    

detriment it gives up when it allows competition to


            3    

utilize some small portion of their networks under various


            4    

different, carefully calibrated circumstances.  They


            5    

cannot make that case yet. 


            6              

And by the way, this TELRIC system has been in


            7    

effect for several years already.  It has been applied


            8    

with depreciation rates.  And I was going to point out


            9    

that there is latitude in the State commissions to set a


           10    

depreciation rate -- this is in paragraph 703 -- that


           11    

reflects the true changes in economic value of an asset


           12    

and a cost of capital that appropriately reflects the


           13    

risks incurred by an investor, and so forth.  Once you've


           14    

seen the application of that, then you can determine


           15    

whether or not there's been anything lost. 


           16              

This is -- and Justice Ginsburg's point I have


           17    

to return to.  This is for use in certain markets by


           18    

certain competitors of certain elements of the incumbent


           19    

exchange system.  If they're interested in recovering


           20    

whatever the number is of $120 billion or $150 billion


           21    

worth of embedded costs, are they expected -- do they have


           22    

a reasonable right to expect that they will recover that


           23    

out of the -- the fees paid for the elements that are used


           24    

in a system that is intended to fulfill the congressional


           25    

goals -- and if these are unconstitutional, that's a

            1    

separate question, but the congressional goals that the


            2    

commission was required to dedicate itself to is to


            3    

promote competition, reduce regulation, lower prices, and


            4    

encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications


            5    

technologies. 


            6              

This Court has said over and over again that


            7    

when the ratemaker --


            8              

QUESTION:  And not compensate investors.  Since


            9    

it spelled out those four and said nothing about


           10    

compensating investors, that doesn't have to be taken into


           11    

account. 


           12              

MR. OLSON:  It -- it -- that's correct.  The


           13    

statute says nothing about compensating investors.  It


           14    

says a just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory rate


           15    

based upon the -- the various factors of the cost of


           16    

providing the service. 


           17              

Now, the Eighth Circuit looked at that and said


           18    

something to the effect that, well, the -- the cost of


           19    

carrying the extra load with respect to these elements --


           20    

that would be an -- something called an incremental cost


           21    

or a marginal cost.  It might be considerably lower.  It


           22    

might reimburse them in some way for some portion of their


           23    

capital costs. 


           24              

And by the way, Congress does know how to deal


           25    

with this issue when it -- when it's necessary.  In the

Pole Attachments Act, which is 47 U.S.C. 224 I think, that


            2    

the Court considered last week, the -- the statute


            3    

specifically refers to an allocation for a cost of capital


            4    

of the telephone pole or the conduit or the right-of-way. 


            5    

It didn't say that in this statute.  It said, costs of


            6    

providing the service. 


            7              

And then it had that exclusion that you


            8    

mentioned, Justice Scalia, about rate of return,


            9    

suggesting that the traditional embedded cost rates, to


           10    

the extent that they are often used in ratemaking, wasn't


           11    

necessarily what the Congress had in mind. 


           12              

What this Court said in its decision, when it


           13    

visited this case 4 years ago, is that this statute is in


           14    

some respects a model of ambiguity, and the Court went --


           15    

went on pointedly to say, at the end of that decision,


           16    

Congress well knows what it's doing when it writes


           17    

ambiguous provisions.  And the word cost, and the word


           18    

value, and the word rate of return, and things like that


           19    

in ratemaking cases are ambiguous, and they mean lots of


           20    

different things under lots of different circumstances. 


           21    

Those ambiguities will be clarified and implemented and


           22    

filled out by the regulators to whom authority has been


           23    

given. 


           24              

What happened in this case, I submit, is what


           25    

Congress properly did.  What this Court said in -- I think

it was in the Duquesne case -- that these are hopelessly


            2    

complex calculations that have to go into making rates and


            3    

deciding what is a fair, just, reasonable,


            4    

nondiscriminatory rate of return in the ratemaking


            5    

context.  Especially something as complicated as this,


            6    

especially where you're trying to bring in new competition


            7    

in a regulated market, especially when you're giving in


            8    

exchange in part in the statute for allowing competitors


            9    

to come into the local telephone markets, giving the local


           10    

telephone companies, which up to that point had been


           11    

precluded from being in the long distance market and they


           12    

were being precluded from competing from other local


           13    

carriers, they were given access to those two markets in


           14    

exchange, when all of those complexities are taken into


           15    

consideration, Congress was not going to be -- able to


           16    

resolve all those things. 


           17              

So, what it did is it turned it over to an


           18    

expert agency which exists for the very purpose of solving


           19    

these problems, just like State commissions have the


           20

           21    

the FCC doing exactly what it should have done, listened


           22    

to the experts, listening to the competing concerns, and


           23    

the developed a methodology which is forward-looking,


           24    

which this Court -- Court has never rejected.

the very end of the Duquesne case, the Court suggested


            2    

that that may be an entirely appropriate methodology.  In

            4              

QUESTION:  Sure, depending on how it's applied. 


            5              

General Olson --


            6              

MR. OLSON:  Yes. 


            7              

QUESTION:  -- assume -- assume -- and I'm sure


            8    

you -- you don't agree with it, but assume that I -- that


            9    

I think this system has to not just be the spinning of a


           10    

wheel, but it has to contain in it some -- some assurance


           11    

that they'll get a fair rate of return on money that they


           12    

have invested, with the Government's assurance that they


           13    

get a fair rate of return.  Assuming that that's the case,


           14    

what is there in this -- in this methodology that enables


           15    

them to get a fair rate of return on their sunk capital?


           16              

MR. OLSON:  The problem, Justice --


           17              

QUESTION:  Just point to me the provision that


           18    

shows --


           19              

MR. OLSON:  The problem is --


           20              

QUESTION:  -- where that will be taken into


           21    

account --


           22              

MR. OLSON:  -- a fair --


           23              

QUESTION:  -- at all.  Is it ever anywhere taken


           24    

into account? 


           25              

MR. OLSON:  It is not taken into account what

their embedded costs are with respect to portions of their


            2    

network that may or may not have anything to do with the


            3    

provision of the service or the network element involved


            4    

here.  We're talking about loops.  We're talking about


            5    

telephone numbers.  We're talking about information used


            6    

for billing.  Whether or not those facilities or those


            7    

network elements have anything to do with an embedded cost


            8    

for a plant that was built 30 years ago for X billion


            9    

dollars is something that's not discernible at the time


           10    

the statute is written. 


           11              

QUESTION:  Well, you're saying some of the costs


           12    

shouldn't be counted.  Let's just take the costs that you


           13    

agree should be counted.  Let's just take the embedded


           14    

costs that do relate -- that do relate to these services.


           15              

MR. OLSON:  Well, I can't determine what those


           16    

are.  I don't know how the telephone companies have been


           17    

allocating those costs on their books.  I suspect that


           18    

they do not allocate those costs on an element-by-element


           19    

basis on their books with respect to this thing.  At the


           20    

end of the day --


           21              

QUESTION:  That's always been the case. 


           22              

MR. OLSON:  That has always been the case, and


           23    

that --


           24              

QUESTION:  It's always been the case with


           25    

ratemaking methodology.  So, you -- you can come up now

and say, it's always been so difficult.  We've done it


            2    

pretty badly.  So, we're going to solve the problem by


            3    

just forgetting about giving --


            4              

MR. OLSON:  No, Justice Scalia.  You said in


            5    

your concurring opinion in the Duquesne case, we look at


            6    

-- we look at consequences, not techniques.  The balance


            7    

of the Court said in that case, we look at the impact, not


            8    

at the methodology. 


            9              

We don't know what the consequences are yet.  We


           10    

don't know what the -- what the impact on the local


           11    

exchange --


           12              

QUESTION:  Now you're back to spinning a wheel. 


           13    

You -- you've departed from my -- from my hypothesis,


           14    

assuming that I don't believe that spinning a wheel is


           15    

okay.  What you're telling me is spinning a wheel is okay.


           16              

MR. OLSON:  No, I'm not saying that spinning a


           17    

wheel is okay.  What I'm saying is that neither the


           18    

Constitution nor the statute put prudent investment --


           19    

prudent investment rule in this ratemaking statute or the


           20    

statute that authorized ratemaking and --


           21              

QUESTION:  We refused to adopt that in Duquesne.


           22              

MR. OLSON:  Precisely.  In fact, that's why I


           23    

was going to say -- and put in a footnote, which I think


           24    

is extremely footnote -- footnote 10 said,


           25    

constitutionalizing the prudent investment rule would

            1    

foreclose a return to some form of the fair value rule,


            2    

just as its practical problems may be diminishing.  Now,


            3    

TELRIC is a version of the fair market rule. 


            4              

The emergent -- as the Court went on to say in


            5    

the Duquesne case, the emergent market for wholesale


            6    

electric energy could provide a readily available,


            7    

objective basis for determining the value of utility


            8    

assets.  In other words, the Court was foreseeing in a way


            9    

the same argument that we were having today.  That's why


           10    

the Court rejected constitutionalizing the prudent


           11    

investment rule, and that's why the Court signaled that


           12    

there were other methods that would be available,


           13    

including fair market methods that -- that might, in fact,


           14    

be very practical and functional.


           15              

This is a situation where I -- I -- and I want


           16    

to emphasize that we're dealing with a statute that didn't


           17    

require the prudent investment rule.  We're dealing with


           18    

decisions that go -- by this Court that go back 100 years


           19    

that have said, don't constitutionalize any particular


           20    

methodology. 


           21              

But that is precisely what the -- the local


           22    

exchange carriers are arguing for.  There are a number of


           23    

premises in their argument to you --


           24              

QUESTION:  To say that you don't


           25    

constitutionalize the prudent investment rule is not to

            1    

say that any methodology will go, even one that does not


            2    

enable somebody who has made investments under a


            3    

commitment from the Government to allow a fair return, to


            4    

recover that fair return.  I mean, the -- the two are not


            5    

-- are not mutually exclusive. 


            6              

MR. OLSON:  Well, that -- that's one of the


            7    

things that I was -- that Mr. Barr said that I think the


            8    

Court would take issue with.  And I think one of the


            9    

Justices in a question did.  I think it may have been you,


           10    

Justice Scalia.  They weren't required to spend the money. 


           11    

They were given an opportunity to invest in an industry,


           12    

in exchange for which they received a monopoly for a long


           13    

period of time. 


           14              

Now, the Congress of the United States has


           15    

decided that we have to have competition, it would be wise


           16    

to have competition in the local telephone market.  They


           17    

were never promised in any constitutional sense or any


           18    

contractual sense -- and they don't even allege that, and


           19    

Mr. Barr said he didn't allege that there was a contract


           20    

-- that they would recover every nickel of their


           21    

investments. 


           22              

In the Duquesne case, for example, the argument


           23    

was made these were reasonable and these were prudent


           24    

investments in nuclear facilities, and yet the State of


           25    

Pennsylvania developed a system that did not allow them to

            1    

recover those prudent investments unless they were


            2    

actually being used in the delivery of energy products. 


            3    

And the argument was made we have a promise or you have a


            4    

constitutional obligation or you have some sort of


            5    

requirement to allow us to recover those costs.  The State


            6    

of -- the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania said no.


            7              

QUESTION:  Well, what is the baseline standard


            8    

that the utilities are entitled to rely upon? 


            9              

MR. OLSON:  They're --


           10              

QUESTION:  It's not like telling GM to give away


           11    

Chevrolets.  We know -- we know that.  A utility is


           12    

different.  Why is it different and what is the baseline


           13    

constitutional standard that they are -- or fair


           14    

compensation standard that they are entitled to rely upon?


           15              

MR. OLSON:  The baseline constitutional


           16    

standard, at the end of the day, once you can look at the


           17    

results, is this a non-confiscatory result.  Is the lowest


           18    

-- this Court has said -- it's the Hope Natural Gas case,


           19    

a number of cases before that, a number of cases after


           20    

that.  It's in the Smyth case.  In -- in that the ultimate


           21    

outcome is a -- the lowest reasonable rate which is the


           22    

lowest non-confiscatory rate.  That is what they are


           23    

entitled to in the Constitution under the decisions of


           24    

this Court. 


           25              

Now, what the Court also --

            1              

QUESTION:  Why isn't it confiscatory to say that


            2    

we're going to make you use your capital plant, which


            3    

costs $140 billion, and we're going to allow you to


            4    

depreciate it as though it were only $70 billion?  Why


            5    

isn't that confiscatory? 


            6              

MR. OLSON:  Or the Court -- the Congress might


            7    

have said, with respect to a transportation company, you


            8    

had it -- you've had the taxi service all to yourself for


            9    

all these many years and now we're going to allow other --


           10    

some competition in there, and -- and you've got some


           11    

monopolistic facility, and we're going to let your


           12    

competitors use some piece of it.  Now, you're not going


           13    

to be -- and -- and we can determine what the value of


           14    

that is in a competitive market, and we're going to allow


           15    

you to recover some portion of the value. 


           16              

This Court has repeatedly said under the Fifth


           17    

Amendment, to the extent that that is applicable -- and I


           18    

believe it is fundamentally -- to the ratemaking cases and


           19    

the utility cases -- that it's a fair market value at the


           20    

time of the taking.  Mr. Barr says the taking occurs is --


           21    

when we were required to expend the money.  Now, that is


           22    

not when the taking occurs.  The taking occurs, if at all,


           23    

when they have to surrender some portion of their system


           24    

to allow someone else to use it.

            2    

know what, in your opinion, the FCC was driving at when it


            3    

chose this particular methodology.  What in your opinion


            4    

-- after all, they had four of five possibilities.  What


            5    

basic economic question were they trying to answer when


            6    

they chose this one as opposed to a different one?


            7              

MR. OLSON:  What they wanted to do with the --


            8    

they wanted to accomplish a number of goals, which are set


            9    

forth in the preface of the statute, which I alluded to


           10    

before, which is to reduce prices, to inspire


           11    

competition --


           12              

QUESTION:  I don't want -- I -- I would like a


           13    

little bit less generality than that, if -- if you can


           14    

give it to me.  What was their object?  What did they hope


           15    

that the rates set this way, rather than set, for example,


           16    

another way, would achieve? 


           17              

MR. OLSON:  Well, they -- they explained that


           18    

one of the important considerations -- and it's hard to


           19    

not deal in some generality --


           20              

QUESTION:  Yes. 


           21              

MR. OLSON:  -- this area does.  But one of the


           22    

important objectives that they hoped to achieve was to


           23    

develop a pricing methodology that would encourage new


           24    

entrants to come into the market and pay fees that would


           25    

allow them to enter the market at competitive rates and

encourage them to develop new technologies --


            2              

QUESTION:  All right.  If that's basically the


            3    

objective, to get them to enter when they should enter --


            4    

is that fair?  To get them enter when economically they


            5    

should enter, not when economically it'd be wasteful for


            6    

them to enter. 


            7              

MR. OLSON:  Yes, I think that's a fair premise.


            8              

QUESTION:  All right.  If that's a fair premise,


            9    

why wouldn't they choose a system that would give them the


           10    

following answer?  Price.  Look at the service that the


           11    

newcomer wants to buy from the incumbent.  Try to charge a


           12    

price so that it reflects the real resources that that


           13    

incumbent will have to spend -- him, not some hypothetical


           14    

person -- to provide that service.  Perfect answer because


           15    

if you can get it, then obviously if that number is higher


           16    

than it will cost the incumbent in real resources to


           17    

provide it, he'll build it himself.  And if it's lower,


           18    

he'll buy it.  The perfect economic answer.  Why would


           19    

they not try, at least, to answer that question? 


           20              

MR. OLSON:  Well, it seems to me that they did


           21    

try to answer that question, Justice Breyer. 


           22              

QUESTION:  Fine.  Okay.  Then you're right where


           23    

I think you --


           24              

MR. OLSON:  All right.  But as you pointed out


           25    

in your -- in your dissent, your partial dissent in the

other -- the other time this case was before this Court,


            2    

there are a variety of different methodologies that


            3    

various different economists look at and think that they


            4    

can accomplish those kind of objectives.  But this Court


            5    

has said that we leave that to the regulators to do, and


            6    

if at the end of the day, there's some level of


            7    

confiscation, then we can adjudicate that.


            8              

QUESTION:  I'm not worried about confiscation.


            9              

MR. OLSON:  All right.  Now --


           10              

QUESTION:  I'm worried about the following.  If


           11    

that's what they're trying to do, then how could it


           12    

possibly do that, to write an order that says the


           13    

depreciation rate and the rate of return that you are


           14    

going to charge is going to be based upon not what it will


           15    

cost you, but rather, what it will cost some hypothetical


           16    

firm that isn't there, let alone saying the same thing in


           17    

respect to telephone poles, in respect to wires, in


           18    

respect to efficiency of administration, in respect to a


           19    

22 percent discount for a competition that doesn't exist? 


           20    

In other words, how did it even come close to answering


           21    

that question to look not at the cost of this firm, but at


           22    

the cost of some hypothetical firm that by definition


           23    

doesn't exist? 


           24              

MR. OLSON:  Well, in the first place, we're not


           25    

talking about replicating an entire firm.  We're talking


62


ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

            1    

about replicating particular elements that are available


            2    

to the -- to the firms that wish to interconnect.  And the


            3    

FCC made it clear that we're not talking about -- we're


            4    

not talking about hypotheticals any more than the embedded


            5    

cost system would require allocating hypothetical portions


            6    

of something that happened 30 years ago to a rate for --


            7    

for a particular small portion of a product that may have


            8    

nothing to do with that. 


            9              

What the FCC's order does -- and it explains


           10    

this in relatively elaborate detail that it's talking


           11    

about a reasonably available, efficient product in the


           12    

marketplace that's comparable that can perform a service


           13    

that's equivalent to the -- the element that may have been


           14    

built 5 years ago and may be obsolete today or partially


           15    

obsolete today and may not be efficient.  Because if we


           16    

don't do it that way, we will encourage non-competition or


           17    

-- or prices that are inefficient based upon old services.


           18              

And this was actually addressed by Justice


           19    

Brandeis in the -- in the famous concurring opinion.  And


           20    

he says at the very end of his -- his opinion, he says


           21    

that -- that surely the cost of an equally efficient


           22    

substitute must be the maximum of the rate base if prudent


           23    

investment is to be rejected as a measure. 


           24              

Now, what the FCC did in this case, it made a


           25    

compromise.  It took the wire centers as they existed, and


63

            1    

they used the other elements based upon these reasonably


            2    

efficient, effective, available alternatives. 


            3              

Now, the FCC has been criticized.  Well, you're


            4    

-- you're theoretically inconsistent.  You should have


            5    

done it all this way or all that way.  The fact is that


            6    

this Court has said again and again that the ratemaker may


            7    

make compromises, may have to balance one benefit to the


            8    

incumbent with one benefit for the competitors. 


            9              

It may -- it doesn't have to be -- the Duquesne


           10    

case and I think the Hope case involved challenges of


           11    

methodological inconsistency, and the Court brushed right


           12    

past that properly because the ratemakers, to solve this


           13    

hopelessly complex problem, might have to pick something


           14    

from column A and column B. 


           15              

Now, at the end of the line, I want to make one


           16    

important point, that even after the State commissions get


           17    

finished with the process, the FCC included in its order a


           18    

provision -- it's paragraph 739 -- that specifically said


           19    

-- and this is page joint appendix 422.  This is after the


           20    

application of TELRIC and after reasonable depreciation


           21    

rates are set.  And they haven't been -- so they have been


           22    

set in some places, and they haven't been set in others. 


           23    

And there have been takings -- cases brought by the -- the


           24    

incumbent carriers.  No court, as far as I know, has


           25    

upheld a taking yet.  And costs of capital.  There's lots

            1    

of flexibility. 


            2              

At the end of the day, paragraph 739 says,


            3    

incumbent local exchange carriers may seek relief from the


            4    

commission's pricing methodology if they provide specific


            5    

information to show that the pricing methodology, as


            6    

applied to them, will result in confiscatory rates. 


            7              

So, TELRIC and the FCC's regulation provided


            8    

lots of opportunities to get to the end of the day the


            9    

right result in a manner that achieved these various


           10    

conflicting goals of Congress.  It did it in a way which


           11    

might not be the best way, although it looks to me like a


           12    

very conscientious effort to import competition, bring


           13    

down prices, and to promote technology. 


           14              

But at the end of the day, after the commissions


           15    

do their job, the expertise that you were talking about in


           16    

your dissenting opinion -- at the end of the day the


           17    

incumbent commission -- exchange carriers can come to


           18    

court and say it was confiscatory, and they have a remedy. 


           19    

Or before that, they may go to the FCC and they have an


           20    

opportunity to present their case to the FCC. 


           21              

This, it strikes me, is the way it should be


           22    

done.  It may not be perfect.  But in this ratemaking


           23    

area, this is the way it should be done.  The expertise


           24    

was given to the agency that has the expertise, and they


           25    

were given an opportunity to fulfill the goals of Congress

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. VERRILLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


            9    

please the Court:


           10              

I'd like to begin by trying to answer Justice


           11    

Breyer's question as to why TELRIC was a sensible policy


           12    

choice by the FCC, and in so doing, I hope also to be able


           13    

to address Justice Kennedy's concern about whether TELRIC


           14    

underestimates the cost that a company will face going


           15    

forward.  And then if I -- if I can, I'd like to turn to


           16    

Justice Scalia's question about whether TELRIC offers a


           17    

fair opportunity to recover embedded costs. 


           18              

Paragraph 679 of the local competition order is


           19    

where the FCC spells out in detail what its rationales


           20    

were.  And what the FCC said in paragraph 679 is that it


           21    

wanted to adopt TELRIC to send -- to send the right


           22    

signals to new entrants about when to buy and when to


           23    

build and to prevent anti-competitive behavior by the


           24    

incumbent with respect to the pricing of network elements. 


           25    

And that's critical from our perspective.

            1              

As a retail matter, the incumbents have every


            2    

right, under the State law and Federal antitrust laws, to


            3    

price their retail offerings in these new competitive


            4    

markets at their long-run incremental costs.  That's what


            5    

the State laws say.  That's what the antitrust laws say. 


            6    

And therefore, if they could charge us the historical


            7    

costs for these key inputs -- the historical costs for key


            8    

inputs, when they can charge retail based on their long-


            9    

run incremental costs, we could never compete using --


           10              

QUESTION:  My question is, by the way, blank


           11    

slate.  I wasn't doubting that they could charge forward-


           12    

looking costs.  I was doubting -- I find it difficult to


           13    

reconcile what the State -- and I think this for me is the


           14    

issue.  I mean, in 679, they have a correct statement of


           15    

the goal, and -- and then all these criticisms, which


           16    

you're well aware of, suggest that by choosing blank


           17    

slate, rather than this company's, this incumbent


           18    

company's long-run incremental costs, they've departed so


           19    

far that -- give them all the expertise you want -- it's


           20    

still awfully hard to uphold them.  I mean, that's


           21    

basically the argument.  And if you're going to --


           22              

MR. VERRILLI:  Yes, thank you.  And -- and


           23    

that's just not right.  And their own experts, Professor


           24    

Kahn, in particular -- and this is at page 155 of the


           25    

joint appendix -- concedes that that's not right, that if

            1    

you set the depreciation and cost of capital appropriately


            2    

to reflect the risks of -- existing in the TELRIC world,


            3    

then TELRIC will provide the full compensation.  Now,


            4    

Professor Kahn concedes that.  I believe Mr. Barr


            5    

acknowledged that at the beginning of his argument.  It


            6    

all comes down to what those depreciation rates and costs


            7    

of capital are.


            8              

And what the FCC said very clearly is that the


            9    

States set depreciation rates.  That's in paragraph 29. 


           10    

The regulation itself says that they must be economic


           11    

depreciation.  That means they must account for the full


           12    

loss in value as a result of technological change. 


           13              

And in paragraph 702 of the order, the FCC said


           14    

we expect States to set depreciation rates that take this


           15    

into account, that take this risk into account.


           16              

QUESTION:  But my question -- I don't want to


           17    

distract you because others had a different question --


           18    

had nothing to do with confiscation.  My question was


           19    

based -- I'm leaving that totally to the side.  Phrase,


           20    

wildly incorrect set of economic signals to achieve the


           21    

739 goals, for the reasons that you've heard and are


           22    

listed in the briefs. 


           23              

MR. VERRILLI:  But if depreciation and cost of


           24    

capital are set right, it won't do that, Justice Breyer,


           25    

and I believe that is what Professor Kahn conceded, their

expert. 


            2              

And that is why, Justice Kennedy, the rate going


            3    

forward, the TELRIC rate going forward, will not


            4    

necessarily be lower than the cost that the incumbents


            5    

incurred going forward, because a rate, after all, is a


            6    

product of three things:  the cost structure, the


            7    

depreciation rate -- in other words, how few years you


            8    

recover it -- and the cost of capital -- in other words,


            9    

what the risk adjustment is.  So, it could well be that


           10    

the rates would be the same or higher depending on how


           11    

depreciation and cost of capital are set. 


           12              

QUESTION:  You're -- you're not asserting that


           13    

the States can -- can kick up the cost of capital rate on


           14    

the basis of -- of the fact that the utility is not -- is


           15    

not getting depreciation on its sunk costs. 


           16              

MR. VERRILLI:  It -- the -- the -- separate two


           17    

questions out.  I think there's two -- two points to be


           18    

made in there, Justice Scalia. 


           19              

With respect to what -- what the cost of capital


           20    

ought to be set at, under the regs and under the FCC's


           21    

order, is to reflect the risks of operating in the system.


           22              

QUESTION:  Right. 


           23              

MR. VERRILLI:  So, I think it does do what Mr.


           24    

Barr claims it doesn't do.  I think it very clearly does


           25    

do that.

Now, with respect to their sunk or embedded


            2    

costs, I think it's a different question because the issue


            3    

here is whether the TELRIC in operation will produce rates


            4    

and returns, then in operation don't cover the -- the


            5    

undepreciated costs still on their books.  And the FCC


            6    

made a specific finding -- that ultimately, Justice


            7    

Scalia, is a much more empirical than a methodological


            8    

question.  It is possible, as a matter of logic and


            9    

methodology, for TELRIC to do so, depending on how the


           10    

inputs are set.  And therefore, it is an empirical


           11    

question whether it will, in fact, do so. 


           12              

The FCC in the notice of proposed rulemaking in


           13    

this case specifically asked the incumbents for evidence


           14    

as to what that gap would be.  The incumbents produced


           15    

nothing.  Nothing.  The FCC made a finding in paragraph


           16    

707 of the order that there was no evidence in the record


           17    

to support the proposition that the adoption of TELRIC


           18    

would result in significant stranded costs. 


           19              

But the FCC did more than that.  It extended an


           20    

invitation to the incumbents to come back with proof that


           21    

there would, indeed, be significant stranded costs.  That


           22    

invitation has been outstanding for 5 years now.  The


           23    

incumbents have come back with nothing. 


           24              

But that's not all.  The way this statute


           25    

operates is the FCC produced a methodology, which is then

            1    

applied in the States, in the States according to these


            2    

rules, setting depreciation rates, setting costs of


            3    

capital.  Every State in the Union has had a proceeding of


            4    

that kind.  This statute in section 252(b)(6) makes those


            5    

proceedings reviewable in Federal district court.


            6    

Therefore, in every State in the Union, the incumbents


            7    

have had the opportunity to demonstrate that in


            8    

application TELRIC will produce rates that don't recover


            9    

significant amounts of stranded cost. 


           10              

They have not succeeded anywhere in the country. 


           11    

Indeed, in the vast majority of States, they haven't even


           12    

tried.  And the reason is because there isn't a big gap. 


           13              

QUESTION:  If -- if that -- assuming that, his


           14    

-- Mr. Barr's argument, I take it, was that paragraph 702


           15    

put -- read in any disclaimers you want, and they have


           16    

loads of them.  But it says the starting point is existing


           17    

depreciation rates and capital rates, and that couldn't be


           18    

right.  And in addition, it strongly suggests if it


           19    

doesn't state -- and it does state -- that you change


           20    

those in respect to new competition coming in while the


           21    

correct statement would be change it from the beginning


           22    

because whether new competition comes in or not is beside


           23    

the point.  You're setting in TELRIC the imaginary rate


           24    

that would be set by new competition, and therefore,


           25    

obviously you can't have existing depreciation rates.  I

mean, I take it I may not have paraphrased it correctly,


            2    

but I think that's basically his point. 


            3              

MR. VERRILLI:  No, I think it's right.  That is


            4    

his argument.  But it's not what paragraph 702 says and


            5    

it's not what happened in operation.  The States have set


            6    

depreciation rates that are downward departures. 


            7    

California, for example, cut the switching depreciation


            8    

rates in half.  So, it's just not the case that that's


            9    

what's happened out there in the real world. 


           10              

And there are dozens of -- there have been


           11    

dozens of opportunities for this case to be proven on the


           12    

basis of a real rate in Federal district court.  And there


           13    

-- as I said, in the few cases where it has even been


           14    

attempted, it has been rejected, and most of the time it


           15    

hasn't even been tried.


           16              

And if -- let me try to get back, if I could, to


           17    

that 340/180 comparison that's in the briefs and we've had


           18    

some discussion about.  Here's why TELRIC doesn't produce


           19    

the kinds of results that -- that example suggests.  It's


           20    

because the 340 is way, way too high.  The 340 is


           21    

everything in the entire network and the entire corporate


           22    

superstructure that goes with it.  And that is not all


           23    

devoted to the production of local telephone service. 


           24    

It's -- there are -- tens of billions of dollars of that


           25    

are devoted to creating capacity for long distance

            1    

service.  Billions and billions of dollars additionally


            2    

are devoted to capacity for video service, for CENTREX


            3    

service, for other services that wouldn't be reflected in


            4    

TELRIC rates. 


            5              

There are just -- you'd have this huge


            6    

allocation problem if you take this.  And this I think


            7    

shows why TELRIC is the practical answer here as well as


            8    

the fair one.  You would have a massive allocation problem


            9    

if you took that 340 because, first of all, you'd have to


           10    

figure out how many tens and tens of billions of dollars


           11    

got taken out for all these services that have nothing to


           12    

do with providing local telephone service. 


           13              

Then of the $45 billion in that 342 that's


           14    

devoted to corporate overhead, you would need to figure


           15    

out how much of that is appropriately devoted to -- to the


           16    

local telephone service.


           17              

QUESTION:  And that used to be done all the


           18    

time, of course, to decide between local and -- and long


           19    

distance phone rates.  Right? 


           20              

MR. VERRILLI:  Well, no, but there's a --


           21              

QUESTION:  I mean, it's not as though --


           22              

MR. VERRILLI:  I'm sorry, Justice Scalia. 


           23              

QUESTION:  It is not as though we didn't --


           24    

haven't been pretending to do that for years and years. 


           25              

MR. VERRILLI:  But -- but, Justice Scalia, a

            1    

significant amount of that goes to retail which can't be


            2    

allocated here.  And then when you get done with all that,


            3    

then you've got to take out the billions of dollars in


            4    

phantom assets that the FCC's most recent audit of their


            5    

books identified.  And then when you get done with that,


            6    

then you've got to decide how much of that was actually


            7    

prudently incurred.  And when you get done with that very


            8    

long process, that number is going to come way, way down.


            9              

Now, on the other side, the 180 is too low.  And


           10    

the FCC specifically said it was too low and warned


           11    

against using it for exactly the comparison that Mr. Barr


           12    

used it for because it's designed to calculate universal


           13    

service subsidies at the very most basic low level.  So,


           14    

that comparison just doesn't hold up.  And so, the


           15    

undepreciated part of the comparison, Justice Breyer,


           16    

doesn't hold up either because the number is not going to


           17    

be -- the undepreciated number of everything is $140


           18    

billion-$150 billion.  But the undepreciated part of what


           19    

they entitled to recovery under TELRIC is going to be a


           20    

much smaller number than that number because you'd have to


           21    

take out everything I just described.  So, it just doesn't


           22    

wash. 


           23              

There may be some difference with respect to


           24    

some of the elements.  Switching costs have come down.  Of


           25    

course, loop costs have not come down, and the loop costs

            1    

are 48 percent, according to the FCC in this order, of the


            2    

overall cost of providing service.  And those have been


            3    

stable over time. 


            4              

So, the fact is you just don't have a huge


            5    

problem.  You don't have a big gap.  And that's why,


            6    

Justice Scalia, when you adopt one methodology, when you


            7    

adopt this methodology here, given the fact that it is an


            8    

empirical matter, there's no reason to think there's a


            9    

huge gap.  There's no reason to think that the outcome


           10    

will necessarily preclude them the opportunity of earning


           11    

a fair return. 


           12              

And that's why I think this case is an easier


           13    

one than Duquesne because at least in Duquesne, you knew


           14    

how much wasn't going to be recovered as a result of the


           15    

switch in methodology.  Here, you don't know how much


           16    

isn't going to be recovered, but what you do know, based


           17    

on the facts that I've just conveyed to the Court, is that


           18    

it's not going to be a very big number, even if you assume


           19    

that all elements are leased. 


           20              

And of course, as Justice Ginsburg's question


           21    

pointed out, only 3 percent -- it's not 6 percent.  The


           22    

FCC's most recent figures are 3 percent -- 3 percent -- of


           23    

the local network is being leased. 


           24              

Which leads me to a practical point here, that


           25    

if the world were the way the incumbents were describing

it, it would be a very different place in fact than it is.


            2    

We would be making all the money.  They would be in


            3    

trouble.  The reality is --


            4              

(Laughter.) 


            5              

MR. VERRILLI:  -- they are making all the money


            6    

and we are in trouble. 


            7              

And the reason for that -- and -- and, indeed,


            8    

they would be derelict in their responsibilities to their


            9    

shareholders if they weren't taking advantage of this


           10    

gigantic regulatory arbitrage opportunity to go into each


           11    

other's local markets and take away all the customers. 


           12    

But they're not doing that.  The reason they're not doing


           13    

that is because the opportunity doesn't exist.  This --


           14    

the thing that's a fantasy, the thing that's hypothetical


           15    

in this case is the claims they are making about what this


           16    

system is and the way it works.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. BARR


           21            

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 00-511


           22              

MR. BARR:  The Constitution doesn't dictate a


           23    

methodology, but what it does say is that whatever


           24    

methodology is selected, it ultimately has to be judged by


           25    

this Court as to whether it provides us a fair opportunity

            1    

to recover our costs.  And therefore, if it creates a


            2    

methodological risk, it has to compensate us for a


            3    

methodological risk. 


            4              

We did show rates.  And the Government's


            5    

position here is because this is a bifurcated proceeding,


            6    

we have challenged rates.  The Government has taken the


            7    

position -- the Fourth Circuit has held -- we cannot


            8    

challenge a methodology.  We can only challenge whether


            9    

the rate conforms to the Federal methodology. 


           10              

This is the only place we can get review of the


           11    

underlying problem, which is the methodology.  This is an


           12    

Ashwander case, and the Government itself in paragraph 705


           13    

says that our interpretation of based on the cost of


           14    

providing is permissible.  What we're saying is the


           15    

statute dictates the methodology here and avoids the


           16    

constitutional problem.


           17              

But even if you didn't find that, this rate --


           18    

this methodology does create a methodological risk, and we


           19    

have shown that we're not compensated for it.  We have


           20    

shown rates in our -- in our -- in the record that halve


           21    

our recovery, halve our revenue.  That is the typical


           22    

instance. 


           23              

They've had 5 years to show one State -- and,


           24    

you know, it doesn't matter if there's one State.  The


           25    

question is what's the risk of any State that comes close

to allowing us to recover our prudent investment.  And you


            2    

can look through the record and you can't find one.  We

classic.  Our loop rate -- our cost is $33.
