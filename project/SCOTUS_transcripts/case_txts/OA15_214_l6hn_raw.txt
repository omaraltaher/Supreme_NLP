CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

  

 

 

 

 

argument first this morning in case 15-214, Murr v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wisconsin. 

            

Mr. Groen. 

 

             

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. GROEN 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The fundamental unfairness in this case is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illustrated by one fact:  If anyone else in the world, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other than the Murr siblings, owned Lot E, that owner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could sell or develop it.  But the Murrs cannot. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Groen, may I ask --

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let me ask you this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question.  It's a hypothetical.  It's not this case. 

   

  

  

 

 

 

Suppose that three years from now lots such as these two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lots in the same ownership become immensely more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valuable than the two lots singly.  Each lot singly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be worth a hundred thousand, but these lots where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can build a bigger home are worth $500,000. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The county wants a fire -- fire station and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it takes Lot E.  What do they pay for it under your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory? 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  They should pay for --

  

 

 

 

 

 

compensation for the taking of Lot E.  Any taking --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Which is $100,000.  So 

  

  

 

 

 

under your hypothetical, property owners stand to lose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

$300,000 under my hypothetical and your answer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  No, I don't think so.  Under the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

hypothetical --

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The hypothetical is 

  

 

 

 

together, they are worth 500,000; singly, they're worth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a hundred thousand each. 

 

 

 

            

What is the amount that the -- the county 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to pay to take Lot E for the fire station? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  The analysis must begin with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

defining the relevant parcel that's the subject of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case analysis. 

 

            

Lot E only. 

   

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And in your view, that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  That's right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And they pay $100,000 

  

 

 

 

 

only.  That's it. 

  

 

            

MR. GROEN:  The land owner would have the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden of proving that there are additional damages that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they should be compensated for.  But the presumption --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You indicated there's no 

  

 

 

 

 

severance damages.  You're taking the entire parcel.

MR. GROEN:  You're taking all of Lot E, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they should be paid compensation for Lot E. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's right. 

  

 

 

MR. GROEN:  Whether that compensation is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's $100,000 that go 

  

 

 

 

 

under your theory, land owners in the hypothetical that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I put up would lose money and the State would be --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be getting the windfall. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  If that hypothetical does not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

include any integrated economic use between those two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parcels; that is correct.  The compensation is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

determined by the lot that is taken. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the integrated -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

integrated use is determined by the market.  Your --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your theory completely ignores market factors. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  And that is exactly what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

government would argue is that the compensation must be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited to the parcel that is taken.  And in eminent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domain law, which is the -- the hypothetical that you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providing, in eminent domain law, the presumption is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly that:  Compensation is limited to the parcel 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken, unless that presumption can be overcome by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

landowner proving that the two parcels are actually --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes, there's a unity of use between the two --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why isn't the value --

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

then why isn't that true here?  Then why doesn't that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

defeat your theory here? 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  It supports the theory.  It's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the exact same principle, only in reverse.  Rather than 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government limiting compensation to just the parcel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken, here the government is saying we want to combine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the values of the two in order to find there's no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking.  But in both scenarios, you have to begin with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the presumption of determining what is the relevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parcel that is subject to that analysis.  In both 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scenarios, either eminent domain or inverse 

 

 

 

 

 

condemnation, you have to begin --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Groen --

  

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  -- with a single parcel. 

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- can I ask just a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

clarifying question about your argument?  One of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

things that makes this case odd is that there are family 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members all around.  Both sellers are the same family 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the buyers are the -- but if I'm right, your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument would extend in the exact same way to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation where you have two sellers who are completely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent of each other.  Mr. Jones and Ms. Smith have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing to do with each other.  Another buyer comes in, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also has no relationship with Mr. Jones or Ms. Smith, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that buyer would be able to make the exact same

7 

            

            

Am I right about your argument? 

   

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  Well, I'm not sure which parcel 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your -- your hypothetical is talking about. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You have --

  

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  But -- but -- but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- two preexisting 

  

 

 

 

substandard parcels.  Somebody comes in, buys both, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all the parties are independent of each other. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GROEN:  Each parcel.  Right --

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And now the person who has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

bought these two standard -- substandard lots wants to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

build on them, and your argument would be the exact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same. 

            

MR. GROEN:  That -- that's right.  They're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

each independent, discrete, and separate parcels.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the grandfather clause that is attached with this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

land-use ordinance would protect the development and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sale rights of each parcel independently. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So where does 

  

 

 

 

regulatory -- a State's regulatory power come in? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

This -- Justice Kagan put in a hypothetical to --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to this one owner owns two parcels or two different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people own two parcels, and they sell it to your one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owner.  And the one owner knows the regulation says if

you have two contiguous land pieces, you can only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

develop on one, if they're both below an acre or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever the rule is.  Your rule would just do away with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your expectations as a buyer. 

   

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  Well, no.  The -- in that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

situation, the fact that someone might know that there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- there are regulations on properties does not change 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the time of the taking.  The taking occurs in 1975 when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the regulations redefined the property rights, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redefinition of the property rights does not insulate --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the parents -- it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

may have been a taking for the parents, but they never 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charged it.  The children when they took were subject to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the regulation, and they knew it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GROEN:  And --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They could have said, 

  

 

 

 

 

no, I don't want two contiguous ones, Dad and Mom.  I'll 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go buy the next-door lot from someone else. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  And this Court in Palazzolo v. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rhode Island ruled that the notice that the Murr 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children may have had -- they actually didn't know, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's assume that they did know --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They should have known. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  Let's assume that.  Let's assume 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that beyond should have; they actually knew.

Palazzolo stands for the proposition that 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- that the -- the subsequent heir or a buyer does 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not lose a takings claim.  The State is not --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that's a very --

   

  

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  -- absolved of liability. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's a very different 

   

  

 

 

situation.  In Palazzolo, all we said was that if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seller has a takings claim, it's not extinguished just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the property is transferred; that the buyer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could have the exact same takings claim.  But the Murr 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children are not asking for the -- for the -- they do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not have the same takings claim as the Murr parents did; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't that right? 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  No, I think that's not right. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

They have the exact same takings claim because we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about Parcel E.  And the rights that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parents could --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The parents could develop on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Parcel E; the children can't. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  The parents, if they had put it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in their own common ownership, which they did for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period of time.  Subsequent to 1975, there is a takings 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim there.  It's the rights inherent in the property. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And in each of these -- in -- in all of these scenarios, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to go back to define --

this again. 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The parents -- let me try 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

For the parents, the two properties were two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

properties.  It's only when the property becomes one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

property that this takings claim arises. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  The takings claim arises because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of the restrictions imposed by the government, not by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change in ownership or anything like that.  The change 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in ownership does not change the nature of the property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest.  That's the key part of Palazzolo, that if you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take away the -- the takings claim or redefine property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests, you're actually changing or altering the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nature of property.  And -- and that's where we come 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back not to a takings analysis, but to defining the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant unit of property to apply the takings analysis. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the --

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The -- I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Please, follow up. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The -- the -- the regulation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, the only thing that it affected for the Murr 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parents and for the plumbing company was their ability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to sell to a buyer who wanted to combine these two lots. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That was the only thing that was affected; isn't that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?

MR. GROEN:  Well, the parents didn't seek to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

combine these two lots or to sell to someone who wanted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

to combine the two lots.  The parents owned both 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parcels.  They had one in the plumbing company name. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They eventually put that in their own names as well in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1982, after the 1975 restrictions were in place.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't merge the parcels.  There's -- there hasn't been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a merger here.  Merger is simply a term that describes 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what happened, and that is, that the use restrictions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preclude the independent sale or development of Lot E. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That is the gravamen of the takings complaint. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And we're told these 

  

 

 

 

 

merger rules have a long history.  Many States have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

them.  So why isn't that background State law that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would -- would apply? 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  There -- there are lots of -- of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

land-use regulations of all types, including merger 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions.  We do not have a background provision here, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

a background principle because you can't have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

background principle that applies to one person, but not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to another.  If someone else owned Lot E, they can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

develop it.  So it's not a background principle to say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that this only applies to the Murrs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Same thing in the neighborhood.  This is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

St. Croix Cove subdivision.  There's over 40 developed

residential lots here.  There's nothing about building a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

home on this property that rises to the level of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

nuisance or something that takes the right to use the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property out of the title that -- that is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property --

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your answer to Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg is that all of those other State regulations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are also invalid. 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  No.  Those regulations are fine, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

whatever they may be, and they come in all -- all types 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of forms.  The question here is what unit of property do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we utilize for determining the takings analysis? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I -- I --

    

   

 

 

MR. GROEN:  Once you determine that, then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you determine, okay, under that merger law or whatever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

land-use ordinance, does it reach a level of magnitude 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of interference that there is a taking?  And those would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to be -- be analyzed on the merits of their own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought your 

    

 

 

 

argument was that under State law, the properties were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not formally merged, that the merger was only, I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the Court put it, an effective merger. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  That's exactly right.  There --

  

  

 

 

 

 

there has been no formal merger.  These remain separate

legal lots today.  This -- this term "merger" has been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

used very loosely, and all it really means is that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Murrs' right to independently use and develop Lot E has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been destroyed. 

 

            

exactly --

 

            

it away. 

 

            

            

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do we know -- do we know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  They could actually still give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

Do we know exactly how Wisconsin and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

county define "common ownership"?  For example, if one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot is owned by an individual in that person's own name, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then the adjacent lot is owned by a wholly-owned 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporation or LLC, is that considered to be common 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ownership?  Or if one lot is owned by, let's say, four 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

siblings and the other one is owned by only three of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

siblings, would that be common ownership? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  Under the way Wisconsin has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

applied common ownership, as long as they are not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

informally the same name -- so here William and Dorothy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Murr, they fully owned their plumbing company, and so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they were technically in -- in different ownership and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was enough to be in separate --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would it be enough if --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  So --

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

14 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- the husband owned one, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

wife owned the other?  That's different?  They're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

separate? 

            

MR. GROEN:  The way Wisconsin has been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

applying it, it would -- it would encourage that kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manipulation and --

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What is the --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  -- and bring in the incentives. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I've not got beyond 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Holmes.  Holmes says that a regulatory taking violates 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the Constitution unless it's compensated when it goes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too far. 

 

            

            

MR. GROEN:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, what you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

want us to do is to put some pretty clear lines in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word "too far." 

 

 

            

            

MR. GROEN:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  My problem is, I can't 

   

  

 

 

 

think of just what those lines should be, that -- that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps, there are many different circumstances in many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different factors. 

 

            

For example, in your case, I imagined that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

what the State was concerned about is they want to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preserve a lake.  At the same time, people own some 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

property around that lake and they used to be able to

build houses.  So here's what they say.  You can build 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one.  One.  And it doesn't matter if you have six lap 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

parcels not together or -- one.  One is what you can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

build because, after all, this Constitution is concerned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about, to paraphrase Justice Warren, protecting people, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not rocks. 

 

            

And so we look at the people and say, how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does this affect them.  And in this case, you have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, but there's some factors against you, and the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal Circuit and other opinions of ours have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

avoided drawing clear lines. 

 

 

 

            

And you see where I'm going.  And I just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

want your general response. 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  Yes.  This case does not address 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the merits of whether there's a taking.  This case first 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to deal with the threshold question of what is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant unit of property --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's what I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

objecting to. 

 

            

            

MR. GROEN:  -- and is it one parcel --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, see that's -- now 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you're not getting my question. 

 

 

 

 

            

Because my question is:  Why look for that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Is it relevant?  Yes.  Is it determinative?  No.  If we 

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

start making determinative rules, developers will take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

500 acres.  They'll break them down into 500 different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

properties, State perhaps aiding in this, 500 different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ones; three of them will be just wetlands, and they'll

reaction. 

            

MR. GROEN:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I want your general 

    

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  Well, the general reaction is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you must begin with the approved legal lots of record 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that have actually been approved and that have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attained -- because they are legal lots of record, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have rights that's in dispute.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Groen, one of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  That's what Roth is all about. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  One of the oddities of your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

position is that you seem to be taking half of State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  In other words, you're saying well, there are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these -- there are these lot lines, and everything has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to depend on the lot lines because they've been legally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approved.  But there have been other things in this case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that have been legally approved too, and one of them is

this merger provision.  And you seem to be saying: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

Well, we look to State law for the lot lines, but then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we ignore State law for the question of when lots are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merged. 

            

And why should we do that?  If we're looking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to State law, let's look to State law, the whole ball of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wax.  In other words, saying:  Well, when I buy those 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

two lots, they're really not two lots anymore. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

According to State law, they are one lot. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  In defining property interests, 

  

 

 

 

 

Roth and this Court in Lucas note 7 both recognized that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you look to the State law, not to the whole body of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State law, you look to the State law that governs the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creation that's the legal recognition of lots and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection of the property interest. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I -- I think that 

   

   

  

 

 

you're right, Mr. Groen.  It's like the legal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognition of property.  But the legal recognition of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

property has something to do with lot lines, and it also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has something to do with when lots are merged, when two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lots are merged into one.  And why would we ignore that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of merger? 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  There's two reasons.  One, they 

  

  

 

 

 

 

have not been merged.  That -- and that's the point we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were discussing earlier.  They have not been formally

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why? 

  

 

MR. GROEN:  And that has not happened. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because if the Court --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  Because if -- if they remain --

don't have to eliminate lot lines.  All we have to do is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to say the -- the lot lines don't have legal effect for

MR. GROEN:  And it's only for the limited 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes of precluding sale or development. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But more than that, your question comes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right back.  It circles right back to Palazzolo, where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you really have to define property interests by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights that are already in place that secure benefits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's what Roth stands for.  That's what Lucas footnote 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 stands for.  And Palazzolo points out the principle 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you cannot then go forward and say:  Oh, well, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State has redefined this --

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, again, I think --

   

  

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  -- so now you --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- Palazzolo depends on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

buyers having the exact same takings claim as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sellers, which it seems to me does not exist in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

But let me ask you a different -- a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

different way around the question, which is, whether you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think reasonable expectations matter at all in your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

framework? 

            

MR. GROEN:  The reasonable expectations that 

  

 

 

 

 

were addressed in Lucas footnote 7 are the expectations 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that grow out of the traditional understandings of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property law.  People understand when they buy a lot in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a subdivision that they are buying a -- a -- a lot that 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

has a right of use, that -- that has a deed, that has 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

geographic boundaries, and that's --

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay. 

  

 

MR. GROEN:  -- what they are relying upon. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But here, if I'm buying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

property in this area, I also know that there are these 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules about when you can develop on substandard lots and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how it is that contiguous lots are understood for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes of that development potential.  So why aren't I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

buying subject to those preexisting regulations?  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

other words, this is not a regulation that just happened 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to me when I was an owner.  I'm buying subject to -- and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

20 

property is a bundle of sticks; we know that, right, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first year of law school.  And I'm buying, you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain metes and bounds, but I'm also buying into a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain set of things about what I can and can't do on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the property.  So why isn't that perfectly consistent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with my reasonable expectations?  I'm supposed to know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the zoning regulations, and when I buy a house, when I 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

buy a piece of land, I'm buying subject to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preexisting zoning regulations. 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  I understand the use of 

    

 

 

 

 

reasonable expectations under the Penn Central for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determining whether there is a taking.  But here, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

we're -- we have to first determine what unit of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property is it.  Is it Lot E, or is it Lot E and F 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

combined?  And in that situation you have to look at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creation of the property.  Property is property.  And it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't change --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But what about -- I -- of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

course, property is property.  But we are still dealing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with a provision of the Constitution that, in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulatory area, is designed to prevent takings that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hurt somebody unreasonably.  It goes too far. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

So why isn't what you want to look at one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more thing to look at?  But we might look at others too. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We might look, for example, at whether the individual

who bought that property at the time he bought it knew 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about this restriction.  We might look at how, overall, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

he has hurt in any related way.  We might look, for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, at the kind of need that was there, and we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might see two big questions. 

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, one big question is -- though it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

awfully general -- is, is he being treated unfairly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either because we're forcing on him the whole cost or a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot of the cost of something that benefits many, many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

others, or because we are interfering with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investment-backed expectations. 

 

              

I mean, as you read the cases it seems to me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are a set of factors like that.  And my problem 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with your argument is it wants to take one and then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply a kind of mechanical test. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  No.  It keeps coming back to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

you -- the -- the task is to first define the unit of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property.  The Murrs -- the Murr parents have two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate distinct lots.  Each is -- is a -- is a lawful 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal building site, and if owned by anyone else, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remains a lawful legal building site. 

   

 

 

 

            

Under the restriction enacted in 1975, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went from two building sites to one building site. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  May I --

   

  

 

MR. GROEN:  That is what has been lost. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  May I ask a question?  I 

   

   

  

  

 

22 

do think, as I'm reading all of the briefs in this case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the issue is how much weight should we be giving to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State boundary lines, the State property lines. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You say as a denominator on the takings 

   

 

 

 

 

 

claim, there -- it's fixed.  You used the word 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"presumption" in your brief, but you haven't explained 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to me what overcomes the State boundary line -- property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lines, so I don't think the word "presumption" has any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning in your brief. 

 

 

 

            

Others, like St. Croix and -- and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government, and embedded in Justice Breyer's question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinks the denominator should be a more nuanced 

   

 

 

 

 

 

calculation, although St. Croix, Wisconsin, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solicitor General seem to have a different weight to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

So let's start with, is yours a fixed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

presumption?  Does anything ever overcome it? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GROEN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or is it, under every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance, the denominator? 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  In -- in -- you must begin with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the presumption of identifying the single parcel.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

nobody, as you point out --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What over --

  

 

 

 

23 

MR. GROEN:  -- no -- no parties --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- comes that? 

  

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  -- and so that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What overcomes that? 

  

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  -- presumption is overcome if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you have facts that are sufficient to show in fairness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and justice that the individual should bear the burden. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And an example, we can draw straight out of eminent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domain law.  If you have a hotel owned by a person and 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they own the parking lot next door, there are two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate parcels, and the government is going to condemn 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the parking lot.  The parking lot is used with the hotel 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as an integrated economic unit.  The presumption in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

eminent domain law is the same principle here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Government is taking only the parking lot, and they will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argue we will only pay for the parking lot. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The burden then shifts to the property owner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to prove that the parking lot is an integrated part of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the operation of the hotel. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what's the difference 

  

 

 

 

 

between that and the factors that the other parties are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using that says look at how the property's been used 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over time. 

 

            

Here, the family has a house on one parcel, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

a volleyball court and a barbecue storage area on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

another.  They use the other parcel -- house on one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side, the other parcel has access to the beach.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

house has not had an economic value to the children.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was there.  They're using it. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what's the 

  

 

 

 

difference --

 

            

MR. GROEN:  I think you have a --

    

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- in terms of --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  -- an inaccurate visual 

  

 

 

 

 

understanding of what the parcel is.  Lot E, and this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went up on summary judgment, is a vacant parcel. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's nothing on Lot E.  It is its own independent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parcel.  The Murrs will sometimes walk across it or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe play volleyball on it, but it is not an integrated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

economic unit as in the hotel parking lot and the hotel. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In that situation, you can overcome the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption, and that landowner in that situation will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argue that they should be paid compensation --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So why isn't an integrated 

  

 

 

 

 

 

unit because they had a barbecue?  In other words, your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical --

 

            

MR. GROEN:  They don't have a barbecue.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Volley -- volleyball. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Volleyball court. 

  

 

 

Under your hypothetical, if the hotel was on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lot F and the parking lot was Lot E, what would be the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fair value if the State took Lot E for a firehouse? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GROEN:  The --

  

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Figure out the fair value? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Don't you figure out the value of that on the market to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a buyer, not the loss to the seller because he's next 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

door?  That has to be. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  The -- the rule begins with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

paying for the parking lot, and the burden is on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

landowner to show that they -- that person should get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional compensation for the impact to the hotel. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's where that comes from. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That just can't be if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they're separate lots.  That's not the law in any State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that I know. 

   

            

MR. GROEN:  That's the unity of -- of use 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule.  That is in condemnation all the time.  And --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's -- that's when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's a single parcel.

separate parcels.  It's the hotel and parking lot 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

26 

example. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, then, under your 

  

 

 

 

 

view, the landowner wins either way. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GROEN:  It depends on --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If the value is great, he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

gets the double value.  If the value is smaller, then he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can sell the lot. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MR. GROEN:  There has to be in --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In your example --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  In that -- -- unity of use. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So, for example, if -- if the parking lot in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the hotel, they were just different parcels, and the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the parking lot was serving some other property and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government took that parking lot, there's no damages to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- to the parcel with the hotel.  There -- and the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

landowner would not be entitled to anything. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, we won't --

Here, that has to be Lot E.  It was purchased 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separately.  It's a separate deed.  It was purchased for 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

27 

separate purposes, and it is the lot that is regulated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You say you would begin 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the analysis.  What more is there if you're saying we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isolate E and E now is of no value.  It can't be sold; 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it can't be built on.  What is the consequence of saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we isolate -- we identify Parcel E.  Is it the same as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if the government physically took Parcel E? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  It's -- it's not a physical 

   

  

 

 

 

 

taking, but it may have the same practical effect. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's a --

   

  

 

 

MR. GROEN:  -- because the -- the value of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lot E is diminished from $410,000 to $40,000.  There's a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

90 percent decrease in value.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there is some use 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that can be made of this other --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  Lot E cannot be developed on its 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

own.  That ability has been taken away. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but is it -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- the combined properties are sold --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  But --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- it's going to be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

much bigger price tag --

MR. GROEN:  But the --

  

 

 

 

28 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- than if just F was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  But the question is, the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Murrs began with two building sites on separate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

properties.  That was taken away.  The value that you're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about is the value that comes from being able to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

build.  Well, the Murrs already have a house on Lot F. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So when you say what is there -- the value afterwards, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the better methodology is how much would the Murrs or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone who owned Lot F, with an existing house on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lot F, pay to add land to it?  How much would they pay 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to add Lot E to their existing building site? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, what the --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Let me give you -- let me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give you an example which might help me.  Let's go back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Holmes case.  There's a hundred acres.  There are 50 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

columns of coal to hold up the -- to hold up the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ceiling.  That he says is okay.  No compensation.  But 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

wait.  Suppose instead of one people -- one person 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owning all 50 acres, suppose 50 people each own one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acre.  And in some cases, the column runs through the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acre and some it doesn't.  Does that make any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference?

analogous to this situation. 

 

 

 

29 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't care if it's 

    

 

 

 

 

analogous or not analogous.  I'm trying to get my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinking clearer, and oddly enough --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GROEN:  Same --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- different things make my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

thinking clearer, and --

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GROEN:  You have --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- this may be one of them. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. GROEN:  The analysis has to begin by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defining the parcel of property that is regulated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You opinion -- in your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

opinion, if, in the Holmes case, instead of one person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owning the whole 50 acres as one lot, there would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been 50 people who each owned an acre.  Now, it looks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same, you know, the columns are in the same place, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

et cetera, and you're saying that does make a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference. 

            

            

            

MR. GROEN:  If someone --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes or no? 

  

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  It does make a difference.  And 

   

  

  

 

 

 

the key is to look at the parcel of property that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owned by an individual and is that property being taken 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So the usual way --

  

 

 

 

 

 

30 

MR. GROEN:  There's two questions here. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The usual way, Mr. Groen, or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at least a frequent way in which this comes up is a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

developer buys a hundred acres of land, and that land is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

split up into 100 one-acre parcels.  And let's say 15, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one-five, percent of them are on wetlands and can't be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

built on.  It makes an enormous difference whether we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to say that those 15 percent are independent lots, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because if they are, then the developer comes in and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says you have to pay me for all of that.  But if they're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not, the developer is out of luck because it's only 15 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent of the whole.  Isn't that right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  The beginning part of your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

analysis says the developer subdivided.  The developer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

cannot subdivide without government approval.  And when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's a subdivision that is created under the laws of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that State, then rights attach. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  Well, the subdivision 

  

  

 

 

 

has occurred with government approval, and the merger 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision has occurred with government approval, saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this shouldn't be understood in the case of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substandard lots as independent. 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  The merger provision is like the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

wetlands provision:  Both restrict use.  And then the

question, then, once you've identified the relevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31 

parcel in your hypothetical, the -- the -- the question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, is there a taking of that 15 percent. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The burden would be on the government to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show that that 15 percent of the lots is actually part 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of an integrated economic unit as a whole, and then you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceed under a takings analysis.  But in both 

   

  

 

 

 

 

situations, you must first define the relevant parcel. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Unless there are further questions, I'd like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Tseytlin. 

 

             

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISHA TSEYTLIN 

 

 

 

 

         

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT WISCONSIN 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

              

I would like to begin, Mr. Chief Justice, by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answering your question, or the point that you made. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The lots here have merged for all relevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes under State law.  It is true that the lot line 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between Lot E and Lot F still exists, but that has 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely no continuing legal relevance under State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your -- your point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is -- raises my exact concern.  You said "for all

relevant purposes."  The -- the question is what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

purposes are relevant?  And it seems to me that what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes are relevant is analysis under the Takings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause. 

            

And we all know the -- the issue, I think, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Justice Breyer brought up.  Let's say you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three -- three acres of wetlands and you own a hundred 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acres.  You say, well, my property is these three acres 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and you've taken it all.  The law is you don't get --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Groen doesn't get to define property interests that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way because it's gaming the system by saying this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what it is. 

 

 

            

Now, another one of my colleagues pointed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out, there are two halves of the State law here:  Half 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of it is the lot line, half of it is the merger.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you want to say, well, for takings purposes, all we look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at is -- is the merger.  And it seems to me that that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just the flip side of what the landowner can't do.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't sort of preempt the takings analysis by saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're only going to look at this aspect under which, of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course, we win.  Just like the property owner says we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only going to look at these three -- three acres under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which, of course, we win. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  No, Your Honor.  I want to be 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

even more specific.  What I meant by "all relevant

purposes," I mean for all purposes under State law. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

            

If tomorrow someone went to the county 

 

 

 

 

 

 

register and deeds and deleted the lot line between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lot E and F, there is not a single right that the Murrs 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have under State law that they would lose, and there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not a single right they would gain. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  The key point is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the key point is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they didn't do that.  Nobody did that.  And I'm looking 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at page G -- 3 of the appendix to the County's brief, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that's the basis on which the analysis was done. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And it says they did not decide whether lots have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formally merged.  And it's language that is used 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

throughout.  These were effectively merged. 

  

 

 

 

            

Well, I mean, on the other side of it, they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can argue, well, we effectively drew lines around these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three acres.  And it seems to me that -- that there's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusion between the definition of "property" and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of whether or not there's a takings.  And if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you start analyzing with the takings factors and the way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's property, that muddles the whole analysis. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Well, Your Honor, let me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

explain the State's methodology.  And I think in doing 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that, I think I'll be able to answer your question more

clearly. 

            

The test to identify the relevant parcel in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

the State's submission should be one straightforward 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question:  Is the land lot at issue completely separate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from any other land under State law?  And there, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at all of State law.  And where the State law --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot line has no meaning for anyone, it has -- it does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not give any rights, which is the case here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  So if lots are contiguous, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's the end of the question for you; right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Not at all, Your Honor.  Our 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

test is if two lots have a link, a legal link under 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State law, then they are one parcel.  If they have no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal link under State law, then they are completely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But are you -- you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

talking just about State law.  It seems to me that your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position is as wooden and as vulnerable a criticism 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

as -- as the Petitioner's.  You say, whatever State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law -- basically you're saying, whatever State law does, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that defines the property.  But you have to look at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable investment-backed expectations of the owner. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Right, Your Honor.  And I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

want to clarify that what we're talking about here is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just the threshold question.  And after the threshold

question is determined, the reasonable expectations 

 

 

 

 

 

will, in the vast majority of cases, be analyzed as part

Federal government, the county, and in the rebuttal --

you had a lot-line rule which you've now changed.  So 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you say that the State law can change reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investment-backed expectations. 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Your Honor, I want to be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

clear.  When you're doing the second step, the hard work 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the takings analysis, the existence -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preexistence of the lot lines, what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investment-backed expectations were can all be taken 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into account.  The problem with the approach urged by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the county, the Federal government, and my friends in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying it's a reasonable presumption is you basically 

   

 

 

 

 

 

have Penn Central squared.  I --

    

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me give you this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

example.  A -- it's not that far from this case.  A 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plumber and his wife buy a small lot, but it's a lot on 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which you can build houses at that time, and they build 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a modest house. 

 

 

            

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And they say, you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

we're going to -- there's a lot next door, let's buy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36 

that; we can use it as a yard for our children when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're growing up.  And then after they're grown, we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can sell it, and we'll have some money for retirement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And that's a buildable lot at that time. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And then this new regulation is adopted and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now the side lot can't be sold at all.  And they say: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Well, look, you've taken away this valuable asset we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were going to use for our retirement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the answer is:  Well, no, because you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could -- you could sell your whole property, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody who wants to build a big house could build on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that property. 

 

            

And they say:  Well, that's fine, but we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

like our little house.  We'd like to stay in our little 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

house. 

            

Now, what is fair about that situation? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Your Honor, I want to 

   

  

 

 

 

clarify.  I believe that in your hypothetical, when you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

had two lots that were preexisting and owned by the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person and then they were involuntarily merged by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government action, the analysis would, in fact, be on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each lot separately.  It is completely different --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you mean by they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

were "involuntarily merged by government action"?

MR. TSEYTLIN:  That is, there was a -- they 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

37 

had two lots. 

 

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Right. 

  

 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Same person had two lots. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Right. 

  

 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  They were each completely 

  

 

 

 

 

independent under State law.  A new State law comes in 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and says those are merged.  That is a completely 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

different analysis, and I would agree with Your Honor's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

premise that --

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  That wouldn't fall under 

  

 

 

 

 

your regulation? 

 

            

this case? 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yeah.  Well, isn't that 

  

  

 

 

 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  No, Your Honor.  The -- the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental difference in this case is that the merger 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened by voluntary action of the plaintiffs.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the plaintiffs did when they acquired two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contiguous substandard lots is --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it's by voluntary 

  

 

 

 

 

action as defined by State law.  The State law takes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that voluntary action.  And it's the State law that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes the consequence, and that's the consequence we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about.

questions that Justice Kagan was asking clarified this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38 

point.  That is to say, if you want to, in this case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talk about what this regulation did in 1976, is it put a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditional stair restriction on the parents who owned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lot E. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And that's a very fine 

   

  

 

 

 

argument, except for the fact that it's completely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary to the reasoning in Palazzolo.  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Kennedy's opinion in Palazzolo rejects that.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

debate between Justice O'Connor in concurrence and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Scalia in concurrence is about exactly that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And you don't even cite Palazzolo in your brief, do you? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  That is not correct.  At 

  

  

 

 

 

 

pages 41 through 43, we discuss why this is not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Palazzolo-type claim.  A Palazzolo-type claim, as 

    

 

 

 

Justice Kagan's questions indicated, would be that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something happened in 1976 that was unreasonable.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

by "unreasonable," I mean that it took property without 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

just compensation.  So there would have to be a look 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to 1976 to see if the relevant takings test fails. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And it wouldn't fail here, because what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened in 1976?  The parents owned Lot E only.  The --

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and their interest to Lot E was protected by the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grandfather clause.  The only additional restriction 

  

 

 

 

 

upon the parents that was placed in 1976 by the State

was a conditional sale restriction.  That is, you can do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

anything with the lot you want.  You can sell to whoever 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you want.  The only thing you can't do practically is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sell it to someone who only wants to buy it if they also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own a lot next door and also is substandard.  That is a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditional sale restriction, a very minor restriction. 

   

 

 

 

 

And as we pointed out in pages 41 through 43 of our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief, they have not brought that kind of claim, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

takes them out of the world of Palazzolo. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, which --

  

 

 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Go ahead. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  If -- if one lot is owned by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a wholly owned corporation or an LLC and the other is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owned by the owner in the owner's own name, are they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered to be under common ownership under Wisconsin 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law? 

            

            

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  No, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  No. 

  

 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Unless you can pierce the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

corporate veil, which is obviously a very high standard.

final position on that.  My understanding is the county, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

which is the first-line enforcer of this, would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret it that way. 

 

 

 

            

way? 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would interpret it what 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Interpret it that if they're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not literally the same person, even if it's husband and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wife, even if it's two people and one of them owns one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and one of them owns the other, and it's not the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two people and they were --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I correct you --

   

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  I didn't 

    

  

 

 

 

hear the end of your sentence. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  That is my understanding of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the county's interpretation. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what is?  That 

  

  

 

 

 

 

it -- that it's still treated separately? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  That if two owns the exact --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that makes it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

seem we're talking about it in justice and fairness. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That seems to make it seem a little quirky that these 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owners are not entitled to treat them separately, while 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if they -- they just happen to record them in -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate names that they would be a entirely different

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Well, let me explain what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

41 

State is trying to achieve in this law.  It wants to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately phase out substandard lots in the long term. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It does not want to interfere with any current 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investment-backed expectations.  So what it says is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we're going to have a slow phaseout and it's going to be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only triggered by the situation where people end up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking the lots in common ownership.  And that will 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen in the long term. 

 

 

 

 

            

Most people in this area bring lots into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common ownership on purpose.  And why would they do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that?  Because if --

  

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, they won't 

  

 

 

 

 

after today, I mean -- or if you win. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You'll be -- you'll 

  

 

 

 

 

 

be smart enough to say:  Okay.  Husband, you own F; I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will own E.  And by the way, you're my successor in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest under E, and I'm your successor in interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under F.  And -- and then we'll be fine. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Well --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does it really --

  

 

 

 

 

 

does the whole takings issue really turn on that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Yes, Your Honor.  Let me tell 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

you why we do think it'll be effective.  Because most 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

people bring these lots under common ownership 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

purposefully.  And the reason they do that is they want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to build a single house up on a bluff, a bigger house. 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

So the reason -- and we think that that will happen over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time.  It's already happened with eight property owners 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this area.  So while it is a slow phaseout of lots, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is a perfectly sensible regime.  It balances, on one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

hand, the desire to protect investment settle -- back --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I would 

   

  

 

 

suppose that in my hypothetical, the husband owner on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one side and the wife owner on the other side, they can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

build a common house on the two lots, can't they? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  The -- the merger of the two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lots are bringing into common ownership makes it easier 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to apply -- comply with other regulatory restrictions on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the area about minimum lot size and things of that sort. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If you don't bring them into common ownership, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're -- you're left with the nonconforming structure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's on your nonconforming lot. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  May -- may I have one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

question?  It's a background question. 

   

  

 

            

Suppose these people had Lots E and F 

   

 

 

 

 

 

merged.  Then they bought G and H.  Can they still build 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one house, just one? 

 

 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  It would depend on the size

of G and H, how much net project area.  Right now, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's --

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, suppose -- suppose 

  

 

 

 

 

43 

they're just like these lots. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Well, Your Honor, so right 

  

 

 

 

 

 

now, it's about .9 --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If they have E and F, then 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

they buy G and H, can they build only one house, or two? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Right, Your Honor, just --

  

 

 

 

 

 

just let me have two seconds.  I think I can answer the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question. 

            

Right now, it's .98 net project area.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lot G is more than .2 net project area, they can build 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one house.  And then the new lot gets the new net 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

project area.  So, basically, in order to have two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

buildable lots, you have to add up to more than two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acres of net project area. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  General --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It makes no 

  

 

 

 

 

difference under your approach that the two lots were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taxed separately, does it? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  No, Your Honor.  I --

    

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So that doesn't make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it.  It makes no difference under your approach that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there were lot lines separating the two lots; right?

MR. TSEYTLIN:  That's right, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are there other 

  

 

 

 

 

44 

aspects in which the two lots are treated separately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that make no difference under your approach? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  So with regard to the tax 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

assessor, that was an -- that was an error that the tax 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assessor made.  In fact, that fact milked it strongly in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favor of the -- the rule that we urge.  Because in our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule, you look at only State law and you look at whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the lots are actually separate under State law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Under the all things considered approach --

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are these lots 

  

 

 

 

 

actually separate under State law? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  There is no legal situation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in which the lot line between Lot E and Lot F makes any 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference right now, none. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- so that's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite an answer.  Are they legally separate under State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law?  They're still shown on the plat as separate lots, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct? 

            

Honor. 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  That -- that's correct, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So to what extent is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it wrong for me to understand that the only -- the only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense in which the merger doctrine that you're talking

about applies is with respect to a takings claim? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  No, Your Honor.  They -- it's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

45 

with regard to every possible use or sale of these lots. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Any development, any sale, anything else a person in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real world would want to do, there would be no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference.  There's not a single action that someone 

   

  

 

 

 

 

could take that they couldn't take if the lot line was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deleted.  It makes no difference.  The -- the lot line 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between Lot E and Lot F as it currently stands --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And then so there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

no reason -- under State law, there is a procedure to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eliminate the lot lines, and you're saying that that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure is irrelevant in this case? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Given the specific facts of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this case it would be completely irrelevant.  No one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would go through that process because it would not add 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or subtract any single right to the Murrs if they --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  General --

  

 

 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  -- deleted that lot line. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  May I ask a question.  The 

   

   

  

  

 

difference between you and the other folks on that side 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the room is that they want to look at reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expectations, and State law, in part, defines those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable expectations, but they're allowing for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

idea that other things might come in as well, and you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

46 

saying it's all and only State law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, I'm pretty sympathetic to the idea that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preexisting State law really does influence quite a bit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

your expectations about what property you own and what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can do with it.  But still, what's the harm of doing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the government and the county want rather than what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you want in terms of saying the analysis should be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little bit more fluent, fluid, sure, State law matters, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but maybe other the things matter too in a particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation. 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Because what you get with any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of their approaches is Penn Central squared.  That is to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, you have a complex multifactor analysis, basically 

   

 

 

 

 

 

an all-things-considered analysis at step one, just to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure out the parcel.  And then, in the vast majority 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of cases, you then do a complex multifactor analysis and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- which is going to look at a lot of the same 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors. 

              

I think one area of agreement among the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties and amicus briefs in this case is this is --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

area of law is incredibly complicated.  It's difficult 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to make your way through the weeds.  It --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Would it matter to you if it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were not possible to build a house that bridged the two 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lots?  Suppose one was at the bottom -- one lot is at

the bottom of a cliff and the other is at the top of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cliff.  Would that matter to you? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TSEYTLIN:  In defining what the relevant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

parcel is it would not.  It would matter quite a bit in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing the hard work of doing the Penn Central analysis, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that's one of the key points I'd like to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reemphasize. 

            

            

            

We believe -- may I finish my sentence? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure. 

  

 

 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  We believe that most of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

work under takings law should be done at that second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

step, usually Penn Central. 

 

 

 

            

We believe the first step, the parcel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question, should be determined in a straightforward way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

so the Court can move on to doing the hard work of Penn 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Central.

St. Croix County has excluded from its grandfather 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause for preexisting lots commonly owned substandard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

adjacent lots.  During all those decades, no court at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any time in any jurisdiction in the United States has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held that exclusion amounts to a taking and for good 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason:  It's fair and it's just.  And the same 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it gets to the questions I was asking early, fairness 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and justness. 

 

            

But the -- and if -- actually the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point is -- last made by -- by your friend, there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two different questions.  What is property and whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's been a taking.  And I thought the question of 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

fairness and justice is justice is applied to the second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question.  I didn't think it was applied to defining 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the property was because then you really do get, as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he said, Penn Central squared. 

 

 

 

 

            

You're looking at fairness and justice.  How 

  

 

 

 

 

 

should we define this property?  Well, fairness and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

justice for what purpose?  Well, for the Takings Clause. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And then once you define it, then you say well, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fairness and justice for whether there's been a taking. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

It seems to me that you're just kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

teeing up the definition of property to give you the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

right answer under the Takings Clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAZARUS:  Your Honor, in -- in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

case, in Valley, there is some circularity here, but let 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me tell you why there is some circularity here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that is because they're making and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking the challenge to a very odd -- a very odd topic, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that is the absence of an exclusion.  And -- and the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason why there's no exclusion for these kinds of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substandard commonly adjacent lots is precisely because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government has determined over decades that, in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation, the economic impact isn't so great.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't so hardship. 

 

 

            

So the premise of the -- of these ordinances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the absence of hardship.  And since the purpose of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Penn Central analysis or the Lucas analysis for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

economic impact is to identify when the hardship really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is so great to justify the payment of just compensation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's not surprising that the very teachings of these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinances is directly relevant to how you evaluate the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  How can you say that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

impact is not -- is categorically not great?  If some --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody buys a lot next to that person's house with the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expectation of selling it at some point in the future to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meet real needs that come up then, and then the -- a

regulation is adopted that says well, sorry, you can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50 

sell it, that there's no hardship there? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAZARUS:  The -- the hardship -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question though is how do you define the extent of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hardship.  And what you want -- what you need to look at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the Penn Central analysis is what the economic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impact is, and to define the parcel part of that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to identify what the impact is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In -- for instance, in this case, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

economic impact on the Murrs, right, has to take into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account the shared value of the two because the fact is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you look to what -- there is no general issue of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material fact with the lower courts on this question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The value of the two parcels together for one house is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$698,000.  The value of two houses separate, with a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

house on each, is $771,000. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's fine except 

  

 

 

 

 

that, in order to realize the value of the two lots put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

together, they would have to move away. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAZARUS:  Right.  But -- and -- and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the -- and they --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, they think that's 

  

 

 

 

 

irrelevant. 

            

MR. LAZARUS:  The takings inquiry is what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the economic impact is on them.  It shouldn't be a

different test depending upon their particular

preferences.  The -- the fact is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought the -- I thought 

    

   

 

 

 

that what you're saying is we have to look at what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fair and just, and now you say, well, we disregard the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation of -- of the particular people who are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved. 

            

MR. LAZARUS:  Well, no.  You're looking 

  

  

 

 

 

at -- it's several things.  You're looking at first what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the economic impact is.  Define the parcel in a way 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which actually evaluates the real impact.  Not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fictional impact, but the real impact.  The real impact 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here is very little. 

 

 

 

            

 

You're also taking account the -- the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  You're looking at the law at the time to figure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out what the reasonable expectations are of people. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You're taking that into account as well. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The other thing you're taking into account, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your Honor, is the point you mentioned before. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Contiguousness by itself wouldn't be enough.  We aren't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguing that.  One thing you look at is the State law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for expectations. 

 

            

You also look at the physical and geographic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

characteristics of the property; in other words, to find

out whether there was any real potential here for unity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52 

of use and integrative use.  For instance, in this case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if Lot E and F were different and you had one up above 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and one down below, that might well be a harder case to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggest that there was that kind of unity of use, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

integrated. 

            

And you look at those three things, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what you're trying to look for to evaluate the parcel is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're trying to see what the real burden is that people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are suffering in the case. 

 

 

 

 

            

You know, it's a remarkable finding that 

   

 

 

 

 

there's such a little difference in value between one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

house on two and two houses each on one.  And the -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reason for that, there's actually a formal term in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

economics for it.  It's called the complementarity 

  

 

 

 

 

 

principle.  You don't need to know that term.  It's just 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common sense. 

 

            

There's some kinds of property, land is one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of them, that can create value joined that doesn't exist 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when separate.  The most extreme example are shoes.  No 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one would pay very much for just a right shoe or a left 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shoe, but they pay a fair amount for the two shoes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

together.  Land is not an extreme example like shoes, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but the same phenomenon exists --

you're -- you're trying to figure out then what the land 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest is.  And usually there's a regular way to do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, which is you go down to the county office and you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at what the -- the lines are between your property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and somebody else's or your lot and a different lot. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You don't look to whether one is below and one is above, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or that, and it seems to me that gets into a very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complicated situation when for Federal takings purposes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're redefining what State law says property is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAZARUS:  What -- what you're doing --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what you're doing, Your Honor, is you're trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine the economic impact.  There's no question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

State law defines what you own, but the question of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it's a taking -- it's a question of Federal 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional law, and the economic impact inquiry has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to see to what extent there really is this incredibly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disproportionate burden they're facing or not. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In -- in the Penn -- in the Penn -- oh 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorry.  In the Penn Central case, in the Keystone 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bituminous case, every one of those cases State law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defined as separate property interests, things can be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bought and sold, the air rights can be bought and sold, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the support estate can be bought and sold, real estate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can be bought and sold under State law.  There are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinct property rights under State law, and the Court

nonetheless, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

joined them together because the Court wanted to find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54 

out whether, in fact, there was that kind of economic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden.  And they even did it in cases involving lot 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lines. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what about adding 

  

 

 

 

 

here when I look to see the reasonableness of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation.  I mean, suppose in Holmes' case, the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

regulation had said you have to leave columns of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thousand feet of coal.  But every expert said, or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everyone who knew about it, said you don't need more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than 50 feet. 

 

 

            

MR. LAZARUS:  Well, certainly it's true, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ultimate analysis, you pay attention to reasonableness. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You -- you pay attention to whether the government --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you don't get to accept the government saying it doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

automatically qualify --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Does that fit in your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

three? 

            

MR. LAZARUS:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

fits under Penn Central.  And in this case -- in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, this is really the easy case.  It's almost a sui 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generis case because the -- the State law at issue was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one which -- which is premised on the notion that under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this circumstance you actually don't face such a great

hardship.  That's exactly why they don't get the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 

exemption. 

            

This isn't -- they are not challenging 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restriction.  They're actually challenging not getting 

  

 

 

 

 

exemption which someone else is getting.  And the reason 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're not getting that exemption is they don't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same hardship that other people have. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The -- the owner of the isolated lot, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substandard lot, asks for some kind of exemption.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

face the prospect of a complete economic wipeout.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the owner of two substandard adjacent lots, they don't. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That person, like the Murrs, they have development 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

options. 

            

In addition, they have the opportunity, as I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said before, to created value, value that doesn't exist 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate.  And in this case, the value of joining the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property together, the reason why this property -- which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is beautiful property, stunningly beautiful, St. Croix 

 

 

 

 

 

 

River, at the bend of the river.  The reason why it's so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valuable is two things:  River frontage and privacy. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's the touchstone of value here. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Lot F is only 58 feet wide at the bottom, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the distance between the two columns in this room, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right next to a public area.  Lot E has a hundred feet, 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

twice that, of river frontage.  And off to the west,

more privacy.  When you add those two lots together, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56 

value of this luxury lot at the bend of the river is so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

great, it actually almost overcomes the loss of value of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not having the second home on the lot. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I've had a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

problem with the appraisal figures, and it may be a step 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm missing. 

 

            

Why would anybody pay $400,000 for a lot 

   

 

 

 

 

 

they can't build on? 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAZARUS:  Because --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The two values -- your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

example said the two lots put together are less 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valuable, or more valuable? 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAZARUS:  Just a little less valuable. 

   

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yeah.  I know there's 

    

  

 

 

only a ten percent difference.  But as I understood the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

appraisal figures, and are now using estimates, each lot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was worth about 350 and 400,000 separately, for a value 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of 750.  Together they were valued at 680.  So they 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weren't -- you didn't double the price --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAZARUS:  No.  But what you do -- if --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you didn't lose very much.  By not being able to build a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second home, the value doesn't sort of halve.  Instead, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the value goes only by -- down by nine percent.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason is that the combined lot is this luxury lot. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

This is a high-end area --

   

 

 

 

57 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I understand why the 

    

 

 

 

combination, but why would anybody buy the lot you can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

develop on? 

 

            

MR. LAZARUS:  Well, the question is not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the -- what the value of Lot E as a unit that you can't 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

develop or -- or build on.  The question is what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

value of Lot E is to the Murrs, who also own Lot F, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because that's how you define what the burden is to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them.  And the burden to them -- if -- if someone only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owned Lot E, then the hardship exemption would apply and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they could build.  That's exactly the distinction that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ordinance draws between the two. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is this right?  Just say 

  

  

 

 

 

 

yes or no, and if it's wrong, I'll figure it out later. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Are you saying -- look, of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

course you look at the lines that the State draws, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that isn't determinative because you want to know the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

total impact on the person, which may get you to look at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nearby property or other things.  You want to know how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable this regulation that affects it is; you want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to know whether he knew when he bought it, and perhaps 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are others. 

 

 

            

Is that basically what you're saying?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR 

 

 

 

 

 

          

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

               

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 

 

 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

I'd like to begin with your question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Chief Justice, about why it wouldn't be sensible to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just look at lot lines here as the starting point for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defining the parcel as a whole. 

   

 

 

 

            

And as Justice Breyer just noted, we think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the lot lines are certainly relevant, especially insofar 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as they might shape reasonable expectations about how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property owners expect to use their property and what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they expect to remain separate and distinct.  But we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

urge this Court not to adopt a presumption or a bright

line rule that focuses on lot lines in isolation.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we really see two principal problems with that, one of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59 

which is practical, and the other is legal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Go ahead. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well -- I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. PRELOGAR:  Turning to the practical 

  

 

 

 

 

point first, especially when you're looking at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contiguous commonly-owned property, which is the 

 

 

 

 

 

situation the Court is confronting here.  We think that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot lines will frequently not be an accurate indicator 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of how that claimant is being burdened by the particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation, and that's because when you have those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contiguous commonly-owned lots, there's a physical unity 

   

 

 

 

 

that frequently opens up the potential for linked use, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

linked development, a direct reciprocity of advantage, 

   

 

 

 

 

and shared value. 

 

 

            

And so when thinking about how to address 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the parcel as a whole issue, where the whole purpose, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the whole point is to get a feel for how the regulation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is actually impacting this claimant, focusing on lot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lines would exclude relevant considerations about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on-the-ground economic realities. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So that's -- I just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

don't know how that works with -- with property.  Not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking whether there's a takings, but asking whether

there's property. 

 

60 

            

You say it -- it depends on spacial, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functional, and what's the third thing? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  Temporal. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Temporal 

  

 

 

considerations. 

            

Now, you usually don't say that when you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking about property.  You say, I owned Lot E or I own 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

Lot F, and here it is on the map; that's what I own. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You don't sit down and say:  Well, but with spacial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considerations I own this much of it, and when temporal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considerations, add this, and functional that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It seems to me that those concerns are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pertinent at considering whether there's a taking of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

property.  But when it comes to what the property is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's a whole different question, and you don't get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

into spacial, you get into what the plat looks like in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the county office. 

 

 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  I think it's absolutely the 

    

 

 

 

 

case that for terms -- in terms of defining what's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protected property interest, at the outset you look to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State law, you look to lot lines, and no one's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contesting here that there's a protected property 

   

 

 

 

 

interest.  But we think that this relevant parcel 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination does come into the second part of the

inquiry in terms of whether there's been a taking.

determine how this regulation is actually affecting this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claimant, and so we would put those considerations on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the taking side of the line. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This Court has always shown a preference in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

deciding, as Justice Breyer said, and -- and Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Holmes' famous formulation whether a regulation goes too 

   

 

 

 

 

 

far, the Court's always shown a preference for being 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

able to engage in that kind of contextual analysis that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focuses on all of the relevant facts and circumstances. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The problem I have with 

   

  

 

 

 

your test, which has the -- the three components, is I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't actually see anywhere in there any weight given to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State property lines. 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You don't explicitly 

  

 

 

 

list it among those three items.  You don't tell us how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're weighing it or not weighing it, what presumptions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're giving it or not.  So where does it fit in to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your -- your -- your three factors? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  We think that it frequently 

  

 

 

 

 

 

goes to the functional considerations because it shapes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expectations about how land can properly be used,

whether it's an entirely separate and distinct issue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So we do think that there's a role for State law to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

play.  And here we think, actually, that's one of the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If we think there should 

  

 

 

 

 

 

be more of a role, where would you put it?  St. Croix 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

puts it on the second prong.  Where would you end up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

putting it, and why do you disagree with how they use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it? 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  I think it's very important 

    

 

 

 

 

not to adopt any kind of presumption or bright line rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the relevant parcel.  And so I also would put it on 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the second prong of conducting the Penn Central 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis. 

            

But the reason for that is because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant parcel that the threshold definitional question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is going to provide the touchstone that contextualizes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the whole rest of the takings inquiry.  And if the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were to artificially narrow it and look only at lot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lines, or to presumptive weight to those lot lines, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's going to be the focal point for measuring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

economic impact for looking at investment-backed 

 

 

 

 

 

expectations. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose you have lots that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are not contiguous but they're very close to each other.

different dimensions, are they ruled out as a single 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

63 

parcel? 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  I think it would be very 

    

 

 

 

 

 

difficult to say that those kinds of noncontiguous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

properties function as an integrated economic unit.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think it would be the rare case where it would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate to aggregate those property interests.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I think that it is important to keep in mind that there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are so many different ways that property interests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arise, that it is important to have a flexible, nuanced 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach here. 

 

            

And Justice Alito, I would just point to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

example we raised about the large developer who acquires 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a large tract, maybe a thousand acres of property, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subdivides it into hundreds --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  That can easily be taken 

  

 

 

 

 

 

care of by making the rule look to the -- the lots as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defined at the time of the acquisition rather than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that was done prior to -- prior to the time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when -- when a rule would be -- would be applied.  But, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, it's fine to say that there are all these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dimensions and they should be nuanced and who can be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposed to something that's nuanced.  But what are we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking for?  What are we looking for?  We're looking at 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all these dimensions to determine what?  Could you just

say as precisely as you can what we would -- we should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be looking for in defining what is the property that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64 

taken using all of the different dimensions that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant in your view? 

 

 

 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  I think the clearest 

    

 

 

 

articulation I have is to say that you should be looking 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for what in the interest of fairness and justice is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accurate way to measure economic impact.  And that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point of the relevant parcel determination.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

focused specifically on the economic impact prong of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equation. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And is it the economic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

impact on these particular owners or on some category of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical owners? 

 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  It's always been an 

  

 

 

 

 

individualized inquiry focused on these particular 

 

 

 

 

 

owners.  And I think that the facts of this case well 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illustrate the point that when you're conducting that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of evaluation, it's often the case, as -- as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Lazarus said, that you're going to have a shared 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

value, a reciprocal value that --

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But what if a lot -- but 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

what if a lot was -- was preserved?  What if it was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bought for the purpose of selling it at some point in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the future and/or it was preserved for that purpose so

that nothing was built on it so that it could readily be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sold? 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  I think that those kinds of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable investment-backed expectations have a role to 

   

 

 

 

 

play, but I don't think that they can be dispositive. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because, again, the point of the relevant parcel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination is to accurately gauge economic impact. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But I do think that it's important --

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why wouldn't they be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

determinative?  I thought you said it was we look to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimate expectations.  There, their expectations are 

  

 

 

 

 

completely frustrated. 

 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  It's certainly the case that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

anytime anyone's alleging a regulatory taking, the 

   

 

 

 

 

premise of the claim is that they're being prevented 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from doing something with their property that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted to do with it.  We think that that's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient to alone define the relevant parcel because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it might be the case, as it is here, that there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually not much of an economic impact at all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And if that's the case, then this isn't the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of regulation that is requiring someone to shoulder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a burden that in the interest of fairness and justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be --

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that comes back to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

my -- but -- but you're saying that they have to move. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66 

They can't afford to build a big house here, which is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what everybody wants.  They don't want these little 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

modest houses anymore.  They want McMansions.  They --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

they have to move.  That's what you're saying. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  But to the extent that a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court were to conclude that that is an undue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interference with their investment-backed expectations 

 

 

 

 

or that the character of that government action is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually unjust and anomalus, then I think that this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's precedent already builds in sufficient 

 

 

 

 

 

protection for those kinds of interest without trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rely solely on expectations to identify the relevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parcel. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- but I thought 

    

   

 

 

reasonable investment-backed expectations were 

 

 

 

objective.  You're now making them subjective. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  Oh, no.  To be clear, Justice 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Kennedy, we do think that it has to be an objective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry.  And I understood Justice Alito to be focusing 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

on a fact pattern where the property was acquired before 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the relevant regulatory restriction was enacted and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thereby frustrated the expectations. 

 

 

 

            

Here, we think it's actually a critical fact 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that Petitioners voluntarily brought this land under

common ownership and so triggered the application of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merger provision decades after the relevant regulatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restriction was in place.  And that does weaken the idea 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there were any objectively reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

expectations --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I actually think 

   

  

 

 

they did it -- the parents did it after the ordinance's, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from my timeline, creation.  The ordinance was passed in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1976.  And in 1982, the parents took the property under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common ownership from the Atlantic Plumbing Company. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

there --

 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  That's correct.  So that 

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So neither the parents 

  

 

 

 

 

or the children, if they had been paying attention to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the regulatory scheme, had a reasonable expectation that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the ordinance wouldn't affect them. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  That's exactly correct.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

think that the timing here of the relevant transfers of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property reinforces the idea that it's proper to view 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these two parcels together as an integrated whole. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the other facts that I would add to that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are the spatial ones, the fact that these are contiguous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commonly owned tracts with possibilities for linked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

development and linked uses that creates that direct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shared value that is borne out by the valuation evidence

in this case.  Because it is significant here that if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68 

you view these lots together as an effectively merged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parcel, as they are under State law, then the value is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only 10 percent less than the value of two separate lots 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with two separate building sites.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But by saying 

  

 

 

 

 

"effectively merged," you mean not really merged? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. PRELOGAR:  Absolutely.  We're not 

  

  

 

 

suggesting that the lot lines have been erased here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And so we do think that those lot lines continue to have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a role to play. 

 

 

 

            

to takings. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Except with respect 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. PRELOGAR:  No.  We think that they do 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

have a role to play with respect to takings, but that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's also important to conduct the same kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contextual analysis that's been the hallmark of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's regulatory takings jurisprudence.

defining the property interest -- remember, the first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

69 

issue, you have to define the property interest that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the subject of the takings -- of the takings claim.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason is because the whole real estate industry, from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mortgage lenders to property owners to title insurance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

companies, all rely upon the geographic boundaries.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's exactly as was suggested --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  With the regulations 

  

 

 

 

that affect those boundaries. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GROEN:  I'm sorry? 

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  With the regulations 

  

 

 

 

that affect those boundaries.  Whether it's a title 

   

  

 

 

 

 

company or anyone else --

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GROEN:  But we --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- they look at what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

paper talks about as a property line and what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations do with respect to that line. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  And when the regulations 

  

 

 

 

 

redefine and impose a new definition, the reliance that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

previously existed is undermined.  And that is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

gravamen of the takings claim.  It is not a redefinition 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that absolves liability. 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what do we do --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  It's a redefinition --

it that these properties were bought separately, one by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

70 

the parents, the other by their company, and that post 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations, knowing exactly what they were doing -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you say they didn't, but that has to do with their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choice, because you buy everything subject to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation.  You may not choose to look at it, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- you should.  Ignorance of the law is not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense anywhere.  I don't know why it should be in the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulatory context. 

 

            

But putting that aside, they took the title 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the property in their own names post regulation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  Yes, they did.  This is a normal 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

American family who understands when you buy property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and you have a deed and it's zoned for residential use 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a subdivision, you get to use it.  And you get to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pass it on to your kids. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you get to use 

  

 

 

 

 

 

everything you own with -- subject to regulatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements. 

            

            

MR. GROEN:  That's right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I buy a piece of 

    

   

 

 

property 10 years ago or 20 years ago, and I didn't know 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I had to put a sprinkler system in.  Today, if you want 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do any kind of renovation, you got to put one in. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  But --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's lots of 

  

 

 

 

71 

regulations that you didn't buy expecting --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

you. 

            

MR. GROEN:  That's right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- but they do affect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  But the Murrs bought two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

separate parcels that comprised two separate building 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lots, and that has now --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They --

  

 

 

MR. GROEN:  -- been taken --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They --

  

 

 

MR. GROEN:  -- away from them. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They didn't buy them. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. GROEN:  That --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They got them in 1982 

  

 

 

 

 

 

subject to knowing that they could only develop on one. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GROEN:  Well, that circles right back to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Palazzolo argument that we discussed earlier. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The other issue I'd like to address is this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reliance that -- that I -- that we're just talking about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with subdivisions and deeds, that is a system that all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this country relies upon.  And if we're going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undermine that, that is a serious step in taking away 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights and property that people traditionally understand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and use in their daily lives.  That's the protection

that's talked about in Roth v. Board of Regents. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The second thing is this valuation question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

72 

And couple of points on that.  All the discussion about, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, the property is valuable because it's waterfront, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all of that discussion goes to the merits of the takings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim; in other words, how much economic impact is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there?  The first step is to define the relevant unit of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property for analysis.  And that step is looking at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deeds and the -- the geographic boundaries of Lot E. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That is the presumption. 

 

 

 

            

When you turn to the valuation question, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notion that Lot -- the combined Lot E-F has value 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it's waterfront, that is ignoring the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental aspects that the valuation in a residential 

   

 

 

 

 

 

lot is because you can build on it.  And that is what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has been taken from the Murrs.  They previously had two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

building sites; now they have one. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The valuation that the county discusses, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

value is not attributed to Lot E, because Lot F has the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

building site.  So, really, the county is getting a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

windfall by suggesting that, oh, well, you can have this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bigger, better lot, and that will enable you to -- to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recover from the compensation.  That goes to -- to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question on -- we have of how do you -- how do you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine the amount of damages?
