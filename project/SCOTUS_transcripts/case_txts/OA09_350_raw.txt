 In Monell v. Department of Social Services, 

this Court held there could be no liability against a 

local public entity under section 1983 unless the 

plaintiff proved causation, namely that the injury that 

was inflicted was inflicted as a result of a custom, 

policy, or practice of that local public entity. 

 The Ninth Circuit, however, in this case has 

imposed ex post facto declaratory relief on the County 

of Los Angeles as well as a substantial fee award, while 

acknowledging that it has not, in fact, determined 

whether the injury suffered by the plaintiffs and 

subject to declaratory relief was the result of a 

policy, custom, or practice fairly attributable to the 

County of Los Angeles.  It did so because the Ninth 

Circuit has developed a digression from the Court's 

jurisprudence in Monell; namely, in the Ninth Circuit, 

3

8

claims for prospective relief, both injunctive and 

declaratory relief, are not subject to the Monell 

requirements. 

 We submit that this is flatly inconsistent 

with Monell and erodes the important principles of 

federalism that are the motivating factors for the 

Monell causation requirement. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What was the -- what was 

9 

the basis for that -- for that exception, that 

10

11

declaratory judgment does not affect the fisc of the -­

 MR. COATES:  Yes, essentially in the Chaloux 

12 

case -­

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It does -- it does, though, 

14 

if you have attorneys' fees.  What -- what was the total 

15

16

17 

18 

19 

20

attorneys' fee award in this case? 

 MR. COATES:  As to the County, it's $58,000. 

But the overall award is far above that, and that's just 

for appellate attorneys' fees.  We're not even talking 

trial fees at this time.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's far above?  Like 

21 

what?  I suspect -­

22

 MR. COATES:  600-and-some-odd thousand 

23 

dollars. 

24

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I suspect the case is 

mostly about attorneys' fees.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there was no 

objection on the part of the State.  The State was to 

pay the lion's share of the fees, I think 90 percent, 

right?

 MR. COATES:  Correct.  The State has not 

6 

contested that. 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the State is not 

8 

contesting. 

9

10

11

 MR. COATES:  The State has not contested 

that, correct. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does the State make that 

12 

payment under an Ex parte Young theory? 

13

 MR. COATES:  Yes, yes.  It's a suit against 

14 

the State under an Ex parte Young theory, since they 

15

16

17 

18 

19 

20

21

maintain the statute. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If you sue the 

municipality, if they deny a marriage license, do you 

have to sue under 1983, or you can just sue alleging a 

Federal cause of action under -- because of a denial of 

a constitutional right? 

 MR. COATES:  Well, it would have to be under 

22 

section -­

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It would be like a Bivens 

24 

action, I guess.

25

 MR. COATES:  It would have to be -- the 

5

3

Court has recognized, against local municipalities' 

liability under section 1983. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The only way to sue a 

4 

municipality for a constitutional violation is under 

1983? 

5

6

 MR. COATES:  In a direct civil cause of 

7 

action, I believe that is correct, Your Honor. 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you could get the 

9 

individual officer who's denying the marriage license or 

10

11 

12 

13

whatever the offensive act is.  You could sue that 

person under 1983 and get -- and get injunctive relief, 

I suppose. 

 MR. COATES:  That is correct.  You could 

14 

also sue the individual.

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But could you sue outside 

16 

of 1983? 

17

 MR. COATES:  The individual, for a Federal 

18 

constitutional remedy? 

19

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just to get -- the 

marriage license example -- just to get an order 

21 

demanding issuance of the license. 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. COATES:  No, I believe you would still 

have to have an operative statute to get it into Federal 

court for declaratory relief requires some -- some 

basis. 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that has to be a 

2 

statute -- it has to be 1983? 

3

 MR. COATES:  I believe for a constitutional 

4 

claim of this type, it would be section 1983.  You might 

5

6 

7 

8

find an employment case where you might have Title VII 

concerns.  It depends on the right that you're talking 

-- that's at issue. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What happens if the 

9 

individual says I'm going to ignore the injunction?  Can 

10

11 

12 

13

you go to the State and force the State to -- in that 

circumstance, to get someone to issue the license on 

your behalf? 

 MR. COATES:  If it's -- we're talking about 

14 

the State, or are you referring to the municipality?

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or the municipality.  I 

16 

misspoke.

 MR. COATES:  You would not, unless you 

showed that there was a policy, custom, or practice. 

You might have one outlying -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what you're saying is 

that a State agent or a municipality can continue to 

ignore a constitutional violation until, what -- you're 

denied the license five times? 

 MR. COATES:  Well, no.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How many times do you 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

2 

3

have to show that you're not getting a license you're 

entitled to? 

 MR. COATES:  Well, say, for example, that 

4 

one brought to the attention of a policymaking official 

5

6

that this is what was going on -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They wouldn't know 

7 

that -­

8

 MR. COATES: -- and then you have the 

9 

deliberate indifference by a policymaking official.  I 

10

submit that, under Monell, that might provide a basis 

11 

under the Court's case law. 

12

13 

14 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So what do 

you do with CANRA section 11178(a)(2), which tells you 

that the municipality is responsible for the accuracy, 

completeness, and retention of the reports sent to the 

16 

State? 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 It's not your policy to ignore your 

obligation and not figure out what to do about the 

retention of improperly submitted names?

 MR. COATES:  Well, the difficulty in this 

case with respect to that is there are no State 

standards in terms of evaluating the accuracy or when 

stuff is removed, when someone wants to be removed from 

the database.  Even the Ninth Circuit recognized that, 

that it was kind of imposed on local public entities 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4

5

through the back door, that there are no specific 

criteria in the statute for removing someone from -­

from the list. 

 And that would require the County to start 

trying to create its own policies or its own procedural 

6 

schemes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's what it's 

charged with doing.  It's charged with the 

responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, and 

retention of these reports. 

 MR. COATES:  But -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if you're charged 

with the accuracy, completeness, and retention of the 

reports, why shouldn't you be responsible for the 

failure to maintain accurate reports? 

 MR. COATES:  Because it's not so much that 

they are inaccurate; it's the standards used to remove 

someone from the list or not.  Because we may have 

information showing culpability, information showing not 

culpability, but we don't have a standard to tell us 

when to remove them from the database and when to leave 

them in, because that's defined by the State. 

 More importantly, we don't have any 

24 

procedures on how to go about that, because the 

25

statutory scheme doesn't have any for doing that.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the Respondents here 

argue, don't they, that you should have created a 

procedure on your own, right? 

 MR. COATES:  Correct.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, if the -- presumably, 

that could be brought to the -- that could be brought 

before someone who is a County policymaker, couldn't it, 

when you are talking about something that's going -­

that's ongoing in the future?

10

 MR. COATES:  That's true.  That could be 

11 

brought to the attention of a policymaker. 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And then that would fall 

13 

within Monell. 

14

15

 MR. COATES:  Correct.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So that's why I'm somewhat 

16 

puzzled about what this case is about. 

17

23 

24 

25

 When are we going to get into a situation in 

which the plaintiffs are asking for prospective relief 

and the matter cannot be brought before a municipal or 

County policymaker? 

 MR. COATES:  No, I agree with Your Honor.  I 

mean, I think that most of these cases do fit neatly 

within the Monell framework if a plaintiff pursues them 

within that framework.

 The Ninth Circuit doesn't require that,

though, and kind of just simply lumps the County 

together with the State and says the State statute's 

unconstitutional.  You're charged with enforcing it. 

Declaratory relief against both of you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You concede, I take 

it, or acknowledge that one episode can be the basis -­

I mean, going forward -- for a determination that the 

defendant has a policy, custom, or practice. 

 MR. COATES:  You can.  If you have a 

policymaker who understands the situation, makes a 

deliberate decision, yes, I think can you come forward 

with a Monell claim. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's your 

14 

adversary's argument, which is by this lawsuit, you have 

15

16 

17 

18

been told that there's something wrong -- it seems 

pretty natural -- that a report would be kept on the 

registry that has been declared just plain wrong. 

 The court has said there's no foundation 

19 

whatsoever for the accuracy of what's in that report, 

20

and you have failed to establish a procedure to remove 

21 

the name.  Why aren't you liable under Monell? 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. COATES:  Well, as a factual matter, the 

one thing the Ninth Circuit said it wasn't doing was 

figuring out whether this met the policy, custom, or 

practice requirement of Monell, because under its case 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

7 

8 

9 

law it doesn't have to do so.  And, in fact, in the fee 

order, it said -- declined to do so and, in fact, it has 

remanded on the damage portion of the case, 

acknowledging that Monell claims remain open.

 We also contend that for purposes of 

potential Monell liability that we may not be free under 

State law to add additional procedural protections. 

That area may be pre-empted by the State through implied 

pre-emption under California law.

10

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, if that's the case, why 

11 

wouldn't one of the following be possible? 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 If you -- you say we have no discretion 

here.  We are required to -- we are totally bound by the 

State procedures; we can't add any new procedure.  They 

say, well, that's unconstitutional.  So -- and you're 

choosing to do something that's unconstitutional because 

it's required by State law. 

 Then, haven't -- in that situation, won't 

19 

you have adopted a policy?

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. COATES:  The way the lower courts have, 

in the context of liability, viewed this requirement 

where State law requires a local entity to do something 

is they have virtually said that they're standing in the 

shoes of the State.  Under those circumstances, it's 

essentially the State making the decision.  They are 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4

5

6

just using the County as a -- the local entity, as an 

instrument.  And so it's essentially an Ex parte Young 

Eleventh Amendment-type case. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  It would be an Ex parte 

Young situation. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And they have sued 

7 

the State here, right?

 MR. COATES:  They have sued the State. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Or under Ex parte 

Young? 

 MR. COATES:  They have indeed sued the State 

here.  And we submit that they can get full relief with 

respect to the database from the State, should they 

choose to pursue that.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Who would they sue to do 

that?  As I am reading CANRA, it makes the California 

Department of Justice only the repository of reports. 

 MR. COATES:  They may -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So who -- who do they 

sue in the State to -­

 MR. COATES:  They've sued the Attorney 

General, because the Department of Justice maintains the 

database.  The Department of Justice issues the 

regulations on how local entities go about -- are 

required to report to the database.  And so that's -­

6

7 

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

that is the defendant in this case, and that's who they 

would sue.  And I submit they could get relief by being 

removed from the database or require the State to enact 

procedures to allow them to have a determination made as 

to whether they should be removed or not. 

 As it now stands, the statutory scheme 

doesn't have that, and the County's view is that it's 

not free to just go out and invent procedures, and other 

counties throughout the State of California aren't free 

to invent their own procedures.  And that's one of the 

elements of this case that I think really underscores 

the Monell concerns with federalism, because it's an 

important question of the manner in which States relate 

to their municipalities and the way States divide up 

responsibility for who does what, and in a fairly 

16 

important area of the law. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24

25

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what would happen 

under California law if you said, we agree with the 

Respondents that additional procedures are 

constitutionally required.  So, even though California 

law doesn't allow this, we are going to create these 

procedures because we have to comply with the 

Constitution. 

 What would your situation be under 

California law?  Would you be subject to -- what could 

14

the State do to you?

 MR. COATES:  Well, there would be a possible 

pre-emption argument.  They could halt California -­

they could halt Los Angeles from enacting the statute, 

from utilizing the procedural protections. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm sorry -­

 MR. COATES:  They could say the area is 

pre-empted and move for an injunction from doing it, 

because they're interested via maintaining the database.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Who is the "they" who 

11 

would do this? 

12

13 

14 

15

 MR. COATES:  The State of California could 

come in and argue that the County was pre-empted from 

using these regulations.  They could argue that it slows 

down the database or what have you.  But they could 

16 

theoretically do that under California law. 

17

18 

19 

20

21

22 

23 

24

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This -- this is getting 

further removed from the situation that we're dealing 

with, because the State has already admitted liability 

and not has contested that its fees -- it owes fees. 

 So, what is the relief that is left?  If the 

-- if the State has admitted liability, what happens at 

that point?  Shouldn't the record be expunged? 

 MR. COATES:  I believe the appropriate 

argument for the plaintiffs would be to apply in a

district court if they believe they have a valid 

injunction and valid declaratory relief vis-à-vis the 

State and move forward from there. 

 They could certainly do that and have 

themselves removed from the database or order the State 

to create statutory procedures to allow them a hearing 

to determine whether they should be removed from the 

database.  They're perfectly free to do that, because 

it's the State statute and it's the State database, and 

the State is a party here. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the State has already 

conceded.  It's been adjudicated a constitutional 

violator, and the State is now saying, yes, we are not 

going to contest that anymore.  Doesn't the State have 

to do something? 

 MR. COATES:  They should.  They absolutely 

should.  And if the State drags its feet, the 

appropriate remedy is to file a motion for an injunction 

as against the State, to have them issue the proper 

procedural protections or to remove them from the 

21 

database. 

22

23 

24 

25

 But we submit that it's, at this point, not 

appropriate relief as against the County.  That issue 

still remains open.  We could still go back into 

district court and lose that, but at this point you

still have to make the inquiry whether it's a county 

policy, custom, or practice that's inflicting the injury 

that's the subject of declaratory relief here. 

 And, I mean, I think at bottom, at the end 

of the day, the point is that Plaintiffs really haven't 

identified any circumstance in which, in a proper case 

applying the Monell standards, you would not be able to 

get relief.  And the danger of going forward with the 

Ninth Circuit's kind of amorphous standard where you 

just impose declaratory relief, independent of whether 

or not there's a policy, custom, or practice, is the 

kind of sloppy order that we have here, granting 

declaratory relief where we have a 90-10 fee split, and 

it's unclear how that decision was made, because it's 

not made through the prism of any sort of causation 

16 

standard articulated by this Court. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24

25

 So we would submit that Monell provides 

clear guidelines, although sometimes difficult to apply 

in certain cases, but they are clear guidelines.  And 

the Court in Monell said that those causation 

requirements applied to damages, injunctive and 

declaratory relief.  And we believe that is a solid rule 

that supports the interests of federalism and -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's true that all cases 

that at least have come to us under Monell have involved

damages.

 MR. COATES:  That is correct.  They have 

been damages cases.  But the -- but Monell itself 

doesn't talk in terms of guarding the public fisc, which 

is how Chaloux, the Ninth Circuit case that departs from 

Monell with injunctive and declaratory relief -- the way 

it characterizes it.  It doesn't. 

 Monell was concerned with interpreting the 

9 

language of section 1983, the "shall subject," the

violation.  They said that did not really conform to 

respondeat superior principles.  And looking at the 

legislative history, the 42nd Congress in enacting 

section 1983 was critical to Justice Brennan in Monell 

that the rejection of the Sherman Amendment, which he 

said was concerned mostly with not imposing coercive 

liability on the municipality for the actions of others. 

They were concerned not to save money necessarily, but 

the way in which a Federal court would exercise coercive 

power over a local public entity. 

 And we submit that it is just as important 

to have those guidelines when directly coercing through 

injunctive and declaratory relief as it is indirectly 

doing it through the threat of damage claims.

 MR. COATES:  Off the top of my head -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because it seems to me it 

would help you in this case, because you would say, 

well, if there's a real problem, the city -- the injured 

party can sue for an injunction.  Perhaps the State was 

against the party first, and he can -- he can raise a 

constitutional defense or he can bring an action for an 

injunction, and it doesn't have to be under 1983.  And 

it would seem to me that that would resolve it.  And you 

then wouldn't have to pay attorneys' fees because 

there's no provision in the statute for it. 

 MR. COATES:  Well, I mean, it is independent 

of what remedies might occur under State law.  I'm not

trying to say that that's the exclusive -- that section 

83 is the exclusive means for all relief.  You can 

certainly -- there is State law -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, I'm talking about 

under Federal law. 

 MR. COATES:  My understanding with respect 

to a general constitutional claim is that it is section 

1983, that that is the Congress's -- that's how Congress 

has specified the remedy.  There are other portions for 

other types of conduct -- section 1986, section 1985, 

for example -- but I think this sort of general 

constitutional claim is subject to section 1983. 

 And if the Court has no further questions, 

14 

I'd reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 MR. PINCUS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

 Let me begin, perhaps, by trying to answer 

Justice Alito's question about what is at stake here. 

Monell held that 1983 has a causation requirement.  And 

the Court has, in a series of decisions, elucidated what 

a plaintiff must prove in the context of claims for 

20
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

15

17 

18 

19

20

21 

22 

23

damages to satisfy that causation requirement, and it's 

held in particular that the mere fact that a city 

employee committed a violation under color of State law 

in the past is not itself a sufficient link to the 

municipality itself.  And the decisions have been 

devoted to elucidating precisely what else is required 

in order to show the sufficient link to the 

municipality. 

 The question here arises in what, we submit, 

is the very different factual context of ongoing 

constitutional violations.  And we think that although 

the jurisprudence that's developed under Monell has been 

done a -- has been devoted to fleshing out this other 

context, the Court should take a look at whether that 

jurisprudence is the appropriate way to determine 

whether the causation test is satisfied when there is an 

ongoing violation, because there's an easier way to do 

it. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's the same statutory 

language that you're relying on, right, that was held to 

require causation in the one case?  Why wouldn't it 

require a similar causation in the other? 

 MR. PINCUS:  Your Honor, we believe it does 

24 

require causation, but the question is what kind of 

25

facts have to be shown to prove causation.  And, in 

21
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

particular, once a plaintiff has shown what is required 

otherwise to show the violation, to show standing for 

prospective relief and obtain prospective relief, we 

think those elements will necessarily encompass the 

showing that's required to prove a link to the 

6 

municipality itself.  And what our concern here -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But then you're not really 

hurt if -- or the system isn't really hurt by the rule 

that the city asks for.  If it's so easy to establish a 

policy or custom requirement in cases where prospective 

relief is sought, then that's the answer.  You can 

establish it.  End of case.  But you don't get it unless 

you establish the custom and practice. 

 MR. PINCUS:  Your Honor, we think it should 

be easy.  It should be present in every case.  Our 

concern is that courts might be confused by the idea 

that what they are supposed to do is apply the 

jurisprudence that's really been developed to target who 

was responsible for this act that happened in the past, 

and not realize that there's really a quite more 

21 

expeditious way to determine in the future. 

22

23 

24 

25

 Here, it's quite clear.  The court of 

appeals said there's an ongoing failure by the County to 

provide due process.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'm -- I'm not sure 

22

misinterpret you? 

 MR. PINCUS:  I guess I would clarify -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you say, oh, it's so 

easy to do, it doesn't make any difference.  Well, then, 

why are we here?  Why isn't the city right?

 MR. PINCUS:  Because I think what the city 

has said, Your Honor, is what Monell requires is for the 

plaintiff to show something in addition to what the 

plaintiff has to -- to what the plaintiff has to show to 

(a) prove a constitutional violation, and (b) prove an 

entitlement to prospective relief. 

 The plaintiff says there is an additional 

element that may or not be present, and our submission 

is that the Ninth Circuit, although its rationale may 

have been slightly off, was correct in saying once a 

plaintiff has shown an ongoing constitutional violation 

and that the plaintiff is entitled, under standing 

principles and principles governing prospective relief, 

to relief, the plaintiff has necessarily shown a link to 

the municipality.  And there is -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So that's what you 

23

think.  So you agree -- it struck me that your argument 

could have been made by your friend on the other side. 

You say if you get an injunction, you must have shown 

municipal policy, practice, or custom.  And, therefore, 

you agree that a municipal policy, custom, or practice 

6 

is required.  That's what he thinks.

 MR. PINCUS:  Your Honor, we agree that 

causation is required.  I think the only slight fillip 

that I would make to your comment is I think in some of 

the jurisprudence that's developed focused on finding 

responsibility for past conduct, some of the ways courts 

have developed to decide those questions might be inapt 

in the -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, could you stop 

talking in the abstract -­

 MR. PINCUS:  Sure. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and give me an 

example?  Give me an example of a situation where a 

State official under Ex parte Young has been held to 

have violated the Constitution where a Monell finding 

21 

had not been a part of it. 

22

 MR. PINCUS:  I'm sorry, Your Honor -- where 

23 

Monell couldn't be satisfied? 

24

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly.

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, I think this case, to the 

24
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

extent that what the city is saying is that Monell is 

not satisfied here, is a perfect example, because 

here -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, Monell doesn't 

apply to State officials, right? 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No. 

 MR. PINCUS.  No. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I was trying to do just

2

an analogy in terms of -- because one of his arguments 

10

has been that -- that Ex parte Young doesn't have, 

11 

inherently, a Monell requirement. 

12

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, if I may, Your Honor, 

13 

just to respond to the Chief Justice's statement -­

14

15

16 

17 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you.

 MR. PINCUS:  The Petitioner's position is 

that this standard would apply also in Ex parte Young 

actions against State officials.  The Court's -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That, of course, 

19 

isn't before us.

20

21 

22 

23

25

 MR. PINCUS:  It's not before you.  The 

Court's jurisprudence is a little -- is a little 

uncertain as to whether that might or might not be true. 

There certainly hasn't been a holding to that effect. 

 But one of the reasons we think this is an 

important issue to be very clear about is because, at 

25

least on Petitioner's view and possibly on the view of 

how -- depending on how the Court analyzes the case, 

this would affect not just the universe of cases against 

municipalities, but also whether relief is available for 

ongoing constitutional violations in the very broad 

6 

group of cases against -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that would 

require -- that would require us to get into the 

question of whether Ex parte Young is a fiction or 

substance, which I certainly wouldn't like to get into. 

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, but it -- it might not, 

Your Honor, because it might turn just on whether -- I 

mean, Ex parte Young suits against State officials are 

under 1983.  And so to some -- I think the argument that 

Petitioner would make is if causation is required under 

1983, well, Ex parte Young is just a vehicle to get 

those people -- to make those people persons.  And so 

whatever the Court were to decide about causation would 

necessarily apply in those Ex parte Young actions.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I have a question 

similar to Justice Sotomayor's.  Suppose we were to hold 

that the Monell requirement applies to prospective 

relief, injunctive and declaratory relief. 

 Can you provide an example of a -- an 

unacceptable consequence that would follow from -- from 

26

that holding, a situation in which that holding would -­

 MR. PINCUS:  I think, Your Honor, we gave 

some examples in our -- in our brief.  And one I would 

give is the example of the marriage license clerk who is 

engaging in unconstitutional -- who is -- who is 

violating the Constitution and denying marriage 

licenses. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  All right -­

 MR. PINCUS:  He or she is not -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Now we have a situation. 

The clerk denies the marriage license.  And then I 

presume you can take the matter before a municipal 

policymaker, and the municipal policymaker will say: 

This is our policy, license denied.  Or this is not our 

policy. 

 And then Monell is satisfied, right? 

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, I -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If the policymaker says, it 

24 

is our policy to deny licenses under this -- under these 

25

circumstances, that's a policy.

 MR. PINCUS:  It may be that -- I don't think 

the Court has required that there be some exhaustion of 

administrative remedies.  I guess the way I would look 

at the case is, if -- if the party who is being injured 

filed suit against the municipality and against the 

official and said, I would like a marriage license, that 

-- and the court heard the case and found yes, there's 

an unconstitutional denial going on there, the fact that 

the lawsuit existed and there was an ongoing violation 

that had been, by virtue of the lawsuit, brought to the 

attention of the policymaker, and if in that case the 

judge decided that prospective relief is necessary, 

which necessarily means that there was some finding of 

ongoing violation under Lyons and those cases, that 

there would be a link to the municipality. 

 And I -- my concern is not that, properly 

applied, a causation requirement would weed out cases. 

It's that because the focus of the Court's jurisprudence 

up till now has not been on the ongoing violation as the 

possible source of a policy, but rather was there a 

policymaker involved in the initial denial, unless if 

the Court were to say there's an extra step, it were to 

make very clear that the focus of attention is not the 

initial action, in terms of finding a policy, but on the 

day -- as the matter ends up on the day the district

court is deciding whether or not to grant relief, that 

those facts are relevant in deciding whether there is a 

policy, as well. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What is -- what is the 

answer to Justice Alito's question?  The -- a clerk 

doesn't give a license to someone he should.  Right? 

Now, you bring -- that person brings a lawsuit against 

the city. 

 Now, if Monell applies, in order to win he 

has to show that it was the city's policy to deny it, or 

maybe all he has to show is the city's policy was to 

leave it up to the clerk.  And if he finds it was the 

city's policy to grant it, he's going to lose, which he 

should, because there was no such policy.  The clerk was 

wrong. 

 MR. PINCUS:  Right. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What's the harm in that? 

 Now, the next question would be:  If we show 

19 

the third, is there any ground for an injunction against 

20

the city?  And on that one, I don't know.  Maybe there 

21 

is.  Maybe conditions changed.  I don't know.

 But what's the harm to anybody in doing -­

requiring that in order -- just what I said?  What's the 

harm?

Alderson Reporting Company

in your hypothetical -- I may have misunderstood it -­

that this was a sort of a one-off decision by the -- by 

the clerk.

possibilities -- three possibilities.  The clerk denied 

6 

the license.

 (A) there is a city policy which requires

him to do it.  All right? 

 Now, those are the only three I can think 

of.  And it seems to me in (A) or (B), you could recover 

against the city, and in (C) you couldn't. 

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, I guess my -­

 Now, is that what you're arguing?  That the 

city should, even though it has no policy, nonetheless 

have to have attorneys' fees, is open to suit, et

 MR. PINCUS:  My argument is this, Your 

Honor, that if -- if there is one clerk who issues 

marriage licenses and that clerk continues to deny the 

marriage license up until the day of the lawsuit, that 

the plaintiff in that case is entitled to relief, to 

injunctive relief, because the city, by virtue of 

tolerating the conduct, has adopted a de facto policy of 

permitting it.  And the alternative is -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If you're right about 

that -­

 MR. PINCUS:  -- that there's no relief. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  If you're right 

about that, there's no problem for you because you are 

saying, yes, you need a city policy, and this counts as 

a policy. 

 MR. PINCUS:  That's exactly right, Your 

Honor.  And our concern is that the Court's 

jurisprudence, because it has been focused on 

retrospective one-off, for the most part, actions,

17

19

rather, yes, Monell's causation requirement applies, but 

we recognize that in this context it's likely to be 

satisfied by the other things that the plaintiff is 

required to prove. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's not what the Ninth 

24 

Circuit -- the Ninth Circuit said, we're not deciding 

25

the Monell question; we're leaving that -- we're leaving

that open.  But Monell -- we're not deciding because 

Monell doesn't apply to forward relief -- declaratory 

relief or injunctive relief.  And so the Ninth Circuit 

has rejected the statement in Monell itself that it 

applies to all forms of relief. 

 And so that's the question we are confronted 

with.  Because we have had experience in Monell cases 

only with damage actions, was -- was the Monell decision 

wrong in saying that that framework applies to 

declaratory and injunctive relief as well? 

 MR. PINCUS:  And, Your Honor, my response to 

that is that Monell was not wrong.  I don't know that 

Monell squarely addressed the question, but clearly the 

statute has a causation element and it has to be met.

 But what Monell didn't grapple with, because 

it itself was a case involving only a past 

non-continuing event, is how does that causation 

requirement get met in a case involving an ongoing 

violation?

 And we think that although the Ninth Circuit 

may not have had its reasoning quite right, what -­

the -- the bottom line was right, in the conclusion that 

when there is an ongoing violation and the other 

requirements for relief are met, Monell/the 1983 

causation requirement doesn't impose an incremental

burden on the plaintiff.  It's necessarily satisfied by

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think your friend

20

violation in the absence of a city policy, custom, or 

21 

practice? 

22

23 

24 

25

 You say you have to show causation to get an 

injunction.  The only way to show that the city caused 

the problem is to show that they've got a policy, 

custom, or practice, including one that might be shown 

35

by inaction.  But you still have to show that, and 

that's all Monell requires.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, now you're 

arguing whether Monell was satisfied or not, and you're 

going to get a chance to do that on remand because the 

Ninth Circuit said we're -- we're making the city pay, 

and now we're going to find out if they violated 

anything. 

 MR. PINCUS:  I agree, Your Honor, but -- but 

by -- by issuing a declaratory judgment and by finding 

that there was standing for it here, the lower court 

necessarily concluded that the city -- that there was -­

the redressability element was satisfied and that the 

16 

continuing harm element was satisfied. 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- so the Ninth 

18 

Circuit was wrong to send it back for a hearing?

 MR. PINCUS:  The Ninth Circuit -­

already shown Monell was satisfied.

 MR. PINCUS:  The Ninth Circuit, I think, 

recognized that there were two different claims in this 

case.  The Ninth Circuit sent it back for what might be 

a different question, which is damages liability.  In

It was a hearing about Monell.

 MR. PINCUS:  And -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Go ahead. 

 MR. PINCUS:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  I think 

this is one of the -- one of the issues, I think, 

with -- with simply saying, as my friend does, that 

Monell applies.  For the damages question, for example, 

whether the damages started accruing on the very first 

day the process wasn't -- wasn't provided, there might 

be a question about whether on that day there was a 

municipal policy in 2002 when this controversy started.

 It might be that on that day there was no 

municipal policy one way or another.  Maybe no one had 

confronted it.  Maybe nobody confronted it until 2006. 

 But I think one thing -- so for damages 

19 

there's a somewhat different inquiry which is, for each 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

day for which damages are claimed, was that -- is the 

policy requirement met?  This is a different question 

which is on a going-forward basis to provide -- to -- to 

be entitled to the prospective relief, what kind of 

causation is made.  And that's exactly the concern -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How can you get 

37
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

relief -- how can you get relief going forward under 

Monell unless there has been a city violation before? 

Otherwise what the injunction you're getting is just an 

injunction saying don't violate the law, and the city 

has said we haven't because you haven't shown that we 

6 

had policy, practice, or custom.

 MR. PINCUS:  But it is not necessarily true 

in this particular case that the policy -- that the 

policy was in effect from day one as opposed to 

something that -- that came into -- that -- the 

municipal responsibility might not have come to pass 

until later when a policymaker -- the city might say 

when -- when these decisions were additionally -­

initially made, no policymaker knew what our process was 

for determining the accuracy of -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If you were sued -­

 MR. PINCUS:  This lawsuit got filed, and in 

2006 somebody decided because the city took the position 

in the lawsuit and has -- has determined that it is not 

going to implement a policy that violates the 

21 

Constitution.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the test would be the

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The same test would apply 

to both damages, going forward after the date of filing 

of the suit, and injunction according to your reasoning, 

right?

 MR. PINCUS:  If -- if the damages -- if the 

injunctive test is satisfied, yes.  From the time that 

that is satisfied -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  From the time the suit is 

9 

filed both -- the injunctive test will also be the

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

damages test. 

 MR. PINCUS:  But the difference, I think, 

Your Honor, is to recover damages, the plaintiff doesn't 

have to show that the other elements of the damages 

claim don't encompass the kind of requirement of 

municipal -- of municipal involvement that is 

encompassed within the other elements of the prospective 

relief claim.  So when a case has both, our submission 

is that there is no need -- the plaintiff does not have 

to show something more to show causation than he has to 

show to show the violation and to show the entitlement 

21 

to ongoing relief. 

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let me follow this.  To 

bring a damages claim, do you have to show past damages, 

or can you just collect damages from the date you file 

suit?

 MR. PINCUS:  I think it -- I mean, you would 

have to show all the requisites, but you can decide that 

you just want to collect damages from the day you filed 

the suit.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, in -- if that's the 

complaint that you file, then -- then in that kind of a 

suit the test for damages and the test for injunction 

would be precisely the same, and you would be able to 

get damages on the basis of the mere fact that the suit 

exists, right? 

 Because they wouldn't be fighting it if it 

12 

wasn't their policy. 

13

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, there might be a question 

14 

about the precise timing on which -­

20

21 

22 

23

be a question about whether or when an official got to 

know.  This -- this suit has been going on for so 

long -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but it's 

24 

not -- defending the suit doesn't give rise to a 

25

municipal custom, policy, or practice.  They may have -­

40
 

Alderson Reporting Company

4

5

somebody comes in and says this is what's going on.  And 

they say, well, we don't -- we don't think that's 

unconstitutional.  So they're going to defend the suit. 

 That doesn't mean that they have adopted a 

policy to do what they -- the individual employee has 

6 

been alleged to have done. 

7

8

 MR. PINCUS:  And is continuing to do. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well -- or

requirement of showing a policy or practice, because 

they may defend on the ground that it's not 

unconstitutional.  They may say, look, this isn't our 

policy, this isn't our practice, but we're going to 

defend our employee because we don't think it's 

unconstitutional. 

 MR. PINCUS:  And I think that is -- that is 

an example, to go back to Justice Sotomayor's question, 

of a case that would be problematic, because at the end 

of the day when the -- when the district judge issues 

his -- says, sorry, City, you're wrong, this -- this 

employee has continued to engage in unconstitutional 

action up until today, and then the question is, should 

the -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but -­

MR. PINCUS:  -- should the plaintiff in that 

41
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2

case be entitled to some prospective relief from that 

violation, or is there some additional requirement? 

 And our position is, once that showing has

been made of a violation and once the showing has been

made that would be under Lyons that would say, yes, the 

city -- this is attributable to the city, that should be 

enough -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And so the city -­

 MR. PINCUS:  Under -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The city is in a 

catch-22 position.  Whenever they are sued, they have to 

say if we defend this, we're going to be liable under 

Monell, but if we don't defend it, then, you know, our 

policy is being changed.  Or we might -- we might want 

to have this policy; we might not.  We didn't know this 

clerk was doing that, but we might think it's a good 

idea, we might think it's a bad idea. 

 The cases are not always going to be as 

19 

clear as the hypotheticals in your -- in your brief.  It 

20

21 

22 

23 

24

25

seems to me that it's a bit much to tell the city you've 

got to choose -- when you have to choose whether to 

defend a suit, you are in fact choosing what policy or 

practice to have going forward. 

 MR. PINCUS:  But the alternative is to say, 

even if it turns out that there is unconstitutional

action going on that the city has become aware of, that 

the plaintiff who shows that does not get any relief and 

has to continue to suffer the unconstitutional violation 

for some indefinite period of time.  And that doesn't -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, he doesn't get 

relief against the city because the city is not 

responsible for what happened until they adopt a policy, 

practice, or custom. 

 Now, if they are told this is 

unconstitutional and they decide to stick with it, then 

they're -- then that's their policy and custom, and you 

can get an injunction against them. 

 MR. PINCUS:  But at the time of the lawsuit, 

14 

the plaintiff can't get prospective relief against 

15

16 

17 

18

anyone because he can't get prospective relief against 

the city.  My colleague's view is an official capacity

21 

the same limit. 

22

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  He's not entitled to 

prospective relief against the city because the city has 

not caused the alleged harm until you establish a 

policy, practice or custom.

 MR. PINCUS:  But that -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If you establish 

what the employee is doing in a suit against the 

employee, which the city is defending because he's one 

of their employees, then the city is put to a choice. 

Once -- I suppose once the legal process has concluded, 

they have to decide whether to continue that or not. 

 MR. PINCUS:  But, Your Honor, I think the 

1

 MR. PINCUS:  Excuse me -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, here you have a 

statute, and the statute doesn't have any method in it 

to get off -- get out of it, even when you should. 

Their claim is this is a State matter, the State's 

responsible, it's unconstitutional, go sue the State and 

tell the State to do it.

 Now, that's a -- what's wrong with that 

21 

position? 

22

23 

24 

25

 And either they had the power to do it under 

State law or they didn't.  If they did have the power to 

do it, then you probably will show a practice.  If they 

didn't have the power to do it, why should they bear

anything against them?  You should tell the State go do

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, two answers, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What is wrong with that?

 MR. PINCUS:  The Court of Appeals held that 

they do have the power to do it.  And we think that's 

settled for purposes of this case. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why did the State -- why 

9 

did they send it back?  I thought they sent it back in 

10

order to determine whether there was some policy against 

11 

doing it. 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 MR. PINCUS:  Look, they sent it -- one of 

the reasons they sent it back was to -- for -- so that 

the procedures could be provided or an injunction could 

be entered, directing the County to do what the statute 

requires, which is exercise its responsibility under the 

statute to make sure that the submissions are accurate.

that their conduct is unconstitutional.  And the other 

thing that the Court has -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What I'm trying to 

figure out the answer to is whether or not merely 

defending the employee in court is sufficient to 

establish that the city has that policy, custom, or 

practice. 

 MR. PINCUS:  I'm not sure that it's the act 

of defending it in court, Your Honor.  I think it's the 

ongoing conduct, almost certainly -- maybe it would be a 

question of fact -- will by virtue of the lawsuit be 

brought to the attention of policymakers. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, sure.  Sure.

 MR. PINCUS:  And, in fact, the -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you're back where 

Justice -- Justice Alito was commenting, well, that at 

some point you have to bring what you're complaining 

about to the attention of the city.  And you dismiss 

that as an exhaustion requirement, but -­

 MR. PINCUS:  No, I'm not -- I don't think 

that courts have said that filing a lawsuit is an 

impermissible way to do that.  And I think that it could 

be done by a letter also.  But the Court has said, for 

example, that there is a deliberative difference prong 

to the Monell retrospective test as well.  So that, in 

the hypothetical we've been talking about, if 

policymakers know of the ongoing conduct and they are 

indifferent to it, which they would be presumably if 

10

they're letting it continue, that that might be 

11 

satisfied.

 But -- but, to us, that just goes to the 

notion that -- it's hard to come up with a situation 

where there will be an entitlement to prospective relief 

and the requisite causation won't be satisfied.  And, 

therefore, saying there is this additional element, it 

sort of creates more harm than good because it's going 

to serve -- send courts on a search for it. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You would have liked the 

Ninth Circuit to have said there is a policy whatever, 

because the city is on notice and they've done nothing 

about it; therefore -­

decide Monell liability; we are just going to say Monell 

doesn't apply.  And if you were just thinking, well, 

what's at stake?  You say all of our cases involve 

damages; that's money.  What is involved here? 

Attorneys' fees; that's money.  So where do we bracket 

this?  Do we bracket this with the -- with damages, 

because that's money, and that's what's involved here, 

attorneys' fees?  Then the only thing that's before us 

is the award of attorneys' fees, right?

 MR. PINCUS:  That's the only thing that the 

County petitioned from, Your Honor, but I think more is 

at stake here because if this rule applied, then it 

would not only preclude attorneys' fees; it would also 

preclude the awarding of any relief.  And so, although 

this -- it happens to arise here in the attorneys' fees 

context, but if this causation requirement is more than 

just an extra box to check in terms of something 

that's -- for which the requirements will be satisfied, 

if it does screen out some cases, then it will not just 

mean no entitlement to attorneys' fees; it will mean no 

entitlement to prospective relief, and we think that's 

significant.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. COATES:  I think it's telling that we 

don't have an example of circumstances where, applying 

the Monell standards, someone couldn't get prospective 

relief where it was appropriate, where the injury was 

actually inflicted by the municipality.  I think 

Plaintiffs' view is that it's kind of the tail wagging 

the dog, that having established declaratory relief, 

that establishes causation, and that's backwards -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, they gave you an 

example.  Clerk says:  I'm not giving a marriage license 

to interracial couples; I think that's constitutional. 

Clerk resigns.  And the municipality says:  We think he 

was right, that's constitutional.  It's not our policy. 

We didn't really think about it, but we think it's 

constitutional.

 You're arguing that because it was the agent 

who made that decision, the city had no policy, you 

can't give injunctive relief ordering the city to give 

you a license.

 MR. COATES:  Assuming that that -- that the 

city's acceptance of that policy wasn't what led the 

clerk to make that decision.  It sounds like you're 

talking more of a ratification type thing on 

consideration.  Yes, we think he did the right thing.

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, how is that 

11 

different from what the Chief Justice -­

you anyway because we think it's okay. 

 Now you're calling that a policy. 

 MR. COATES:  No.  I'm saying that there are 

circumstances under which you have a policymaker that 

specifically ratifies and says this is affirmatively our 

policy, we think it's correct, as opposed to legal

arguing we think it's -­

that; they're going to say:  Policy, no policy -- we

going to defend it.  It's constitutional.  And the court

says:  What he did is not constitutional.  X has to be 

done instead by you, the municipality, even though the 

agent that you had before was acting on his or her own. 

 MR. PINCUS:  In -- in those circumstances 

where the public entity is not a party, you can only 

hold the public entity liable when its policy actually 

inflicted that injury.  These people re-apply for a 

license and they're denied, and a policymaker knows 

that, then they absolutely are going to come in under 

10

Monell, and I think it's going to be a slam dunk for

have a situation where what you are proposing is that 

you have to sue the individual actor, get a ruling on 

the constitutionality of whatever is being done, and 

then let that suit finish and ask the municipality to 

perform or not perform, and if it doesn't, then you 

relitigate all these issues? 

 MR. COATES:  In the second lawsuit, the 

municipality is being held liable for its 

unconstitutional conduct.  That's because the injury in 

the second case is absolutely inflicted as a result of a 

municipal policy, custom, or practice.  That's why. 

It's fairly attributable there.  In the first one, 

you're talking about an injury that has been inflicted

by the employee.  You know, I see the significant point 

here, again -- and the Ninth Circuit Court recognizes 

because, again, it didn't apply Monell in granting 

declaratory relief and issuing the attorneys' fees.  It 

conspicuously did not. 

 It expressly reserved the Monell issue in 

the main opinion.  It did so because, on rehearing -­

the initial opinion didn't say anything about Monell. 

On rehearing, we pointed out that those issues were 

still open, more specifically the issue of whether we 

were even free under California law to create these 

additional procedures.  That issue remains in this case. 

It's a significant issue.  Even the Ninth Circuit admits 

that.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But whether you were free to 

do it or not under California law, how can there not -­

how can it not be your policy that you have refused to 

provide these procedures which they say are 

constitutionally required?  Your policy is to follow an 

arguably unconstitutional State requirement, rather than 

comply with what is arguably required by the 

Constitution.  Why isn't that a policy? 

 Now, all that's at stake is -- and, of 

24 

course, it's a matter of practical importance, but all 

25

that's at stake is a monetary dispute between the State

of California and the County of Los Angeles, which, as 

far as the federal Constitution is concerned, is the 

same thing as the State of California.  So why should we 

be concerned about this at all?  I don't understand why 

there's not a policy here. 

 MR. COATES:  For a couple of reasons.  The 

lower courts in talking about this issue in the context 

of Monell claims against local public entities have 

said, look, if you are just enforcing State law, if you 

have no discretion, you're not really making a conscious 

decision, you have to do this under State law, you're 

essentially acting as an arm of the State Eleventh 

Amendment Ex parte Young.  I think we cite the Bockes 

case, which is an employment case where they sued a 

local entity for employment decisions that were dictated 

16 

by a State board.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes, but all that's involved 

is money between -- between California and a creature of 

California.  As far as the Federal Constitution is 

concerned, California could abolish the County of Los 

Angeles.  California could subsidize you for your 

attorneys' fees, or they could levy some sort of -­

something upon you and require you to pay them 

additional money.  None of that -- what's the 

constitutional concern in all of that?

 MR. COATES:  Well, the constitutional 

concern is that it injects a Federal court directly into 

the way that municipalities operate under California 

law.  I mean, injunctive relief -- it's even worse.  To 

issue an injunction against the County saying you have 

to do these procedural protections, notwithstanding the 

fact that the State says you shouldn't be able to do 

that, is inviting a lack of uniformity in these 

procedures throughout the State, and the State might 

want uniformity. 

 If you hold a local public entity 

automatically liable for declaratory injunctive relief 

for -- for enforcing State law, you really have 

circumstances where a local entity is going to say:  We 

don't need this fight.  We're not going to enforce this 

16 

law.  It may be defensible, but it's not on our dime. 

17

18 

19 

20

 And then you get local entities not 

enforcing State law, and that seems to be a significant 

State interest.  And I submit that these are the kind of 

federalism principles that, you know, Mozell -- Monell 

21 

is designed to take into account. 

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But do you think that the 

Federal court has to decide the issue of California law, 

namely whether you have freedom under this particular 

statute to add additional procedures to the California 

54

 MR. COATES:  They'll have to say whether 

we -- yes, I believe they will, to determine whether 

it's, in fact, a county policy or custom.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why isn't that something 

that ought to be decided in State court?  Why isn't this 

a beef between the State and the State's creature, the 

County of Los Angeles? 

 MR. COATES:  It's very much like the 

McMillian -- the McMillian case, Your Honor, with the -­

the -- the State sheriff in Alabama, who's a county 

sheriff, and the question was, for Monell purposes, does 

he act on behalf of the State or does he act on behalf 

of the county?  And the Court said that determination is 

informed by State law.  It ends up being a question of 

16 

Federal law, but it is informed by State law. 

17

 So, the short answer is that the court does 

18 

that all the time in Monell damages actions -­

19

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And California itself or 

the Ninth Circuit had a case in which the county sheriff 

was directed by a judge to garnish certain wages or 

certain accounts; the sheriff had no choice, apparently, 

other than to follow the judge; and the Ninth Circuit 

held Monell is not required when you seek declaratory 

relief against future actions, and so attorneys' fees 

55

are given.

 MR. COATES:  Correct.  Correct.  That's the 

Chaloux case in which they said that Monell simply 

doesn't apply.  We're not going to ask whether he's 

acting as a State official or a county official -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It doesn't make any 

7 

difference? 

8

 MR. COATES:  It doesn't make any difference 

9 

to the Ninth Circuit.  Other circuits have been very 

10

careful in drawing that distinction as to how county 

11 

officers -- how counties function. 

12

13 

14 

15

 As I noted, I think this goes to important 

principles of federalism.  It goes right into the way 

the States interact with their local governments.  And 

it can have a profound impact on the way in which local 

16 

governments view their obligation to enforce State law. 

17

 If the Court has no further questions, I 

18 

would submit the matter. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted. 

 (Whereupon, at 1:56 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
