The Electric Power Supply Association and        the consolidated case.               General Verrilli.          ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. DONALD B. VERRILLI                  ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONER                  GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and       may it please the Court:                 The Federal Power Act expressly authorizes      FERC to regulate the process that sets wholesale rates         for electricity, and that is exactly what FERC's        wholesale demand response rules do.                 Demand response is a resource that is bid         into the wholesale auction, and the wholesale market        operators that run those actions rely on the bids to          balance wholesale supply and demand, to set wholesale        rates, and they particularly rely on those bids in         periods of peak demand to avoid price spikes and to          avoid blackouts and brownouts.                JUSTICE KENNEDY: If there were a student in          Economics I, it seems to me that he would conclude and           his professor would conclude that wholesale affects       Alderson Reporting Company Official retail, retail affects wholesale, they're interlinked,      which means you win the case, except that the statute          makes the distinction. We have to make a distinction.           Can you tell us what the distinction is that marks the           end of the Federal power and the beginning of local          power?             GENERAL VERRILLI: So I ­­ I have several           answers to that, Justice Kennedy.                 First, we completely agree that what ­­ any        action that FERC takes at the wholesale level in some          sense is going to affect the retail market. All things           equal, if FERC sets ­­ FERC will set a higher wholesale            rate, there is going to be a higher retail price. But             that can't be a basis ­­ those kinds of effects can't be             a basis, for denying FERC's jurisdiction.                  And the case I would particularly point Your         Honor to is the Mississippi Power case. Now, there was           a case in which what FERC did was conclude that a           utility could recover at wholesale its investment in a         nuclear power plant. And what the Court held in          Mississippi Power was that that had the effect of         denying the State regulator the ability to deny that         utility recovery of those costs in the retail rates,         even though under State law they would have been         imprudent costs and not recoverable. That was a very           Alderson Reporting Company Official direct effect on the exercise of State regulatory        jurisdiction, which you do not have here, by the way, so           I think a fortiori, this is certainly permissible under          the rationale of Mississippi Power.                 JUSTICE SCALIA: I find that a pretty fuzzy           line, "very direct effect." I ­­ it seems to me that             there is a distinction between affecting retail rates,         which, as Justice Kennedy has pointed out, always        happens, and using ­­ using effect upon retail rates as          a means of regulating wholesale rates. And the argument          here is that that is what has occurred, that         effectively, FERC has raised the retail price during        peak hours because somebody who wants to purchase at         retail during peak hours not only pays ­­ you know, has           to forgo the benefit that that person would otherwise         get from FERC's program. That raises the price at          retail, and that is the means of achieving what FERC          wants to achieve.               Yes, FERC has the ­­ has the power to         regulate wholesale rates. But ­­ but, the argument is,          not through the fiddling around with retail rates, which         is what is asserted is happening here.                   GENERAL VERRILLI: So ­­ I think three         points to be made in response to that argument, Justice          Scalia. First, the ­­ the authority that's exclusively         Alderson Reporting Company Official reserved to States by Section (b) of ­­ of the          Federal Power Act is the authority over retail sales.         Every retail sale that occurs in the regime in the ­­ in            FERC's ­­ under FERC's wholesale demand response regime        is a retail sale that will occur at the rate that the             State regulator has set, and under the terms and         conditions that the State regulator has set, every        single sale that occurs that is true about.                    Second, what they have said is that this        changes the effective rate. But what I would say in            response to that, Your Honor, is that if I go out and             buy a Ferrari for $,, everybody thinks that the          price of the Ferrari is $,. Nobody thinks that          the price of the Ferrari is actually $, because         I'm foregoing the $, tax credit I can get if I            bought an electric car. The rate is what it is. It's             $,. And here, the rate is what it is.                      And third, the point I would make, it seems          to me, it's a very odd argument to say that what FERC's             rules do here is increase the retail price. What FERC's           rules do is drive the retail price down by driving the           wholesale price down by very considerable amounts in        peak periods. This is ­­ this is a system that results             in lower rates for retail consumption.                  JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, yes, ultimately, but       Alderson Reporting Company Official the question is whether that is achieved by the means of           directly managing retail rates. And you say this does          not. What if FERC ­­                             GENERAL VERRILLI: Those ­­    JUSTICE SCALIA: ­­ had sufficient funds       available that it could pay people to not purchase         electricity during peak hours? It just said, you know,          we'll give you so much per day not to use more than X             amount of electricity during peak hours. Would that ­­         would that be within FERC's powers?                  GENERAL VERRILLI: I think that would be a          harder case than this one because all of the conduct          that FERC regulates here occurs in the wholesale market.         All of it. The ­­ this is about what bids            can be  accepted into the wholesale market, what ­­                  JUSTICE SCALIA: It ­­ it's the        difference between turning over money to these retail        purchasers and simply depriving retail purchasers of a         benefit that  they could otherwise obtain in the wholesale market.                    GENERAL VERRILLI: I ­­ I think this is a            more straightforward case, because all of the conduct        that FERC regulates occurs in the wholesale market, all         of the actors are regulated in their role in the          wholesale market, and FERC's purpose in this situation        is to achieve lower wholesale rates and to allow and to           Alderson Reporting Company Official prevent ­­ allow wholesale operators to prevent       blackouts and brownouts in their ­­                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's still based        on direct price regulation of the retail rate. It may           be the same point as your Ferrari hypothetical, but         if ­­ if FERC is basically standing outside McDonald's         and saying, we'll give you $ not to go in, and the            price of the hamburger is $, somebody goes up there,          there ­­ the price of a hamburger is actually, I think             most economists would say, $, because they give up the          $, they've still got to pay the $.                    And your answer is, there's no impact on        what the States can do, because they can still say, no,           the price of the hamburger should be $, or it should be            $. The point is that ­­ that FERC is directly           affecting the retail price.                GENERAL VERRILLI: And I guess there's an         additional point to be made in response to that, Your          Honor, is that ­­ the ­­ here, of course, what FERC is            doing is saying, here are the rules by which the          wholesale market is going to operate, and if you come          into the wholesale market, these are the rules that will          apply to you.               But ultimately it remains up to the States        because FERC takes State law as it finds it here,          Alderson Reporting Company Official whether citizens of the State can go into the wholesale          market. They can only go into the wholesale market if           FERC ­­ if States agree that they can go into the           wholesale market. So it's very difficult to see that ­­                      JUSTICE SCALIA: That ­­ that's interesting.       If FERC has this power, how can it strip itself of this            power by saying, we will not do this if the States don't            want us to do it?                 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think FERC        certainly has that authority in the course of deciding         what's a just and reasonable practice. And, in fact, I            believe that that's what the Court held in New York v.           FERC with respect to FERC's decision not to regulate         the ­­ the bundled element of transmission there because         it was concerned about jurisdictional overlaps. And        there FERC didn't exercise its regulatory authority at        all. And so it's a fortiori ­­                    JUSTICE SCALIA: That's quite different.      That's quite different from saying we're going to        exercise it unless you, the States, veto it. I don't            know that if ­­ if FERC really has that power. I don't              know how it can confer a veto upon the States.                       GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, it seems to me,        Your Honor, that that's not an argument that goes to          FERC's jurisdiction. That may be an argument, although         Alderson Reporting Company Official no one has made it in this case, that if FERC believes            that this practice is ­­ that this practice is required          to have a just and reasonable wholesale rate, that ­­          that FERC can't then let States opt out.                    But, again, that seems to me to be a merits           issue, not a jurisdictional issue. And ­­ and again, I            think it's ­­ it's just incorrect under this Court's         holding in FERC v. ­­                JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I think it's goes to          whether FERC really thinks that it's meddling in ­­ in          retail rates.              ­­            GENERAL VERRILLI: No, Your Honor ­­ I know          JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what it goes to in         my mind. I think it's an acknowledgment by FERC that,            in fact, you know, we are mucking around in an area           that's the State's area. And if the States don't want           us to do it, we won't do it.                    GENERAL VERRILLI: I appreciate that, that        Your Honor dissented in New York v. FERC on a ground            very much like that. But the Court held that that was a             legitimate exercise of FERC's authority to decide what        just and reasonable practices were, to take that        jurisdictional overlap into account. And that's all        FERC has done here. It seems to me quite clear that            Alderson Reporting Company Official that is, under the logic of New York v. FERC,          permissible exercise of ­­ of FERC's authority.                   And so in a situation, it seems to me, in           which what you've got is FERC taking State law as it           finds it, you really can't say that this is a          impermissible interference or a power grab or any         intrusion into State authority because the States       ultimately make the decision.                  I ­­ in fact, I think the Federalism        argument is upside down here. This is a situation in            which what you have is a FERC rule that really is a             strong version of cooperative Federalism.                 What FERC is saying here is that this is         policy that we think works, we think brings about         billions of dollars in consumer benefits by lowering        wholesale rates.              JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it fair to say that         FERC is luring retail customers into the wholesale        market? And if that ­­                 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, well, my friend       has ­­ my friend has used that term, but I think ­­                        JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if that ­­ and if ­­         if ­­ well, if that were true, would that not be a ­­             a ­­ a serious problem for the government?                     GENERAL VERRILLI: It's wrong as a matter of          Alderson Reporting Company Official history ­­ as a matter of history. It's wrong as a             matter of law. This ­­ this idea of wholesale demand           response was not FERC's idea. FERC didn't impose it on           the market, Justice Kennedy. This is a practice that           grew up organically out of the private actions of market          participants once the wholesale markets were      deregulated. It's exactly the kind of innovative        private market conduct that you would hope that        deregulation would bring about. And the ­­ the private          actors, the wholesale market operators, brought that       idea to FERC as early as .                   JUSTICE SCALIA: One of the briefs, by the         way, says that you had no authority to deregulate it.          You know, we had a case involving the Federal          Communications Commission which wanted to dispense the       filing of tariffs on the part of everybody, I think,           except AT&T. And we held that the statute requires the           agency to regulate rates and required filed rates.        Isn't that a problem here too?                   GENERAL VERRILLI: So I'm very familiar with        that case, Your Honor.                JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I'm sure you are.                    GENERAL VERRILLI: And this case is       completely different. And in ­­ in fact, I think, you            know, when ­­  Alderson Reporting Company Official             JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I like deregulated          markets. But the ­­ the problem is, do you have the            authority to do it?                GENERAL VERRILLI: Sure. I think that         the ­­ that bridge was crossed in New York v. FERC. It             seems to me in New York v. FERC held that that ­­ that             that deregulation, that deregulatory impulse was within       the authority of FERC, and that there's nothing in the          statutory text that precludes it. And I do think that's            a key point here, that what we're talking about here at           the end of the day is FERC's authority, which this ­­          which comes down to what the statute says.                    And what the statute says, in Section       (e), is that FERC has authority over practices that         affect rates in ­­ wholesale rates. And there's just no           doubt given that all of the practices FERC is regulating          occur in the wholesale auction. They're all embedded in          the wholesale auction.               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we're ­­ if        we're ­­ obviously, that's true. But it's just as          obvious, it seems to me, that you have to have some sort            of limiting principle, otherwise FERC can do whatever it         wants. So what is the limiting principle that you would           suggest to us?               GENERAL VERRILLI: I think ­­ I think the           Alderson Reporting Company Official limiting principle has worked quite well in D.C. Circuit         for years now is that the effects have to be direct.           And it's a limiting principle akin to the kind of           limiting principle ­­ common sense limiting principle       that the Court has used in the ERISA preemption         contracts with respect to relating to.                  And with respect to direct effects, what I        would say is when you ­­ what you're talking about is           regulation of conduct that occurs in the auction itself,         participation in the auction, the rates that are        charge ­­ that are ­­ the ­­ the bids, the nature of            bids that can be accepted at the auction, the use of           those bids to balance wholesale supply and demand,        payment of the bidders at a rate that FERC prescribes,           and recoupment of that payment in the wholesale market,         all in the wholesale market that you've got as direct an           effect as you can have.                 And we're quite comfortable with the Court       drawing a line that would exclude the kinds of          examples ­­ the hypotheticals that the D.C. Circuit came         up regulating steel, regulating ­­ regulating inputs       into electric generation. We don't think FERC's        authority goes anywhere near that far.                  It ­­ but when you're talking about conduct        that occurs in the wholesale auction in the wholesale         Alderson Reporting Company Official market, it's just at the core of the practices affecting          jurisdiction that the statute ­­                JUSTICE SCALIA: That isn't the ­­ that        isn't the central conduct here. The central conduct is          the refusal to buy power during peak hours. That occurs           in the retail market. So why is that a direct effect?             What ­­ what you're ­­ what you're telling people is, if           you agree not to buy power at retail during certain          hours, we're going to pay you. I ­­ that seems to me an               indirect effect, not a direct effect.                   GENERAL VERRILLI: No, the ­­ what the        conduct ­­ that ­­ that's ­­ that is ­­ it is an            indirect effect of the conduct that FERC regulates by         market participants, the wholesale market operators and       the ­­ and the participants in the wholesale auction.         But that's an effect. The conduct that FERC regulates          all occurs in that auction. It creates that incentive,          yes it does. But all of the conduct is in that auction.             It's clearly within the text of (e)(a). And there is           no text that unambiguously ­­                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, I believe that        there is ­­ I understood the retailers are not telling           the ­­ the selling generators: "I'm not going to use           it." It is the people buying from the wholesalers,          which are a different entity from the retailers, who are           Alderson Reporting Company Official doing it.              GENERAL VERRILLI: That ­­ that ­­ that's        correct, Justice Sotomayor. And if I ­­ I would like to              make one point and then reserve the balance of my time,           if I could.                And the one point is this: There is no          statutory text that unambiguously denies FERC this       authority that it's exercising here over this wholesale        conduct. And given that, Chevron requires that the         Court uphold FERC's authority here.                 Thank you.              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.                   Mr. Phillips.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS                ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE PETITIONERS                  MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,        and may it please the Court:                  Justice Kennedy, I think I'd like to start         with the first question you asked, which is what ­­ what           do we learn essentially from Economics . And ­­ but           I think the way that you have to think about it is in             terms of the actual market that operates in this         particular case, which is a wholesale market.                    It's not a market that covers the entire         United States. It covers less than half the States.          Alderson Reporting Company Official But it is an important market that was created in order           to create a basis for competition.                   And up to this point, up prior to the demand          response initiative that was not adopted by FERC, but         was, in fact, pushed by my clients and those we          represent in private business, what we were trying to do          was to create a demand­side component to that wholesale          market. Because trying to regulate exclusively or        trying to ­­ to deal exclusively with the supply side          wouldn't work, or it's not as effective as it could be,           or certainly wouldn't necessarily guarantee you just and        reasonable rates.              And so tariffs were filed in order to        provide a basis for putting in the demand side. And the             reason why this is a direct effect on the ­­ on the             wholesale rates is because it's an absolute one­to­one        relationship.             If I put in a unit of ­­ of or reduce a unit                of demand, I don't need as much supply, and that affects            the price directly. And that's the direct relationship         that derives from the economic principles.                  And ­­ and to my mind, the entirety of ­­ of           the Federal Power Act, in , , , asks you in the            first instance to look at the wholesale market that         exists. Alderson Reporting Company Official             And then once you do that, then is this ­­         you know, it's not: Does it affect the retail rate?           Clearly it will. The question is: Did what FERC do            here in the order directly affect the wholesale rate?         And on that score, it seems to me there's no question.                                   Then the issue becomes what ­­     JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I think moving          directly to control retail prices, subsidizing certain       retail purchases, that also would directly affect the        wholesale rate. And ­­ and does that mean FERC is           authorized to do that?                MR. PHILLIPS: I don't know that it would          directly affect the wholesale rate in nearly as        exquisite a fashion as the regulation in this case,          because again, you're talking about the exact same        transactions going on in affecting supply and demand.        Nothing can affect the wholesale rates that way.                    If I make an effort to manipulate the retail          rates, maybe eventually it will affect the wholesale        rates, but it will do it in ways that are very indirect            as we explained in our reply brief. It may go up; they             may go down. It's impossible to know.                    There's no way to doubt that if I reduce          supply, that that will in ­­ or if I ­­ yeah. If I               reduce supply, that will cause the ­­ the rates, the          Alderson Reporting Company Official wholesale rates to drop as a natural consequence.                     JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't mean to jumped         forward too ­­ too quickly to, really, the second         question, did FERC comply with its obligation to explain         the ­­ the reason for its change, but it ­­ it does seem             to me that ­­ that they come close together.                     FERC's argument is essentially circular.     It ­­ it says, well, the market forces will ­­ will work            this out, but we define the market. That seems to me            circular.             MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean ­­ I don't know            that we define the market. We've allowed the market to           be created.              JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, there are two         parts to this argument: One is jurisdiction; the other          is whether ­­              MR. PHILLIPS: Right. No, I understand         that. But the question is what price will allow this ­­           will ­­ will promote this market, to create incentives         to allow you to have enough on the supply side ­­ on the             demand side, I'm sorry ­­ in order to make this          meaningful?             And what the FERC said was, when we had         experience with one of the regional transmission       operations, what happened when they reduced the price?        Alderson Reporting Company Official The amount of the demand response dropped precipitously.                    And as a consequence of that, based on that          experience, we now have enough evidence by which to say,          wait a second, we need to go back and raise the price in              order to bring in more of the demand response, in order           to ensure that there is a reasonable balance between the           supply and the ­­ and the demand. But all of that's in             the wholesale market.               This ­­ this doesn't come close to violating        the principle of Louisiana Power where this Court said,         what is the retail authority that is preserved to the          State? And that's to set the rates for retail sales.                       The State ­­              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The problem is ­­                   MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry, Your Honor.                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: ­­ that what FERC is         doing basically leaves the States with the pure        formality of setting the rate that is going to be          directly affected by what FERC is doing.                   In my hypothetical, if you remember, I mean,         they get to say how much the hamburger costs once you           get in the store, but FERC can respond to it directly by            setting the price to encourage you not to enter the          store.             If I ­­ if ­­ if$ ­­ we'll give you $ not             Alderson Reporting Company Official to enter, and a burger is $, if it's ­­ the State gets              to say, no, no, we want it to be $, and then FERC just              says, all right, we'll give you $ not to enter.                      MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But that all assumes         that what ­­ what FERC is trying to do here is to, in             fact, directly regulate the rates. That's not ­­ that          was never the intention behind this exercise.                   The intention here is to try to       manipulate ­­ not to manipulate, but to control ­­                                JUSTICE KENNEDY: It may not be ­­       MR.

PHILLIPS: Right. But ­­ but the         JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you say, oh, well, we         didn't mean this, but we're doing it.                   MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I ­­ you know, ONEOK          sort of says what you intend, what you ­­ what your           intent is and what's directed at actually controls in         some ways this area, but we're talking about a situation           of concurrent jurisdiction between the State and the        Federal government in this particular context.                  And so the fact that there are going to be          Alderson Reporting Company Official effects on the retail rates doesn't deprive FERC, which         ultimately is the supreme authority here, as long as it          operates within the sphere of adopting ­­ of dealing         with a practice, regulating a practice that will in fact            affect the wholesale rates. And that's precisely what         it has tried to do in this particular context.                     And ­­ and, Justice Kennedy, I don't think         there's a problem with respect to the way the rates were            set, because again, if you do it in the ­­ in this very             sort of fundamental Economics approach, which       Dr. Khan is the one who ­­ who was the primary proponent            of it, said, look, if you're ­­ if you're taking out           demand, if you're ­­ if you're reducing demand, that         affects supply directly, and therefore, you should       compensate them exactly the same.                 And FERC looked at that and said, you know,         that makes perfect sense to us. That's an appropriate          way to go. That will ­­ you know.                     That's not a ­­ that's not luring people;         that's just providing a basis upon which there will be           enough of a market in order to allow the wholesale side            of the ­­ of the grid system to operate in an efficient            way. Not only to reduce the wholesale prices, which is           important, but even more fundamentally, Your Honor, to        protect the reliability of the grid.      Alderson Reporting Company Official             That was what prompted, frankly, the initial       effort to deal with this entire demand response issue,         was to figure out what are we going to do about           brownouts? What are we going to do about blackouts?          How are we going to be able to ­­ because we can't do it              if we just do it on the ­­ on the ­­ on the generation              side.             We need to reduce the demand in order to         ensure that in response to these kinds of crises, there          is an answer.               This is the answer. Commission has operated        exactly the way it ought to have under these         circumstances.             JUSTICE SCALIA: Why ­­ why ­­ why aren't         all the companies in agreement with you? Why are there           some ­­ some private companies on the other side?                     MR. PHILLIPS: Well, most of the private        companies on the other side generate electricity and        would prefer not to manipulate the supply side because         they're ­­ they're ­­ I mean, manipulate the demand side           because they like to have all of the supply side going           to as far as you can take it.                    JUSTICE SCALIA: But they're not all       generators I don't think.                 MR. PHILLIPS: They're pretty ­­ I mean,         Alderson Reporting Company Official there's a substantial number of them. I mean, the vast             majority of them on the other side are ­­ are          generators, Your Honor.               JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, maybe your      colleague can ­­ can answer it.                   MR. PHILLIPS: I'll let him count up his        amicus briefs, if he ­­ if he wishes.                    And ­­ and the last thing I guess I would            say is ­­ is I agree with General Verrilli's point, that            if at ­­ at all ­­ if all else fails, this is clearly a              question ­­ these are both questions that are ­­ in          which the Commission deserves deference. It deserves        deference on the question of the scope of its         jurisdiction, and it assuredly deserves deference,      Justice Kennedy, in deciding as between locational       marginal price and locational marginal price minus G or          minus G plus A, or however you would go about that.                        If there's any issue upon which this Court        ought to say the Commission gets a ­­ gets more than a             thumb on the scale, it would be that issue.                     If there are no further questions, Your       Honor. Thank you.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,      Mr. Phillips.              Mr. Clement.  Alderson Reporting Company Official             ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                 MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:                 I don't usually start in this Court by       telling you who I represent, but I think I better do it               here, which is I represent not just EPSA, which is a            group of power generators, but a number of other ­­          other organizations.              So the vast majority of the people that I         represent are load­serving entities who are not       exclusively on the supply side. They're actually the         regulated public utilities that actually could provide       demand response in a wholesale, meaningful level by         working, as they have since long before FERC got in this           business, to work with retail customers and their State         regulators to provide for reduced retail demand at peak         time. So that's who I represent.                    Now what I'd like to start, beyond telling        you who I represent, is with the notion of what FERC was             trying to do here, which was to reduce retail demand by           providing payments to retail customers on an otherwise        wholesale market in an effort to change the effective         price for retail sales.                Now, that sure sounds like something that       Alderson Reporting Company Official belongs to the States. So the answer you hear ­­                                              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where is that ­­      MR. CLEMENT: ­­ from the general ­­       JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where is that in ­­       written anywhere that that was their goal? That's how          you've characterized that goal. But what I've heard         them say is, we're trying to lower the price of          wholesale to a more just amount. That's what's in           anything I've seen written. You've recharacterized it.                    MR. CLEMENT: I don't think it's just a          characterization battle ultimately. But even if you        want to stipulate that they are trying to reduce retail          demand for the best of wholesale reasons, it's still ­­                     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They're not in the       retail market.                          MR. CLEMENT: What? I'm sorry?       JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They're ­­ they're      generators selling to intermediaries. The      intermediaries are the ones who are in the market with          the retailers.              MR. CLEMENT: That's not correct, Justice       Sotomayor. It's crystal clear, and I don't think the           Solicitor General will contradict me in his rebuttal,        that what FERC does uniquely in this context is invite          retail customers, directly large retail customers ­­      Alderson Reporting Company Official JUSTICE BREYER: That's true. That is true.         MR. CLEMENT: ­­ directly on the wholesale        JUSTICE BREYER: That is true. What you say                      That ­­             exchange.             is true. Every reduction in demand for a unit of retail             electricity is ipso facto a demand for a reduction of a             unit of wholesale electricity, and vice versa. So it's          hardly surprising that anything they do in the wholesale         market that adds to demand will add to demand in retail,           and vice versa.               But I thought that their motivation here is         the following: On the th of August at : p.m.,           people turn on electricity for air­conditioning. That's        the peak hour. The industry, leaving reserves out of          this as a fixed matter, has to supply that. So if there              are not enough generators at : p.m. on August the          th, they have to build one.                  And to build an additional generator ­­ I        don't know what gas costs now, but let's imagine it's          $,, and that will be passed on in the wholesale          price, and then probably, though the States are free to          do what they want, in the retail price.                    So FERC thinks I have another way of doing          this. For only $,, I can be sure that on the th              Alderson Reporting Company Official of August at : p.m., the demand is not great enough           to spend the , and so we group the people who will            promise to fulfill their air­conditioning at other       times.             That way, the price of wholesale electricity       falls. And, therefore, we satisfy all demand at a lower            price. We are interested in wholesale. We are          interested in how to satisfy peak wholesale demand. And          we have worked out a way to do it cheaper. Of course it               affects retail prices, so does everything we do in         respect to wholesale prices. End of the matter.                     So I accept your characterization, but I do          not see any law that prevents them from raising or          lowering wholesale price despite the fact that that        affects retail price.               MR. CLEMENT: And I certainly wouldn't be         here suggesting that anything that happens in the        wholesale market that affects retail price is somehow        verboten to FERC. But I am here to say that when you              regulate wholesale prices, essentially as Justice Scalia       suggested, through the retail market, that that crosses        a very important boundary in the Federal Power Act. And           with all due respect to your question, your approach to          this would make perfect sense if FERC were the only          regulator on this scene, but ­­     Alderson Reporting Company Official             JUSTICE BREYER: It didn't affect ­­ it        didn't try ­­ what it said was, we have a group of             people who will put customers together, and those        customers will, in fact, cut demand at : p.m. on          August th. As I say, that affects retail price; so            does everything.                          MR. CLEMENT: But ­­ but ­­      JUSTICE BREYER: And ­­ and what is the         difference here ­­ and that's what you want to get at,           so I'm letting you do it ­­                              MR. CLEMENT: I ­­ I ­­        JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ the difference here and        what I just said? Everything.                   MR. CLEMENT: The difference here is that        the customers they're targeting are retail customers,       and the very fact ­­ and this is what I ­­ where I              really wanted to go, which is, I think the Solicitor           General goes a long way to conceding that this really is            going at retail ­­ the retail market and the retail          level of demand matters, and he will concede that we're          changing ­­ they're changing the effective price of        retail electricity.              The only ­­ the saving grace for them is,         ah, but we're limiting ourselves to the wholesale        market, and we're the wholesale regulator. So why         Alderson Reporting Company Official shouldn't we do it?                Here's the problem: These retail customers       don't belong on the wholesale market. Whether you think          they were lured in or you think they walked in the door,            it doesn't matter. They are on a market where they            don't belong. The fact that they are regulating in this           context and this context alone, retail customers       directly, is a profound signal that they've overstepped         their jurisdictional bounds.               And I think the way you can understand why          the fact that they're on the wholesale market is not a           complete answer is to consider the following scenario,        which doesn't seem all that farfetched, which is to say          a large retail consumer of electricity, let's call it         Wal­Mart, decides, you know what, I like the prices on           the wholesale market better, and I buy more electricity          than a lot of load­serving entities in small         jurisdictions. So I'm going to walk on to the wholesale           market run by an ITO or an ITO, and I'm going to buy             electricity for my own consumption at a better price.                      If they did that, I don't think there is any           question that that would be a retail sale that could           only be regulated by the States. And if that actually           happened, then the RTOs and ISOs would have to make a           choice. They would either open themselves up to         Alderson Reporting Company Official regulation simultaneously by FERC and the States for        that retail transaction, or they would do what I think           they probably would do, which is, one regulator is         plenty.             We're just going to say that Wal­Mart can't        come on to our market and buy retail gas directly from a            generator. And that's the world we live in. Wal­Mart           can't walk on that market and buy ­­                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's the ­­ what's        the horror here of concurrent jurisdiction? You seem to          posit that this is horrible, but if, in fact, it's          lowering prices, Wal­Mart sees it as a lowering of          prices, I ­­ hard to think of why States would say no,             but some of them have. But I'm not sure what the            problem is with concurrent jurisdiction.                 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Your Honor, I'm not        sure, ultimately, that my burden is to show that this is           horrible as opposed to ultra vires. But let me try to            explain to you why concurrent jurisdiction is an anomaly         in the context of the Federal Power Act. I mean, this             Court, on numerous occasions, has said that although        you ­­ sometimes it's hard to divide the lines. Once           you do, generally the Federal government operates in its         exclusive sphere of the wholesale market, and the States         regulate in ­­ exclusively in the retail market.        Alderson Reporting Company Official             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they all ­­ each of         them affect each other.                MR. CLEMENT: But here's the problem ­­       yeah, normally they stay away from each other and each          other's customers.              Another thing that is a complete anomaly        that FERC has created here that, as far as I'm aware,           exists nowhere else in the energy world, is you actually          have the Federal government and the Federal regulators        and the State regulators bidding against each other for         the same customers to reduce their same retail demand.                     And the other side has made a very big deal           that none of the States raised a jurisdictional         objection before FERC itself. But there were a number           of States, Ohio, Illinois, and all of the States that          are participants in the MISO, one of the ISOs. And what            they told FERC is, by all means, do not set the           compensation level at LMP, because that's too high. And          by setting it so high, what you are going to do is            you're going to crowd out our own efforts at dealing          with demand response. Because we love demand response.         We want demand response. But we don't want to pay twice            as much as the market really should pay for demand          response. And if you're out there offering our same          retail customers the ability to get demand response paid         Alderson Reporting Company Official at huge LMP levels, then we're going to be crowded out.                       Now, the only response that FERC can offer        to that is, well, then just opt­out, come on, you know.                       First of all, that's the third anomaly here,        because there's no other area of regulatory authority        where FERC allows States to opt­out. And if you think           about what they're opting out and compare it to their          legal theory, it doesn't work. I mean, since when is            FERC all of a sudden enthusiastic about State         experimentations with practices that directly affect      wholesale rates?              In every other context where they actually       have jurisdiction, wholesale rates, transmission, not      only would they not allow State opt­outs, but they would          say it's going to lead to discrimination in a way that            would be unjust and unreasonable.                 So the opt­out option here, though, doesn't       work for another reason, which is it's worse for the          States that most want to provide for demand response.         Because what they're being told is, all right, you have          a subset of your customers who are actually interested         in demand response. And if you want to opt­out, what           you have to tell your customers who are interested in          demand response is we're actually going to pass a         regulation that restricts you, and you can't go into the          Alderson Reporting Company Official Federal market and get a better rate ­­                                JUSTICE BREYER: I guess if you're ­­        MR. CLEMENT: ­­ you're going to have to         take a lousier rate.                 JUSTICE BREYER: If you're right, then I        guess the FERC could not direct the grid approvals in a           way that would, in fact, prevent certain retail        customers from buying electricity at certain times. I         guess that FERC could not, in fact, allow large         consumers of electricity to buy at wholesale, because        that would take the retail customers away from the         jurisdiction of the State.                  I guess that FERC could not, in fact, insist        upon a marginal capacity being generated from natural         gas instead of from other things, because that will         affect the price of natural gas, will affect the         wholesale rate, thereby raising the retail rate, thereby        stealing customers away from, let's say, Ohio, where it         goes up, and forcing them to go to Texas.                       I mean, I have not been surprised that I         have found no case in which FERC ever tried to do           anything roughly comparable or even by the roughest        analogy that would say that they cannot do this for the           reason you suggest.               MR. CLEMENT: Well, Your Honor, there is a         Alderson Reporting Company Official lot in that question, but let me just respond ­­                     JUSTICE KAGAN: No, all there were meant to         be was three examples, and I don't know how good they            are, but they come to mind.                  MR. CLEMENT: Well, with all due respect, a         couple of them aren't that great because ­­                   (Laughter.)             MR. CLEMENT: ­­ because you seem to suggest         that if you can't do this, well, then FERC can't          essentially tell generation resources that we don't want        any more coal generation; we only want natural gas.         And, of course, they can't do that because the Federal          Power Act reserved the plenary authority of regeneration        to the States.               You also suggested if they can't do that,        then they can't allow Wal­Mart to helpfully walk into         the wholesale market and buy at retail.                   JUSTICE BREYER: I was grasping your point,         which I hadn't grasped previously. And your point seems           to be that the problem here is the way they are reducing            the demand, and therefore, the cost of wholesale        electricity, is by taking a ­­ groups of people and           preventing them from buying electricity at all at        certain times, which, of course, affects their buying        retail. Alderson Reporting Company Official             Isn't that basically your point? And if it         is, I was trying to think with that argument. That's ­­            that's why I said that you can skip the whole thing if             you want.              MR. CLEMENT: Well, here ­­ here's a way          of ­­ of trying to harmonize that, which is I think that             the line that the Federal Power Act divides ­­ draws is           between retail sales and wholesale sales. And I believe           that this is impermissibly on the retail side of the          line.               I think my friends on the other side       ultimately think that the difference isn't between       retail and wholesale but is between sales and nonsales,         because they appear to concede my Wal­Mart example in         the retail world. Which is to say, on page of the             SG's brief, I think they pretty much concede that          Wal­Mart cannot walk on to a wholesale market and          purchase gas at retail without coming into the scope of          the State regulators.                 I think they also concede that, if the       government's interest here was not to suppress retail        demand but to increase it, they thought, you know, if we           could just sort of boost retail demand a little bit,           we'd get a whole bunch of these new green resources           online and it would actually make, you know, everything         Alderson Reporting Company Official better.             So we want to increase retail demand. So         here's what we're going to do: We're going to have           either directly or through the wholesale operators ­­       we're going to pay a bonus to people who increase their            retail purchases.              That, I believe, my friends on the other         side say, well, no FERC couldn't do that because that          would affect a fully­consummated sale.                  So their position seems to be although we        can pay ­­ we can't pay incentive payments to increase          retail demand, we can pay incentive payments to reduce         retail demand.              Two observations about that: One is, why in         the world would that make sense? I mean, why in the             world would ­­ would Congress have divided the authority         here in a way that allows the Federal government to           suppress retail demand but not increase retail demand?                    The second thing that I want to say about          that anomaly, though, is the line between sales and         nonsales can't be the right line because it ­­ if it is,            then not only can they do what Justice Scalia suggested,          which is have FERC pay a direct bounty not to purchase.            And I was actually quite surprised by the Solicitor          General's answer to that. And he ­­ and he didn't fully            Alderson Reporting Company Official complete the answer. He said that would be a harder            case, but he didn't ultimately say how that would be          answered.               I think he has to say that, if FERC sort of          cut out the wholesale operators and just said, we got a           new appropriation, and every retail customer that       reduces their retail consumption gets a $ check from          FERC, that has to be consistent with their position that          FERC can do it because it doesn't interfere with a fully            consummated sale.              But we're still ­­ if they're right, then        what FERC can do tomorrow is solve this problem much          more directly. They can say, retail customers, you         cannot buy at peak times. You simply can't. We're not            going to allow it. Because that's going to reduce          the ­­ the ­­ the wholesale demand. It's going to avoid            brownouts. It's going to take all the pressure off our           grid. So that's it. No more purchases on August th.                        JUSTICE SCALIA: And they're not regulating       the rate of sales.                MR. CLEMENT: They're not regulating the       rate of sales. So, you know, never mind. Or ­­ or ­­             or the rate of sales is ­­ is either zero or infinity            because you can't do it.                 But any way you think about it, that has to          Alderson Reporting Company Official be the implication of their theory that there is a          categorical difference between ­­               JUSTICE BREYER: They have to be reasonable        in what they do under Chevron. It's a broadly­phrased           statute. What they have to do is reasonable.                     And so really the question is: Is what         they're doing here unreasonable?                            MR. CLEMENT: Well ­­    JUSTICE BREYER: And ­­ and I ­­ and we're           not electricity regulators; they are. It's pretty tough         and technical.              And ­­ and so that's why I ­­ I've been           trying to figure out just what it is about this thing           that, in your view, makes it unreasonable.                   MR. CLEMENT: And what is unreasonable is        that, before you get to a Chevron question, certainly          before you get to an arbitrary and capricious question,         you have to have jurisdiction for FERC to do this.                      And the basic division of authority in       (b) of the Federal Power Act is that the Federal          government gets sales for resales and the States get all          other sales.              And I think it's important to recognize that         you really have to wrestle upfront with the (b)         question because the other side loves to talk about          Alderson Reporting Company Official and in the practices affecting language. But the          problem with that is that (b) specifically says that         the provisions of this subchapter, which include and         , shall apply to sales for wholesales and shall not          apply to all other sales.                 So you don't get to and if what is           being regulated front and center is a retail sale of           electricity.                         JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement ­­     JUSTICE KENNEDY: And at some point of ­­ I          want you just to assume that there is jurisdiction, but          to discuss your point that section ­­ that Rule ,          particularly, was arbitrary and capricious, I assume,        because adequate reasons or no reasons were given. Or          maybe there's some other point. But at some point          before your time runs out.                 MR. CLEMENT: I ­­ I ­­ I will definitely do              that, Your Honor. I don't know if you had a question              that goes to jurisdiction that you want to talk ­­ I           mean ­­             JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you mind, Justice       Kennedy, if I ­­                JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, of course.                  JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes?                  I mean, I take it that the ­­ the         Alderson Reporting Company Official implications of your argument is that FERC can't do         anything with respect to demand response; is that right?                     MR. CLEMENT: No, that's not right. My         position is that FERC can't do anything with demand         response with retail customers. They can do demand         response, true wholesale demand response, which they       were actually doing before they went down this route and          around, you know, the ­­ the two ­­ early s.                      And the way that wholesale demand response       works is the way you sort of naturally think it would           work, which is through a participant in the wholesale          market, namely through the load­serving entities who are        mostly my clients.               Because the way you can sort of do this is          you work cooperatively with the States and the LSEs, and          you encourage them, as Congress suggested in (e) of         the ­­ of the National Policy Act or the Energy Policy           Act. You encourage them to do all sorts of things to            reduce their demand, and then there's just less demand         bid in to the auction in the first place. And so supply             meets demand at a much lower level.                    Just for completeness sake, you can also       have wholesale participants participate in a      demand/response program in the forward­capacity markets,      where, again, it would be the LSEs. And what they would            Alderson Reporting Company Official do is say, we're going to ­­ we're going to ­­ three            years hence, we're going to reduce our compensation ­­        or our ­­ our consumption by this level, and we're going           to do it on the local level.                   And just to further complete that thought,       you know, it's ­­ it's nice to talk that FERC has been            doing this since , but the States have been doing          this long before that, at least since the s.                     And there is a brief for other respondents         that I don't represent, the Midwest load­serving        entities. And it's worth a ­­ it's a short brief, but              it's worth a quick read because what they say is, look,            we've been doing this at the State level since .          We're a local utility. We work with our local           regulator. Because we have plenary authority over the         retail market, we can deal with demand response in all          sorts of ways that FERC could never imagine. And we can            do things like basically go in and get a local customer            to agree with us to change the way ­­ their thermostat.           We can go in, send somebody in, put different hardware          in there, and then, based on a reduction in their retail            rates, we can get them to agree that basically, on a hot             day in the summer, we get to take over your thermostat.           And we directly impose demand response through that.                    And that's the kind of thing that States        Alderson Reporting Company Official have been doing since the 's. And that's the kind of            things that are going to be crowded out by this          one­size­fits­all rule with the high LMP      compensation recipe.              JUSTICE KAGAN: And so this sort of        practice, though ­­ so I'll just narrow the question ­­         where it's retail actors who are bidding into a         wholesale market.                          MR. CLEMENT: Right.    JUSTICE KAGAN: I take it that there, there          would be a regulatory gap. In other words, FERC can't            do anything nor can the States do anything.                    MR. CLEMENT: I ­­ there is not a ­­ a             regulatory gap. I don't think FERC can do anything.           And I would answer it by reference to my Wal­Mart hypo            going in to buy.                If Wal­Mart went in to buy ­­ so if a retail            customer on the buy side sort of walks into a wholesale            market ­­ it's not that lightning strikes and they can't          do it. It's that it's a retail transaction. So if             anybody can regulate it, it's the States.                   So there's not a regulatory gap. In theory,          a State could regulate the transaction even though it         takes place on an otherwise wholesale market.                     I think as a practical matter ­­ I don't          Alderson Reporting Company Official want to ­­ as a practical matter, I don't think the ISOs              and the RTOs want to be regulated by both FERC and the            States. So I think what they would do is, ah, if the              price of having a retail customer on our otherwise          wholesale market is we get State regulation on top of          Federal regulation, then we're going to bar the door to          the retail customer.               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe you can turn        to the question Justice Kennedy asked you to address.                     to.             MR. CLEMENT: I ­­ I ­­ I would be delighted              If I could say one last thing about         jurisdiction, which is simply I ­­ I do think, though,            that the premise of the other side's argument is that          the sky will fall if you don't have this precise type of            retail customer on wholesale market demand response.       And there, I think, it's worth taking a look at the             Southern company's brief, because they operate in a part          of the country that doesn't have an RTO or an ISO.                       JUSTICE KAGAN: It ­­ it is an odd result,          given this Energy Policy Act which made it so clear that           Congress liked demand response that it wanted FERC to         lower barriers to demand response, to then say, well,         FERC has no jurisdiction to do exactly what the policy          that Congress articulated is.    Alderson Reporting Company Official             MR. CLEMENT: But the problem with that way         of looking it, Justice Kagan, with all due respect, is I           think it looks only at (f), which is the one          reference to what FERC's supposed to do, and it ignores          (e) where Congress recognized that the States are        the primary actors here.                And the point I was making about the         Southern company brief is operating in an area without         ISOs, without RTOs, so without FERC, they actually have         a greater level of demand response than other parts of          the country that have the Federal rule.                   So to bring us to the arbitrary and        capriciousness question, I think, Justice Kennedy, the        way I think about it is that we have both procedural            objections and substantive objections.                The procedural objections are essentially     that there are all sorts of objections to using LMP as           the price to provide compensation.                 That wasn't just my clients. That was also         the States that I alluded to who were worried that this            high level of compensation would crowd out their effort.                     It was a particularly poignant comment from        the ­­ the ­­ some of the ITOs and RTOs who design            these ­­ run these wholesale markets.                  And the ones that I thought were most         Alderson Reporting Company Official persuasive in some respects was the operators of the         MISO, the midwestern one, because at FERC's direction,        they basically spent two years trying to come up with ­­          get all the stakeholders in a room and come up with a             formulation ­­ a compensation formula that worked. And          what they came up with was essentially LMP minus G.                      And after having spent two years with all        the stakeholders coming up with LMP minus G, they were          then told by the Federal government at a late breaking           hour that there was a one­size­fits­all solution, and it          was LMP.              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, wait a minute.        That's the classic choice that we give agencies. They          had expert testimony, Dr. Khan, who was undisputed to be          a leading expert in this field, say the opposite. I           mean, how do we choose to go into the weeds of something            as technical as that ­­                MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think ­­                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ when that's been       entrusted to the agency?                MR. CLEMENT: Surely it has. But the reason          I started with the procedural way of coming at this is           the D.C. Circuit has lots of arbitrary and capricious         cases, and they are quite comfortable in saying that, in          circumstances like this, you didn't respond adequately       Alderson Reporting Company Official to the comments that were put before you.                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would you tell me which        one? I mean, I looked through everything that the            dissenter said, and there is at least one or two or           three paragraphs in the FEC's report on this that         directly explains why they chose a different route.                     MR. CLEMENT: Well, there is certainly ­­                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The ­­ the ­­ the court         below didn't give us one comment by the dissenter that          wasn't addressed by something said in the report.                    MR. CLEMENT: Well, I can give you an          example, Justice Sotomayor, if it will help, which is         that Chairman Mueller in his dissent ­­ Commissioner        Mueller in his dissent actually used a hypothetical that          is very similar to the hypothetical discussed in our         brief and the SG's brief about a factory and how if ­­            if you have full LMP, a factory will essentially reduce           its production at time periods where it's economically        inefficient for them to do so.                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And they ­­ and they        recognized that, and what did they say?                   MR. CLEMENT: They ­­ they had no ­­                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Only when it's      economically feasible will we pay this price.                   MR. CLEMENT: Well, the way I read the ­­          Alderson Reporting Company Official the way I read the record, Your Honor, is that there was             no response to that hypothetical, just as there was no          response in the SG's ­­                JUSTICE SCALIA: The response was where it        doesn't work, we won't use it, which I didn't find a            very satisfactory response. Isn't that essentially what        they said?              MR. CLEMENT: I'm not even sure they ­­ they          said that much, but I don't think they really grappled           with it.              And to whatever extent they ­­                 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought that the response         was what Justice Sotomayor, and the way ­­ I wouldn't           characterize it that way, but it's called the "net         benefits test." And the net benefits test means this is           not a one size fits all.                   And then in the order, at paragraph , ,         page , they go through a bunch of methodologies, and           they ­­ I mean, they say, we're picking this one.                       And the reason that they pick this one, I         guess, is they think it's ­­ if you try a G thing, that               also is a problem administratively.                  Okay. Now, I'll just read those. Is there          anything else you're going to tell me that ­­ I'll read           them and see what they say, right?       Alderson Reporting Company Official             MR. CLEMENT: Sure. Well, I would ­­ I           would ­­ I would encourage you to look at the FTC            comments, the Joint Appendix page , the comments of         the States.                I mean, I would think that when you have         another coordinate part of the federal government come        in and say, you are picking the wrong compensation level          and it will be affirmatively inefficient and will crowd         out other uses for demand response, that you'd at least          owe them something more of an explanation than grouping         them in a footnote with every other commentator you got           and say, we're not persuaded by that.                   There is, though, I think ­­ and I would ­­           actually, you know, I ­­ I didn't think I would come up               here talking about net benefits test, but I actually          would ­­             JUSTICE BREYER: I'll read ­­ Cicchetti that        writes about that in the brief, doesn't he?                    MR. CLEMENT: Yes. Yes.                  JUSTICE BREYER: And so I think that's the          best brief to read on that.                  MR. CLEMENT: Yes.                JUSTICE BREYER: Right? Okay.                  MR. CLEMENT: And ­­ and ­­ and what I would            say beyond that about the net benefits test is here's          Alderson Reporting Company Official another way in which the ­­ the compensation formula is          what I would call substantively arbitrary and        capricious.             The whole formula is built on the idea that         there is an ­­ an equivalence between less demand and          more actual supply of energy. But of course, when you           get to the nitty­gritty of it, it turns out that's not           true, because the great thing about actual supply of         energy is that other wholesale ­­ real wholesale        customers buy it, and then the market clears naturally.                     But when you start getting a third­party in         there, a retail customer who really doesn't belong there          and start saying, we're going to pay you money, but that           money doesn't actually result in load that ­­ a         load­serving entity pays for, that creates a deficit in          the wholesale account.               JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is one way to think about         that is that the ­­ FERC's argument is circular. It           says, well, the market will take care of this, but we           define the market.               MR. CLEMENT: Yes. And yet, it's ­­ the          market really can't take care of it because the market's          designed to simply get a bunch of wholesale sellers and           a bunch of wholesale buyers together, and the price of          the sales and the price of the purchases equal each          Alderson Reporting Company Official other out, and everybody goes home happy.                   But when you invite retail customers on and        say, guess what, we're going to pay you not to buy, that            creates a market imbalance.                 The FERC euphemistically refers to this is       the billing unit effect. And then they have to solve           that by making adjustments to the market clearing price.         And then to make sure they don't go too far down, they            apply the net benefits test, which is not only         mind­bogglingly complex, but FERC itself recognizes that       it's imperfect.              The last thing I want to say, though, about          sort of the substantive unreasonableness about this is        there is a more fundamental problem here, and it's ­­ I            think the economist's brief on our side gets at this          very well, which is at the end of the day, if FERC gets             to do this on the wholesale markets, what is being          purchased is not energy, actual energy that's been        bought and then sold. What is being sold is an option            to buy electricity at a subsidized retail rate.                     And in any other market ­­ I mean, think of           a stock where I have an option to buy it at and the               market price is . Lots and lots of people are going            to offer me , for that option because I have a             valuable right to buy something at a below­market price.          Alderson Reporting Company Official             But nobody is going to offer me for the          option to buy at just because the market price is at            . But that is exactly what FERC has done by setting            the compensation rate at LMP.                 And they made mincemeat out of poor       Dr. Kahn, because what Dr. Kahn really says is that the           market signal that the customer ought to get is LMP.          But the market signal they get is LMP if it accounts for            avoided costs.              If you take the avoided costs out of the         question, then you get LMP plus the retail costs.                     And of course, another irony here is the        distortion is greatest in those markets where the States         have done exactly what FERC would like, which is adopt          retail price ­­ real time pricing, because then the         retail price is LMP.                And so what is the compensation rate for        demand response providers? It's twice LMP.                   JUSTICE BREYER: I thought ­­ you don't         have ­­ I mean, I thought that he ­­ frankly the net              benefits test was meant to dealt with ­­ deal with this           problem.               I will read Kahn's testimony, I promise. I         will read Cicchetti, and I will read Hogan too. Okay?                        MR. CLEMENT: Please read ­­ please read        Alderson Reporting Company Official Dr. Hogan as well, because I really do think he has the             better of this argument.                Now, you would say, generally, well, couple       of expert economists, just let FERC decide. But I do            think in this case they have strayed beyond the bounds          of arbitrary and capriciousness, Justice Kennedy.                  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I ­­ I take it you're            asking us not to make the judgment as to which was right            and which was wrong, but that ­­ but that FERC did not            address it by giving specific­enough reasons.                  MR. CLEMENT: Yes. That ­­ that is the          principal reason. But I ­­ but I don't want to suggest              that it's just purely procedural because I don't think          these are things they can fix.                  And of course, we hope that you don't even         get to that question because you find they don't have          jurisdiction.             Thank you.              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       Five minutes, General.       REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.                  ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONER                  Justice:             GENERAL VERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief       Starting on the jurisdictional issue with      Alderson Reporting Company Official text, my friend pointed to Section (b), which you can          find at (a) of the appendix to our brief.                     What it says is not that FERC shall have         jurisdiction over sales of electricity at wholesale. It         says the provisions of this subchapter shall apply to         sales of electricity at wholesale.                 One of those provisions is (e)(a), which       says FERC shall have jurisdiction over practices       affecting wholesale rates.               So we're within the plain terms of the        statute, and there is no statutory text that plainly         forecloses FERC's exercise of jurisdiction. And my        friend, in minutes, didn't even try to identify one.                      So in terms of applying Chevron, there's no        doubt that ­­ that FERC's interpretation has to be         upheld.             With respect to the Wal­Mart example that my        friend identifies, I think it shows why his argument          about hermetically­sealed­off retail and wholesale     spheres really has nothing to do with the real world.                      In the real world today, large customers can        buy directly. They can do it through contract, and they           can also go into the wholesale market auctions and buy,          if their States permit it, and that does happen in the           real world.  Alderson Reporting Company Official             And this is really no different because       demand response entities that want to come in and         participate can only do so if their State law allows          them to do so. So it's no different than what's been            going on in the real world for quite a long time.                        Third, with respect to the load­serving      entities, the ­­ the utilities, my friend says, well,         don't worry about it; they'll do all the demand         response. It will work great.                  FERC addressed that. It addressed it       directly. It found that load­serving entities don't        have sufficient incentives to engage in demand response.        And it's obvious why they don't, because they        cannibalize their own profits. The higher cost they         have, the higher their rate of return profits are going          to be generated. They will do it under commands from           State regulatory agencies to do it, but they'll do it          grudgingly. And what FERC said is you want people to           come in who have a real profit motive to do it, and             that'll incent the LSEs to get in there and try to get a             piece of the action rather than letting it go to          somebody else.                          But FERC addressed that issue specifically.      Now, the idea that demand response can't       work, the State­level demand response, retail demand       Alderson Reporting Company Official response can't work where wholesale demand response is        operating, you know, again, the real world just        contradicts that. We have States in which this is           going on. And if this were a problem, you'd expect to             see in this administrative proceeding some evidence that        it was a problem, and there is zero evidence. You look             at all these briefs; there isn't a citation to anything           in the administrative record that suggests that the        Federal and State programs can't work in harmony. And          FERC made a finding that they can work in harmony.                       Now, with respect ­­ just one point on        arbitrary and capricious, and I'd like to sum up.                       I think if you're going to look at one thing         in terms of the concern you've raised, Justice Kennedy,         I would look at page of the Appendix to the           petition ­­ of our petition, and what you will see right           there is FERC directly identifying the problem that my         friend spent the last few minutes of his argument on,          and then going on to say ­­ and then going on to explain             in great detail for several pages why that critique is          wrong, and citing in particular the paragraph of        Dr. Khan's declaration where Dr. Khan is responding to         the specific critiques that my friend made.                   So it ­­ it certainly meets the threshold        test of ­­ of ­­ of an adequate explanation for a           Alderson Reporting Company Official decision.             Now, if I could sum up, I think this is what             this case comes down to.                 On one side of the scale, you've got a         practice that saves billion ­­ that has saved billions         of dollars in wholesale costs and will save billions of          dollars, and it's an effective tool against blackouts        and brownouts, and that nobody has shown in the real          world does any harm.                You have a statutory provision that gives        FERC specific authority to regulate this practice.                   You have no statutory provision precluding      it.             You have Chevron in case there's any doubt.                    And you ­­ and you have, really, a strong          cooperative Federalism program here in which States have        the ­­ States are masters of their own fate. Whether ­­           whether customers in a State participate or not is up to            the State. If the State thinks this is not a good             policy, the State can say it doesn't operate in our          State.             On the other side of the scale, what you've         got is an argument that all those benefits have to be           extinguished, and ­­ and no argument in the record that          there was any harm from this program. You have no clear            Alderson Reporting Company Official statutory text for bidding FERC from engaging in this         regulatory practice.              And my friend used the phrase "one size fits         all." Well, I ­­ I suggest that really what we've got              here on the other side is a faux Federalism argument.           Their argument is the one size fits all.                    There are lots of States out there that want         their consumers, want their citizens to participate in        this because they think it's good policy and it's         completely harmonious with their regulation. But what        my friend's argument does is wipe that out and say, no,           it's one size fits all, and then what's ­­ and that one            size that fits all is that nobody can participate, not          even the States that want to do it.                     Thank you.                                      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.       The case is submitted.
