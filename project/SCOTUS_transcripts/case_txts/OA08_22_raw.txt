 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-22, Caperton v. 
Massey Coal Company.

 Mr. Olson.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
 MR. OLSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a 

fundamental constitutional right.  That means not only 
the absence of actual bias, but a guarantee against even 
the probability of an unfair tribunal.  In short --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Who says?  Have we ever 

held that?

 MR. OLSON:  You have said that in the 

Murchison case and in a number of cases, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  A guarantee against even --
MR. OLSON:  Yes, the language of the 

Murchison case specifically says so.  The Court said in 
that case:  "A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic 
requirement of due process.  Fairness, of course, 
requires an absence of actual bias in the trial of 
cases, but our system of law has always endeavored to

prevent even the probability of unfairness."

 And in that paragraph, the Court goes on --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  "Has always endeavored."
 MR. OLSON:  Pardon?
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  "Has always endeavored." 

"Has always endeavored."

 MR. OLSON:  Yes, but that's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And there are rules in the 

States that do endeavor to do that.

 MR. OLSON:  But the Court has said that 

frequently, not only the probability of bias, the 
appearance of bias, the likelihood of bias, the inherent 
suspicion of bias.  The Court has repeatedly said that 
in the context -- a series of contexts or cases.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  "Probability" is a 

loose term.  What -- what percentage is probable --

MR. OLSON:  Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If you've a 50 

percent chance of bias, a 10 percent chance?  Probable 
means more than 50?

 MR. OLSON:  It's probable cause, Mr. Chief 

Justice.  The Court frequently decides questions 
involving due process, equal protection, probable cause, 
speedy trial, on the basis not of mathematical 
certainty, but in this case where an objective observer

would come to the conclusion -- knowing all of the 
facts, would come to the conclusion that a judge or 
jurist would probably be biased against that individual 
or in favor of his opponent, that would be sufficient 
under the Due Process Clause, we submit.  The Court --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does it mean the same 

thing as likelihood of bias?

 MR. OLSON:  The Court -- the Court, Justice 

Ginsburg, has used the changes interchangeably.  We 
think the probably -- the "probable" standard is the one 
we would advance to this Court.  But the -- but the 
seminal case, the Tumey case, said that even if there 
was a possibility -- any procedure where there would be 
a possible temptation for the judge not to hold the 
balance nice, clear, and true, would be the standard. 
But -- and the Aetna -- in the Aetna v. Lavoie case not 
very many years ago, the Court repeated that standard, 
and that standard has been repeated again and again. 
The likelihood or the possibility or even the temptation 
--

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you claim that there is 

such a temptation here because of gratitude?

 MR. OLSON:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You've been around 

Washington a long time.  How far do you think gratitude

goes in -- in the general political world?

 MR. OLSON:  Well, let me put it this way, 

Justice Scalia.  If -- an ordinary person would say that 
it would be very difficult for a judge to hold the 
balance nice, square, and true when that judge has just 
been put on the bench during the pendency of the trial 
of the case by his opponent's contribution of $3 million 
to his election.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but that -- that 
person contributed money to my election because he 
expected me to be a fair and impartial judge.  And I 
would be faithful to that contributor only by being a 
fair and impartial judge.  That is showing gratitude.  I 
should do what he expected me to do, and I have no 
reason to think he expected me to lie and distort cases 
in order to come out his way.  What I expected he wanted 
me to do was to be a good judge, and I'm being faithful 
to him and I'm -- I'm showing my gratitude by -- by 
being a good judge.

 MR. OLSON:  Well, I would go back to the 

words of this court in the Tumey case, the seminal case: 
"Due process is not satisfied by the argument that men 
of highest honor and greatest self-sacrifice could carry 
it out without danger of injustice."

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It isn't a matter of honor

and sacrifice.  You talk as though what gratitude 
consists of is coming out in favor of this fellow, but 
that is not necessarily what gratitude consists of. 
Gratitude consists of performing the way this person 
would like me to perform.  Now, in this case, I will 
acknowledge that you seem to have a contribution based 
upon more.  This contributor never even met the judge, 
did he?

 MR. OLSON:  Well, it's not clear.  There is 

a --

buddies.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  They're certainly not good 

 MR. OLSON:  We're not claiming that there is 

a basis based on personal relationship, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And his contributions, as I 
understand it, were mainly based upon his opposition to 
the incumbent, who he thought was an activist judge that 
-- that was distorting the tort law of the State, all in 
favor of the plaintiffs' bar.  And if -- if the 
contribution were to engender any gratitude, it seems to 
me it would simply be that this other candidate would do 
what he promised in his campaign and that is not be an 
activist judge and not distort the tort law of the 
State.

the premise of your question and invite the Court to 
look at page 188a of the joint appendix.  This addresses 
the point that you just made that he was contributing 
his money to defeat Justice McGraw as opposed to 
supporting Justice Benjamin.  On page 188a is one of 
those financial disclosure reports that's required by 
West Virginia law.  It's filed by Mr. Blankenship and it 
says on that page:  "Expenditures made to support or 
oppose," and he underlines the word "support," and then 
he types in the word "Brent Benjamin."

 Then if you'll turn over to page 200a, which 

is the last page of that report, that shows that he 
directly spent $508,000 of his own money to support 
Justice Benjamin.

 Now, to the larger part of your point, the 

context of this case suggests that, while the appeal was 
going to be coming to the -- to the West Virginia 
Supreme Court, Mr. Blankenship, who was the CEO, 
chairman, major stockholder and a -- the prime mover in 
the case that gave rise to liability in this case, 
decided to unseat Justice McGraw, who he thought would 
be unfavorable to him, and elect Justice Benjamin, who 
he thought would be favorable to him.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if, instead of 

having the focus on one, we're dealing with a trade

group that's making the donation.  Ten companies form a 
trade group.  Is the judge recused in the case of every 
one of those companies?

 MR. OLSON:  I think that -- I think the 

answer probably is not, Chief Justice Roberts, but this 
is, like your cases involving reasonable search and 
seizure, it's going to require an analysis of the 
complex of circumstances.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, let's just 
take this case, the same amount of money, except it's 
not from an individual, not from that individual's 
company, but from ten different ones, and divide it up 
by ten.

 MR. OLSON:  I think the Court would -- a 

reasonable objective observer knowing all of the facts 
would not feel that that -- that trade group was not a 
party to the case, who is not personally involved in 
having a personal stake in the election or the outcome 
of that particular case, but may be interested in a 
panoply of cases or judges that approach things in a 
certain way; that would not give rise to what you're 
concerned about here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, okay.  Now, 
I'm sure you know where I'm going next.  What if it's 
five companies in the trade group?  When do you decide

that there's a probability?  I take it if there are two 
companies, under your theory there would be a 
probability of bias?

 MR. OLSON:  If those are the companies that 

are a party to the case, if it's when their case is 
pending, if it's a vast magnitude -- the magnitude --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, can I stop you 

right there, "When their case is pending."  The Massey 
Company has a lot of cases pending, so is it only those 
cases that were pending on the day of the election?

 MR. OLSON:  No, I think that that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then we 

shouldn't talk about pending cases.

 MR. OLSON:  Well, no.  I think that that is 

-- I answered your question whether it's only those 
cases.  That is a part of the circumstances that would 
give rise -- you have decided, this Court has decided 
that the possibility that a $12 benefit, the Tumey case, 
might ultimately come to the judge is a disqualifying 
interest.  You've decided in the Monroeville case that 
because the adjudicator was the mayor of a town who 
might receive some fines --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that's the 

whole distinction that your friend on the other side 
makes.  Those cases involve financial interest and the

recusal rules are, you know, if you have one share of 
AT&T stock and it's in AT&T, you have to recuse.  But 
this is different.  This is a probability of bias, not 
financial interest.

 MR. OLSON:  Well, I would submit that your 

cases say that when the judge has an interest in the 
case and that interest leads to the likelihood of --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, they don't say that.
 MR. OLSON:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  There are only two 

categories of cases, only two categories.  One -- one is 
where the judge is almost the aggrieved party in 
conducting contempt proceedings against someone who is 
contemptuous of that very judge, and the other one is 
cases where the judges have a financial interest. 
That's far from this broad category of whenever there is 
a possibility of bias.

 I was appointed to the bench by Ronald 

Reagan.  Should I be any -- should I have been any less 
grateful to Ronald Reagan than -- than the judge here 
was grateful to the person who spent a lot of money in 
his election?

 MR. OLSON:  Well, let me -- let me answer 

that.  There's more parts, there's more than one part to 
that question.  Let me answer the first part first.  The

Court hasn't said that there are only two categories of 
disqualifying bias.  I submit the Court has said that 
it's an interest in the outcome.  That interest in the 
outcome might be financial --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Two categories are the only 

categories in which it has applied that.

 MR. OLSON:  I respectfully submit, Justice 
Scalia, that in the Monroeville case the judge didn't 
have a personal financial interest.  He had what the 
Court called a partisan interest because the money that 
might have been assessed in the way of fines might have 
come to the city.  In the Lavoie case, the judge didn't 
have a direct financial interest.  He had an indirect 
potential financial interest.  In the Johnson v. 
Mississippi case, the judge had been named in an 
institutional suit about racial bias and whether juries 
should be -- those -- there's a panoply of 
circumstances, all of which add up, Justice Scalia, I 
submit, to a situation where a judge is -- a reasonable 
person would suspect that the judge would have a hard 
time, in the words of this Court, "holding the balance 
nice, clear, and true."

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Nice, clear, and true.  Are 
you going to tell me why I shouldn't have been grateful 
to Ronald Reagan?

MR. OLSON:  And I was going to --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And he had a lot of, a lot 

of issues coming before me while his presidency 
continued.

 MR. OLSON:  In the first place, there is a 

-- there is a significant difference with respect to the 
framers of the Constitution who gave the members of this 
Court and the Federal Judiciary life tenure for the very 
purpose of ensuring the independence of the judiciary. 
There is a separate consideration that this Court has 
mentioned because of the fact that judges and justices 
of this Court cannot be replaced if they feel that they 
must recuse themselves.  There is -- another interest is 
institutionally presidents appointing justices all of 
the time for a variety of reasons, but not to attempt to 
affect the outcome in their case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about the 

United Mine Workers.  If they give a contribution to 
somebody's campaign, is that judge then recused in every 
labor case?  Or I don't know if they give contributions 
or not, but a group like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, 
because they think the other judge is too lenient in DWI 
cases, so they give contributions.  Is their preferred 
judge recused in every DWI case?

 MR. OLSON:  No, Chief Justice Roberts.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Or are those all 

factors and circumstances we have to look at?

 MR. OLSON:  Well, of course they're factors 
and circumstances, but the -- when -- when an individual 
or a group of individuals makes contributions in the 
context of elections -- and we are going to have State 
elections of -- of judges.  We have them in 40 -- 39 
States, and there's no sign that those are going to be 
discontinued any time soon.

 But when a group of individuals or an 

individual is -- is making contributions because they 
think the jurist is going to be sensitive to -- to the 
rights of criminals or sensitive to the rights of 
victims of criminals, those are generic concerns that 
people participating in the electoral process --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, also, if there 
is a big -- a big United Mine Workers case, or not even 
United Mine Workers, involving particular union members, 
and the UMW gives large contributions to a judge, that 
-- that judge is recused?

 MR. OLSON:  I can't -- I can't rule out a 

situation where there is a potential litigant who has a 
stake in front of a case.  The amounts here have to be 
taken into consideration, too.

question in this case is this:  In your petition for 
certiorari you said that, well, by the time you came 
here you would have a standard for us that we can work 
with.  You know, all of us know, that a ruling in your 
favor means that law and motion practice will -- could 
-- could change drastically in States all across the 
country.  Disqualification for bias will now become a --
a part of the pretrial process, and I'm asking you what 
your standard is.

 Your standard is an unacceptable risk of 

impropriety or perception of bias, but I -- I need some 
more specific standards within which to fit this case. 
You give a general standard, and then we hear about the 
amount of the contribution.  We hear about the fact that 
it was a contested election, et cetera.
 MR. OLSON:  It would be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But your -- your standard 

of -- of impropriety doesn't, it seems to me, give 
sufficient -- or "unacceptable risk of bias" doesn't 
give sufficient guidance to the courts to implement this 
rule unless it's just -- it's just going to be one case. 
Now, I know the law evolves on a case-by-case system.  I 
understand that, but it doesn't seem to me that the 
standard you offer us is specific enough.

to that.  In the first place, the Conference of Chief 
Justices of all of the States of the United States filed 
a brief in this case and said that we need a standard 
with respect to recusals for extraordinary campaign 
contributions in cases.  They also said that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was their standard the same 
as yours?  I mean, that's frankly one of the problems in 
this case.  The various amici and -- and you come up 
with, you know, a wide divergence of standards.  And all 
of them say:  By the way, these seven factors or five 
factors or six factors, whatever they say, are not 
exhaustive; There may be others as well.

 MR. OLSON:  That's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right?
 MR. OLSON:  That's because, Justice Scalia, 

the -- the jurisprudence of this Court in connection 
with standards like due process or probable cause or 
speedy trial or equal protection can't be nailed down 
with levels of specificity.  It would be very inviting 
--

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I want you to articulate 

some substandards that have -- that are general in 
nature, that apply to this case, substandards that are 
more specific than the probability of bias.

 MR. OLSON:  Well, I -- I -- the reason we --

we approached it from that standpoint, Justice Kennedy, 
is the probability of bias is something that this Court 
has said repeatedly.  But let me answer your question 
this way:  When the circumstances, including the timing 
of the contribution, the magnitude and proportion of the 
contribution, are such that it would lead a reasonable 
person in possession of all of the facts -- these are 
all words from these courts' decisions -- to believe 
that the judge would have a difficult time being other 
than biased in favor of one of the parties, that would 
be the standard that would be applied.  It's a general 
standard, but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  To what --
MR. OLSON:  -- the Conference of Chief 

Justices --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  To what extent do you 

rely on -- and this is a very unusual situation -- that 
you have a defendant in the ongoing litigation who is in 
fact a prime culprit from the point of view of the 
plaintiff?  That is, Blankenship, who made all these 
contributions, is charged with driving Caperton out of 
business.  So he is not simply the CEO of the company 
that's named as the defendant, but he is targeted as the 
perpetrator.  So that's an -- an additional factor.

 Is that just one of a laundry list, or is

that central to your view that there is really an 
appearance of impropriety here?

 MR. OLSON:  It is very much central, but 

it's not exclusively central.  If the -- and -- and that 
is absolutely correct, Justice Ginsburg.  On pages 63 
through 65a of the joint appendix, for example, are the 
specific post-trial motion findings of the judge saying 
that the prime mover in the -- in the conduct that was 
declared to be fraudulent and a deliberate effort to 
drive this company out of business was Mr. Blankenship. 
So factually that's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel --
MR. OLSON:  That is a central factor.  If he 

had given one dollar --

factor.

factor.

 MR. OLSON:  It's not --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You said it's one central 

 MR. OLSON:  Well, that's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You really have no test 
other than probability of bias.  We can't -- we can't 
run a system on -- on such a vague standard.

 MR. OLSON:  I submit, Justice Scalia, you're 

going to have to wipe out a lot of jurisprudence from 

18 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

this Court that uses terms like "appearance of bias," 
"likelihood of bias."

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not -- not for situations 

that have such an infinite variety as -- as the 
appointment of judges and the election of judges and --
and as funding your opponent or -- or declining to fund 
or joining some agglomeration of -- of other 
institutions that fund.

 The -- the variety is immense, and you give 
us nothing to hang onto except, you know, case by case 
we're going to have to decide whether there's a 
probability of bias.

 MR. OLSON:  Well, it would be -- it would be 
-- I would be delighted to say that the standard was 50 
percent of the contributions in an election, and we 
would come along in a case where there would be a very 
small amount of money, and someone -- that -- that all 
of those situations are distinguishable.

 I admit this is not easy, but the Conference 

of Chief Justices specifically said, to get back to 
Justice Kennedy's question, what did they propose and 
are they proposing something comparable to us?  They are 
-- they are -- and this is on page 4 of the Conference 
of Chief Justices' brief.  They are the judges who would 
have to live with this decision.  They said:  (A), we

need it, extraordinary, out of line campaign support 
from a source that has a substantial stake in the 
outcome of the proceedings where those extreme facts 
create a probability of actual bias.

 And then they go on to say, to answer the 
floodgate problem that my opponent raises -- this is 
going to open the floodgates, and you will have nothing 
but recusal motions.  They explicitly state that concern 
is not -- is unfounded.  No bright line rule can or 
should be attempted.  These are the judges --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't you think it would be 

easier to solve the problem, as some States have done, 
not by having this -- this raffle for -- for whatever 
judge gets -- gets stricken from the case or not, but 
simply limiting the amount of contributions that can be 
made?  Isn't -- isn't that a much more sensible 
solution?

 MR. OLSON:  Well, the States are perfectly 

free to do that.  But let me --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And some of them are doing 

that.

 MR. OLSON:  Let me make this point, Justice 

Scalia.  The contribution limit in West Virginia is 
$1,000.  Mr. Blankenship contributed $1,000, and then he 
put up three million additional dollars, three thousand

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are the States --

are the States really free to do that?  We have 
recognized First Amendment interests in participating in 
the electoral process before.  I mean, would your 
approach constitutionalize McCain-Feingold at a State 
level?

 MR. OLSON:  I -- I think that this Court's 

-- this Court's campaign finance jurisprudence 
acknowledges the appropriateness of campaign 
contribution limits, the very point that Justice Scalia 
just made, and other limits.  And in -- and, in fact, 
States have limits against corporate contributions, 
limits against union contributions.  I think the United 
Mine Workers incident came up.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, this -- this 

--

MR. OLSON:  But -- but the -- and -- and the 

States do have limitations with respect to what 
litigants can do.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right.  Mr. Olson, the 
very fact that they do raises what I think is one of the 
difficult issues in this case, and it's raised by --
specifically by the -- the brief of the nine States, 
Alabama and so on.  And -- and I would put it this way.

It's not exactly the way that brief did, but I see the 
problem that you are -- that you are addressing as -- as 
not only a procedural, but certainly to a degree a 
substantive due process kind of problem.

 One of the factors that goes into the 

recognition of at least a substantive limitation when 
there has been none before is -- is the issue of timing. 
Is the political process in fact working now toward a 
solution?  Because if it is, that kind of ethos of total 
unreasonability is -- is still being worked out, and --
and the courts ought to stay their hands.  So my 
question is, what do you say to the argument that there 
is a political process going on addressing this issue? 
And I forget the details, but my recollection is that it 
may well have been that brief pointed out that the State 
of West Virginia itself has enacted some legislation 
since these events began to transpire.

 So the nut of the question is, is 

the political process in process and is that a good 
reason for us to stay our hand in recognizing a new 
procedural or substantive due process right at this 
point?

 MR. OLSON:  I think there are -- there are 

more than one answer to that question.  One, the 
political process to which you refer is spiraling out of

control.  There is a financial arms race in judicial 
elections in various States throughout the country, and 
the briefs --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Oh, I think we all 

recognize that.  Is there -- is there a 
counter-political process going on?

 MR. OLSON:  It hasn't done the job so far, 

and the trend seems to be in the opposite direction, but 
even if it --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  What happened in West 

Virginia?

 MR. OLSON:  Pardon me?
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is my recollection correct 

that West Virginia has, in fact, enacted some kind of 
limiting legislation?

 MR. OLSON:  I believe that is correct, but I 

don't think that would have addressed the problem in 
this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought they closed the 

527 loophole that allowed him to contribute so much 
above the individual limit.

 MR. OLSON:  Irrespective of that, I was 

going to go on and answer this in response to Justice 
Souter's question.  The Conference of Chief Justices, I 
think, provide a second answer to that question.  They

are the ones where the rubber meets the road, so to 
speak.  They are saying, and the entire conference is 
saying, we need some guidance here with respect to a 
constitutional limit --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, they propose a 

seven-factor test, and all of the other amici, who know 
a lot about this subject, propose multifactor tests. 
Public Citizen has ten factors, the ABA has four 
factors.  In an effort to see if this can be put in more 
concrete terms, I wonder if you would be willing to say 
categorically that your -- the holding that you're 
proposing would not apply under any of these situations: 
Where the judges are appointed, where there are massive 
contributions and a hotly contested election, but the 
issue is not an economic issue, it's a social issue; 
where there isn't any specific issue headed for the 
court but there are massive contributions by, let's say, 
the plaintiffs' bar and the defense bar?  Could you say 
categorically in any of those situations that your rule 
would not apply?

 MR. OLSON:  I would hesitate -- I would 

hesitate to do so, Justice Alito.  I think you've put 
your finger on some of the circumstances that would take 
it out of the context of the appearance of justice for 
sale.

I'm going to reserve, if I may, the balance 
of my time, but finish with a reference to the principle 
that we're articulating here is not new to the 
jurisprudence of the western world and the legal 
jurisprudence that we come from.  In the Magna Carta the 
king promised:  "To no one will we sell justice."  And 
Blackstone repeated that and restated it and stated: 
"For injury done to every subject, he may take his 
remedy by the course of law and have justice freely 
without sale."

 This circumstance in this case involves the 

appearance of judges being bought.  Now, we're not 
saying that there's actual bias because there's actual 
-- as this Court has repeatedly said, that's impossible 
to prove, and that's why the appearance of probability 
of bias is so important to the respect that we need to 
have for the judicial system.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Mr. Frey.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY

suggested, close the 527 loophole and limit 
contributions by individuals to 527 groups to $1,000 
after the 2004 election in response to the concern about 
the amount of money that was being spent through 527 
groups in that election.  So I think this is a situation 
where the States are dealing with it legislatively and, 
and as I hope to get to in a minute or two, the Court 
has recognized that this is -- repeatedly recognized 
that this is something that is meant to be dealt with 
through legislative or canons of judicial ethics or 
codes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How is it -- is it --

this Court's decision in the Republican Party of 
Minnesota said that judges could say anything, just as a 
legislator.  Are you extending that notion that an 
election is an election to this area of the appearance 
of impropriety?  I mean, is it your position that the 
judge is elected just like a legislator is elected, and 
legislators all the time are beholden to interest 
groups?

 MR. FREY:  Well, of course I don't agree 

that Justice Benjamin was in the least beholden to 
anybody in this case.  But the Republican Party case was 
a case about the First Amendment right of candidates in 
an election to speak their position on issues.  I'm not

sure that I follow what this has to do with this case. 
But I will say that this is not a case about 
appearances.  The petition was about appearances. 
They've -- the other side has withdrawn or it has 
abandoned an appearance argument, and with good reason 
because the Due Process Clause --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Frey, is it your 

position that the appearance of impropriety could never 
be strong enough to raise a constitutional issue?

 MR. FREY:  Well, we might have appearance of 

impropriety overlapping with conditions that would 
justify --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I'm assuming appearances 

only.  Are you saying that appearances without any 
actual proof of bias could never be sufficient as a 
constitutional matter?

 MR. FREY:  I think we are.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Is that your position?
 MR. FREY:  We are saying that the Due 

Process Clause does not exist to protect the integrity 
or reputation of the State judicial systems.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's not an answer to my 

question.

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Supposing, for example, 
the judge had campaigned on the ground that he would 
issue favorable rulings to the United Mine Workers, and 
the United Mine Workers campaigned, raising money 
saying, we want to get a judge who will rule in our 
favor in all the cases we're interested in.  Would that 
create an appearance of impropriety?

 MR. FREY:  Well --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Or take another example. 

The Chief Justice asked what if there are ten members of 
a trade association and would all -- and they all 
contributed to get a judge to vote in their favor in a 
case that involved a conspiracy charge among the --
charged the ten of them for violations of the Sherman 
Act, something like that.  And if all ten of them raise 
money publicly for the very purpose of getting a judge 
who would rule favorably in their favor, that would 
clearly create a very extreme appearance of impropriety. 
Would that be sufficient, in your judgment, to raise a 
constitutional issue?

 MR. FREY:  If you were -- if -- if you 
thought there was no basis for believing there was 
actual bias, but it looked bad --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, it would meet the test

be tempted under the circumstances.  That's the test 
that the Conference of Chief Justices judges --

MR. FREY:  That I don't --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  And do you think that 
could ever, just appearance, could ever raise a due 
process issue?

 MR. FREY:  No, I don't think just appearance 

could ever raise a due process issue.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  No matter how extreme the 

facts?

 MR. FREY:  The question is whether there is 

actual bias of a kind that is recognized as 
disqualifying.  The Court has recognized --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  The whole point of this 

case is it has not been recognized.  We have never 
confronted a case as extreme as this before.  This fits 
the standard that Potter Stewart articulated when he 
said "I know it when I see it."

 (Laughter.)
 MR. FREY:  I would take exception to the 

characterization of this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think we adopted 

his principle, did we, in the obscenity area?

whether we have, but whether we should.

MR. FREY:  I hope to address that question. 

Let me start off by pointing out, as Justice Benjamin 
said in his opinion on discussing the recusal issue, his 
July opinion, which I commend to the Court, he is being 
asked to recuse on the basis of activities of a third 
party over which he had no control, in a case whose 
disposition offers him no current or future personal 
benefit, and where he has no personal connection with 
the parties or their counsel, has expressed no opinion 
about any of them.  He has done nothing that would call 
into question his objectivity, his impartiality.

 I think that's a very important point.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the view that 

Benjamin should not be the judge of his own cause? 
Wasn't -- wasn't it -- it was either Massey, the 
company, or Blankenship that brought a 1983 action 
insisting on that very point, that in recusal matter --
-

MR. FREY:  Well, that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- it wasn't -- well, 

maybe you can tell me what that 1983 suit was.  It was a 
charge --

MR. FREY:  Yes, it challenged the procedure. 

That's not an issue that's before the Court here, and 
our -- our position today is that this Court has

consistently allowed recusal matters to be decided by a 
-- the single justice who is challenged.  I don't think 
the Court thinks it's unconstitutional to do that.
 I understand the -- the concerns about 
having the judge making the decision about whether 
recusal is required, but that is not the practice of 
this Court, and if it's not the practice of this Court I 
frankly doubt it's unconstitutional.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it was the position 

that Blankenship took?

 MR. FREY:  Well, it was -- no, not 

Blankenship.  Massey.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it may not be per se 
unconstitutional, but it is certainly one contributing 
factor, it seems to me, to the argument that the system 
that we have depended on up to this point is not working 
very well.

 MR. FREY:  Well, I don't think -- I don't 
think the system -- I don't -- I don't agree that the 
system is not working well.  I mean, of course there are 
adjustments --

appearance problem that would ever justify a

 MR. FREY:  Yes, but --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  And in fact --
MR. FREY:  -- but appearances, but 

appearances -- I don't mean to interrupt you.  If I'm --
sorry.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Go ahead.
 MR. FREY:  Appearance is a standard for 
recusal, a nonconstitutional statutory standard for 
recusal in virtually every State, so we already have --
and in the Federal system, so --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.  And we have -- and we 
have an appearance standard under the ABA Canons, but I 
think it would be difficult to make a very convincing 
argument that that standard was effective in this case.
 MR. FREY:  Well, that -- that's a matter of 

opinion.  I -- I --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it's -- it's the 

matter of opinion that brings the case before us.  And 
would you agree -- I am not -- I am not asking you to 
agree that the ABA standard was violated.  That's not 
what you're here for.  But would you agree that the ABA

been?

 MR. FREY:  I think I would agree that 

reasonable people could have a different view one way or 
the other about whether there is an appearance of 
impropriety for Justice Benjamin sitting.  I would agree 
with that.  I don't think I would go further than that 
because my personal view is that there was no 
impropriety, that it was reasonable, and if you read his 
opinion I think you'll see a -- a fair, balanced, 
thoughtful statement of the reasons why he feels he 
could sit.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I want you to be able to 
elaborate your full theory of the case, but just so you 
know, it -- it does seem to me that the appearance 
standard has -- has much to recommend it.  In part it 
means that you don't have to inquire into the actual 
bias; it's -- it's more objective.  Now, of course it 
has to be controlled, it has to be precise.  But I just 
thought that you know that I -- I do have that 
inclination.

 MR. FREY:  But -- but we're here on the 

question of constitutional requirements and the 
Constitution --

protection.

 MR. FREY:  Well, what you're really asking 
is whether you should abandon what is a fairly clearly 
stated rule and practice of this Court, dating back to 
the common law, that questions of bias in general as 
opposed to interest are matters for legislative 
resolution and not for -- not for constitutional --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course the appearance 
standard is -- is wonderfully ratchetable.  Once it is 
clearly established that a certain -- certain set of 
facts creates the appearance of impropriety, that is 
solidly established, then the set of facts right next to 
that suddenly acquires the appearance of impropriety 
because it's so -- it's so close to what is obviously 
improper.  And -- and so we go down and down and down. 
And I -- I personally don't favor a constitutional rule 
that is a sliding scale like that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Of course, you can stop at 

what is obviously improper.

 MR. FREY:  I don't -- I think, first of all, 

the Petitioner has not advanced on the merits in this 
case an appearance standard.  A lot of the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would you please clarify 

that?  Because I was taking appearance, likelihood, 
probability as all synonyms, and I think of Justice

Marshall's decision in Peters and Kiff, involving a 
grand jury, and he said that due process is denied in 
circumstances creating the likelihood or the appearance 
of bias.  And there are other decisions, too, that use 
those terms interchangeably.  So I don't know that 
probability of bias, likelihood of bias, appearance --
that -- those seem to me synonyms.

 MR. FREY:  All right.  Well, if you're 

viewing them as cinnamons -- synonyms, then the question 
is whether that kind of standard is a -- is the 
constitutional standard; and let me say about the Tumey 
case which -- the "possible temptation" language in the 
Tumey case, which is of course a wide open standard: 
That was discussed only after the Court said questions 
of bias are not constitutional, they're for the 
legislature; questions of interest, pecuniary interest 
in the Tumey case, are.  And then the language that Mr. 
Olson quoted came in the discussion of the question of 
whether the pecuniary interest was substantial enough to 
create a disqualification, constitutional 
disqualification.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I think you're quite 
right in the way you describe Tumey, but I wonder why is 
that the reason -- why is appearance never 
constitutional?  Why should that be?  Can you talk about

that?

 MR. FREY:  Because it seems to me to be --

if we're talking about appearance as distinct from 
actual bias or probable -- you know, I can understand a 
rule that says the probability of bias is enough.  I 
think it would be a very ill-advised rule without 
historical foundation, without foundation in the Court's 
precedents, and open-ended and creating all kinds of 
problems; but I can understand that rule.  That at least 
is addressed to the right of the party to get a fair 
trial.

 Appearance is addressed to a different 

thing.  It's addressed to the reputation of the judicial 
system, which is not, I think, the function of the Due 
Process Clause to address.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Why not?
 MR. FREY:  Because I think the Due Process 

Clause is concerned with the fairness of the --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  You don't think the 

community's confidence in the way judges behave is an 
important part of due process?

 MR. FREY:  No, I think it's -- it may be a 
systemically important value.  But I think as long as 
the judge is impartial in the -- in the case at hand, I 
don't think there's a problem.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But our whole system is 

designed to ensure confidence in our judgments.

 MR. FREY:  Well, I don't -- I think this is 

a side point.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And it seems -- it seems 
to me litigants have an entitlement to that under the 
Due Process Clause.

 MR. FREY:  Well, I don't think so, but I 
don't think it -- I don't think it really essentially 
matters.  We're -- we're dealing with a semantical 
quibble here, where the real question is, is possibility 
of bias, a temptation of bias, a subconscious effect 
that -- even a probability of bias, whatever -- there's 
a lot of different standards that have been put 
forward -- is that a constitutional basis for 
disqualifying a judge, A?  B, if it is sometimes a 
constitutional basis for disqualifying a judge, is it a 
basis under the debt of gratitude theory?  And, C, if 
the debt of gratitude theory is a viable theory -- for 
reasons I hope to have a minute or two to address, I 
think it's not viable -- does it apply on the 
circumstances of this case?

think it was Matthew, moved to disqualify Judge 
Starcher, and Justice Starcher did indeed recuse 
himself.  He had spoken out against what went on here. 
If he had refused to recuse after speaking out as he 
did, would that be compatible with due process, the due 
process owed to the Massey Company?

 MR. FREY:  That would raise an interesting 
question and I think a much closer question than this 
case, because that would involve the question of whether 
-- there is --
the Court has recognized that where a 
judge is embroiled with a litigant, and has a personal 
animosity arising out of the relationship with the 
litigant, that is a -- that is possible ground for 
recusal.  So it's a -- it's a stronger case.  I'm not 
sure it's strong enough.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought the animosity 

was directed at Judge Benjamin?

 MR. FREY:  No, no.  The animosity is 

directed at Massey and Mr. Blankenship, who were --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you think the 

Constitution might have been violated if Starcher -- you 
think due process might have been violated if that judge 
had remained on the bench?

 MR. FREY:  I think it's a closer case.  I'm 

not prepared to say that it would have been violated

even then.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Mr. Frey, you've tried a 

couple of times to -- to get to your -- your point that, 
even if we assume probability of bias is the standard, 
the debt of gratitude would not qualify.  I'll be candid 
with -- to say that I don't see why probability of bias 
is necessarily an inappropriate constitutional standard, 
whether we should adopt it or not.  But would you give 
your argument on why the debt of gratitude could not 
qualify?

 MR. FREY:  Of course.  I'd be happy to.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Because that may illustrate 

the point.

 MR. FREY:  Let me say just one point about 
probability of bias, which is conceptually -- the rule 
is quite clear at common law, as the Court knows, that 
that was not a ground for disqualification of a judge. 
Now --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, but I don't know what 

common law -- how much help common law is.  Common law 
didn't have elected judges.

 MR. FREY:  No, but it had --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Common law did not have 

this contribution system, which your colleague referred 
to as spiraling out of control.

MR. FREY:  That's the point I wanted to 

make, that while common law did not have elected judges, 
it had the issue of bias.  After all, elected judges are 
not really the issue here.  The issue is not whether 
judges should be elected; the issue is whether --
whether there should be disqualification for bias.  That 
is an issue that the common law confronted.  This is not 
like some novel situation that has arisen that the 
common law didn't deal with.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We don't deal with an 

abstract setting.  We have the setting of elections, of 
elections of judges and millions of dollars spent on 
them.  That's the context in which this case arises.

 MR. FREY:  Yes, I understand, and the 

question is whether that -- that gives rise to bias.  So 
let's -- let's turn -- let's turn to the question of 
whether the debt of gratitude theory, which I take it is 
the principle that would underlie disqualification in 
the election context --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  I don't take it as the 

principle, but I take it as an application of the 
principle.  And I thought if you get to responding to 
the application, I may understand your position better 
on the principle.

 MR. FREY:  Debt of gratitude I think is a

principle.  You have to ask yourself what is the reason 
why somebody would conclude -- why a court would 
conclude that Justice Benjamin is -- is not biased.

 And let me say that one of the key elements 
which is not mentioned by the other side which is very 
important is the presumption of impartiality.  It goes 
back to Coke and Blackstone.  Judges are clothed with a 
presumption of impartiality.  There has to be something 
that overcomes that presumption.  And let me say that, I 
ask the Court to ask yourselves if you were in Justice 
Benjamin's situation, do you really think you would be 
incapable of rendering an impartial decision in a case 
involving Massey?  Because if the answer to that is no, 
if the answer to that is you would not be incapable of 
rendering an unbiased decision, then there's no 
justification for saying that Justice Benjamin would --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask you on your 

challenge to the probability of bias as a standard.  Do 
you think it's an unworkable standard or that even if 
there is a probability of bias, that should not be 
constitutionally disqualified?

 MR. FREY:  I think it's an unworkable 
standard, and -- and I ask the Court to look at --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Why is it any more 

unworkable than probable cause in a Fourth Amendment

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, it has probable 

cause as a standard.

 MR. FREY:  If there was a standard that said 

judges should recuse themselves when it would be 
reasonable to suppose that there was bias, if the 
Constitution said that, we wouldn't be here today or we 
would be here arguing about whether --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me get back to the 

question.  Why is probability in this context any more 
difficult to figure out than probability in the Fourth 
Amendment context?

 MR. FREY:  I'm not --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Or is it?
 MR. FREY:  I'm not sure of the answer to 

that.  What I am sure is that if you start down the road 
of debt of gratitude, which I think is the animating 
principle if there is going to be a probability of bias.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, I'm not -- I'm not 
asking you about debt of gratitude.  I'm asking you why 
isn't the probability standard perfectly administerable, 
just as it is in the Fourth Amendment?  And surely you

that if there is a

of cases in which you would -- which you would decide 
and provide standards.  I think that could be done.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  We have no choice with 

regard to the reasonableness standard.  We -- it's not a 
standard we made up.

urged to adopt out of nowhere a new standard of

standard?

waiting.

 (Laughter.)
 MR. FREY:  I've been trying to get to it, 

but I was answering Justice Stevens's question.

 The problem with debt of gratitude is that 
it's not a principle with any reasonable limit.  If you 
apply it here, if you say there's a debt of gratitude 
here, then you have the question about all the other 
circumstances.  The plaintiffs' lawyers gave a million 
and a half dollars to Justice McGraw to support his 
reelection.  Suppose he had won?  What do you do?  It's 
true that no one individual gave a lot of money, but 
it's -- if you're looking at it in terms of what is the 
probability of bias, it's at least as great, if not 
greater than here.  The doctors gave $750,000 to 
Benjamin.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But that isn't the only 

theory.  That is, in my own mind -- I don't know if you 
want to call it "probability" or "possibility," you 
don't manacle a defendant in a courtroom even though 
this jury may not have been affected.  I read the 
opinion Justice Benjamin wrote, it was a very good 
opinion.  I sympathized with his problem.  Okay?  So I'm 
not talking about him.  I'm talking about we don't 
manacle defendants because many jurors, maybe not this

one, would have been adding affected, and that seems the 
problem here.

 The debt of gratitude I think, no, that 
isn't the theory that underlies it, though it may in 
part.  It's that you have here the largest amount by a 
factor, an order of magnitude perhaps, I mean hugely 
greater than any other contribution given to a judge by 
a single person.  It doesn't just affect the fast 
through gratitude.  A normal human being also thinks, if 
I play my cards right, maybe it will be repeated, and 
they'll want to keep me in office.  And we have the fact 
of how it looks, and we don't have a situation where the 
something like this is inevitable, where you appoint 
judges.  It's inevitable that there will be an 
appointment.  I mean, hey, but that isn't true of 
sitting on this kind of case.

 So we have all those things that make it 

extreme.  So what is the problem?  If we say there is an 
envelope that the Due Process Clause doesn't touch, and 
that envelope is greater, and we touch less, if the 
States are regulating it themselves.  Where they're not 
-- and this is way outside the envelope -- at that point 
the Due Process Clause comes into play.  Now, end of 
opinion.  Now, what terrible mess will the Court get 
into if they write just that?

MR. FREY:  Well, if you have a -- you have 

to have a logical principle.  I'm sorry, I --

JUSTICE BREYER:  A logical principle or, I 

thought, if I was mentioning all those things that might 
lead a judge in the future, because of the size, in the 
past, because of the size, in the fact that it's a 
single individual, in the fact that there's a case 
coming up that's likely that the judge will decide --
all those things that are listed by the chief justices 
in their brief, all those things together make it a 
serious risk that there will be bias, even though an 
individual might not be.  There is a serious risk.

 Call it a "probability"; call it an 

"appearance."  Use the language that you want, but put 
them together, and they spell "mother."

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't matter what 
language you use because it's pretty vague anyway --
"probability," "likelihood," "appearance" -- it doesn't 
really --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Don't you understand what I 
mean?  I'm not worried about what you call "probability"

MR. FREY:  I don't agree with you, Justice 

Breyer.  I think you have to -- you have to have a 
reason.  You don't have a decision that's good for this 
case only.  You have to have a decision that's 
principled, and when -- and when you ask what is the 
principle, what is it that would cause Justice Benjamin 
-- and by the way, let me say that I think if Justice 
Benjamin was moved to do anything, it's to vote against 
Massey or to recuse himself to avoid the controversy 
that would attend a vote for Massey that he knew was 
going to happen.  And if you look at page 692 of the 
joint appendix, he actually discusses that problem.

 So I don't think you can even predict which 
way these circumstances would cause him to go, but I do 
think you need a principle, and the principle is either 
debt of gratitude or hope of future benefit.

 As to the hope of future benefit in this 

case, that is totally not viable for a couple of 
reasons.  One is Justice Benjamin's not running for 
another eight years.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  How long has Massey been in 

business, eight years?

 MR. FREY:  A long time.  Sure.  A long time.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  If one is going to go into 
that calculation, one is going to assume that in eight 
years, there's going to be another three million dollars 
waiting to be spent.

 MR. FREY:  That -- well, there's several 

problems with that, Justice Souter.  The first is 
there's no more likely to be spent on Justice Benjamin 
than on any other member of the court who might be 
sympathic.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, one has hopes.
 (Laughter.)
 MR. FREY:  Excuse me?
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  One has hopes.
 MR. FREY:  A lot of members of the Court 
would have the same exact hopes, with another reason, 
they might be running sooner, they might end up with an 
opponent who is more distasteful to Mr. Blankenship.

 By the way, Mr. Blankenship is not Massey. 

They are two separate things.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, you say that and I 
say that because we took corporate law.  But in -- in 
terms of my brother a moment ago spoke of we've been 
around Washington for a while, and I don't think that 
fine distinction counts very much on the issue that 
we've got.

MR. FREY:  But why would -- why would 

Blankenship be more likely to support Benjamin than to 
support Justice Davis or justice --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  We'll have to see when the 

next election comes along.  An expectation has been 
created that if there is an interest, the money will be 
spent, and it seems to me that underlies Justice 
Breyer's analysis just as it does mine.

 MR. FREY:  Where that takes you is all the 
judges have to recuse themselves because they all have 
the possibility of garnering support.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  They all have not had the 3 

million.

 MR. FREY:  But either you look to the past 
and you look at debt of gratitude, and in our brief we 
have indicated a number of circumstances where the same 
debt of gratitude rationale would apply.  There are a 
lot of things that led to Benjamin's election, and 
Blankenship's money is not necessarily the main thing at 
all.  And if you're looking forward --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but with respect, 

Justice Breyer disassociated his question from debt of 
gratitude.  I understand you -- you are arguing against 
a debt of gratitude theory, but if I recall his 
question, it was not based upon the debt of gratitude

theory.

 MR. FREY:  Right, but what I'm saying is you 
can't.  If -- if you're looking at -- at where -- where 
would the bias come from, and I'm assuming now that some 
probability of bias standard is accepted by the Court, 
and I'm asking where would the bias come from.  It 
either would come from a debt of gratitude for past 
contributions or an expectation of future benefits.  If 
it's an expectation of future benefits, it is not 
reasonable to assume that Benjamin has any stronger 
expectation than other members of the court.  So it 
seems to me you're in a position where if he has to 
recuse, they all have to recuse.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And then debt of 

gratitude -- we keep asking but your time is running 
out, have you said what you need to say on debt of 
gratitude?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm really anxious to hear 

what you have to say on debt of gratitude.

 MR. FREY:  Well, okay.
 (Laughter.)
 MR. FREY:  I don't know.  Some of the ground 

is covered already by questions during Mr. Olson's 
argument.  I think the debt of gratitude cannot be 
limited consistent with neutral principles to large

individual campaign contributions.  You have newspaper 
endorsements.  Clearly you could have a debt of 
gratitude there.  Newspaper could be a party in the 
case.

 You have the plaintiff lawyers and the 

doctors which we've talked about.  You have labor unions 
getting out the vote.  You have political figures 
endorsing.  And you have appointed judges and -- and to 
say that there's no -- to say that you're going to carve 
out the gratitude that the judges feel toward the 
president who appointed them -- I mean, the fact is in 
the Nixon tapes case, and in Clinton --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Frey, there is 

obviously a difference between appointed judges and 
elected judges.  But why do we have to rest on just one 
factor?  The Conference of Chief Justices suggested 
their seven factors should be taken into account.  Why 
is that totally unworkable?  Why does it have to be just 
one theory, debt of gratitude and nothing else?

 They don't -- the chief judges who are 

elected don't think that's the way to do it.

 MR. FREY:  I think you're mixing up two 

different things.  What is the -- one question is what 
is the wellspring of the bias?  Why do we think the 
judge has bias?  And the second question is how do we

measure that?

 And what I'm saying is if you think that 

Justice Benjamin would be biased in this case, which I 
certainly don't, and I think his track record has shown 
no bias in favor of Massey, then why would -- why would 
an appointed justice, appointed by a president in a case 
where the president's personal interests are at stake 
not have the same feelings of bias, and yet justices sit 
in those circumstances.

fair if you were in Justice Benjamin's position?  That, 
I submit, is not the question, because this Court has 
repeatedly said actual bias is something that's 
virtually impossible to prove, the counsel of -- the 
Conference of Chief Justices said don't go there.  We 
can't ever determine that.

 And so the question is what is -- is someone 

likely to be biased, likely to be unfair?

 And, Justice Kennedy, one of the factors 

that led us to the conclusion that an objective 
standard, that a reasonable person knowing all of the 
facts would probably be biased is language from a number 
of these court -- this Court's decisions, including your 
concurrence in the Liteky case -- I think it's Liteky, 
L-I-T-E-K-Y -- in which you said the objective observer 
would entertain reasonable questions about the judge's 
impartiality.

 Now, that's a case involving section 455 and 

not the Due Process Clause, but I think the logic with 
respect to the application of the test and the ability 
of this Court and other courts to apply it, as the 
Conference of Chief Justices said they could, is the 
same.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What is the difference 

between this situation and a situation where a justice

or a judge is appointed by an executive and then hears a 
case that is of critical importance to the executive?

 MR. OLSON:  The -- the -- there's a number 
of questions.  In the first place, there's life tenure 
for federal judges.

 Secondly, was that appointment made --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Specifically if Justice 

Benjamin were term limited, would this case be 
different?

 MR. OLSON:  No, I think it wouldn't be 

different because of all the confluence of 
circumstances.  If a detached observer, again to use 
Justice Kennedy's words --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait, you can't have it 

both ways.  I mean, if your response to the first 
question is judges have lifetime tenure, you then can't 
respond to the second question would it make a 
difference if he was term limited by saying, no, it 
wouldn't make a difference.

 MR. OLSON:  He might be running for another 
court, he might need the benefits.  This was $3 million 
in a race in which that amounted to more money than 
everybody else collectively put into this race while 
this case was pending.

 Now, the language that I think is important

is from the Tumey case, might not a defendant with 
reason say that he would fear he would not get a fair 
trial.  So instead of the question that my opponent 
asks, would you be fair, which is not the standard 
because actual bias isn't the test, would there be a 
perception, likelihood, probability appearance of bias, 
to use the language used by this Court over and over 
again.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about --
MR. OLSON:  Ask yourself this question --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about 

protective donations?  You actually give, not three 
million, but a couple hundred thousand to somebody you 
don't want deciding your case.  And it comes up, and you 
say, you have to recuse yourself because --

MR. OLSON:  As this Court has said, I think, 

in one of the cases that you can't allow a litigant to 
try to game the system in that way.  What I was getting 
to instead of the question --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How do you know?  I 

mean, are you saying it's going to be clear in every 
case that the judge is going to rule against the 
particular entity?

 MR. OLSON:  It's not going to be clear in 

every case, Mr. Chief Justice.  It's going to be would a

detached observer conclude that a fair and impartial 
hearing would be possible?  So instead of the question 
that Mr. Frey was asking whether you, yourself, could be 
-- I would like to ask you to ask this question.  If 
this was going to be the judge in your case, would you 
think it would be fair and would it be a fair tribunal 
if the judge in your case was selected with a $3 million 
subsidy by your opponent?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that a reasonable 
person that's making that inquiry, is that the standard?

 MR. OLSON:  That is the standard that 

this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Would a 

reasonable person think it's a ground for recusal if the 
lawyer and the judge were very close friends?
 MR. OLSON:  No, I don't think so.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You don't think so? 

A reasonable person comes up and says I socialize all 
the time, you know, they were at each other's weddings, 
whatever it is, we know that that's not a basis for 
recusal.

 MR. OLSON:  Then if it was a basis for a 
recusal, you would have to be recusing all the time, 
because that is a standard that's reasonable question of 
impartiality is in section 455, it is in many of the

State codes.  The courts handle these decisions all of 
the time.  These are factors, and I think I would go 
back to Justice Stevens' and Justice Breyer's question, 
this is a situation where there has got to be some 
limits.

 Our opponents say there's -- bias tribunals 

are not prohibited by the Due Process Clause nor 
probably biased or the appearance of bias.  We think 
there has to be some constitutional limit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:18 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
