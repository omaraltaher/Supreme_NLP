CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 02-473, the United States v. LaShawn Lowell


Banks.


Mr. Salmons.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. SALMONS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The officers in this case went to respondent's


apartment on a weekday afternoon to execute a valid search


warrant for drugs.  They knocked loudly and announced


their purpose.  They waited at least 15 to 20 seconds


without hearing any response and then forcibly entered the 

apartment.  Those actions were reasonable under the Fourth


Amendment. 


The Ninth Circuit concluded otherwise based on


its adoption of a rigid, four-part categorical approach to


knock and announce cases that is fundamentally at odds


with this Court's precedents in two critical respects. 


First, it is inconsistent with the flexibility that is an


essential feature of this Court's totality of the


circumstances test, and second, it turns primarily on the


need to damage some property in order to effectuate an

entry, a factor that under this Court's reasoning in


Ramirez should have no relevance to whether the entry at a


particular time was itself lawful.


QUESTION:  Did the court here say that these


were the only -- the only four factors?


MR. SALMONS:  No, Your Honor.  What the court


here did -- and I would refer the Court to -- to page, I


believe, 6a of the appendix to the petition for


certiorari, actually beginning on page 5a.  What the court


does is it first creates four basic categories of knock


and announce cases, and those categories are defined by


two factors, one being the presence of exigent


circumstances and the other being the need to damage


property.


And then on page 6a, what it does is its says 

that the essential question of whether the entry was


reasonable is approached in the following way.  First, we


characterize -- and this is the first full paragraph on


page 6a.  In addressing that inquiry, we characterize


entries as either forced or non-forced, meaning either


property is damaged or not damaged.  The reasonableness


must then be determined in light of the totality of the


circumstances.  Now, the court does list a number of


factors that it thinks are relevant.


QUESTION:  And -- and it says that -- that those

factors are not exclusive.  They say they're -- they


include but are not limited to.


MR. SALMONS:  That's correct, Your Honor.  And


we take no issue with its list of non-exclusive factors in


terms of whether those factors are relevant to the


question under the totality of the circumstances test. 


The difficulty we have with the Ninth Circuit's approach


in this case is that it has engrafted a rigid property


destruction rule onto the Fourth Amendment's flexible


standard of reasonableness and onto this Court's totality


of the circumstances test.


In other words, what the court of appeals does


is it requires that where an entry is non-forcible, again


meaning no property need be destroyed, then the officers


must wait a significant amount of time before entry.  But


where some property damage is required, it would require,


quote, an explicit refusal of admittance or the lapse of


an even more substantial amount of time.


And we think that that both is inconsistent with


the totality of the circumstances standard because it


imposes this rigid rule of property damage, and it's


inconsistent with Ramirez which makes clear that the need


to damage property, although it's certainly relevant to


the ultimate question of whether the manner of the


execution of the warrant is reasonable under the Fourth

Amendment, it's not a relevant inquiry into whether the


entry at a particular time is itself lawful.


QUESTION:  Doesn't -- excuse me.


QUESTION:  Go ahead.


QUESTION:  No, please.


QUESTION:  I just had this -- I was just curious


about one aspect of property damage and so forth.  If a


citizen's property is damaged by this, who pays for the


damage?


MR. SALMONS:  Well, Your Honor, there is --


there is a statute that Congress has enacted and that is


31 U.S.C. 3724, and that authorizes the Attorney General


to pay out sums of money up to, I believe, $50,000 to pay


for any damage to property that may result from law


enforcement activities. 


The way that it typically works, 

as I understand it, Your Honor, is that there is a


significant fund set up based on forfeiture assets, and


that those funds are used to pay for damage to property


that may result during the course of -- of a search or --


or other law enforcement activities.


Typically what happens is the law enforcement


officers will not leave the premises until it is at least


secured, and then they provide forms or other information


so that individuals can make claims --

 MR. SALMONS:  -- for any property that is


damaged.  And -- and at least with regard to Federal law


enforcement practices, those claims are readily paid out


and there are funds to do so through the forfeiture


proceeds.


QUESTION:  Of course, that would have -- that


would not apply.  This was really a State search rather


than a Federal search even though it was --


MR. SALMONS:  This was a joint search, Your


Honor.  This was a -- the -- the search was conducted by a


joint task force.  There were both local police officers. 


They were at the front door.  There was an FBI agent at


the back door.  We think that this search, although it's


not in the record -- I don't know exactly how it occurred


in this case with regard to whether any claims made for 

damage to the door.  But because the FBI was involved in


the search, typically that -- they -- they -- that


information would be provided.


QUESTION:  I see. 


QUESTION:  Do they pay the claim if -- if in


fact the -- the person is arrested and is there and is --


and does have marijuana?


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  Do -- do you pay only if you're -- do


you get paid only if you're innocent?

 MR. SALMONS:  It -- it depends, Your Honor. 


There are -- there are factors that are considered.  I'm


-- I'm not entirely sure of -- of what all of them are. 


If there is -- I would -- my understanding is that if


there is -- certainly if there was another individual that


lives in the home or -- or otherwise, that even though the


entry was -- was reasonable and the need to destroy or


damage property was reasonable, if there were other people


in the home, the officer -- the -- the Federal law


enforcement officials typically pay that.


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. SALMONS:  And even when there's not, they


often do as well.


QUESTION:  Well, this is a background issue, and


-- and I don't mean to take you away from talking about 

the Ninth Circuit's case in response to Justice Scalia's


question. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Salmons, may I ask you one


question on -- on your timing point?  Your claim is that


the -- that the issue of property damage is irrelevant to


the question of reasonable timing as distinct from


reasonable execution.  I understand your argument when we


are dealing with a situation in which there is an -- an


exigency, a set of circumstances that said you've got to


act fast.

 My question, though, goes to the situation in


which there is no exigency.  You're -- you're executing a


warrant for -- to seize a stolen grand piano or something. 


No property is going to be destroyed if you wait a little


bit longer.  In that case, where there is no exigency, not


at the beginning, none develops while you're waiting,


doesn't the issue of property damage have some relevance


to the question of timing?  In other words, if there's no


risk that anything is going away, isn't it reasonable for


the police to say, okay, give them another minute or


something like that?


MR. SALMONS:  We submit, no, Your Honor, and for


the following reason, that in -- typically the -- the


standard would -- that would be applied in this kind of a


context would be whether the officers had waited 

sufficiently long so that they could reasonably conclude


that there was a constructive denial of admittance or


that, as you indicate, other law enforcement -- excuse me


-- other law enforcement concerns may justify a more


prompt entry.


In the hypothetical that you gave, none of those


other law enforcement concerns are present, and so the


question then, we submit, would be whether the officers


could reasonably conclude that they had been


constructively denied admittance.  And there, the need to

damage some property, if it exists at all, is a


consequence of the denial of admittance, not a factor as


to whether the denial had in fact occurred.


QUESTION:  But when -- when you're dealing --


let's -- let's take the case in which the exigency


develops while you're waiting.  One reason why it is


reasonable to -- to suspect that you are being denied


admittance, let's say, in a case where drugs are easily


disposable is that there is good reason to believe that


somebody would -- another 10 or 20 or whatever seconds


will use the 20 seconds to get rid of the drugs, if


possible.  You don't have any basis for drawing that kind


of a conclusion in the grand piano case, and there --


there is less reason to believe, less reason to suspect


that you are actually being denied admittance as opposed 

to simply being the victim of somebody who's slow at


getting the -- to the door.  Isn't that a fair line of


reasoning?


MR. SALMONS:  I mean, I think the distinction


Your Honor makes between those types of cases is a


legitimate one.  We still think though, however, that the


need to damage property is really not a factor that goes


into whether entry at a particular time was reasonable


under the circumstances.  It's a consequence of the denial


-- excuse me.  It's a consequence of the occupant's

QUESTION:  But -- but maybe --


QUESTION:  Are there -- are there guidebooks? 


Is there any manual that Federal law enforcement officers


use that will say in -- in a knock and announce situation,


these are the relevant factors?  Do they suggest a time, a


time span that would be appropriate? 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, there is training that


occurs, although to my understanding, there's not a


specific amount of time that's -- that's provided to


officers that they need to wait as some sort of minimum. 


Rather, consistent with this Court's cases, the -- the


guidelines and -- and the training that's conducted


teaches the officers that they must take into account the


totality of the circumstances. 


That would include factors 

like how large of -- of a dwelling it is, what time of day


it is.


QUESTION:  But there's nothing -- nothing


written down that suggests how many seconds, no manual


that Federal law enforcement --


MR. SALMONS:  To my knowledge, that is correct. 


The -- it used to be the case, as I understand it, that


there was a suggested amount of time and that was 30


seconds when there are no other law enforcement concerns


that are at issue, but that currently the training that is

conducted just focuses on the totality of the


circumstances and that they need to wait a reasonable


period of time, and if there are no other law enforcement


concerns at issue, then that reasonable period of time is


typically considered to be how long it would take to


conclude that you were constructively denied admittance --


QUESTION:  But not if there are -- but not if


there are other law enforcement concerns.


MR. SALMONS:  That's correct.  If there are


other concerns --


QUESTION:  I mean, what troubles me is you --


you can't simply announce that -- that the rule is you


wait a reasonable amount -- what -- what constitutes a


reasonable of time is how long it would be expected


someone would take to get to the door. 


You -- you can't 

adopt that as your uniform rule because otherwise, you'd


have to use the same amount of time whether there are


exigent circumstances or not.


MR. SALMONS:  That -- that --


QUESTION:  If it takes 20 seconds usually, it


takes 20 seconds.


MR. SALMONS:  That -- you are correct, Your


Honor.

QUESTION:  That isn't quite right.  Because


certainly in a motel room, it would be less time than it


would in a mansion.


MR. SALMONS:  No.  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  No.  I'm just saying the exigent


circumstances would not alter what is a reasonable time.


MR. SALMONS:  And that's why we submit that the


relevant question is not just how long it would take for a


person under those circumstances to get to the door.  The


-- the analysis must take into account as well valid law


enforcement concerns.  And -- and all this -- what I think


all this illustrates is what this Court has repeatedly


said, which is this is a contextual analysis that has to


be based on the totality of the circumstances.  There's no


mechanical rule --


QUESTION:  Well, but may -- may I just


interrupt?


MR. SALMONS:  -- or a reasoned way to apply it.


QUESTION:  It's not how long it would take a


person to get to the door.  It's how long a period must


elapse before it's reasonable to infer that the person has


refused to come to the door.


MR. SALMONS:  You're correct.  You're correct,


Your Honor.  That -- and that would be -- that would be

that would warrant --


QUESTION:  Well, yes, but -- but that also is


not affected by the existence or nonexistence of -- of


exigent circumstances.  So the exigent circumstances sort


of override --


MR. SALMONS:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- how long it would take a


reasonable person to get to the door.


MR. SALMONS:  That -- that's -- that is my


understanding, Your Honor, and I think that's exactly


right.  I would also --


QUESTION:  Mr. Salmons, are you relying on


exigent circumstances here because it was a drug case or


not?


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, in this case, let me


begin by pointing out that we submit that the 15 to 20


seconds that the officers delayed in this case is a


substantial amount of time.  And it's no -- it's really


nowhere close to the constitutional line.


QUESTION:  Well, could you answer my question? 


Are you relying?  We have to reweigh this, I assume, and


do you want us to treat this as an exigent circumstance


case or not?  Yes or no?

that --


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. SALMONS:  -- by your question you're


referring --


QUESTION:  That's what I'm asking.


MR. SALMONS:  The only reason I hesitated is


because I think the term exigent circumstances can be a


bit ambiguous, and this is not a case where the Government


has suggested that the officers were entitled to forego


knocking and announcing at any point in the process.


QUESTION:  This was a small apartment, was it?


MR. SALMONS:  Yes.  This was a small apartment. 


It was in the middle of the afternoon.


QUESTION:  What size? 


MR. SALMONS: 


It was a two-bedroom apartment. 

I'm not sure of the square footage.  There are some


diagrams of the apartment in the joint appendix.  The


testimony of the officers was that it was sufficiently


small that the officers located in the back of the


apartment could hear the knock and announce at the front


door.


QUESTION:  Does it make any difference if the


occupant says, wait a minute, I'm in the shower, I'm


coming?


MR. SALMONS:  Well, certainly that would be a

factor that would then go under the totality of the


circumstances standard.  Whether or not -- I mean, there


are a lot of other things that the officers would have to


consider, including whether they're being truthful,


whether they can hear water running, whether there's still


a risk that they may have drugs with them in the shower,


dumping them down the drain.


QUESTION:  But in response to Justice O'Connor's


question, there are no exigent circumstances of the type


that would eliminate the need to knock and announce at


all.


still --


MR. SALMONS:  That's correct, but there are


QUESTION:  Are you going to go on to say that


there are some other exigent circumstances that are in the 

background here that --


MR. SALMONS:  Well, certainly --


QUESTION:  -- that counsel against waiting more


than 20 seconds?


MR. SALMONS:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  In fact,


even though there may not be sufficient concerns about


officer safety or the destruction of evidence to forego


knocking and announcing altogether, those are still valid


law enforcement concerns in the context of a case like


this where the officers are there to execute a warrant for

drugs.  The officers are -- have strong evidence that


there are, in fact, drugs in the apartment.  They did a


controlled buy not long before they went to execute the


warrant, and there is the risk at a minimum of the


destruction of evidence, and that those are factors that


have to be taken into account.


QUESTION:  And that would be true in almost any


drug case where the officers know that drugs are in -- are


-- are in the premises or have reason to believe that


drugs are in the premises.


MR. SALMONS:  Certainly I think the potential


for that concern is present in almost all -- and not just


drug cases, but any case where the -- the evidence to be


sought through the search is subject to -- to readily


destruction and --


QUESTION:  And you say that's not enough to


forego knock and announce, but it is enough to shorten the


time period that you have to wait.


MR. SALMONS:  Yes, Your Honor, that -- that it's


not enough to -- at least in the context of this case,


that there was not enough reasonable suspicion of those


concerns to forego knocking and announcing altogether, but


those factors still have to be taken into account under


the totality of the circumstances in evaluating whether


the officers here waited a reasonable period of time.

MR. SALMONS:  No.  I think not, Your Honor. 


We're not suggesting some rigid rule that applies in all


cases.  What we're suggesting is that as part of the


totality of the circumstances, it -- it must be the case


that the officers that are going to execute the warrant


can take into account the fact that the evidence they're


seeking is readily disposable.  That -- all we're


suggesting is that should be a factor.  It should into the


analysis, and generally that would be a factor that would 

tend to cut in favor of a prompter entry.


QUESTION:  But isn't it true that the -- the


purpose of the analysis is to decide whether or not the


silence is the equivalent of a refusal?  Because the


statute requires a refusal.  And if that's true, I -- I am


really kind of puzzled as to why the possibility of


disposing of drugs affects the time period.


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, I think we would


disagree with your characterization of the purpose of the


inquiry at least in part, and that is that as Justice

Souter's question earlier pointed out, in a case where


there are no concerns that would -- that would warrant a


more prompt entry, we think the question is whether a


reasonable officer could conclude that he had been


constructively denied admittance.  But -- but where there


are those concerns, even if they don't rise to the level


of foregoing knocking and announcing altogether --


QUESTION:  But isn't --


MR. SALMONS:  -- they're factors that cut in


favor of a prompter entry. 


QUESTION:  But isn't it true, if you just look


at the language of the statute, the inquiry is always has


there been a refusal?


MR. SALMONS:  That is the way --


QUESTION: 


If you're not relying on exigent 

circumstances, when you just go on in anyway.


MR. SALMONS:  That is the way in which the


statute is worded, Your Honor.  This Court has --


QUESTION:  And that's what it means too, isn't


it?


MR. SALMONS:  Well, we think not, Your Honor. 


This Court has never felt that the -- that the terms of


this statute are to be construed literally.  In fact, if


the Court were to start doing so, it would need to


overturn a number of its prior cases, including in Miller,

where it read the statute to reach arrest warrants -- or


even arrests without warrants; Sabbath, where it read


forcibly break to not require any showing of force.  What


the Court has held that it really --


QUESTION:  Those -- those are all breaks in


favor of the -- of the citizen.  This is a break that is


not in favor of the citizen.  There -- there may be some


of us who are willing to twist the statute for the benefit


of the citizen, but not for the benefit of the Government.


QUESTION:  Maybe others who feel equally.


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, I think --


(Laughter.) 


MR. SALMONS:  I think there may be a more benign


explanation, which is this Court has recognized that what


this statute does is it filled a gap. 


There's a 

historical explanation that this statute filled a gap that


then existed in Federal law because this Court had not


incorporated or -- or subsumed the common law principles


of knock and announce into the Fourth Amendment and many


States had.  And so what Congress did was -- and this


Court reaffirmed this in Ramirez not long ago, that what


the statute does is it codifies the common law tradition


of knock and announce, and that includes all the


exceptions to knock and announce.

 QUESTION:  How do they get out of it?  Because


how do you say -- I mean, suppose the person from behind


the door says, oh, police, you'd like to come in.  I'll


let you in.  Come right in, but just wait 1 minute while I


flush the drugs down the toilet. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Now, he's not refusing him


admittance.  I mean, he's welcoming him.  So how -- how is


the Court -- with open arms.  He's delighted to have him


in.  He says, it'll just take a second. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  And -- now, how -- how -- how has the


law reconciled that which is obvious that he ought to --


the police ought to be able to get in there -- with the


statute that says they cannot come in unless he refuses 

the police admittance?  And he hasn't. 


MR. SALMONS:  Right.  You point out a very good


point, Your Honor, and that's why this Court has said that


-- that the statute can't be read literally and instead --


QUESTION:  I don't think they read it --


QUESTION:  I don't think it's a good point at


all.  I think refusing admittance means refusing prompt


admittance.  It doesn't say you can come in next week. 


That's refusing admittance.  Knock, knock, I want to come


in.  You can't come in now.  You can come in next week.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 

 MR. SALMONS:  The -- the point I was attempting


to make, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  That's refusing admittance.


MR. SALMONS:  The point I was attempting to


make, Your Honor was that what this Court has recognized


repeatedly, and it said in Ramirez it was now decisively


holding and resolving the question, and that is that the


statute here, 3109, is not to be read literally but merely


is to be read as a codification of the common law


tradition of knock and announce.  And as this Court


indicated in its decision in Wilson, that common law


tradition is a flexible one, and it's one --


QUESTION:  Does that flexibility mean that there


really isn't this bright line between exigent and


nonexigent?  There's kind of a spectrum. 


So while it's 

not exigent enough to do away with the knock and announce,


there is then a difference between the case Justice Souter


posed of the grand piano and the warrant is to search for


drugs which could easily be -- be disposed of.


MR. SALMONS:  We submit so, Your Honor.  We


think that --


QUESTION:  So it's not 100 percent exigent, but


neither can one say it's nonexigent.


MR. SALMONS:  That's -- I believe that is our


position, that -- that although there were not sufficient

exigencies in this case to justify foregoing knocking and


announcing altogether, that the officers here were -- were


permitted to take into account the risks inherent in


executing a warrant in this kind of a context, including


the risk of destroying of that --


QUESTION:  May I ask this question?  Does a


citizen have a right to make sure that they're really


officers by getting a copy of the warrant or something


like that?  Could he -- could a citizen come to the door


and say, slide the warrant under the door and I'll look at


it and I'll let you in if I think you're genuine?


MR. SALMONS:  I'm not aware of case law on that,


Your Honor.  I -- I -- presumably they -- they are


permitted to do that.  Again, all of that would go into


the totality of the circumstances. 


Any response from the 

occupants I think are things that the officers --


QUESTION:  Because the occupant -- I can


conceive of situations in which an occupant might be


concerned that perhaps it's not a genuine law enforcement


officer.  It's somebody who wants to hold up the house,


you know. 


MR. SALMONS:  Well -- well, certainly one of the


purposes of the knock and announce rule, Your Honor, is to


provide notice to the occupants that it is the police that


are attempting to come in so that it increases public

safety and -- and protects both the officers and the


occupants.


QUESTION:  What time did this take place?


MR. SALMONS:  This took place at 2 o'clock on a


Wednesday afternoon, Your Honor. 


I think one of the remarkable things about the


Ninth Circuit's decision in this case is that the


officers' delay here really was nowhere close to the


constitutional line.  15 to 20 seconds is a substantial


delay.  Even if this Court were to conclude this case


based only on the question of whether they had been


constructively denied admittance, we think these other


factors warranted a prompter entry here.


And in fact, the testimony of the officers in


this case suggests that. 


The officer from the Nevada 

police that was at the front door stated that he waited a


long time in this case because he thought there was some


chance that the case may go to Federal court, and he


wanted to make sure that there were no knock and announce


concerns. 


The FBI agent at the back of the -- of the


apartment testified that he -- he became concerned about


the length of the delay.  He described it as unusually


long and stated that he was concerned that the occupant


might be attempting to flee from another way.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 

 This is simply not a case that's close to the


line, and for the Ninth Circuit to hold that the officers


in this case were required to wait some additional period


of time that's unspecified, in addition to the 15 to 20


seconds, really does pose threats to law enforcement


officials engaged in the front-line law enforcement


activities in the jurisdictions covered by the Ninth


Circuit. 


QUESTION:  Going back to Justice Scalia's


initial question, the Ninth Circuit opinion is wrong


because? 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit


opinion is wrong because it adopts a rigid property


destruction rule and engrafts it onto the totality of the


circumstances test. 


And that rule is one not flexible 

enough to be consistent with the totality of the


circumstances test and, two, is inconsistent with this


Court's decision in Ramirez which indicated that the


question of the timing of an entry is distinct from the


question of the manner in which the entry and the warrant


itself are executed.  The destruction of property may very


well constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment if it


is needless or wanton, but that, as this Court said in


Ramirez, does not make the entry unlawful and it doesn't


require suppression.  And so --

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 

 QUESTION:  Do you -- do you think that the


dissenting judge Fisher got it essentially right?


MR. SALMONS:  Well, certainly we think that


Judge Fisher was correct when he indicated that one of his


concerns about the court of appeals -- the panel's


decision in this case was that it didn't follow its own


list of factors.


We also think Judge Fisher was correct when he


indicated that all one needs do is do a thought experiment


and think to yourself, police, search warrant, and count


out 15 to 20 seconds to see how long a period of time this


really was.


QUESTION:  Do you -- do you say that the -- the


property line is improper only when there are exigent


circumstances or in all situations?


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, we submit that it is


not relevant to the question of the timing of the entry in


all circumstances. 


QUESTION:  You mean a -- a police officer


shouldn't wait any longer before he rips my door down,


leaving the house exposed to -- to burglars than he --


than he has to wait when that isn't necessary, when the


door is open and he can just walk in?


MR. SALMONS:  That -- that's correct, Your


Honor, and let me explain why.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 

 QUESTION:  Why isn't that part of the totality


of the circumstances? 


MR. SALMONS:  The reason we think, one, flows


from this Court's decision in Ramirez where the Court


differentiated between the timing of the entry and the


need to damage property.


And two, it's important to keep in mind what the


officers in that situation have to take into account. 


They're -- they're waiting and they have to -- they have


to consider how long they have to wait to either conclude


that they've been constructively denied admittance --


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. SALMONS:  -- or that there are valid law


enforcement concerns that require entry at that time.


QUESTION:  I'm -- I'm excluding the latter.  I'm


saying there are no other exigent circumstances, not even


the -- the moderate exigent circumstances that are not


enough to enable you to go in without knock and announce.


There are just no other exigent circumstances. 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, in that case --


QUESTION:  There's no reason whatever.  All


they're looking for is how long is it reasonable to wait


for me to come to the door.  And you're -- you're telling


me it is just as reasonable for them to have to wait only


15 seconds when their entry simply requires walking in and

still 15 seconds when it requires them to bash in the


door.  That doesn't seem to me to be a -- an application


of totality of the circumstances. 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, we would disagree


because, first of all, it's -- it's going to be -- it's


often going to be the case that the officer, at the time


he makes the decision that he's been constructively denied


admittance, doesn't know whether the door is locked or


not, and he really can't be put in a position where he has


to check the doors and windows to see whether any are


unlocked before he's allowed to enter.  He's -- he has a


warrant that authorizes him to go in, forcibly if


necessary, secure the premises and search for the evidence


covered by the warrant.  That's what happened here.  The


fact that the door happened to be locked or unlocked is 

really not a factor that the officers can take into


account at that stage of the process.  And it --


QUESTION:  Should we consider these two


possibilities in Justice Scalia's case?


Possibility one, no exigency again, just take


his premises as -- as he gave it.  Possibility one, the


police knock on the door; they say, police, search


warrant.  A guy on the inside says, I don't want to see


you.  The police say at that point, come on, we're


serious.  We've got a warrant out here.  Open up.

 Possibility two, same thing.  The guy says, I


don't want to see you.  The police bash the door down.


Isn't the fact that the police could say, come


on open up, we're serious a factor to take into


consideration in deciding whether, at the point the fellow


says I don't want to see you, it's right for them to bash


the door down?


MR. SALMONS:  Again, Your Honor, we think the


relevant inquiry is whether a reasonable officer could


conclude that he had been constructively denied


admittance.


QUESTION:  Exactly, and if that's --


MR. SALMONS:  And it seems to me under your


hypothetical, he probably could. 


QUESTION:  And I -- I think so too.  That's why


I put it that way. 


MR. SALMONS:  And so --


QUESTION:  If that is the only question that you


ask, I think you are taking a very narrow view of totality


of circumstance. 


MR. SALMONS:  Well, again, Your Honor, in -- in


-- I see my time is almost up.  We think that flows from


the principle this Court followed in Ramirez that the


timing of the entry needs to be separated from the manner


in which the entry and the search is conducted.  That's

If I may, I'd like to reserve the rest of my

QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Salmons.


Mr. Roske, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL J. ROSKE


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. ROSKE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


this Court:


This case is about whether your door, my door,


and everyone's door is worth 15 seconds.  This case


presents the component of the knock and announce statute


that's the refusal component that this Court has not


addressed previously in any of its decisions. 


In Wilson, you said that this rule is of 

constitutional magnitude, and in the Wisconsin v. Richards


case, you said there can be no blanket exceptions to knock


and announce just based on the -- the kind of case it is.


And then we see in Ramirez the Court talks about 3109 and


-- and so we see a line of cases where from Miller where


we were dealing with sort of an oversight of the -- the


Court's decisions overseeing the criminal justice system


from a Federal standpoint --

entry where the door --

QUESTION:  -- was bashed in?


MR. ROSKE:  That's true.  And there were --


QUESTION:  And this Court said that could comply


with the Fourth Amendment? 


MR. ROSKE:  Yes.  And the -- the Court in -- in


Ramirez noted that there were all kinds of indications and


evidence known to the officers of the person, the suspect,


the fugitive that they were looking for being armed,


dangerous, likely to resist forcibly the officers, and


officer safety exceptions --


QUESTION:  But we didn't apply the statute


literally there.


MR. ROSKE:  No.  You never have, as far as I


understand the Court's decisions, applied a literal 

interpretation of the 3109.


QUESTION:  Ramirez was a break-in -- a -- an


entry into not the house of the person who was -- who was


sought, but someone else's house where he was thought to


be staying.  The -- the damage was done not -- not -- to


someone who was concededly innocent.


MR. ROSKE:  Well, he wasn't concededly --


QUESTION:  Well, he had a -- he was a felon in


possession they found.


MR. ROSKE:  That is correct.  That case involved

a fugitive who was not the known occupant of the


residence, and they had developed information that this


individual was, however, staying at the Ramirez residence.


QUESTION:  One thing I thought that the Ninth


Circuit opinion really was contrary to Ramirez was its


stress on property damage, which -- which Ramirez made


quite clear was not determinative.


MR. ROSKE:  Well, I think that the circuit,


Ninth Circuit, has focused on property damage as, you


know, we have a statute that talks about breaking, and it


sees that in -- in the context of delay as requiring more


time.


QUESTION:  Well, we also have an opinion, e.g.,


Ramirez, which the Ninth Circuit didn't even cite, which


says that property damage is not controlling. 

MR. ROSKE:  Well, and that's true and I -- I


concede that is so.  And I would submit to the Court that


you can decide that those guideposts cited by the Ninth


Circuit are flat wrong and reach the ground there that it


is entirely reasonable under a totality of the


circumstance test that you affirm the decision.  You can


do a decision saying that the guideposts are simply wrong


under Ramirez, but the result under a totality of the


circumstances test is correct.

argument the other way is what they said.  In the lower


court, the Ninth Circuit says that the police waited a


maximum of 15 to 20 seconds, and the police say and the


Government says that's way more than enough time to flush


the drugs down the toilet.  All right?  So every other


circuit has said 10 seconds, 15 seconds, is the maximum, 6


seconds, and even the Ninth Circuit has normally held that


15 to 20 seconds is long enough to wait when it's a small


house, daylight so people are awake, and all it would take


is about 2 seconds to get rid of the evidence.  So they've


all said that.


And this case, they say, is an outlier.  This is


well beyond what every other circuit has done and doesn't


make any sense.  All right?  Because the drugs will just


be destroyed.


Now, what's your response to that?  That's the


basic argument.  I'd like to hear your response. 


MR. ROSKE:  Well, the response would be that,


yes, the modern marvel of indoor plumbing does provide an


avenue for the destruction of evidence.  It also provides


people the opportunity to shower themselves.  And this is


the archetype kind of activity that occurs in the home


which the privacy concerns are the greatest for.  And --


and --

then says even though you have a warrant, probable cause


for believing there are drugs there, and it's easy to get


rid of them, there's just nothing the police can do about


it except not prosecute the drug cases in these


situations.


MR. ROSKE:  15 seconds is a -- is virtually no


time at all to respond to a door.


QUESTION:  Why is --


QUESTION:  What does the shower have to do with


it?  Is -- is it your contention that a reasonable time is


how long it takes somebody to complete a shower?


MR. ROSKE:  No, but that's the kind of --


QUESTION:  Well, then -- then of what relevance


is the shower?


MR. ROSKE:  The relevance --


QUESTION:  It seems to me it's of no relevance


at all.  This fellow said he was taking a shower.  Well,


surely you don't have to wait as long as it takes the


normal person to complete a shower.


MR. ROSKE:  I agree.


QUESTION:  And presumably dry himself and


presumably put on a towel.


MR. ROSKE:  Grab a towel.  In this case, we


don't know how long Mr. Banks would have continued the


shower, whether he would have become aware of the -- of

the officers at his --


QUESTION:  We don't know and we don't care


because that surely does not determine what's a reasonable


time to wait.


MR. ROSKE:  Right.  But the -- but the point of


the shower is this.  Anybody that's in -- in a home, in a


dwelling, and in a community such as we have that's 24


hours, anything could be being -- sleeping and other


activities where that would cause someone to be unable to


respond within 15 seconds can occur.


QUESTION:  First, just a quibble.  But I read


the lower court as saying 15 to 20 seconds, and I take it


as 20 seconds because given that statement, had this been


20 seconds, they would have said it was unlawful.  And so


if in fact you concede that 20 seconds is too long, then I 

guess I'd have to reverse or is -- you know.  So -- so


what I want -- I'm -- I'm taking the outer limit of what


they said.


Now, on that, I want to be sure I've got a


complete answer from you because I was pushing you, and so


far I've said all the circuits say 15 to 20 seconds is


certainly enough time for the policemen to wait where it's


a drug case, a small house, and you could easily get rid


of the evidence.  In response to that, you said that you


thought that 15 seconds -- but you should say 20 -- is --

is actually -- they have to wait that long.  Now, is there


anything other than your opinion, which I respect, but --


but what I'd like to know is whether there is any basis in


authority or reason or something, other than that, that


would support your position. 


MR. ROSKE:  All of the cases that were cited in


the briefs I tried to distinguish as having differences


that were fundamental to the case, the sole occupant, for


instance, they note --


QUESTION:  Well, why don't we take the Ninth


Circuit's own subsequent case where it has a footnote? 


This is the Chavez-Miranda --


MR. ROSKE:  Right, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  -- where the court said, Banks


appears to be a departure from our prior decisions.  As


noted by the trial court, we have found a 10- to 20-second


wait to be reasonable in similar circumstances. 


MR. ROSKE:  I think that the court in Chavez-


Miranda focused on the fact there were numerous occupants


in the -- in the residence and that even if -- if one or


two were engaged in some kind of private activity, the


others would be able to respond quickly to the door.


QUESTION:  But why is -- isn't 15 to 20 seconds


ample, if the question is reasonable time, in a small


apartment to get to the door to open it?

 MR. ROSKE:  It's not reasonable because it's


virtually no time at all.  If you're in the bathroom on


the toilet, if you're in the bedroom naked --


QUESTION:  It's the time -- it is the time in


which a telephone would ring at least twice and perhaps


three times.  Usually people pick up a phone after the


second ring.  If they can manage to do that, why wouldn't


one expect the same interval would apply in getting to the


door?


MR. ROSKE:  Well, there are plenty of times that


you may be home and you don't get to the phone in time


because you're engaged in some activity that -- that


prevents you from immediately responding.  And that's the


point of this case.  They had --


QUESTION: 


No, but isn't -- isn't the problem 

that -- that Justice Ginsburg is asking you about what is


a reasonable time, and your answers always get to the


point of saying, well, there are particular facts that


might have taken somebody longer than a reasonable time. 


And -- and that, of course, is always true.  They might


have been asleep at 2:00 in the afternoon.  They might


have been sick with a virus so that they couldn't get up


quickly.  There are all sorts of reasons.  But the issue


is -- is an issue of a reasonable time under the


circumstances known to the officer.  Isn't that correct?

 MR. ROSKE:  I believe that we cannot simply


measure the -- the test from the eyes of the officer.  You


have a duty --


QUESTION:  Well, they're the ones who have to


decide how long to wait.


MR. ROSKE:  Right, and they -- what did they


know?  They knew nothing in terms of exigent


circumstances.  And I would like to call the Court's


attention --


QUESTION:  Yes, but --


QUESTION:  They -- they knew they were dealing


with drugs, that the warrant was to search for drugs.


MR. ROSKE:  They knew that they were searching


for drugs, yes, and not grand pianos.  But the Fourth


Amendment, as you -- as you interpreted it in your cases, 

that -- you know, we just don't get rid of the refusal


component or the knock and announce rule simply because


drugs are involved.


QUESTION:  You don't get rid of it, but as I


suggested to Mr. Salmons, maybe there isn't this dichotomy


between exigent and nonexigent, but that it's not exigent


enough to avoid knock and announce altogether.  On the


other hand, it isn't like the grand piano.  That's not


going down the toilet.


MR. ROSKE:  Well, if you look at the appendix,

joint appendix, at page 75, and see what the officer said


about why he entered, he simply said that he thought that


15 seconds was reasonable and that this case might go


Federal and they've heard about problems with this.  And


he doesn't mention anything about a concern that evidence


is being flushed or that he heard anything.  And remember,


again, this is a small apartment.  If he heard the toilet


flushing, presumably he'd heard that.


QUESTION:  Let me -- let me talk about the small


apartment.  Might it not be the rule that when -- when


there are exigent circumstances, the amount of time you


have to give has nothing to do with how long it takes to


get to the door.  It has to do with how long it's


reasonable to wait with -- without impairing the law


enforcement purpose that is threatened by the exigent 

circumstances? 


I cannot imagine, can you, that -- that people


dealing with drugs are perfectly safe so long as they do


it in a really big house with lots of toilets?


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Okay?  So you have to wait 45


seconds.  They could way over at the other end of the


house.  What is a reasonable time for this house?  It's 45


seconds.  So let's do all of our -- all of our drug


activity in -- in a big house.  That can't be the rule.

 It seems to me the reasonable time is what is


reasonable to go in in order to prevent the exigent


circumstance from frustrating law enforcement.  Doesn't


that make more sense?


MR. ROSKE:  I think that the test should be a


protecting of the individual's rights from intrusions that


are unreasonable, and that all deference should not be


given to law enforcement officers' decisions.  In this


case, he didn't suggest at all that he had to go in


because he thought drugs were being chucked in the


commode.  It's not there in the record and nowhere in --


in -- below or in the Ninth Circuit did the Government


argue such a theory.  They simply said it was a reasonable


period of time.


QUESTION: 


Well, but if -- if we're to decide 

this case on the basis of reasonableness, certainly we've


got to take into consideration common sense factors that


may be suggested other than by the officer at the door.


MR. ROSKE:  Well, that's correct, but I think


this Court has a supervisory power and it has to not


abdicate all decisions to the officer at the door.  And


this officer has simply made a subjective decision there,


saying that was what he understood would be reasonable. 


There was an earlier --

period of time that you would agree was reasonable?


MR. ROSKE:  Well, I do note that the Ward case


cited in my brief talked about the FBI adopting some 60-


second rule.  Obviously, that would have been about 45


seconds more time than -- than was here.  I think that you


can't set a bright line rule and -- and that it has --


QUESTION:  Can you set a rule for the facts of


this case?


MR. ROSKE:  Well, we need to set a prophylactic


rule that recognizes the -- the dignity and the importance


of the refusal component.  In this case --


QUESTION:  I know, but what do you think that


rule is?


QUESTION:  Length-of-the-shower rule. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  For this case. 


MR. ROSKE:  I'm -- I'm suggesting that --


QUESTION:  Well, no.  I think you have agreed


the fact he's in the shower really is irrelevant because


the officers didn't know it, and you must judge these


things ex ante not ex post.


MR. ROSKE:  Right.  And I -- I agree.  Just as


they -- if they had heard the toilet flushing repeatedly,


that might be a factor to hasten their --

if you do have a view as to what would be reasonable on


the facts of this case.


MR. ROSKE:  Well, I think that -- that certainly


15 seconds was an unreasonably short period of time, and


that --


QUESTION:  I understand you think 15 to 20


seconds is unreasonable.  Do you have a view as to what


would have been reasonable?


MR. ROSKE:  I believe that a -- a wait towards a


minute might be more reasonable under these facts where


they have absolute -- see, they're confronted with silence


at the door.  It's not as if there's anything giving them


any kind --


QUESTION:  Yes, but so you have to be contending


that the Constitution requires them to wait -- the 

Constitution and the statute required them to wait a


certain period of time that was longer than 15 to 20


seconds.


MR. ROSKE:  What we're --


QUESTION:  And if so, I just wonder if you have


a theory as to how much longer.


MR. ROSKE:  Well, I -- I --

a figure to put on that.  I just know that this 15 to 20


seconds was too little time. 


QUESTION:  Well, would you be making the same


argument if it had been 30 seconds?  Let's put it that


way.  Would you be here --


MR. ROSKE:  It would --


QUESTION:  -- making this same argument? 


MR. ROSKE:  My argument would be less strong as


more time passed.  In this fair city, you're given 30


seconds to cross a major boulevard according to the -- the


flashing time, and Mr. Banks had less than 15 to respond


to his door.


QUESTION:  I thought it was 15 to 20, the point


Justice Breyer made.


MR. ROSKE:  Well --


QUESTION:  You keep saying 15, but I thought --


I thought we took the facts --


MR. ROSKE:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- as 15 to 20.  Do we not?


MR. ROSKE:  The officer --


QUESTION:  Is there something else?


MR. ROSKE:  The officer conducting the entry


testified that it was at least 15 seconds.  Now, the FBI


officer -- or agent in the back of the building thought it


was closer to 20.  I submit that the officer who --

 QUESTION:  And what did the court below treat it


as?


MR. ROSKE:  15 to 20 seconds.


QUESTION:  So don't we just take that as a given


in resolving it?  You don't want us to redetermine the


facts, do you? 


MR. ROSKE:  No, I do not wish the Court to -- to


redetermine the facts.  I just simply point out that of


the two time frames that were cited below in the record,


the officer at the door was in the better position, I


believe, to know how much time elapsed since he was


conducting the entry.


QUESTION:  But -- and he says it's a minimum --


a minimum of 15, and you used the word maximum a few


times.  There's no evidence of 15 maximum.


MR. ROSKE:  At least 15 seconds is the quote


that I have at -- at page 75 of the joint appendix of the


officer Wilson. 


And the refusal component of the -- of the knock


and announce statute is, of course -- it's not frozen in


time, I understand, but it was considered to be an


important element and component of the -- of the knock and


announce statute.  It wasn't some -- it had dignity.  It


had purpose, and its purpose is served, including the


protection of the officers, when they come to the door and

And they knock at a substantial number of


innocent citizens' residents, and their doors were 15


seconds to 20 seconds, absent any kind of exigent


circumstance at all, that they may just simply believe


that they're going to find drugs at the residence.  I


cited in --


QUESTION:  It's not that they believe.  They've


-- they've established probable cause before a magistrate,


probable cause to believe that there's contraband in the


apartment.


MR. ROSKE:  They did, Your Honor.  And -- but


what I want to point out is that they waited 7 days from


the time they got the warrant to execute it.  They


couldn't wait more -- a few more seconds at the time they 

were at the threshold.


QUESTION:  Well, I mean, you're not inclined to


flush it down the toilet when there's nobody knocking at


the door. 


MR. ROSKE:  Well --


QUESTION:  I mean, this is valuable stuff. 


You're going to get rid of it during those 7 days?  You're


going to get rid of it after you hear somebody saying,


police at the door.

effort and there was nothing in the record to suggest


there was any destruction of evidence by Mr. Banks in this


case.  And I think that it's an overbroad assumption that


every time the officers come on a search warrant for drugs


that the person that they're going to be searching is


going to go to the commode and chuck it.


QUESTION:  Well, he was taking a shower.  He


probably didn't even hear them at the door.


MR. ROSKE:  He did not --


QUESTION:  Had he not been taking a shower, he


might have been flushing the toilet.


MR. ROSKE:  Well, we -- we know -- all we know


is that he was in the shower and that he made no effort,


upon hearing the door crash in, to -- to take any step in


that direction.


QUESTION:  And given his condition when he did


come to the door, it's likely that 30 seconds wouldn't


have made any difference.  Isn't it so?


MR. ROSKE:  Well, the inevitable discovery


doctrine I know has been much raised here by the Solicitor


General's office in their brief, but it has no application


in a prophylactic rule that, of course, as the -- the


refusal component should be.  Obviously, it's not a


situation this Court was confronted with in Nix where


there was an independent investigation finding a -- a

young girl's body, that the investigation by the community


to find that was wholly independent of the law officers'


efforts there to a -- a confession.


So it just has -- if -- if you find that there


is a violation here that -- that the inevitable discovery


doctrine simply would have no -- no purpose or effect in


-- in your determination, because if you do decide that,


as the Seventh Circuit has, that inevitable discovery


doctrine applies to all knock and announce issues, you'll


essentially have no judicial review.  You have the title,


I suppose, 1983 actions that might be brought occasionally


but those are of no real deterrent to law enforcement. 


They --


QUESTION:  Going back to -- to not getting into


the inevitable discovery rule, but you have said that the 

judgment of the Ninth Circuit was right although not its


opinion.  So if you were to explain why that judgment is


right, what would you say?  What would you say about


destroying the -- the door?  What would you say about the


15 to 20 seconds?  What would be the opinion that you


would write to justify this judgment? 


MR. ROSKE:  I would -- I would focus on the fact


that we're dealing with a dwelling and not an office, that


we're dealing with a habitation where private activities


occur and routinely, and that in this case there was

any additional reason or justification for acting wtih


haste.  I would say that the court --


QUESTION:  What about the -- the drugs, the --


the fact that it was a drug charge and that drugs were


thought to be on the premises?  Do you not think that


gives then officers at least a factor other than the


simply bare bones thing?


MR. ROSKE:  Well, yes, I -- I would agree that,


you know, obviously if it were televisions or if it were


grand pianos, the idea that somebody is going to chop them


into splinters or into fragments and the -- thwart the


officer's whole purpose would entirely evaporate.  It was


argued by the Solicitor General that in fact they thought


that maybe the place wasn't even occupied and therefore 

they were doing an -- a senseless or a needless act by --


by delaying and knocking and announcing repetitively.  In


any event, I think that this case is -- is one where if


they truly believed it was unoccupied, that there would be


no harm and foul on the officer erring on the side of


caution and waiting.


QUESTION:  Mr. Roske, going back to your


inevitable discovery point, was that raised by the


Government in the district court?

the Ninth Circuit. 


QUESTION:  May I ask another question?  We


talked about the case as though it involves just searches


for drugs.  But isn't it true that in this case and in


fact in many cases, the officers will also pick up


substantial amounts of cash and weapons, which are not apt


to be -- neither of which is apt to be flushed down the


toilet, I wouldn't think.


MR. ROSKE:  In -- in fact, in this case there


were three firearms recovered from Mr. Banks' apartment. 


One of them was out on the couch in the front room.  Two


weapons were back in the south -- I believe -- east bed --


west bedroom, excuse me.  Southwest bedroom.  And yes, and


there was about $6,000 of currency located throughout the


apartment.


The dimensions of the apartment were not


developed below, but basically the place is about 20 by


33.


The -- the layout of the residence is put in a


diagram that's part of the appendix. 


And I just want to point out that in -- in King


Edward I's reign, this is where we get the knock and


announce statute.  He lived in unsettled times, and he was


actually out of his kingdom when the word that his father


had died came to him.  He was on a trip from the Holy

Land, and he was in Genoa.  And he had to rush back to his


kingdom to find it in disarray.  His men were running


amuck.  And the knock and announce statute, which hails


from the -- this ancient time, was passed, just to prevent


the kinds of abuses that we can see happening today. 


There was a reverend in Boston that that lost


his life as a result of the law enforcement erroneously


searching a residence.  Had he been given the knock and


announce and been able to respond to the door, maybe he


would he wouldn't be dead. 


There's another instance I cited in my brief


about a Fortune 500 executive who had -- in the middle of


the night, had is home searched erroneously for drugs, and


he was shot several times defending his habitation.


These are important considerations that it's not 

just the guilty that are protected by the knock and


announce rule.  It is -- it is everyone that -- that


benefits, the innocent and the guilty. 


QUESTION:  Well, the guilty perhaps benefit more


than the innocent. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. ROSKE:  True enough, but that -- but -- but


when -- when we have a suppression, when we have a case


where the court acts as it has in the Banks case, that


provides a lesson for law enforcement that they do heed,

and it has a deterrent effect.  Your opinions do matter


greatly.


And I just think that the wise decision here


wouldn't be to create a bright line rule, to set in stone


any kind of time limit, that the totality of the


circumstances test decided by the Ninth Circuit is the one


that needs to be used.  And I know that the Ninth Circuit


struggled with the fact that the common law knock and


announce provision, you know, dealt with concerns of


destruction of the door and destruction of the habitation


and concerns of privacy, a man's home being his castle. 


And we do that no honor when in 15 seconds to 20 seconds


that door goes down. 


And there was no refusal in this case, and the


record is entirely barren of that. 


And that component was 

required at common law.  And I understand at -- the


Constitution was not frozen, you know, at the time of the


enactment of the Bill of Rights.  It has developed and


evolved, but all of the -- all of the exceptions that --


that have been applied by the lower courts in this area


are distinguishable from Banks.


And I thank the Court if the Court has no


further questions of me. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Roske.


Mr. Salmons, you have 2 minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. SALMONS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 


Unless the Court has any further questions, the Government


submits that the judgment below should be reversed.


QUESTION:  I have a question just with regard to


your opposing counsel's last assertion.  Do -- do you know


whether the rule you're arguing for would have been


applied in 1791?


MR. SALMONS:  Well, Your Honor, what I do know


is that as this Court indicated in its decision in Wilson


where it incorporated the common law tradition into the


Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness, that the


standard at common law was a flexible one.  It didn't


require knock and announce in all cases, and it took into 

account a variety of law enforcement concerns and, we


would submit, including the risk that there might be


dangers to the officer's safety or that evidence might be


disposed of.  So we think that our rule is perfectly


consistent both with the common law tradition and with


this Court's decision in Wilson that incorporated it.


QUESTION:  But you don't disagree with the fact


that the -- or the -- the claim that the statute does


apply?  There was a duty to knock and announce.


MR. SALMONS:  That's correct, Your Honor.  We're

announce rule.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Salmons.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 10:59 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
