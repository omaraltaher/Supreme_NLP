CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 01-1435, Clackamas Gastroenterology


Association versus Deborah Wells.


Mr. Seymour.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN W. SEYMOUR


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. SEYMOUR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The four doctors who are shareholder-directors


of the petitioner are not employees under the ADA, the


Americans With Disabilities Act, because, like partners,


they own and manage their own clinic.


QUESTION:  What -- what is the common law rule


on respondeat superior for an ordinary corporation vis a


vis a director?  Is a director of an ordinary corporation


an employee of the corporation?


MR. SEYMOUR:  In an ordinary corporation, the


common law rule is that the employee is like a servant. 


QUESTION:  Well, if -- if that's so --


QUESTION:  Well, what is your answer?


QUESTION:  I didn't hear you.


QUESTION:  I couldn't hear the response.


MR. SEYMOUR:  I'm sorry.

 QUESTION:  Your answer was yes, was -- he is an


employee?


MR. SEYMOUR:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Okay.  Well, then Darden says common


law, common law says directors are employees, and these


are directors, end of case.  Why not?


MR. SEYMOUR:  Because Darden doesn't apply here. 


Darden was --


QUESTION:  Well, you didn't even cite Darden, I


don't think.


MR. SEYMOUR:  I believe I did.


QUESTION:  Did you?


MR. SEYMOUR:  Yes.


QUESTION:  I would think Darden would be the


first place we'd look.


MR. SEYMOUR:  Well, the difference between this


case and Darden is significant.  Darden was a case in


which the Court was required to determine whether an


individual was an independent contractor --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. SEYMOUR:  -- or an employee.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. SEYMOUR:  That's not a choice here.


QUESTION:  No, but the decision has to be made


on whether these people are employees.

 MR. SEYMOUR:  That's right.


QUESTION:  And Darden says, well, we're going to


look to the common law, so what makes you think we'd do


something else in this situation?


MR. SEYMOUR:  Because there are frankly not much


common law that gives us guidance on how to decide whether


a director-shareholder in a professional corporation is an


employee or not.


The -- in Darden, it cited factors that are


really quite good at determining whether an individual is


an independent contractor or an employee.  Those factors


don't work very well here, because they're not designed to


address the issues that we're looking at.


That is, for example, one of the factors that


the common law looks to to determine whether a -- an


individual is an independent contractor is whether the


individual provides their own tools of the trade.  Well,


that's not the kind of factor that's going to work very


well in this kind of case.  Therefore, we're suggesting


that a Darden-like analysis is very appropriate, but we


think that it's better to use factors such as suggested by


the Government in their brief, that is, the EEOC guidance,


because those kinds of factors suggested in the EEOC


guidance go the heart of the difference between


shareholder-directors and employees.

 The factors in Darden do not, so therefore the


Darden factors are like trying to pound a round peg into a


square hole.  We shouldn't do that, because it becomes


clumsy.


QUESTION:  It may be clumsy --


QUESTION:  But this was a case where it was very


important to the shareholders in this corporation that


they be labeled employees for ERISA purposes.  It had to


be -- if they weren't employees, they weren't going to be


able to get themselves covered under the retirement plan


as the law then was, so in -- in the ERISA context you


would be saying, of course they're employees.  That's how


they qualified under ERISA.  We set this thing up solely


for that reason.


MR. SEYMOUR:  Yes, Your Honor, except that I


think that the -- the tax purposes were more under the


general tax laws, not under ERISA, because they could


establish an ERISA plan and deduct the expenses.


QUESTION:  But didn't they -- in order to be


covered, didn't they have to be employees?


MR. SEYMOUR:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. SEYMOUR:  And -- and just --


QUESTION:  And they wouldn't -- on your theory,


they're not -- so they are employees for that purpose?

 MR. SEYMOUR:  Well, they're treated as employees


for that purpose, but they should not be treated as


employees for purposes of the ADA.


For example, if we turn the coin over and look


at the other side, and the Court is required to examine


whether someone who is labeled a partner is, in reality,


a -- an employee.  If the Court finds that, looking at the


economic realities of that situation, that the partner is


really an employee, that doesn't mean that the


now-employer should issue W-2's, or that they should have


been withholding.  Those are tax issues, and they don't


have the same purposes as the ADA.


QUESTION:  But the -- am I wrong in thinking


that the -- the whole thing was set up the way it was,


instead of as a partnership, for the reason that these


people needed to be characterized as employees for


retirement plan purposes?


MR. SEYMOUR:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And are they not also employees for


Worker's Compensation purposes?


MR. SEYMOUR:  Under Oregon law, they can opt out


of Worker's Compensation.


QUESTION:  But they'd have to opt out.  They


start out by being in.


MR. SEYMOUR:  Yes.

 QUESTION:  They start out as being -- do they


get salaries?


MR. SEYMOUR:  They get salaries plus a bonus,


which is the division of their profits.


QUESTION:  But they get salaries.  There's


nothing inconsistent with being, say, the president of the


company and principal shareholder and being both an owner


and an employee.


MR. SEYMOUR:  That's true.  There's nothing


inconsistent about that, and our concern with this case


is, the court didn't go past the fact that the clinic was


organized as a professional corporation, and when the --


QUESTION:  Why should it, because I'm still


stuck with the language of Darden, which reads as a


general rule, when Congress has used the term, employee,


without defining it, we have concluded that Congress


intended to describe the conventional master-servant


relationship as understood by common law agency doctrine,


and it says, that rule stood as an independent authority


for the copyright decision.  So, too, should it stand


here.


Now, is your view, it should not stand here in


this case --


MR. SEYMOUR:  That's our view.


QUESTION:  -- as sufficient?

QUESTION:  All right, so you're asking us to


depart from Darden and to make an exception from the


Darden rule for the -- this particular act.


MR. SEYMOUR:  For this --


QUESTION:  Is that right?


MR. SEYMOUR:  For this particular circumstance,


that's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Well, when you say circumstance,


there's a word in an act, so you're saying that the word,


employee, in this title of the ADA does not bear the


common law definition?


MR. SEYMOUR:  Well, I think the common law


definition is one thing to look at.  That is the --


QUESTION:  No, no, I'm asking -- they said in


Darden that's the end of it, and you say -- I want to be


just clear about it.  You say, it is not the end of it. 


Common law is not the end of it.


MR. SEYMOUR:  Yes, that's what we're saying.


QUESTION:  All right, and so --


MR. SEYMOUR:  Common law is not the end of it.


QUESTION:  Okay.  Now I understand.


QUESTION:  Would -- would you say that the EEOC


guidelines and writings and treatises on the differences


between professional corporations and other corporations

might themselves be part of what we call the common law?


I -- I take it part of your position is based on


the proposition that the common law, I suppose of agency,


up through the 1950s just didn't have much on this subject


at all, when we're talking about the difference between


partners and professional and -- and employees of a


professional corporation.  There just wasn't a corpus of


writing on that subject.


MR. SEYMOUR:  No, there isn't much in the common


law, because a professional corporation is not a product


of the common law, nor is a limited liability partnership,


nor a limited liability company, and all three of those


organizations are virtually functionally identical once


they're up and running.  They have the same --


QUESTION:  Well, and as -- as courts begin to


write about these things in the area of subchapter S


status, tax status and so forth, there is an emerging


decisional law, at least, that's -- that's evolving, I


take it, and you might say that has some common law


attributes.  It might not be common law as we -- as we


usually define it.


MR. SEYMOUR:  Attributes, yes, but not that


focus on this particular question, and that is whether a


shareholder-director in a professional corporation should


be considered an employee for purposes of defining who --

 QUESTION:  Who -- Darden also says, a couple of


pages after the quote that Justice Breyer -- since the


common law test contains no shorthand formula or magic


phrase that can be applied to find the answer, all of the


incidents of the relationship must be assessed and weighed


with no one factor being decisive, which suggests a more


fluid test, certainly, than the other language.


MR. SEYMOUR:  And a more fluid test would be


certainly more flexible, because --


QUESTION:  But that's exactly my point.  That's


why I started out asking you whether you concede that a


director of a corporation is an employee under the common


law, because if you concede that, you're saying that the


common law fluid test ends up with the director being an


employee, and I take it that it's well-established a


director is an employee.


MR. SEYMOUR:  Well, that's -- I -- I understood


your question to be --


QUESTION:  No, my question was to try to get the


framework.  Either you're saying the common law, you win,


or you're saying, common law, I lose, but I win anyway


because it's not the common law, so if you want to take


the tack, common law test, I still win, explain it to me. 


How is a director ordinarily an employee, but this one


isn't?

 MR. SEYMOUR:  Well, under an ordinary


corporation, I think your -- your question would be yes,


but under a professional corporation, it's different.


It's much more like a partnership, because if we


look at the emergence of these new entities like limited


liability partnerships, limited liability corporations,


and professional corporations, they're all emerging for


professional businesses like this clinic from sole


proprietorships or general partnerships, and the only --


there's really no difference, functionally, when we look


at those different entities.


QUESTION:  Oh, but isn't there a huge


difference, that they've got limited liability?


If you have -- the corporation is liable if you


have, you're incorporated?  Isn't that the true with your


case, too?


MR. SEYMOUR:  No, the --


QUESTION:  Whereas in partnership, the


individuals are liable?


MR. SEYMOUR:  In the partnership, individuals


are liable, but in a professional corporation, in a


limited liability partnership, in a limited liability


company, the -- for professionals, those limited


liabilities are all the same, and they're not as good as a


general corporation, or an ordinary corporation.

 In other words, the doctors in this clinic, in a


PC, have liability for their own acts, and limited


vicarious liability for the acts of the other doctors. 


That's not true inside an ordinary corporation.  It is


true inside a limited liability partnership and a limited


liability company.


QUESTION:  Am I wrong in thinking that the --


that the individual liability is not across the board, but


it's only for malpractice-type claims?


MR. SEYMOUR:  That's right, it's for


malpractice-type claims, and I think --


QUESTION:  So --


MR. SEYMOUR:  -- that's pretty much true not


just in --


QUESTION:  But other claims against the clinic,


it -- they -- they would have limited liability?


MR. SEYMOUR:  Yes, they do, and that's true for


all three of those emerging types of entities,


professional corporations, limited liability partnerships,


and limited liability companies.


QUESTION:  Well, maybe there isn't -- there


isn't any settled law, is there, that a limited liability


partnership would not be treated the same way that this


entity is -- is treated?


MR. SEYMOUR:  Well, for example, as a partner in

a partnership, limited liability partnership, I have


exactly the same limits on my liability as the doctors in


this clinic, and I am not an employee, I'm a partner, and


the only difference between my status and the status of


these doctors is the form of the business, and that's


really just a label.


QUESTION:  Well, you say you're not an employee,


but isn't that the question we have to decide?


MR. SEYMOUR:  Well, every court that's addressed


the issue of whether partners are employees, including


this Court --


QUESTION:  Well, you wouldn't suggest that every


partner -- no partner is ever an employee.  You're not


suggesting that, are you?  Say you've got a law firm


that's got 250 partners, you're going to say none of them


are -- are employees?


MR. SEYMOUR:  I'm sure there are some who would


say that, but I think that what the courts need to do is


look at the individual, not just at a label, and look


beyond the label to find out, as the EEOC standards --


QUESTION:  Well, we don't have a partnership


here.  We have a professional corporation --


MR. SEYMOUR:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- do we not?


MR. SEYMOUR:  That's correct.

 QUESTION:  That's what we're talking about. 


We're not talking about partnership.


MR. SEYMOUR:  But I'm saying that a -- a limited


liability partnership and a professional corporation


should be treated alike for purposes of the EEOC.  Excuse


me, for purposes of --


QUESTION:  But then we're away from --


MR. SEYMOUR:  Pardon me?


QUESTION:  I thought you had a very good case in


your brief, and then I read Darden, and I realized the


reason I was thinking it, I was out of date and thinking


that Hearst was still good law.  That's Frankfurter's


opinion on employee.  I thought it was a great opinion,


all right, but I can't square that with what the Court


said.  That was my initial question, and I'm still there,


because I haven't really heard you explain why it is that


the common law test won't pick up your clients.


MR. SEYMOUR:  And I'm -- if I may, the -- the


problem with Darden is, it's examining a different


relationship than we have in this case.


In the Darden case, the issue was whether an


individual was an independent contractor, and we deal with


those issues all the time.  Our clients come and say, I


want to be an independent contractor, or make my employees


independent contractors, and we have to go through the

books and say, no, we can't let you do that because of


Darden, or whatever.


We don't see those kinds of circumstances in the


law.  There's no common law --


QUESTION:  Well, maybe the price that has to be


paid for professionals to set up a professional


corporation is to be subject to the ADA, and the anti-


discrimination law of title VII, and so forth, because


these people are going to be counted.  In this case, it


makes a difference.


MR. SEYMOUR:  Well --


QUESTION:  Is that all bad, that they have to be


subject to these provisions?


MR. SEYMOUR:  The reason that it's bad -- yes,


it is all bad.


QUESTION:  Why?


MR. SEYMOUR:  And the reason is that we should


treat similarly situated businesses the same, and there


are a -- a class of partner-like or proprietor-like


individuals, and there is a class of employee-like


individuals, and just because -- let's say it starts out


as a general partnership.  Just because they shift into a


limited liability partnership, or a professional


corporation, or a limited liability company, that


shouldn't change who belongs in which class, and if we

QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Seymour.


Mr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN


FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it --


may it please the Court:


Under the EEOC's guidance, the question whether


shareholder-directors are employees depends on whether


they operate independently and manage the business or,


instead, are subject to the organization's control.  That


standard aligns the test for determining the employment


status of shareholder-directors with the test that courts


have long used in deciding whether partners are employees.


QUESTION:  Well, do you say that the EEOC has


adopted standards that differ from the common law, and has


by regulation or otherwise determined that we should apply


its test to this question?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  I guess largely, yes.  The EEOC


started with the common, common law right to control test

that is used to distinguish between independent


contractors and employees and adapted it to make a


distinction between those who were the proprietors of the


business and that business' employees, and it did so in a


way to align its standards for looking at the question of


shareholder-director with the same standards that have


been used by all the courts in deciding whether partners


or -- are employees


QUESTION:  And do you agree with the


petitioner's attorney that if you look to the common law


test, these people would be employees?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  If you look to the Restatement


as the measure of the common law --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  -- then generally speaking, a --


a director who didn't employ service -- perform services


would not have been an employee, but a director who


performed services would be.


Now, the only hesitation I would have is to say


that the -- that at the time of the Restatement there


wasn't -- there weren't professional corporations that


mixed and matched features of partnership and


corporations, so there's not as clear an answer on that.


QUESTION:  Do we owe deference to the EEOC


standard?

 MR. GORNSTEIN:  The -- the Court should give


weight to the -- the EEOC's test because it reflects its


accumulated and longstanding experience in administering


the act, but we're not asking for Chevron deference here.


QUESTION:  Didn't the Court say the EEOC doesn't


get such deference?  I mean, didn't -- wasn't that way


back in the Gilbert case?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  It -- it did say that, that


it -- it doesn't get Chevron deference.  Now, there is an


exception now.  Under the ADA, the EEOC can issue


regulations, and this Court has held that those


regulations are entitled to Chevron deference, but this is


guidance that applies across the board to all the


nondiscrimination laws, and what the Court has said in


that context is that the EEOC's analysis gets weight, in


light of the fact that it has accumulated experience under


the law.


deference.


QUESTION:  But it would be kind of a Skidmore


MR. GORNSTEIN:  It would be a Skidmore


deference, that's correct.  Now, what --


QUESTION:  I hate to be a bore on this, but will


you please write the two sentences for me where I have to


say either that, we apply the common law test, and in this


instance, the common law test comes out in your favor, or

we have to say, we don't apply the common law test because


the EE -- this statute is different.  Which of those two


paths, both of which could lead to your victory or your


defeat, do you think we should take?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Neither of those two, Justice


Breyer.


QUESTION:  Neither, all right.  Then write that


section of the opinion.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  I -- let me get to Darden,


because I think that's the focus of your questions.


As we read Darden, there is language that is


certainly broad enough in it to say that any time you use


the word, employee, you mean common law employee, but I


think that those, what -- you have to understand Darden in


the context of the -- the issue it was resolving in that


case, and there it was trying to draw a distinction,


whether the term employee embraces independent


contractors, and in that setting, Congress had twice


amended statutes to make clear that the term, employee,


did not mean independent contractor after this Court has


said that it could, and in that context, it makes perfect


sense to start out with a very strong presumption that


when Congress uses the term, employee, it does not mean


independent contractor.


But that's not the situation we have here, and

in other cases where the Court has looked at statutes that


use common law terms, like Title VII does with respect to


the term, agent, it has felt a lot more freedom to adjust


that common law term to the purposes of the statute, and I


would point you to the Faragher case and the Kolstadt case


as two examples of that, and that's what the EEOC has done


here.


It has adapted that common law principle in


light of the fact that we have an established tradition in


the courts, well-established, of looking at the question


of partnership in a functional way, does this person


actually operate as a proprietor of the business, or is


this a partner in name only, and it makes perfect sense


for the EEOC to apply that same kind of functional


analysis in deciding whether shareholder-directors are


employees, because for purposes of deciding who should get


the protection of the act, and that's what we're talking


about primarily here, there is no practical difference


between shareholder-directors who run a business and


partners who run a business, and so it makes sense to --


to use the same test.


Applying the same test also makes sense in light


of the purposes of the small business exemption, because


the purpose of that exemption is to spare small businesses


the very substantial burdens of complying with the

nondiscrimination laws, and those burdens are experienced


in exactly the same way regardless of whether those who


choose to organize a small business do so through a


partnership form or a corporate form, and the -- the


analysis that the tests should be the same across the


board also makes --


QUESTION:  May I ask you a question about the


application of your test?  You -- you urge us to remand


the case, as I understand it --


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Yes, we do.


QUESTION:  -- to answer the question whether


these individuals operate independently and manage and


control the business on the one hand, or are subject to


the organization's control on the other, and I ask you, is


it not possible that the same individual could meet both


halves of that test?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  No.


QUESTION:  Some of his duties, he'd be manager,


and some others he'd have to respond to what the group


told him to do?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well, it -- it's possible that's


true, but what the EEOC's guidance --

case?

 QUESTION:  With respect to surgery, he takes


orders from the directors.  With respect to advising


patients, he's on -- on his own.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  What -- what we have here under


the EEOC's guidance is, ultimately you make an overall


judgment that's either-or, based on all the considerations


in the guidance, and they are at page 9 of our brief, so


that, just as in the partnership context, you look at all


of these factors, and just as you would in an independent


contractor status kind of situation, you look at all the


relevant factors, and then you make an overall judgment


about, essentially does this person function as a


proprietor of the business, or is he functioning as an


employee of the business overall.


QUESTION:  Why isn't it simpler just to say,


well, they picked a corporate form with their eyes open


because it was important for them to be labeled employees,


at least for retirement purposes, so they have to take the


bitter with the sweet.  They got that qualification so


they could have their retirement plans, and then it's just


much simpler to say, that's the form that they chose, and


the law for many -- in many contexts does follow what --


the form parties choose for their arrangement.  Why


shouldn't that be the answer?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  The -- the approach that the

EEOC has taken is to -- is a functional approach that


tries to treat all people alike, and to look to the real


functional relationship between the individual and the


employee, and the fact that somebody may have chosen to do


something for tax consequences, or chose to do something


for purposes of limiting individual liability, really


doesn't have anything to do with whether he is the sort of


person who should receive protection under the


nondiscrimination laws, and this is ultimately what we are


determining here, are these shareholder-directors people


who are employees and therefore receive protection under


the nondiscrimination laws, because it's only those people


who are the --

see if some other, lower employee was covered, not these


directors, and that turns on whether you count them as


employees --

MR. GORNSTEIN:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  We're not looking to see if they


themselves are covered under the ADA in this case.

question you have in front of you, which is, is this a


small business and does this employee get protection, you

first have to answer the question of, are these


shareholder-directors employees who get protection under


the law, so that is the inevitable product of having to


decide the small business exemption, is that you have to


decide, these are people who get protection under the


laws, and it -- it's just not the case that the policies


that underlie decisions about incorporation having to do


with tax consequences and individual liability have


anything to do with whether these are the kind of people


who should receive protection under the nondiscrimination


laws.


QUESTION:  Well, I just thought Congress was


more concerned with not making really small businesses


covered by these acts, that we weren't focused on whether


these professional shareholders should be covered, but


whether this was the kind of small business that shouldn't


be covered at all.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well -- I'm sorry, Justice


O'Connor.


QUESTION:  Is that right?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  I -- what Congress did in the


small business exemption is to link the exemption to the


number of people who receive protection under the laws,


and that makes sense, because it means that at most, when


the small business exemption applies, at most, 14

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.


Mr. Crispin, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG A. CRISPIN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. CRISPIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The position of the clinic and the Government in


this case essentially is to look to ignore the form and


structure of the corporate business, yet just 2 years ago,


in Cedric Kushner versus King, this Court held that a sole


shareholder was separate and distinct from the corporate


structure itself, and that's the -- the essence of the


question.


QUESTION:  What kind of a legal issue was it


there, Mr. Crispin?  What act were we construing?


MR. CRISPIN:  That was a RICO question, and the


question was whether or not the two parts of the -- the


RICO enterprise on the one hand and the -- the other


aspect of the RICO question existed with both the


individual sole shareholder and director of the


corporation as being separate and distinct from the


corporation itself, and in that case the Court said, you


cannot collapse the two.

 The defense position was, they are, in fact, the


same identity, and this Court said no, that's not true. 


What -- the corporate structure is something separate and


distinct, which is recognized by this Court, has been


recognized for years and years and years, and that that is


something that cannot and should not be ignored.


QUESTION:  Well, the -- the reason we said it


was that we couldn't find any basis in the statutory


history or the text that -- that gave us a clue that


Congress, in effect, wanted to ignore something which is


such hornbook law.


The argument on the other side, I think, is that


there is a reason to think Congress would want to look


at -- at nontraditional concepts here.  The argument is


that the common law definition of employee does not


axiomatically apply because it's not addressing the issue


that Congress was addressing in that -- in this statute. 


The issue that Congress was addressing in this statute, as


I understand the argument, in fact taking the -- the very


words that Mr. Gornstein used a moment ago, was the issue


of protecting people who can be hurt by discrimination. 


It was a protection issue.


So that I think what he's saying, and -- and


what the petitioner's counsel are saying is, the one thing


that we do know about employees is that they were people

who were intended to be protected by this statute.  If


that is true, it is not probable that they were trying to


include as employees, the protected category, people who


don't need protection because they are in ultimate control


of the business, the ones who, if there's going to be


discrimination, are going to be doing the discriminating,


so it's probable that the people who have that ultimate


control would intend it to be within the employee


category.  That's an issue that the common law didn't


address.


How do you respond to that argument?


MR. CRISPIN:  Justice Souter, the individuals


that are subject to discrimination in this particular case


are not only the lower-level employees as this case


presents.  We have four shareholder-directors, and any one


of those could come down with a disability and have the


remaining three shareholders refuse to accommodate or


otherwise violate the ADA with respect to that one


individual, so the -- the individual --


QUESTION:  So you're saying, even on the premise


of their argument, it does not exclude any one of the


four.


MR. CRISPIN:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  I suppose if one of the four had a


51 percent, a truly indefeasibly controlling interest,

you'd concede that, but short of that, which apparently is


not the case here, you say, even if I take their premises,


they lose.


MR. CRISPIN:  That's right, Your Honor, I --


although I -- let me comment that I'm not sure I would


concede the 51 percent, all -- I would concede it for your


hypothetical.


QUESTION:  Yes, right.


MR. CRISPIN:  But our position is that the


employing enterprise is the determining factor.


QUESTION:  How -- how does the EEOC treat an


ordinary corporation that, let's say, has 12 regular


employees and then three directors, the cousin, the


father, the son, or whatever, of the owner, so there -- so


it's as -- if you count the three -- and it's a perfectly


ordinary corporation.  There's nothing special about it. 


Do they count those three directors, or not, as employees?


MR. CRISPIN:  As I read their position, I -- I


believe that they, under the new guidance, would count


those directors under their balancing test.  They would


apply the -- this multiple-factor balancing test, look at


the degree of control, and decide on a case-by-case basis.


QUESTION:  So remember, these three are just


cousins.  They're not -- I mean, they only show up once a


year, and they vote, and -- and that's it.  That's their

connection.

MR. CRISPIN:  In that case, Your Honor, they


would not be counted.


QUESTION:  They don't count?


MR. CRISPIN:  They don't count, because they're


not performing services --


QUESTION:  All right.  Then -- and those are


people who the common law really would consider to be


employees, at least while they're there for that hour a


year, is that right?

be.  We know that -- that employee is considered a person


who performs services for the corporation --

QUESTION:  Right.


MR. CRISPIN:  Now, of course, under the ADA


we're looking at numbers of employees over 20 weeks within


a calendar year.


QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.


MR. CRISPIN:  But again, the idea, as this Court


recognized in Walters versus Metro Educational, was that


the determinations under the employment discrimination


statutes should be subject to ready and easy


determination.  Complex and expensive factual inquiries


should be avoided, but yet the Government's test and the


clinic's test, which has adopted the Government's test,


would have this Court look at the facts in each individual


case every time --


QUESTION:  Well, don't we have to give some


weight to the EEOC view?  Do you just want to ignore it


completely?


MR. CRISPIN:  No, Your Honor.  The Skidmore


deference is appropriate, Justice O'Connor.


QUESTION:  Why?  Why, because I would think then


you lose.  I mean, here -- if I'm very frank about it,


there are two competing things here, and the one thing,


give weight to the agency, let them define these terms,


particularly at the margin, but that's Hearst, and -- and

the other is, no, no, it doesn't matter what they say, pay


no attention whatsoever to what they say.  What they have


to do is follow the common law definition.  That's Darden.


So if Darden applies, I take it you win, but if


Darden doesn't apply, it seems to be much harder for you


to win, because then the agency should get deference under


Skidmore, at least, in applying the term, and the agency


here has a different definition than the one that helps


you.


about it.


So that's where I am, and I'm quite uncertain


MR. CRISPIN:  Your Honor, two -- two responses


to your question.  Under Darden, it -- it does -- the


Court has decided that the common law applies, and we


would say that's appropriate.  The precise test under


Darden dealt with the independent contractor versus


employee test.  That is not absolutely translatable here,


but the key concept is that the common law applies is


appropriate.


The second aspect of your question, Your Honor,


was on the deference entitled to the EEOC opinion, and as


I understand Skidmore deference, it's only that deference


which is appropriate under the circumstances of their


test.  In this case, the EEOC's test is not workable.  It


leads to inconsistent results, and it fails to further

the -- the interests that are looked at under the statute,


and I can turn to those points.


QUESTION:  Doesn't it, perhaps better than the,


just straight common law, of course, deal with the coming


of -- of age, so to speak, of the professional


corporation, which really didn't -- didn't amount to much,


if -- if it even existed 20 or 25 years ago?


MR. CRISPIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, it may address


it, but it need not.  It need not treat a corporation,


whether it's a professional corporation or a general


corporation, differently --


QUESTION:  No, it need not, but it has chosen to


do so, and the -- the question, I guess, before us is,


under Skidmore deference, is that a reasonable decision?


MR. CRISPIN:  It's not a reasonable decision in


looking at the professional corporation as the EEOC's test


would apply to it, and -- and the reasons are that, as --


as the EEOC and the clinic has suggested, an important


issue is one of consistency, yet applying their test does


not lead to consistent results.


One can imagine the -- the circumstance of a


professional corporation with one shareholder-director and


14 employees. Under their test, that individual


corporation would not be covered.  It has fewer than 15.


Take the situation, though, where there are 14,

15 director-shareholders of the professional corporation


and 14 employees, a business nearly twice the size of the


first one, and yet that one would be covered because of


the 15 employees.


QUESTION:  Are you -- are you basing your


estimate of what the EEOC would cover on the materials set


forth in the Government's brief at page 9?


MR. CRISPIN:  Well, as I -- as I read the test,


what the EEOC would do in that circumstance would look at


the number of employees, and the 15 employees, whether


there was 1 or 14 shareholders would make no difference,


and -- and yet with 15 or 14, or 15 or 25 shareholders,


whether or not they were considered employees or not, the


15 individual employees would be enough to provide


coverage, yet take the same circumstance and back off the


one with the number of employees, and under the EEOC's


test, it would be a factual shareholder-by-shareholder


determination which would be required to determine whether


this company -- corporation is, in fact, covered or not.


And so we have the situations where many more


entities, enterprises with a lot of people working for


them, which may not be covered on the one hand, and down


the street a very similar corporation --


QUESTION:  But if they have many people working


for them, they won't be subject to the small business

exception.


MR. CRISPIN:  That -- that's right, unless they


have less than 15 employees, but yet in a professional


corporation as we have here, the individual shareholders


are performing services for the corporation.  In fact,


that's the business of the corporation, is to provide the


medical services that these four shareholders were


performing.  They created revenue which came into the


corporation, they got the benefits of the corporate


structure for tax benefits and for ERISA purposes, and yet


they -- and yet the EEOC would -- would put a factual


determination on whether or not one or more of the


individuals were, in fact, employees.


The interest of predictability would be lost in


such a situation.  Predictability is important for both


the enterprise itself to know whether it's covered, and


also for the individual employee, the secretary or the


nurse down the hall.  In a -- a test that says, we adopt


the corporate structure as the appropriate test, those


individuals, the enterprise, the nurse, the secretary, all


they have to do is look at their paycheck to see if it's a


corporation, and count up the number of people working for


that corporation, performing services --


QUESTION:  Well, what -- why would they be doing


this?  I mean, are you suggesting that the secretaries

won't work for the corporation unless they know it's


covered under this statute?


MR. CRISPIN:  I -- I think that's a possibility,


yes.


QUESTION:  No, I mean, is it a realistic


possibility?  I mean, are people making employment


decisions depending on whether they -- they're going to be


able to sue if there is discrimination likely?


MR. CRISPIN:  In -- in my practice, which is


exclusively dealing with employment matters, yes, we see


that, individuals who are quite concerned.  Also, I am


aware of, although I cannot cite you to studies which


indicate that fear of retaliation for bringing a claim is


a real factor on individuals.  If they know they're not


protected, they don't bring the claim.  Now, that's --


QUESTION:  But if there are no -- if they're not


protected, they have no claim to make.


MR. CRISPIN:  That's true.  If they -- if they


know they're not protected, then they -- they don't risk


the kind of retaliation for raising the claim, and they go


on and just do their jobs.


QUESTION:  So I'm quite -- still -- I hate to go 


back to this, but it seems to me there might be millions


of small businesses in the country that have about 10 or


12 employees where if you count their directors, they are

going to be covered, and if you don't count them, they


won't be, and I'm curious about the practical effect of


that.  Of course, if the EEOC counts them now, there's no


problem.  If it doesn't count them now, this decision


would -- would affect that.  Do you have any sense of what


the facts are?


MR. CRISPIN:  I think the numbers are


significant, that there are quite a number of -- of small


businesses in that category, professional corporations,


but whether that's a factor that should enter into the


Court is, of course, your decision, not mine, but if


Congress -- but the -- the touchstone of that question,


then, would be, though, the intent of -- of Congress,


whether Congress intended the term, employee, to have a


common law application and, if that's the case, then they


should be, in fact, covered.  That's what Congress wanted


to do.


QUESTION:  How do you respond to the famous two


clinic examples, one is set up as a partnership and one is


a professional corporation?


MR. CRISPIN:  Well, Your Honor, Number -- I've


got two responses to that.  Number 1, it -- it's one


example of a way that it would provide inconsistent


results, but I just talked about a different one which is


very different, which provides inconsistent results by

their test.


Second, this Court has never held that a


partnership is not subject to Title VII or ADA because


it's a partnership.  Some of the lower courts have done


that, and Justice Powell in his concurring opinion in the


Hishon case did, in fact, address that, but this Court has


never so held.  That's not a question that this Court need


address in this opinion, but it is something that the


Court may want to look at in terms of, under the -- for


example, under the Restatement Second of Agency in 1958,


the partnership was recognized as being able to have


employees as members of its partners who were performing


services for that partnership, so --


QUESTION:  Are you making a distinction between


owner-directors who are also working every day providing


the services of the entity, and owner-directors who are


not involved in the day-to-day service delivery function


of the enterprise?


MR. CRISPIN:  Justice Ginsburg, I -- I


believe -- I believe your question addresses whether those


directors who are not involved day-to-day --


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. CRISPIN:  -- would be covered as employees,


but the common law test, as I understand it, is that


there's a question of compensation.  If the services are

being provided, and there's compensation for those


services, then the individual would be counted as an


employee and, as we indicated earlier, the question under


the ADA deals with five work days in 20 different weeks,


so the -- the director who comes in just on occasional


basis, even if compensated, would not be enough to -- to,


typically to add another employee.


QUESTION:  Well, if you say the director gets a


fee, and the meetings are not frequent but the director is


expected to remain au courant with what's going on in the


business, so how do we judge that?  We can't say, only


the -- for the hour of the meeting that director counts.


MR. CRISPIN:  Your Honor, the -- the decision of


this Court in, in the A -- in determining what employees


count for ADA purposes was, the -- the decision was the


payroll method, and looked to the payroll, whether an


individual is on the payroll for 5 days of the week for


20 weeks in the preceding or current calendar year, so the


director, if that director is performing services adequate


to put him or her on the payroll for the entire week,


would be counted as an employee for that particular week.


I -- I would suggest that that would be a rare


occasion where a director who had no other role in the


company but to come in and sit in on a meeting or keep up


with things would appear on the payroll, but if they were,

then they should be counted as employees, because they are


performing services, receiving compensation, and then it


just simply moves into the -- the method of counting those


employees.


QUESTION:  In any event, the director, the


owner-directors, shareholder-directors that we have here


are working for the corporation every day, and they are on


salary?


MR. CRISPIN:  They are on salary.  They work


every day.  The compensation or revenue they produce goes


into the corporation.  They enjoy the corporate shield


from liability for all but that small category of exposure


to malpractice cases --


QUESTION:  Why is that small, when you're


talking about a professional medical corporation?  It


seems to me that that would be the biggest liability, not


the small --


MR. CRISPIN:  It very well may be the largest


monetary, but one could -- could list a number of things,


such as liability on the leasehold, liability for employee


claims, liability for employment contracts, liability for


tax payments, that would be the liability of the


corporation, and for which the individual shareholder-


directors would not have --


QUESTION:  But with -- with malpractice, don't

you have a much greater likelihood of punitive damages and


things like that, that you don't have arising just out of


a contract claim?


MR. CRISPIN:  Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice,


that -- that is correct, and so, from the -- the monetary


standpoint, as I said, that would be the greatest problem,


but the -- the idea of limited liability exists in this


corporation, as it does, in fact, in the limited liability


partnerships and limited liability companies, and if the


touchstone is whether there are corporate limited


liability features, then it doesn't make any difference


whatsoever whether we're dealing with a limited liability


partnership, limited liability corporation, a professional


corporation, or a general corporation, individuals would


be employees if they met the requirements otherwise.


If there are no other questions, I'll conclude.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Crispin.


Mr. Seymour, you have 4 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN W. SEYMOUR


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. SEYMOUR:  Thank you.


The protected class, people in the protected


class should be the same as are counted toward the


15-employee threshold.  That is, we should look at the


individuals in the business enterprise the same, whether

we are determining whether they are eligible to file a


lawsuit, or are protected by the act, or are counted


towards the act's coverage.


Must these doctors take the bitter with the


sweet?  What we're saying is that what these doctors


deserve is to be treated the same as their colleagues in


businesses that are identical, but have a different form. 


That is, these doctors in the professional corporation


should be treated the same as doctors in a limited


liability partnership or a limited liability company.


Would it be simpler to simply look at the form


of the business and stop there?  It would, but it would


also be simpler if we looked at the term, partner and


said, well, partners can never be employees, or we look at


the term, independent contractor, and say well,


independent contractors can never be employees, but we


don't do that for good reasons.  We look beyond the label,


and I'm suggesting that that is appropriate here as well. 


Look beyond the label and see what the realities are, a


reality check.


Does the EEOC count directors as employees? 


Generally, in -- in business law there's a big difference


between a director, an officer, a shareholder, and an


employee, so as I read the EEOC guidance, that is a


vehicle through which businesses, courts, and the EEOC can

look at an individual and determine, well, is the -- is


the label, director, in this circumstance appropriate, or


are they really functioning as an employee?


You can, of course, have inside directors, that


is, employees who are appointed to the board of directors,


or you can have outside directors in some circumstances


where they aren't affiliated except in an advisory role,


as a member of the board, and they -- members of the board


of directors could be paid or they could be not paid, and


I don't think that's an issue that should necessarily be


determinative on deciding whether or not they are an


employee.


The court of appeals here did not look beyond


the fact that the shareholder-directors had organized as a


professional corporation, but the trial court did, and


looked at factors similar to those identified in the EEOC


guidance, and concluded that these shareholder-directors


were not employees.  We believe that is the correct


approach the Court should take.


Thank you.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you,


Mr. Seymour.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:48 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
