 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

next this morning in Case 10-98, Ashcroft v. Al-Kidd.

 (11:18 a.m.)

 General Katyal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL NEAL KUMAR KATYAL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 This lawsuit seeks personal money damages 

against a former Attorney General of the United States 

for doing his job, allegedly with an improper motive, 

yet the Attorney General, like the Federal prosecutor in 

Idaho who sought the material witness warrant at issue 

in this case, was performing the functions of his 

office.

 There are three reasons why the Petitioner 

should not be personally liable for money damages.  The 

first is because the prosecutor's act of seeking the 

material witness warrant is integrally associated with 

the judicial process and entitled to absolute immunity. 

To view it any other way is to expose both line 

prosecutors and high officials to lawsuits by highly 

incentivized litigants based on their purportedly bad 

motives.  That is something this Court has manifestly

resisted and for good reason, because improper motives 

are easy to allege and hard to disprove.  Allowing such 

suits to proceed would result in burdensome litigation 

and interfere with the ability of prosecutors to do 

their jobs.

 The second reason is that the Fourth 

Amendment was not violated, and, therefore, qualified 

immunity applied.  There can be little doubt that the 

statutory requirements of section 3144 were met in this 

case, and, equally, there can be little doubt that the 

subjective motivations of Attorney General Ashcroft or 

the line prosecutor are thoroughly irrelevant to whether 

a Fourth Amendment violation exists.

 This Court has repeatedly rejected 

subjectivity, explaining that otherwise time-consuming, 

vexatious, burdensome, and, indeed, destabilizing 

discovery and litigation would be the inexorable result.

 And the third reason, and the easiest 

reason, is that whatever one thinks the applicable law 

is, what it -- it was manifestly not the law in 2003 

when the warrant in this case was issued by a neutral 

judge in Idaho.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can I ask whether your 

second reason doesn't boil down to saying that it makes 

very little difference whether -- whether Ashcroft is -­

is held immune by absolute immunity or by qualified 

immunity?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Oh, no, it -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Once -- once you say 

that -- that motive is not introducible with regard to 

the qualified immunity question, and once you say that 

he's using a witness subpoena, and you can't look behind 

it as to whether he was abusing it for some other 

purpose, is there any difference between absolute and 

qualified immunity?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Well, I take it there may 

be a difference.  We think the Court should first decide 

the absolute immunity question, which is the way that 

this Court has historically handled questions when 

there's an absolute immunity question and then a 

qualified immunity.

 I take it that the qualified immunity 

question in this case is one about whether motivations 

matter for the Fourth Amendment; whereas the motivation 

question in the absolute immunity sense, as Respondents 

see it, is -- is something broader.  It's not limited to 

the Fourth Amendment, per se.  Their argument is if the 

prosecutor is -- has bad motives essentially or a 

certain bad motive, an investigatory or purposeful bad 

motive to engage in preventive detention, that somehow

pierces the veil of absolute immunity.  That is 

something this Court has never accepted.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I thought the -- I 

thought the argument, rather, was that this is not as 

close to the core of the prosecutorial function as some 

of the other functions to which we have given absolute 

immunity, and since it's so dangerous, since there is 

such potential for abuse, we shouldn't confer absolute 

immunity on this particular conduct.  But I don't 

understand why if we agree with you on qualified 

immunity, there is any difference whatever.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Justice Scalia, to be sure, 

they are now making that argument in this Court, that 

this doesn't fall -- this isn't intimately associated -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  -- with the judicial 

process.  Below, of course, they said the reverse:  That 

material witness warrants were associated with the 

judicial process and that the only difference is that -­

that, here, they had a bad motive.

 So I've talked about the bad motive point. 

Now, with respect to whether this is intimately 

associated with the judicial process, these are material 

witness warrants being sought in connection with an 

ongoing investigation by a prosecutor.  It is

quintessentially a prosecutorial function to obtain 

these warrants and has been for -- for hundreds of 

years, and it's the exercise of the prosecutor's 

professional judgment, which is something that this 

Court has looked to.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was the prosecution already 

pending when this -- when this warrant was issued?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Yes, it was.  The 

indictment of Mr. Al-Hussayen was in February 2003.  The 

prosecutors learned in March that Mr. Al-Kidd was about 

to board a plane and go off to Saudi Arabia for an 

unspecified length of time.  They then acted 

immediately.  They went to the court and said we need 

this warrant to secure this testimony.  That is, to me, 

essentially what prosecutors do and protected by Imbler. 

To see it any other way is to expose prosecutors to 

lawsuits for -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was Mr. Al-Kidd -- was he 

released after -- I understand he didn't testify at the 

trial, and there was an acquittal, and then other 

charges were dropped.  Was Al-Kidd still in custody as a 

material witness after the trial was over?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Justice Ginsburg, he was 

in -- he was detained for only a period of 16 days total 

in 2003.  Is -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But he was restrained 

much longer -- for 15 months.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  He had travel restrictions 

placed upon him until the trial was over and until the 

government -- because after the resolution of 

Mr. Al-Hussayen's case, which was acquittal on some 

charges and a hung conviction -- a hung -- a hung 

decision on others, the government thought about 

retrying Mr. Al-Hussayen, took it very seriously, and 20 

days after al-Hussayen's verdict by the jury, we reached 

an agreement with them in writing that Mr. Al-Hussayen 

would leave the country and -- and not come back, and in 

exchange we weren't going to prosecute him any further. 

And so, immediately -- I think quite soon after the jury 

verdict, the -- the conditions placed on Mr. Al-Kidd 

were lifted.

 And I should say that the material witness 

warrant statute laces into it a whole suite of 

safeguards to prevent against -- as, Justice Scalia, you 

pointed out -- the potential abuse for the -- for 

material witnesses by prosecutors.  I think Congress has 

set up several different things to prevent that.  The 

first is, in order to get a material witness warrant, 

the prosecutor needs to show both materiality and then 

practicability.

The second is that there are strict limits 

placed on the conditions of the -- on the ability of the 

prosecutor to detain anyone.  Section 3142 says that a 

detention can only be allowed by a judge if, quote, "no 

condition or combination of conditions will reasonably 

assure the appearance of the individual."

 And then there's a formal procedure where 

they have a right to counsel, they have the right to 

cross-examine witnesses, to -- to present evidence, to 

proffer evidence at the hearing, and the like -- all to 

show that they shouldn't continue to be detained.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, in light of these 

restrictions, I would like to come back to the question 

that I understood Justice Scalia to be asking.  If the 

Court were to hold that obtaining a material witness 

warrant does not violate the Fourth Amendment where the 

statutory requirements, and in particular establishing 

materiality, are met, why would it be necessary for the 

Court to decide whether there's absolute immunity when a 

prosecutor seeks a material witness warrant?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  For two reasons.  Number 

one is I think that's the way this Court has 

historically gone about it, probably for reasons of 

constitutional avoidance, to not reach constitutional 

questions if there's an absolute immunity question.

And the second is, here, you have a Ninth 

Circuit decision, Justice Alito, that says that -- that 

absolute immunity can be pierced by a prosecutor's bad 

motive.  That is something that infects not simply 

material witness warrant cases but, indeed, virtually 

any case.  As we point out and as the dissent below 

pointed out, that kind of argument could be run by any 

defendant who says you didn't intend to actually indict 

me, or, you didn't care about that, you really wanted to 

flip me to get testimony against some higher-up.  And to 

allow defendants to make those kinds of arguments and to 

expose line prosecutors and attorneys general to that 

form of liability is an extremely damaging proposition.

 The -- with respect to the Fourth Amendment 

question about whether or not motive applies, I think 

this Court has quite clearly said in Whren that motive 

is not -- is not something that should be looked to, 

that the subjective motivations of the prosecutor are 

not -- are -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's after there is 

probable cause to suspect that criminal activity has 

occurred.  And then you -- once you have probable cause, 

they're not going to look behind probable cause.

 But, here, the whole reason for using this 

material witness statute is that there isn't probable

cause to believe that al-Kidd did anything.  The 

violation -- there was no violation of the law.  So 

Whren is different.  It's a different case.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Justice Ginsburg, it's 

certainly different in -- in that respect, but I do 

think that difference doesn't matter, because I think 

what Whren and Edmond and the cases were getting at is, 

is there some objective, individualized determination by 

a neutral judge?  And, here, as I was saying earlier, 

there is quite clearly that laced into the 3144 statute 

itself; that is, the judge must find materiality and -­

and impracticability of the testimony.  And that is a 

standard performing, I think, a long-standing government 

function of making sure that testimony, important 

testimony, is available at trial.

 So it is not like a situation in which the 

government, just on their mere say-so, can put the -­

can detain someone on the basis of them saying, well, we 

think this person has information.  I think there are 

strict standards placed on that, and, indeed, Federal 

Rule -- Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 46 adds 

standards to it by saying that a prosecutor must report 

to the judge every 10 days about anyone who is detained 

and assure no more detention is necessary.  So that -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How does that -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't see how that would 

make any difference to the -- at least to the absolute 

immunity question.  You wouldn't assert that there is 

absolute immunity if there's a statute such as this, but 

there is not if there isn't.  I mean, either this is 

core prosecutorial function for which he can't be sued 

or it isn't.  So what difference does this statute make 

as far -- as far as absolute immunity is concerned?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Absolutely, Justice Scalia. 

I was just answering Justice Ginsburg's question about 

qualified immunity.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  I imagine one point about 

the statute might be that the statutes, going all the 

way back to 1789, do reflect that this is a 

prosecutorial function to the extent there is any doubt. 

So, for example, the 1846 statute said that an 

attorney -- excuse me, an attorney of the United States 

must apply for a material witness warrant.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So for us to agree with you 

on absolute immunity, we -- we would have to believe 

that even if there were no such statute and if a 

prosecutor simply detained somebody as a material 

witness without any check of a -- of an independent

magistrate, he would be immune?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  I think that is correct, 

that that is quintessentially what prosecutors do in the 

exercise of trying to get a trial -- a trial going. 

Now -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose -- suppose that a 

prosecutor reads the statute, there must be an affidavit 

that says this witness is material.  And there is 

irrefutable evidence that the prosecutor said to 

colleagues and others:  I do not intend to try this 

person, ever, no matter what; I just want to ask him 

questions.  In that case, has the statute been violated 

because he is not material?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Well, if the -- if the --

I'm not sure I totally follow -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not saying it's this 

case.  I'm saying it's a hypothetical case.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  If the evidence shows that 

the evidence is not material, then the statute is 

violated.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And the reason it is not 

material is because the prosecutor has no intention 

whatsoever of ever bringing this person as a witness in 

any trial.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  I do think that that would

generally mean that materiality would be violated.  I 

could imagine -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  -- some theoretical 

construct -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  If materiality is violated, 

does not then that -- that prosecutor -- since he had no 

intention of bringing him to trial or of having him as a 

witness at a trial, that prosecutor would not be immune?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Justice Breyer, let me -­

let me -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- yes.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  -- just make sure that I 

understand the contours of your hypothetical.  I don't 

think that subjective motivations of the prosecutor go 

to materiality.  So if -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, how does -- how does 

it -­

GENERAL KATYAL:  Here's how I think it 

works:  So I think that Congress set up the objective 

two-part test to decide whether or not an arrest warrant 

would take place, which is materiality and 

impracticability.  Now, that isn't subjective; that is 

simply, does the person have material information that 

can be used that -- that's relevant to the trial.

Now, if the person has a -- the prosecutor 

has a subjective intent that says I'm never going to use 

this testimony, then I think that that doesn't -- that 

will -- that will almost always reflect the fact that 

materiality just objectively hasn't been met in a given 

case, but theoretically I could imagine a circumstance 

in which the prosecutor has that subjective intent but 

yet is material.

 With respect to that, Congress has a 

different safeguard at the back end, in 3144, and that 

is the language in 3144 that says a judge in the 

detention hearing is to inquire as to whether or not the 

detention is necessary, quote, "if there will be a 

failure of justice" if the person is released.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you can't look behind 

that, right?  You can't look behind that?  If the -- if 

the judge has said it's material, that's the end of it; 

you have absolute immunity, right?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Well, I think that the -­

the defense can litigate that and appeal that set of 

issues, but I don't think -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can appeal the -- the 

judge's determination that -- that it's material?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Absolutely.

absolute immunity?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Well, they did, because 

we're talking about -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, you mean at the time 

it's issued?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Exactly.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I see.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  At the time itself.  But I 

think that's an important point, Justice Scalia.  With 

respect to absolute immunity, this Court has often said 

that it is the crucible of the trial process itself that 

often is a safeguard against abuse.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, what if you didn't 

have -- again, what if you didn't have this prescribed 

judicial process?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  I take it that the logic of 

this Court's precedence is that absolute immunity would 

still apply.  And the reason for that is that absolute 

immunity isn't some rule to just protect prosecutors 

willy-nilly; it's to protect the public.  And as this 

Court said most recently unanimously in the Van de Kamp 

case, that -- quoting Learned Hand -- that -- that there 

is a cost to this.  No doubt that certain individuals 

will be harmed, but the cost of rooting out the bad 

apples through damages lawsuits is far worse, that it

causes prosecutors to flinch in the performance of their 

duties.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There is a difference 

between calling a witness at trial and arresting a 

person.  How is it a part of the prosecutorial or the 

trial function to arrest someone?  Isn't what's 

protected absolutely is your use of that person at 

trial, not your arrest or detention of them?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  No, I do think it goes 

quite a bit further than that.  I think it -- and I 

think Burns v. Reed -- and the relevant language is at 

page 492 -- I think is -- is relevant because it says 

that it's pretrial conduct, in order to secure the 

testimony for trial or the like is -- is what is 

protected as well, that it would be far too narrow to 

just focus on the trial itself; and that would be the 

contours of absolute immunity.

 I think Justice Kennedy's opinion in Buckley 

is also instructive in this regard, because what that 

opinion says is that allowing only immunity for the 

trial would just allow individuals to constantly replead 

their allegations and focus only on the pretrial conduct 

and be an end run around absolute immunity.  And, again, 

absolute immunity is important not for the prosecutor 

for his own sake or her own sake, but because ultimately

that is what -- that causing -- damage liability will -­

will make prosecutors flinch the performance of their 

duties more generally.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You don't -- you don't 

think there's a reason to make prosecutors flinch 

against willy-nilly -- that's not what I'm -- I'm 

claiming happened here, but if you take the point that 

you're raising, then prosecutors can out of spite, out 

of pure investigative reasoning, out of whatever motive 

they have, just lock people up.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Justice Sotomayor -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And you're -- you're 

basically saying -­

GENERAL KATYAL:  -- making prosecutors 

flinch is -- is always a bad thing.  What I'm referring 

to is this Court's precedents that say damages liability 

on prosecutors is the wrong way to go about it because 

the costs are too high compared to the benefits, and 

there are other ways of dealing with that -- from 

professional discipline, as Malley v. Briggs and Imbler 

said; to -- to -- to bar actions; to the crucible of the 

trial process itself, which is a way of dealing with 

that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, there are procedures 

set forth in the statute, I'd say you would add, which

you think are not necessary, but are there in order to 

make them flinch in a different -- in a different -­

GENERAL KATYAL:  That is precisely correct. 

We don't think those are constitutionally compelled, but 

we do think they provide a very important safeguard.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's your best authority 

that at -- at common law or the common law tradition, 

there is absolute immunity for witness -- for the 

issuance of witness warrants?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  I don't think it's come up 

with respect to public prosecutors, and so our argument 

here, to the extent the Court reaches that question -­

and, again, it wasn't -- it wasn't raised below in the 

brief in opposition, but if the Court wanted to reach 

that question, I think it would be that the argument 

would derive the same way as the arguments in this 

Court's post-Imbler cases, which is, as long as it is 

intimately associated with the judicial function that 

the prosecutor is doing, then absolute immunity should 

extend to that context.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then a second question, 

quite apart from immunity, just addressing the 

substantive constitutional issues under the statute, 

suppose that the prosecutor has probable cause to indict 

and try the person for the crime.  Suppose also that

there is good reason to show that he would be a material 

witness as to another participant in the crime.  Does 

the government have any duty to proceed with the 

indictment, or can they just hold the person as a 

material witness without indicting?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  I do think that the 

government -- I'm not sure if we have any policy with 

respect to that, but I think that -- that we -- that at 

least for Fourth Amendment purposes, there wouldn't be a 

violation if the government held the person for 

essentially a dual motive, and that is what I understand 

they have now conceded at page 31 of their brief, which 

is in dual motive cases, the government's action is 

permissible.

 If there are no other questions, I'll 

reserve the balance of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEE GELERNT

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. GELERNT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In Dunaway, this Court emphatically 

reaffirmed the bedrock Fourth Amendment principle that a 

criminal suspect may not be arrested, absent probable

cause to believe there has been a law violated.  The 

rule is fundamental to our traditions, is widely viewed 

as a defining feature of our country, and has been 

steadfastly protected by this Court for more than 2 

centuries in both good and bad times.

 The material witness statute represents a 

dramatic departure to the rule, allowing the arrest of 

uncharged, innocent, even cooperative people.  If a 

material witness arrest is constitutional, it can only 

be because its purpose is to secure testimony and not to 

preventively detain and investigate the witness himself.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you acknowledge that it 

is then constitutional?  Your -- your opening comments 

make me think you don't even acknowledge that it's 

constitutional then?

 MR. GELERNT:  Justice Scalia, we are not 

pressing that argument.  I would say that based on the 

legal historian's brief there is a strong argument to be 

made that it is not constitutional, with respect at 

least to cooperative witnesses.  The statute the Framers 

enacted in 1789 would not allow the arrest of any 

witness unless they came voluntarily before the 

magistrate and refused to even promise to return.  Not 

even a surety or a -- a surety or a bond was allowed. 

So we do think there is a strong argument, but we are

not pressing that argument.

 Our argument is that it cannot be used for 

ulterior purposes.  And I just want to pick up, if I 

can, with Justice Breyer's hypothetical that he posed to 

the government, which is of course our hypothetical. 

The government started out this case throughout the 

lower courts and in the opening brief saying purpose is 

wholly irrelevant.  This is Whren, even though Whren is 

probable cause to believe a law has been violated; this 

is Whren, purpose is wholly irrelevant.

 We posed a hypothetical which we actually 

think is this case and is consistent with our factual 

allegations, that the sole reason this arrest was made 

was not to secure testimony but to preventively detain 

and investigate someone for whom there was no probable 

cause or violation of the law.

 That is -- is a difficult situation I think 

to reconcile with Whren, I think an impossible situation 

to reconcile with Whren, or with the text or history of 

this statute.

 The government has now come back and trying 

to have it both ways and saying, well, the statute 

wouldn't naturally allow that.  But if purpose is -- as 

Justice Breyer pointed out, if purpose is truly 

irrelevant why they want to make the arrest, the

government should have answered "that would be fine. 

The only things we need to satisfy are the objective 

components of materiality and impracticability."

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Is this a -- is this a 

realistic hypothetical that you've posed?  Now, in order 

to detain someone under the material witness statute, 

that person, potential witness, must have material 

testimony, not just relevant testimony, material 

testimony, testimony that would be of some importance in 

the criminal prosecution.  So your hypothetical is a 

situation in which there is a witness and this witness 

has important testimony that could be used in a pending 

criminal case, and yet the prosecution has absolutely no 

interest in calling that person as a witness.

 How often is that going to arise?

 MR. GELERNT:  Well, Justice Alito, I -- I 

think a few points, one is just as an initial matter. 

The statute has not actually been interpreted to go 

beyond relevance, in the way you're posing it. 

Interestingly, earlier statutes actually said the 

testimony needed to be necessary.  And so, that's -­

that's actually an important watering down.

 But putting that aside for the moment, we 

think that what -- it -- it did happen in this case, it 

happened after 9-11, I think that goes to the crux of

our case here.  We are not trying to fiddle with the use 

of the material witness statute in the every day 

context, and I think that's the point the Federal 

prosecutor's brief is making.

 What we are saying is simply that the 

principle has to be that if you do encounter that 

extreme case, this Court should not bless the situation 

where it literally can be used as a preventive -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The problem, and 

it's, I think, the problem that I think Whren 

highlighted is that the -- the allegation can so readily 

be made in every case under the material witness statute 

is that this is one of those bad intent cases, and the 

case has to proceed so that we can prove that.

 One of the ways we prove that is by asking 

everybody who is involved in the process.  Why did you 

do this?  What was your intent?  I mean, the whole 

purpose of Whren is to make sure that kind of stuff 

doesn't happen.

 MR. GELERNT:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but 

let me -- let me say that I think I -- I understand 

Whren, I obviously don't want to tell the Court about 

its own cases, but is that it was drawing a conceptual 

line, that the first point about Whren, and I think the 

fundamental point, was the conceptual point that as the

Whren court put it, only an undiscerning reader would 

conflate cases in which there was probable cause of a 

violation of the law with cases in which there wasn't.

 So I think the Whren court is not saying we 

wouldn't look at purpose.  I think that's the teaching 

of the special needs cases.

 Now, to your practical question about why 

would this be hard to allege?  I actually think that 

this is one of those unique situations which it would be 

very difficult to allege.  Take the government's cases, 

for example, that they've cited, like Daniels and Betts, 

the material witness cases, you have witnesses being 

arrested, not showing up for trial.  As the court of 

appeals made clear in those cases, they were the main 

witnesses, not showing up on the day of the trial or 

right before trial.

 It would be virtually impossible for those 

witnesses to turn around and say the only reason I was 

arrested was for investigative purposes.  And I think 

that on top of the fact that this statute is used very 

rarely, I mean what we have pointed out is other than in 

immigration cases, which the person is already subject 

to custody, there are only a few hundred each year.

 And again, I think what the Green brief is 

saying by the Federal prosecutors is, look, the settled

understanding of this statute among line prosecutors has 

always been, you use it to secure testimony.  Maybe 

there's a windfall in the back of your mind that this 

person might be a suspect, but you certainly can't use 

it where you have no intention of using the testimony. 

I think then the limitations on this statute become 

meaningless.  I mean, take -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So every time the 

prosecutor elects not to call one of these witnesses for 

a variety of reasons, you would have a claim that this 

wasn't designed to elicit testimony?

 MR. GELERNT:  No, no, we don't think so, 

Mr. Chief Justice.  I -- I think what we have -- we have 

said is that calling the witness or not calling the 

witness can't be determinative.  I think one reason is 

you wouldn't want to create a perverse incentive to have 

prosecutors simply call the witness just to cover 

themselves.  So I think you would have to allege much 

more, and I think that's what we have done.

 I think there is an entire set of 

allegations with respect to Mr. Al-Kidd, and they fit a 

national pattern.  And I would importantly say in the 

questions presented, the government raised an Iqbal 

claim as to plausibility only as to a small part of this 

case which is no longer part of the case, which is, was

Mr. Ashcroft involved in the specific statements in this 

specific affidavit.

 They did not allege that the allegations of 

a pretextual policy were implausible.  So it is not 

before this court, it is not a question presented, and I 

think it is telling that the government didn't raise it. 

They are sitting on all the information about what 

happened after 9-11 as a policy matter, and they did not 

claim it was implausible.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just a point of detail. 

I -- I may not be recalling correctly.  You said this 

statute is rarely used.  I thought there were 4,000 

material witness hearings a year.  Is that mostly 

because of the immigration?

 MR. GELERNT:  Yes, Justice Kennedy, and I 

apologize if I wasn't clear.  That what the -- what the 

court of appeals showed and what the statistics also 

show is that roughly 92 percent of the cases are 

immigration cases, where the person is already subject 

to custody, and there wouldn't be any need to use it in 

that pretextual way.

 So what we're talking about is a few hundred 

each year throughout the country, and again when it's 

used properly, it's going to be virtually impossible to 

allege something like this.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do we -- do we -- do we 

have statistics for the States, how many States hold -­

how many people are held under State material witness 

statutes?

 MR. GELERNT:  We have -- we have looked for 

those, Justice Kennedy.  We have not been able to find 

them.  What we do know about the States, though is that 

more than 30 of the States have statutes that are much 

more restrictive than the Federal Government, because 

what they do is they follow what the framers did in 

1789, which is to say the witness has to be given an 

opportunity to comply, and that's what the framers did. 

You have to ask the witness if they will continue to 

comply.  If they won't -- or you have to make a showing 

of why it's impossible to ask them.

 So, I think in many States it won't be a 

problem.  I think actually, you know, the State issue is 

an important one because what the Federal Government is 

arguing here is, of course, well, our prosecutors are 

very well supervised.  Well, that -- that doesn't take 

into account if there is a deliberate attempt to misuse 

it.

 But I also think what we're looking at are 

States, local counties, cities where there may not be 

the resources necessary to put checks on, and what the

government's asking is for this Court to hold that as 

long as you can make the minimal showings of 

impracticability and materiality, which don't even 

require the evidence to be important or that the witness 

be uncooperative, you then can have any purpose you 

want.  So you could have States, cities, local counties 

saying every member of this gang or every member of this 

business must know some information about the person 

that's been indicted.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Your argument is that the 

Constitution does not allow a material witness to be 

detained, so long as the witness says in court that he 

or she will show up for trial, no matter how much 

evidence there is that this person poses a great risk of 

flight?  If the person says in court, I will be there, 

that's the end of it, the person cannot be detained?

 MR. GELERNT:  Do I think the Constitution 

requires that?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.

 MR. GELERNT:  I think it probably does, but 

we are not taking a position on that.  I mean, what we 

are basically saying is that it is out of whack 

historically.  It wasn't until the mid 1900s where that 

could happen, where even if they said they would come 

back, you could hold them.  So I think it's out of whack

historically, and there may be a real constitutional 

argument.

 We are not pressing it.  We are simply 

saying that if it's used for its proper purpose, then we 

are going to assume it's constitutionality, which the 

Ninth Circuit did, but it can't be that it can be used 

as a preventive detention.  And I think any reasonable 

official -- and I want to go to the qualified immunity 

if I could -- would have seen that, because I think the 

analysis would have been the following.  You would have 

pulled out Dunaway, and you would have seen that you 

need probable cause to arrest someone, probable cause of 

wrongdoing.

 And you would have then said, well, we don't 

have probable cause of wrongdoing, so you would have 

pulled out Whren then, because Whren talked about 

pretext.  What Whren would have told you is do not 

conflate cases in which there's probable cause of 

wrongdoing with cases in which the court has granted an 

exemption from the probable cause -­

witness statute cases, and what would he have found?

 MR. GELERNT:  Well, I think what he would 

have found, Your Honor, is that the Court has not 

specifically -- I grant that it has not specifically 

ruled on the Fourth Amendment, but what he would have 

found in Barry and the other cases, is that the Court 

repeatedly, repeatedly referred to statute as a means of 

securing testimony.

 So I think the reasonable official would 

have said to themselves, well, it's clear under the 

Fourth Amendment that I don't have probable cause, but 

maybe the statute is allowing me to do it.

 Now, first of all, it statute can't 

authorize a Fourth Amendment violation.  But putting

 MR. GELERNT:  Exactly, Your Honor.  And I 

think what the research would have been done, they would 

have looked at Barry and all this Court's other cases 

and would have specifically said it's to secure 

testimony, and then I think a reasonable official would 

have looked at the text of the statute, everything in

the text of the statute is about securing testimony, 

including the deposition requirement, you must be 

released if your deposition is taken, you must have a 

deposition.

 All of those things do not suggest -- if the 

government's interests could be simply we want to hold 

this person because for preventive detention reasons, 

none of the statute would make sense.  I think that a 

reasonable official could not have turned to this 

statute and said, yes, I'm looking at the statute, and 

it seems like I can use it for whatever reason I want.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the eight -­

eight judges taking the opposite position in the hearing 

en banc below were just being unreasonable?  It would 

have been unreasonable for an officer making this 

determination to agree with eight judges from the Ninth 

Circuit?

 MR. GELERNT:  I think, Your Honor, the --

Mr. Chief Justice, the only way I can answer that is to 

say this Court has -- has never made determinant of 

whether there are dissents.  I mean, take the Brogue in 

this Court, two justices of this Court descended on 

merits and yet you still found that the law was clearly 

established.

Wilson, I'm quoting, judges -- when judges disagree on a 

constitutional question, it is unfair to subject public 

employees to money damages for picking the losing side 

of the controversy.

 MR. GELERNT:  I mean, but I think Brogue 

goes the other way.  Ultimately, all I can say, 

Mr. Chief Justice, is I think that the -- the fact that 

there were dissenters can't be dispositive, and 

ultimately this -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I agree 

with -- I agree with that, of course, but at the same 

time, it does seem that you're imposing a very heavy 

burden on the officers in this area when do you have a 

situation where eight judges, when they conduct their 

research, come out the other way.  And that type of 

burden is particularly heavy when you're talking about 

if they guess wrong, it comes out of their pocket.  And 

if I'm the officer in that situation, I say, well, I'm 

just not going to run the risk of, you know, having to 

sell the house because I agreed with eight judges on the 

Court of Appeals.

 MR. GELERNT:  Well, Your Honor, I think -­

you know, of course, I'm not sure it will actually come 

out of their pocket, but I get the crux of your point.

where a reasonable official would have had to say to 

themselves:  I can use this as preventative detention. 

Because I want to be very clear about our position and 

how narrow it is.

 We would concede, for purposes of this 

argument, that if they wanted to use this for dual 

motives, then there would have been a real question 

there.  If they said, look, we want the testimony, 

that's what the statute talks about, but we also hope 

that maybe something else will come out of it, that's a 

closed question.  But if they would have said to 

themselves, which is all we're saying this case is 

about, is:  Look, we don't want this testimony.  In 

Justice Breyer's hypothetical, there's clear, objective 

evidence.  We don't want to use this testimony, perhaps 

it's counterproductive in our case; we're not going to 

use this testimony, but we would like to hold the 

person.  I think that is very difficult for a reasonable 

official to say to themselves, this statute grants me 

preventive detention powers.

 I mean, I think you would be looking at a 

statute going back to 1789 that this Court has 

repeatedly commented on that is only about testimony. 

You would be saying to yourself, this statute allows me 

to engage in preventive detention even though Congress

has never passed a statute like that, Congress 

specifically rejected preventive detention powers -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  You don't think that an 

official reading all this Court's cases saying 

subjective motivation is not proper in determining the 

application of the Fourth Amendment would be able to 

think that this would apply here, too?  Subjective 

motivation doesn't count here; what counts is whether 

there's -- there are objective criteria that would 

permit the detention?

 MR. GELERNT:  I don't think so, Justice 

Alito, respectfully.  I think when you pulled out Whren, 

which, of course, is this Court's landmark decision on 

pretext -- Whren could not have been clearer.  The Court 

specifically said only an undiscerning reader would 

conflate the two.  And I think the conceptual point 

Whren was making is straightforward.

 The Fourth Amendment says you need probable 

cause or a violation of the law to arrest someone.  If 

the government wants to walk in and ask for an exemption 

from that standard and says, the reason we want the 

exemption is because of the purpose of the arrest, then 

the Court in Whren said, well, then they must adhere to 

the purpose.  Otherwise, it's simply an end-run about 

the probable cause.

I mean, consider two cases -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the Fourth Amendment 

doesn't say you need probable cause.  There are 

situations where you can conduct a search without 

probable cause.  There's the Terry search.  There's 

administrative searches.  There's a lot of exceptions.

 MR. GELERNT:  Yes, Justice Scalia, but I 

think -- well, the Terry -- the Terry stops, I think we 

put to one side, because as the Court in Terry said and 

as this Court has interpreted Terry, those were because 

those were not full-scale arrests and the 

administrative -- sorry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Administrative searches, 

automobile searches, you know.

 MR. GELERNT:  Absolutely, and those all fall 

into the special needs category, and those were cases 

you, Your Honor, in Whren distinguished as conceptually 

different than when there's probable cause of a 

violation of law, because what you yourself said in 

Whren was:  Look, the government is asking for an 

exemption from the traditional Fourth Amendment standard 

and they're saying the reason we want the exemption is 

because of the purpose of our search.

 You said, well, then, of course we're going 

to hold the government to that purpose.  They can't tell

us, look, we don't want to meet the Fourth Amendment 

standard because of the purpose of what we're doing, but 

then turn around and not adhere to the purpose.

 And so if you had two cases, one where 

there's probable cause of wrongdoing and another case 

where there wasn't, the judge would say fine to the 

first one and then he would say to you, well, the second 

one, you don't have probable cause.  The only thing the 

government could say at that point was, well, that's 

true, but we're not trying to investigate or prosecute 

the person as in Dunaway.  We have a different purpose. 

Maybe it's administrative.  Maybe it's to secure 

testimony.  Maybe it's a roadblock.  Maybe it's 

something else.  And then if the Court said, well, fine, 

then go ahead and do that search on less than probable 

cause, if that's your purpose, you couldn't turn around 

then and not -- and then not adhere to that purpose. 

I 

mean, I think that's what we're talking about, is

JUSTICE ALITO:  You seem to acknowledge that 

in -- a dual motive case would not violate the Fourth 

Amendment, or wouldn't necessarily violate the Fourth 

Amendment; isn't that right?

 MR. GELERNT:  Yes, Your Honor.

reasonable official would appreciate, well, it's okay 

for me to have a dual motive, but I have to stop and 

think:  Is my interest in investigating this individual 

further the but-for cause of my desire to get a material 

witness warrant?  Do you think that was apparent?

 MR. GELERNT:  I think it actually is, Your 

Honor, and the reason is because I think it's -- I think 

it actually gives cushion to the reasonable official, 

because I think once you are saying we want to secure 

testimony, it might be very difficult, as the Chief 

Justice was pointing out, to say, well, how I do know if 

I could have ulterior motives or not?  That might be a 

very difficult situation.

 But I think a reasonable official -- this 

Court's proposition that this Court would have to -­

would have to bless, based on the allegations here are, 

the official said, look, we think we can show 

materiality and practicability because Mr. Al-Kidd is 

taking a trip, he is being cooperative, but he is taking 

a trip and he works for the same charity.  We do not 

want the testimony.  We can't use the testimony in this 

trial.  The only reason we want to do it is to hold him, 

and we don't have probable cause of a violation of the 

law.  I think any reasonable official would have 

understood that as preventive detention, and there -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm not sure why that just 

can't be resolved under the issue of materiality.  The 

magistrate asks the prosecutor why he wants to do this, 

and he infers from what the prosecutor said that -- just 

what you say.  Then it's not material.  It's not a case.

 MR. GELERNT:  That goes to the crux of, I 

think, what is going on here.  We have said that both 

the Fourth Amendment and the materiality as well as 

other parts of the statute would deal with it precisely. 

The government's opening brief and throughout the lower 

courts said, no, it doesn't matter if you're going to 

use the testimony or not or we have any intention.

 We posed that hypothetical in our brief. 

The government came back and said, well, maybe that 

could be done with materiality.  If the government was 

going to stick to their position, their conceptual 

position, they would have come back and said, look, the 

objective components of materiality and of 

practicability have been satisfied, because he's taking 

a trip and he worked for the same charity, and who cares 

whether -- so if the Court is prepared to put a limit 

on, you have to use this for its stated purpose, 

testimony, that's all we're asking for.  I mean, the 

case has changed now because of the concession that the 

government's made on pages bottom of 15, top of 16,

where they're now saying, yeah, that is a tough 

situation, and maybe we can deal with that through the 

statute.  But that's all we're saying.

 The Ninth Circuit understood this as a sole 

motive case.  The government understood it in their cert 

petition and in their brief to this Court as a sole 

motive case.  We have said we think the analytical test 

is a but-for, but we're prepared to go with sole motive, 

and our allegations, our factual allegations, are 

consistent.  In the proposition, we are simply saying, 

we don't think this Court can bless it.  You satisfy 

practicability in some objective way; you don't care 

whether you're going to use the testimony, you may have 

no use for it, but it's an end-run around locking people 

up.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Where did you allege that 

the desire to detain was the sole motive for this?

 MR. GELERNT:  Your Honor, I think that the 

clearest allegations are at 111 and 112 and 154 of our 

complaint, in the joint appendix.  What we said is it 

was not to secure testimony.  And I think the Ninth 

Circuit certainly understood it that way at pages -- I 

apologize -- 25A and 40A of the opinion.  And the 

government, in its cert petition and its brief, 

understood it that way in saying, we don't know how the

Ninth Circuit would deal with a mixed motive case, 

clearly suggesting that the Ninth Circuit was a sole 

motive case; and so again, all we are saying is it 

cannot be that this statute be transformed into a 

preventive detention statute, and I think particularly 

so because the government after 9-11 specifically -- as 

the green brief notes -- specifically asked Congress for 

preventive detention power, and that power was denied. 

What they granted was a very limited 7-day hold only for 

noncitizens.

 And so I think what we're talking about in 

many respects -- at a macro level is a separation of 

powers case as much as a Fourth Amendment.  I think it's 

not -- it's not dissimilar to the dialogue this Court 

has been having in the Guantanamo cases with, look, you 

need to go beyond the Fourth Amendment; if you think you 

need such a fundamental change to our country's 

traditions, Congress is going to have to take the first 

step, we'll look at it and there will be a back and 

forth.

 But here what happened was the preventive 

detention powers were denied and yet the government 

still went ahead and used the material witness statute. 

And again, I can't stress enough that the government did 

not raise an Iqbal claim as to the plausibility of these

allegations.  Only now in the reply brief where they're 

-- they're trying to address a sole motive situation, or 

a but-for, which is all we're asking this Court to 

address, the government has now said the allegations are 

implausible.

 I think that in many situations -- you know, 

with the absolute immunity point, if I could just turn 

to that for a second -- the history, as you said, 

Justice Kennedy, the government has conceded they don't 

have a case on their side.  We have plenty of cases in 

which, as the historians' brief points out, and as our 

brief points out, in which there was not immunity for 

the arrest of a -- for the arrest of a witness, which is 

very different than calling a witness, Justice 

Sotomayor.

 And what we are talking about here also is 

the government's burden.  So I don't think that's 

something we could have -- we could have waived, 

especially since the Ninth Circuit addressed it and put 

the government on notice that the government came 

forward with no historical evidence; and it's not 

inconsistent with warrants generally.

 As this Court made clear in Malley, it 

surveyed the history of arrest warrants and said, look, 

arrest warrants, there's no history; we're not going to

grant absolute immunity for arrest warrants.  In Burns, 

Justice Scalia pointed out that there is no history with 

respect to search warrants, and I think the history with 

respect to material witness warrants is even clearer. 

So what we're talking about is no history; we're talking 

about a fairly ancillary and rarely used process to the 

criminal justice system, and one we're talking about 

where there's sort of a unique confluence of factors 

where you have someone who is not the defendant in the 

trial, who is a third party, and their liberty is being 

deprived; and it's the type of statute that can be 

abused.  I mean, I think the government's whole point is 

it's a dual -- it's a dual motive type statute; and so 

that because it can be inherently abused, there has to 

be some checks on it.

 And this Court has never said that you would 

have absolute immunity for all prosecutors in all cases. 

We are certainly not raising a motive case with respect 

to absolute immunity.  What we are simply applying is 

the Court's test in absolute immunity, which is the 

functional approach, you have to make that threshold 

determination about whether something is investigative 

or not; and I think that's the teaching of Buckley. 

Take two witness interviews.  They're the same act, but 

the prosecutor clearly can be engaged in interviews for

different reasons.

 In Buckley, it happened to be on those facts 

the Court believed it was investigative, based on the 

allegations in the complaint.  But what if it were 2 

days before the presentment to the grand jury?  It's 

likely the prosecutor would have assumed he had probable 

cause at that point and was prepping the witnesses.

 Those are two acts, but you have to look 

behind them.  I think there's no way around looking 

behind.  The alternative, the flip side of what the 

government's asking, is:  rigidly categorize every 

single act a prosecutor may undertake in this country 

and say it's either wholly investigatory or wholly 

prosecutorial.  And I think that's a very difficult 

test.

 I think there's no reason why district 

courts can't make an initial determination.  I think 

here in particular, Judge -- was in a unique position to 

make the determination.  He sat at the underlying trial 

of Al-Hussayen, so he knew what testimony and what was 

going on.  He -­

 MR. GELERNT:  No, Your Honor.  And I -- I --

Justice Scalia, I apologize if my argument was going 

beyond.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what I thought you 

were saying.

 MR. GELERNT:  I think what's going on here 

is there's a unique set of factors with respect to 

material witness, not the least of which is the history 

with respect to both material witness arrests and 

warrants generally, and I think there's been no 

counter-history by the government.  I think back -­

relevant to the scope of the immunity that should be 

available in a -- in a Bivens action?  What's the theory 

for that?

 MR. GELERNT:  Well, Your Honor, I think -- I 

don't know that I have an independent first principles 

theory.  I think this Court has said repeatedly that you 

will keep the immunities coterminous and you will look

to the history in both cases.  So that's the Butz case.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Does that make any sense? 

I 

can understand it with respect to 1983, on the theory 

that when Congress passed the predecessor of that 

statute it implicitly intended to adopt the immunities 

that were available at the time; but when this Court 

invented the Bivens claim -- in when -- 1971 or 

whatever -- that the Court -- the Court was -- committed 

itself to recognizing only those immunities that were 

available at the time when 1983 was adopted?

 MR. GELERNT:  I think, you know, part of 

what the Court's answer is, it's a practical concern. 

That it's just too difficult to have different 

immunities, and the Court -- so the Court has repeatedly 

reaffirmed that, and I think from a policy standpoint, a 

practical standpoint, it's felt that that's the right 

analysis, and there has to be some way to tether the 

immunity analysis; and history is ultimately, I think -­

what the Court has said it's a necessary though not 

sufficient, and that once you sort of unmoor it from 

history, it becomes very difficult to keep the two.

 So I think what we're talking about here is 

a -- a statute that had enormous consequences.  It's 

third parties who have been cooperative, even, who have 

done nothing wrong, that end up in jail, and to say that

there is going to be absolute immunity is very 

dangerous.  This Court has repeatedly said that the 

thumb has to be on the scale against absolute immunity. 

That's an extraordinary protection, and if there's 

anywhere where there needs to not be complete 

insulation, it would be where you have third parties, 

and -- who are going to jail.

 The only other case, prosecutorial immunity 

case this Court has had where it was a third party and 

not the actual defendant was Mitchell, and the Court 

denied absolute immunity.

 All the other cases, some of which you have 

denied absolute immunity, some of which you have 

granted, it's been the defendant in the full judicial 

process.  Here we're talking about third parties after 

9-11 who repeatedly went to jail.  I think the 

allegations are very clear that it's at least but-for -­

we think sole -- but certainly far more than dual 

motive.  People were held -- half the people were held 

more than 30 days, even though the statutory presumption 

is 10 days.  Many people were held for months.  They 

were arrested at gunpoint.  They were not immunized; 

half the people were not called to testify.

 It went on in cities all over the country, 

people being held under horrendous conditions for long

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL NEAL KUMAR KATYAL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Thank you.  This is a 

simple case.  It's not about Guantanamo, it's not about 

separation of powers, it's about one simple thing: 

should we allow damages actions against an Attorney 

General of the United States and ultimately AUSAs for 

doing their job, when they're alleged to have a bad 

motive?

 If I could start with the Chief Justice's 

point about the cost of these lawsuits and allowing them 

to proceed.  My friend on the other side says, well, but 

this will be a small, rare case, an isolated example, 

but I don't think that's true.  I think if you allow 

their motivation argument to -- to -- to pierce absolute 

immunity, you will have this in every case or near every 

case.  95 to 96 percent of Federal cases are resolved by 

plea agreements.  So there isn't someone who is actually 

called at trial.  You could allege it in any of those 

cases.

what my friend has said is a disturbing, quote, 

"national pattern of abuse" of the material witness 

statute, something which we --with which we vigorously 

disagree, but if you could add the fact that someone 

wasn't called on in a trial to that national pattern, 

then you'll be having these damages actions quite a bit 

of the time.  Now he says don't worry, it will only be a 

few hundred of these lawsuits.  Well, leaving apart the 

fact that that excludes immigration cases and excludes 

the States' cases, as Justice Kennedy said, a few 

hundred lawsuits just at the Federal level filed against 

the Attorney General?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General Katyal, there are 

some elements of this picture that are very disturbing, 

and we are talking about the Attorney General and the 

Attorney General's immunity.  But there are allegations 

here that this man was kept awake, the lights shining in 

his cell for 24 hours, kept without clothes.  Now that 

doesn't sound like the way one would treat someone whose 

testimony you want.  Is there a remedy that he has for 

that obvious mistreatment?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Justice Ginsburg, with 

respect to that whole set of questions, conditions of 

confinement, that isn't before the Court right now. 

What is before the Court is -- is exclusively Fourth

Amendment concerns.  Now, Mr. Al-Kidd did sue other 

people, including the warden who was responsible for 

that, and I think that there have been other ancillary 

litigation with -- with respect to that, but to hold 

either the Attorney General or prosecutors liable is 

something that would, I think, ultimately open the door 

to, at least there are a few hundred lawsuits at the 

Federal level if not more.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I would like to go back to 

the statute.  If an officer fills out an affidavit for a 

search and says there were drugs in the house, so I want 

to search it, and it turns out he was lying, you would 

have a damages action?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  The officer -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, yes.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  -- you have -- you 

potentially have a damages against the officer, not 

against the prosecutor?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  I'm saying the 

officer, because he told a lie.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now here it 

says that the person filling out the affidavit has to 

say he is a material witness.  So suppose that the 

plaintiffs were to prove that the individual who signed

that was not telling the truth in saying he is a 

material instant -- witness because not just but for, 

but there was no possibility he would call this 

individual, none.  And that's what they have to prove. 

It's really very hard burden of proof.

 Now, one, would that interfere significantly 

with law enforcement?  And, two, how do you distinguish 

it from the drug case?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Justice Breyer, I'm not 

sure if your hypothetical has it as the prosecutor who 

is filing the affidavit and lying or the agent.  If it 

is the agent, I don't think that is something as to 

which absolute immunity, that's Malley v. Briggs and a 

whole line of cases.  Qualified immunity, of course, 

would, and indeed those claims are pending in this -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  But in the case of the 

agent, you're prepared to say that we will allow the 

plaintiff to go into his motive to the extent that the 

plaintiff can show there is no possibility he intended 

to call this individual?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  I think that at least for 

purposes -- I would say there is at least no absolute 

immunity prohibition against that.  There may be -- may 

be relevant under other lines of authority.

your hypothetical in which he said that there -- you 

know, the government isn't sticking to its position or 

something like that, I just want to be clear.  Our 

position is for the Fourth Amendment, it doesn't look to 

subjective motivations at all.  That's Whren and Brigham 

City and the like, but the statute in 3144 does have 

safeguards, prophylactic safeguards to guard against the 

type of abuse that I think several justices have 

mentioned today.  So that you could only detain someone 

so long as their release wouldn't result in a failure of 

justice and the like.

 My friend also said that -- that there's no 

historical precedent for this.  I would urge the Court 

to look at the 1846 statute, which didn't require 

failure to comply before a witness was brought in on a

consistent with their newly minted standard, a dual 

motive standard.

 And given that, I think that the complaint 

would fall on their own terms, and indeed that law -­

that line that they're proposing, a but-for causation 

line, would be extremely difficult to apply in practice 

and would ultimately lead to lawsuits filed against 

attorneys general and line prosecutors alike.

 If there are no further questions -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.

 The case is submitted.
