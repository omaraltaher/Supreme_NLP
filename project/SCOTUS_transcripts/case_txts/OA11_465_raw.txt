Ms. Brenan. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANIE BRENAN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

1
2
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 
3
4  first this morning in Case 11-465, Johnson v. Williams. 
5
6
7
8
9  please the Court: 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
 And this rule is correct for three reasons: 
17
 First, state courts discharge their duties. 
18  They are sworn to uphold the Constitution.  Therefore, 
19  they must adjudicate claims that can -- that allege 
20
21  a decision denying relief, it must necessarily have 
22  considered and rejected all of the claims. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What happens when there 
23
24  is a challenge to the admission of evidence on a state 
law ground on -- on a Confrontation Clause ground, and 
25

adjudicated on the merits when a state court issues a 
decision denying relief unless it has made a plain 
statement to the contrary.  And this is especially true 
where the state court has grappled with the substance of 
the alleged error. 

constitutional violations.  So when a state court issues

 Are we to assume, in the light of that kind 
of decision, that the court actually grappled with the 

 MS. BRENAN:  Your Honor, we would assume 

Clause -- claim.  And that would be because --
for a number of reasons. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Am I to make that 

1  all the state court does is grapple with the evidentiary 
2  rule, but it's self evident that the Confrontation 
3  Clause is based on a different theory? 
4
5
6  Confrontation Clause? 
7
8  that there the state court, through its denial of 
9  relief, did adjudicate the presented Confrontation 
10
11 
12
 First, the presumption of regularity that 
13  judicial officers do do their job, and it can only be 
14  rebutted by clear evidence. 
15
16 
17 
18 
19

24
25

assumption when, before our line of cases in this area, 
state courts generally had held that if hearsay was 
admissible under their evidentiary rules, that that was 
the end of their Confrontation Clause challenge? 

that presumption in light of an undisputed state's 
statement that their rules are consonant with the 
Confrontation Clause. 

 MS. BRENAN:  In that situation, if the state 

court rule is consonant with the Confrontation Clause, 

Is a Federal court supposed to continue with

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, let's assume it's 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If one --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, we can continue and 

1  we would have certainly an adjudication of the 
2  Confrontation Clause. 
3
4  not after our -- we render our decision. 
MS. BRENAN:  And if it were -- if it were 
5
6  different, we would still hold that in that situation, 
7  as this Court -- in relying on Richter, in that 
8  situation it would be more of a summary denial on the 
9  confrontation analysis. 
10
11
12  probably should talk about this broad theory that you 
13  want us to adopt. 
14
15
16  turn cited, at page 104 of the petition appendix, a 
17  Supreme Court case you don't even -- you say citation, 
18  you don't even give -- but it -- it's -- it's the 
19  Supreme Court case, United States v. Wood, written by 
Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes.  And it seems to me 
20
21  itâ€™s very clearly ties its state analysis to the Federal 
22  Constitution and a Sixth Amendment discussion in Wood. 
 So it seems to me that you're -- you have a 
23
24  very strong argument that they did adjudicate the 
25

 Really, in this case, the court of appeals 
in -- in the state system cited Nesler, and Nesler in 

Federal claim anyway.  I know you want us to maybe reach 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MS. BRENAN:  Yes, Your Honor, we agree that 

state law was tied to the Federal standard, and the 

1  the bigger issue, but -- and your brief almost downplays 
2  it -- but it seems to me pretty clear that you have the 
3  argument, that you don't strongly make, although you 
4  don't, by any means, abandon it, that -- that here the 
5
6  Federal standard was the basis for the entire 
7  jurisprudence. 
8
9  in our situation it just so happened to be that the 
state standard also encompassed this Court's Sixth 
10
11 
Amendment jurisprudence because it -- it was citing U.S. 
v. Wood, and it was citing Smith v. Phillips among the 
12 
13 
-- the Sixth Amendment cases.  In our case, it just so 
happens that it does. 
14 
15

17 
18 
19 
20
21 
22
23
24  suggested that -- that it can be rebutted by a plain 
25

But we posit also that our case shows why 
this is illustrative as to why this Court should adopt 
the broader rule that, in situations where a state court 
has denied relief or a claim has been fairly presented, 
that this Court and all Federal courts should assume 
that the state courts did their job by adjudicating 
claims --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Irrebuttably? 
 MS. BRENAN:  Your Honor, in -- we have 

statement, if the state court says that it is not

second, can you? 

 MS. BRENAN:  Well, Your Honor, I posit that 

1  reaching it or, more particularly, if a state court 
2  imposes a procedural bar. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I see exceptions to that 
3
4  already.  There are cases where the state court reaches 
one prong of the Strickland standard, has no need to go 
5
6  to the second. 
 MS. BRENAN:  Yes --
7
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you really can't say 
8
9  in that situation that you can assume they reached the 
10
11
12  those Strickland cases are different.  And they are 
13  different because in all of those cases of Wiggins v. 
14  Smith and Rompilla, that there the courts -- what the 
State court did was follow exactly what this Court has 
15
16  said of how a Strickland claim may be answered entirely 
17  by only addressing the one prong of Strickland. 
 And so there they're doing exactly 
18
19  adjudicating everything through the analysis of one. 
20
21 
22 
23
24
25

Additionally, in those cases, by doing so, 
the courts are not in any way suggesting that the State 
courts failed to do something. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, suppose that the --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Brenan, we are 

straying pretty far from this case.  And correct me if 

7

So there really isn't any 


 So it seems to me if we just look at the 


1  I'm wrong, but, as I understand it, the argument was 
2  made under State law, and then Williams said there was 
3  an abuse of discretion under State law and therefore the 
4  Sixth Amendment was violated. 
5
6  independent -- Williams hasn't stated any independent 

7  Sixth Amendment right.  It's State law was violated and 

8  therefore the Constitution was violated. 

9
position that Williams was taking, that these two, the 
10
11  State and the Federal claim, are tied -- tied together. 
12  And we don't -- to go beyond this case and imagine some 
13  other case that might come before us some day would not 
14  be wise. 
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

agree with the view that here Williams did present a 
completely dependent Federal claim; and, therefore, the 
State's analysis -- the State court's analysis would 
have fully adjudicated that. 

MS. BRENAN:  Yes, Your Honor, I completely 

However, we suggest that this case does 

illustrate why that broader rule is important.  And it's 
important because, otherwise, other Federal courts may 
not view it as this Court did, of seeing it as a dependent 
claim --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The -- the court of

hypothetical.  The brief filed with an intermediate 

 MS. BRENAN:  Exactly, Your Honor. 
 So --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me give you this 

1  appeals, whose decision we're reviewing, understood the 
2  Respondent to present a separate State claim and a 
3  separate Federal claim, correct? 
 MS. BRENAN:  Exactly. 
4
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's the predicate 
5
6  to the whole question we have before us, right? 
7
8
9
10
11  State court of appeals contains 25 pages of argument on 
12  a Federal constitutional claim.  Let's say it's a Brady 
13  claim.  And then it also has two other claims, two other 
14  arguments.  They are State law claims, and each one is 
15
16  intermediate court of appeals, issues an opinion that 
17  addresses only the two State law claims and says nothing 
18  about the Federal constitutional claim. 
19
20
21  constitutional claim? 
22
23  situation we would.  One, because of the presumption of 
24  regularity; two, because of what this Court has said in 
25

Richter, where we could view it as a summary denial; 

dealt with in two pages.  And then the State court, 

 You would say there that -- that it's 

conclusively presumed that they adjudicated the Federal 

 MS. BRENAN:  Yes, Your Honor, in that 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 But that's not what this Court said in 

mean that it didn't consider and reject that claim. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why is it necessary to go so 

its opinion, which should be read as in its opinion 


1  and, third, what underlies that is â€“ is the view that 
2  if it's not written in the opinion, that it has been ignored. 
3
4  Castillo, where it said, if a court chooses to ignore in 
5
6  writing, means that that claim has been impliedly 

7  rejected. 

8
 So, therefore, just because a State court 

9  chooses not to write about it in its opinion does not 

10
11
12  far as to require a plain statement?  Why wouldn't you 
13  protect the same interests if you had a rule that said 
14  that there is a presumption that they have adjudicated 
15
the claim on the merits, but that it can be rebutted if 
16  there is a strong inference that they overlooked it or a 
17  very strong inference that they overlooked it. 
18
 Then you wouldn't have situations like the 
19  one that Justice Sotomayor posed in her hypothetical or 
20
21
22  reason why there should be a plain statement is because 
23  it's long been held that in order to rebut that 
24  presumption of regularity, you need clear evidence. 
25

And, really, the only clear evidence that one could have 

the one that I just mentioned to you. 

 MS. BRENAN:  Sure, Your Honor, but the 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I assume that in --

Harris v. Reed is a case that talked about plain 

enough indication that the court did not consider it or 
not, right?  And every year is a reduction of sentence, 
so to speak. 

1  would be a plain statement. 
2
 And this Court reinforced that when it said 
3  in Richter, it talked about an indication or other State 
4  procedural bars, and it cited Harris v. Reed.  And 
5
6  statements. 
7
8  in many cases, especially capital cases, one could argue 
9  for years over whether -- whether, in fact, there was 
10

14  that's -- that's why having a broader rule with this

18  State's judicial budget and bought them all a stamp 
19  which just says, we have considered and rejected all

22  when they say "affirmed" at the end of the decision.  It

 If it were a stamp, it would be merely 

reflexive, and therefore would in the end give you no

 MS. BRENAN:  If -- this was not a capital

2  not.

3
4  your experience how many separate claims are typically 
5

7  case --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry. 
8
 MS. BRENAN:  -- but an LWOP case.  However, 
9
in a capital case there can be hundreds.  And we -- or 
10
11  hundreds of pages of documents -- or hundreds of pages 
12  in an appellant's opening brief, and, therefore, if one 
13  were to slip in, in a phrase an apparent claim, and that 
14  the State court happens not to --

18 
19 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

good debate over whether it was presented clearly 
enough, is presenting it in two sentences enough to 
require the court to answer it.  I can see a whole --
you know, a whole train of litigation on this wonderful 
subject, a whole new area of law.  Has the -- has the 
State supreme court overlooked something that was 
clearly enough presented, and is there enough indication 
that the State court has overlooked it?  I mean --
that's the problem. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  There would be a lot of

I'm sorry.  Not the Ninth, but the Eleventh. 
 MS. BRENAN:  Well, Your Honor -- the 

1  courts basically have a rule close to the one announced 
2  by Justice Alito, don't they? 
3
4  to mention one particular claim? 
5
6  essentially a presumption that's rebutted by some form 
7  of evidence, except for perhaps the Eleventh and this 
8  circuit that have a clear, almost irrebuttable 
9  presumption. 
10
11
12  Eleventh Circuit and, I believe that, the Sixth Circuit as 
13  well. 
14
15

 Do you know what the total number of habeas

as the Eleventh. 

 MS. BRENAN:  True that the Eleventh Circuit 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Would you be willing to 

 MS. BRENAN:  Yes, I believe that is true, 
that there is a small number of granting of petitions, 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So whatever the abuse of 

 MS. BRENAN:  Well, Your Honor, the thing is 
that -- and I think that Justice Scalia has adverted to 

1
2  accept that it's -- in relationship to the total 
3  granted, it's very, very small? 
4
5
6  yes. 
7
8  the system is, it hasn't halted justice. 
9
10
11  this -- is that if we were to -- to require only an 
12  indication, it would create a situation where there 
13  would be all this litigation.  And that's why this 
14  Court, when it does -- has accepted conclusive 
presumptions in other cases, for example in Coleman v. 
15
16  Thompson, talked about we will accept these conclusive 
17  presumptions because they work in almost all of the 
18  cases, and we will accept the small number of errors in 
19  exchange for the reduction workload.  So --
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

do what we used to do?  Many district judges do this 
and -- because there sometimes thousands of 
petitions of different kinds.  A lot go to the staff 
attorneys that look them over and flag the arguments, 
and you put at the end, just to be on the safe side: 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why can't they just 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  Any other arguments that are made are rejected.  All 
2  right. 
 Now, that serves one purpose.  A human being 
3
4  has a hard time writing that unless he's thinking:  I've 
looked this over pretty carefully.  And if it's a staff 
5
6  attorney preparing a draft, the staff attorney doesn't 
7  want to -- doesn't want to write those words unless he 
8  or she has really looked with some care. 
 And so it serves a purpose.  It means they 
9
don't do it just as a form.  They could turn it into a 
10
11  form, but they shouldn't.  And so if -- let them write 
12  that, and therefore if we get nothing then you put into 
13  play these presumptions, et cetera. 
14
15
16  end just -- could become reflexive --
17
18  not do their job.  But -- but when you write something 
19  like the word "denied," which is all most district 
20
21  motion, they think about it, that's their job. 
 So -- so, similarly, a staff attorney or a 
22
23  judge who is going to have to write certain words will 
24  want to do his job or her job, and they will do it. 
25

disagree with -- with that proposal because it is in the 

judges write in respect to many motions, they read the

13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
 MS. BRENAN:  I think we could be arguing the 
19
same problem.  I think, as Your Honor's noted, that the 
20
21  inclusion of the word denied, or, if you're affirming a 
22  conviction in a direct appeal, the word affirmed covers 
23  that.  It says exactly, we have considered all those 
24  other claims. 
25

require such a statement, but you have a situation where 
a Federal question occupies 90 percent of the brief, and 
the court only addresses explicitly the state things, 
the state claims, and then at the very end says, we have 
considered all the other claims, presumably including 
the 90 percent Federal claims that are not addressed, 
would we be out of the woods, or would you be here again 
arguing the same problem? 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Brenan, can I ask you

So what would be a plain statement? 

 MS. BRENAN:  A plain statement would be a

1  what you mean by a plain statement?  Because you've said 
2  a couple of times a plain statement to the contrary. 
3
 Justice Sotomayor and Justice Alito have 
4  given you hypotheticals, very different from this case, 
5
6  inference that there was no adjudication of the 
7  particular Federal claim alleged. 
 You said that's not a plain statement, even 
8
9  though it seems as though there is a strong inference. 
10
11
12  procedural bar, or if there were -- a court were to say, 
13  we're not, for some reason, going the reach the 
14  constitutional claim, that they really need to say it 
out loud.  I don't know why they would say that, but 
15
16  that's what would be required. 
17
18  would say that either.  Well, by the way, we're not 
19  adjudicating this, you know.  So if that's your test,

MS. BRENAN:  Well, Your Honor, the thing is

21  to be clear enough for me to be convinced.  Is that a 
22  biased juror? 
23
24  that's what he said to the court.

certainly not it.  Itâ€™s the bias comes from what he was 
saying of his disagreement or -- that he just really did 
not believe with the felony murder rule.  Therefore, 
it's that -- that under any evidence, whatever evidence 
was presented, that he would not be able to convict

6  to your basic theory, because I guess I'm not sure I 
7  understand what you're arguing now. 
 In your brief, you talked about focusing on

18 
19
20
21  the court discusses the alleged error, there is an 
22  adjudication on the merits, but that plays into the 
23  larger and broader rule. 
24
25

it doesn't matter that there were three different 
theories for why the admission of evidence was wrong; 
you should just look at the fact that we're talking 
about the admission of evidence.  Now, is -- is that 
what you're arguing, or are you also saying what the 
states say in their amicus brief, that even if, you 
know, one claim is about the admission of evidence, and 
one claim is about ineffective assistance of counsel, 
you would still apply the same rule? 

 MS. BRENAN:  What we're saying is that, at 
the very least, in our type of situation where -- where

you give them the presumption of regularity in the one 
case you ought to give it to them in the other. 

1  arguing, you know, there is regularity and we do -- it's 
2  fair to assume that a judge who is looking at an 
3  appellate court brief is going to do their job and look 
4  at the briefs. So that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you're not 
5
6  willing to assume that when the judge says "denied." 
7  You're willing to assume that when the judge says:  I've 
8  looked at everything, denied.

17  below made a mistake; it was fairly exhausted.

19  concern about the whole area of litigation that might 
occur.  That won't happen for one reason:  In the habeas 
20
21  context the claim must be fairly presented, period.  If 
22  the Federal constitutional claim is not fairly 
23  presented, you're not in Federal court.  And so there is 
24  already a whole body of law talking about what a claim 
25

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Of course, again this is 
14  fact-specific to the case.  It doesn't address the rule 
that we want to address and was the reason for us taking 
15
16  the case, but 104a, the State court, State appellate 
17  court, cites the United States v. Wood, and -- and it

7  had considered the Federal standard, but didn't adopt 
8  it. 
9
10
11 
12
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not sure how you can 
13  say that.  I mean, I think the simplest statement of the 
14  State rule is that the State believes that if you remove 
15
16  Sixth Amendment.  They said it in Cleveland.  They were 
17  presented with the argument in this case by the briefing 
18  that the juror was not biased and hence the Sixth 
19  Amendment was violated.  And they ruled to say he was 
biased, and I see as a natural, clear inference that 
20
21  they were saying the Sixth Amendment wasn't violated 
22  because he was biased. 
23
24  that determination is that there's the Federal standard 
on what is -- what the Sixth Amendment standard is.  So 
25

a juror for actual bias, that that is okay under the 

 MR. HERMANSEN:  There -- the problem with

 MR. HERMANSEN:  This gets to the -- my 

friend's argument about how their argument is upside 

a biased juror violates -- doesn't violate -- the 

1  under Thomas, Symington and Brown --
2
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's a different 
3  question.  That question is whether the California 
4  Supreme Court's Cleveland decision, its assumption that 
5
6  removal of a biased juror doesn't violate the Sixth 
7  Amendment, is that an unreasonable application of 
8  Supreme Court precedent, not circuit court precedent? 
9
10
11  down.  They are saying that we're trying to incorporate 
12  into 2254(d)(1) what is contrary to and what is the 
13  United States Supreme Court law, but we never get to 
14  (d)(1)'s United States Supreme Court law limitation 
15
16  was the claim adjudicated on the merits?  That's the 
17  threshold question. 
 So if the claim was not adjudicated on the 
18
19  merits you don't get to the United States Supreme Court 
20
21
22  Go ahead. 
 MR. HERMANSEN:  Instead you look at Brown, 
23
24  Thomas, and Symington, and they say that if the juror's 
views on the merits of the case have been expressed and 
25

because, looking at the text of 2254(d), you start with 

law limitation.  Instead --

1  the juror might be kicked off because of -- which is 
2  exactly what happened here -- kicked off because of his 
3  views on the case, then the Sixth Amendment has been 
4  violated. 
5
6  precedent commands that result? 
7
8  doesn't command it, but because it's de novo review and

20
21
22  you've been having with Justice Sotomayor and Justice 
23  Alito highlights another problem with your approach, is 
24  that the court is going to have to decide in every case 
25

Congress said States are going to get deference and they 
are going to get a limitation on the law that the 
Federal courts can look at, the United States Supreme 
Court law.  But for that quid pro quo to happen, for the 
States to get that deference and limitation on the law, 
they have to have adjudicated the claim.  Because 
that's --

2  Circuit got that question right in this case or they got 
3  it wrong, but in every case, or many of the cases, the 
4  claim will be made on the part of the State, well, yes, 
they just said State law, but it's the same as Federal 
5

tell if they adjudicated the claim on the merits.  And 
it appears, every appearance and inference is that they 
overlooked it or didn't adjudicate it.  So that's a rare 
case.  Normally, just looking at the opinion you can 
tell if they adjudicated the Federal claim.

4  greatest respect to the State courts in comity and 
federalism is to look at what the order says, and if

take this opinion at face value, it cuts against you.  I

mean, it's a -- they're applying Cleveland.  Cleveland 
is a constitutional decision.  It's a Federal 
12 
13 
constitutional decision. 
14
California has made it completely clear in other cases 
15
16  post Cleveland that it thinks it's applying the Sixth 
17  Amendment. 
18
19  interpretation of the Sixth Amendment is unclear, but 
it's also completely irrelevant.  It thinks it's 
20
21  applying the Sixth Amendment, and it's reaching a 
22  Constitutional judgment, isn't it? 
23
24  Cleveland -- a careful reading of Cleveland shows that 
the majority does not adopt the Federal standard.  So

rejects the consensus standard, but it's entitled to do

possible juror bias.  And that -- that's still good law. 
That hasn't changed. 

So that's why Justice Werdegar, in her 

concurrence, was saying, we need to be worried about the 
Sixth Amendment.  And the only reason she joined in the 
opinion was it used to be, well, if there's just 
substantial evidence that the juror is not deliberating 
as a juror should, she wasn't satisfied that that was 
sufficient; but, because there had to be a demonstrable 
reality from the record that the juror wasn't 
deliberating, she signed on in Cleveland. 

And in Cleveland, they reversed under 1089. 

And this case should have been reversed under 1089. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- Can we go back a minute, 

please, to 
Justice Kennedy's question about page 104(a). 

I read the court of appeals' opinion.  Most 

of it, about six or eight pages, recites the facts. 
Then they discuss the law.  The legal discussion is on 
page 104(a).  It's approximately 30 lines long.  More 
than half of it concerns Federal law. 

I mean, they don't just cite that Federal 

case.  They say, "In assessing whether a juror is 
impartial for Federal constitutional purposes -- Federal 
constitutional purposes -- the United States Supreme 
Court has said," da, da, da, then they quote it all.

rights to Sixth Amendment right.  It says it over and 

 Now, since your argument, the argument in 
1
2  the -- in this brief here is entirely Sixth Amendment, 
3  as far as I can tell, they say, look, look what happened 
4  here, they took this man off the jury.  That violates my 
5
6  over and over.  I have no doubt you raised it. 
7
 And now they give an answer.  And the answer 
8  that they give consists of 30 lines, and 16 of the lines 
9  consist of Federal law. 
So -- so what's the problem? 
10
 MR. HERMANSEN:  The problem --
11
12
 JUSTICE BREYER:  The remaining 14 lines do 
13  consist of state law too; but, I mean, how can we say 
14  they didn't consider the Federal issue? 
15
16 
17
 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, they didn't quote --
18  Nesler doesn't.  What they did in Nesler is quote a 
19  Federal case.  And what they do here is not just say 
20
21
22  nothing to do with kicking off a holdout juror. 
23
24  Maybe they didn't properly -- maybe they didn't properly 
state what Federal law is.  Everybody has some concerns 
25

 MR. HERMANSEN:  And that Federal case has

that if the juror's views on the merits of the case have

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Which happens to be the 

issue in this case. 

 MR. HERMANSEN:  The issue in this case is 

wrongly. 

 MR. HERMANSEN:  Respectfully, 

1  thing I don't understand is how you're saying -- or 
2  everybody -- I must be wrong, because everybody seems to 
3  be saying it -- that they didn't reach the Federal issue 
4  when they spent 14 lines discussing it, rightly or 
5
6
7  Justice Breyer, they don't -- they're just talking about 
8  a definition of one word, of what actual bias is. 
9
10
11
12  can you kick off a juror who has expressed 10 or 15 
13  times -- and this came out right out of the bat -- the 
14  foreperson was called out, asked about some notes and 
15
16  think there's sufficient evidence.  So that's different 
17  from whether we look at Federal law to -- for the 
18  definition of actual bias. 
19
20
21  only talking about what the definition of actual bias 
22  is, that the actual Sixth Amendment claim -- and even 
23  the trial attorney was arguing in Symington, Your Honor, 
24  please don't question these jurors.  The foreperson, 
right out of the box said that Juror No. 6, 10 or 15

 My -- I think it's a reasonable position to 
say that you can't infer from this discussion of Nesler, 

said, Juror No. 6, 10 or 15 times has said, I don't

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  Now, what the court 


So this court of appeals thinks the issue is 

whether he had shown sufficient bias.  You think the 
answer to that is clearly no.  The Government thinks 
it's yes.  And I can understand the differences of 
opinion, but I'm back to my question. 

1  times, has already said that he thinks there isn't 

2  sufficient evidence. 

3
4  says about that argument, what the court of appeals 

says, is that the argument of your client not only 
5
6  misstates the evidence -- that's their -- not you, but 
7  they're criticizing -- and then he says, "It ignores the 
8  trial court's explanation that it was discharging Juror 
9  No. 6 because he had shown himself to be biased."

I've listened to the answer.  Do you want to add 
anything? 

it's clear that the California Court of Appeals is 

It seems to me in 14 lines they do address 

the Federal constitutional question of bias.  And 
that's -- that's -- maybe it wasn't the right issue, 
et cetera, but -- or maybe they didn't decide it 
correctly. 

But you see what's bothering me.  And so

 MR. HERMANSEN:  No.  If there is good 

cause --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, answer my question. 

1  dealing with 1089.  They are not dealing with the 
2  Federal standard that we're grappling with here, which 
3  is if a juror's views on the merits of a case have been 
4  expressed, can you then interrogate all the jurors --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is this -- is this a 
5
6  holding that the Sixth Amendment requires you to keep a 
7  biased juror as long as the juror says, I have doubts 
8  about the sufficiency of the evidence? 
9
10
11
12  Does the Sixth Amendment require you to keep a biased 
13  juror? 
14
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21
22  minute we'll get into the issue that wasn't certified, 
23  but what happened in this case was the judge -- the 
24  Ninth Circuit found that the finding of bias wasn't good 
25

Sixth Amendment doesn't require you to keep a biased 
juror, then why is it that the state court's finding 
that this juror was biased a Sixth Amendment holding, 
that it wasn't violated because the juror was biased? 
The logic is almost inescapable to me. 

 MR. HERMANSEN:  No. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So, if the 

cause under the Federal standard because the --

 MR. HERMANSEN:  Yeah, right.  So for a

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Did the California court

And so that doesn't show bias when 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That was one of the things. 

1
2  find the juror was biased? 
3
4  applying too high of a standard because he said very 
convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, and there was a 
5
6  quibble about what does the word very add to beyond a 
7  reasonable doubt.  And the jury very eloquently 
8  responded that very convinced beyond a reasonable doubt 
9  is the same as convinced beyond a reasonable doubt. 
10
11 
12
13  Then they go through in those four pages about six 
14  other -- they called -- he gave one story to the judge, 
15
16
17  jurors, and they come up with quite a different story 
18  about what he was telling them in the jury room and --
19  that I'm not going to convict him.  Well, he didn't 
quite say that; he was talking about Vietnam and talking 
20
21  about the slaves, and you don't want to convict a person 
22  for -- make him return the slave. 
 I mean, they talked about a lot of things. 
23

25

biased.  And your point was he wasn't biased.  He was 

 Then the prosecution calls about eight other

 But -- and how do we know that there --

there's a possibility that he's being kicked off because 

says, Juror No. 6, 10 or 15 times has said he doesn't 

1  going to decide it fairly. 
 Okay, I'm listening. 
2
 MR. HERMANSEN:  But the threshold issue is 
3
4  when the foreperson, at the very, very, very beginning, 
5
6  think there is sufficient evidence, all questioning 
7  should have stopped at that point, because there was no 
8  indication of bias. 
9
10
11  of his views on the merits of the case?  We know that 
12  because the prosecutor filed a motion saying, let's 
13  reopen questioning.  And that -- then the judge said, 
14  okay, yeah, let's reopen questioning. 
15

18 
19 
20
21 
22 
23
24  case, it's just a -- an LWOP case. 
25

But the foreman had already said, I think 
your response to the jury note has satisfied that; I 
think it will be fine.  Yet, the prosecutor filed a 
motion to reopen because the prosecutor knew that this 
juror had reasonable doubts. 

And so that's why there's clear evidence in 
this case that the motion to dismiss the juror was based 
on the juror's views on the merits of the case. 

 And -- and, also, this is not a capital

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANIE BRENAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
 Ms. Brenan, you have four minutes remaining. 

1  you. 
2
3
4
5
 MS. BRENAN:  Thank you. 
6
 I would just like to make about four points. 
7
 First, my friend discussed the case of Smith 
8
9  v. Digmon.  And I think I would like to point this Court 
to the words that were used in Smith v. Digmon, which is 
10
11 
where the state court chooses to ignore in its opinion. 
And as this Court later said in Castille talking about 
12 
13 
that, that's an implicit rejection. 
14
is, if a state court fails to mention in its opinion 
15
16  writing, it's implicitly rejected, not that it's been 
17  ignored. 
18
19  California believes that 1089 is Constitutional under 
20
21  Miller v. Stagner said that it was facially 
22  constitutional. 
23
24  Justice Sotomayor that here, where the trial court made 
the finding of bias, that answered the Sixth Amendment 
25

the Sixth Amendment.  And, in fact, the Ninth Circuit in 

 Third, I would just like to agree with 

44
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 So, really, the way it should be interpreted 

 Secondly, I'd just like to agree that, yes, 

Official 

 Secondly, as to that point, I would just 

sufficiency of the evidence.  Those were the 

 The entire argument below and throughout was 

1  question. 
2
3  a disagreement as to whether the juror was biased, or 
4  was he just having -- harboring doubts about the 
5
6  counter-arguments. 
7
 The trial court, by making the determination 
8  that there was bias, necessarily answered that question. 
9
like to also point this Court to the language in People 
10
11  v. Cleveland that talks about agreeing with Thomas, and 
12  Brown, and Symington that you cannot dismiss a juror 
13  based on his views of the evidence.  And that's at 21 
14  P.3d at page -- 1236. 
15
16 
17 
18
19  Mr. Chief Justice is correct that this would increase 
the litigation.  We would have courts, Federal habeas 
20
21  courts all the time trying to decide whether there was a 
22  sufficient indication or not by deciding whether state 
23  law is coterminous with Federal law. 
24
25

So it couldn't have -- in order to have good 
cause in California, you couldn't have gotten rid of him 
for his views of the evidence. 

 Finally, I'd just like to say that 

 As we've already seen in California, 

following the issuance of this decision that's exactly
