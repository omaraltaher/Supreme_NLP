ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

             

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

please the Court: 

 

 

              

A smartphone is smart because it contains 

 

 

 

 

 

hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work.  But the Federal Circuit held that Section 289 of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Patent Act entitles the holder of a single design 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent on a portion of the appearance of the phone to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

total profit on the entire phone. 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

That result makes no sense.  A single design 

    

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

patent on the portion of the appearance of a phone 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should not entitle the design-patent holder to all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

profit on the entire phone. 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

Section 289 does not require that result, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

and as this case comes to the Court on the briefing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Apple and the government now agree that Section 289 does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not require that result.  We respectfully ask that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court hold that when a design patent claims a design 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

4 

that is applied to a component of a phone or a component 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

of a product, or, to use the language of Section 289, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when a design patent is applied to an article of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacture within a multi-article product, we request 

   

 

 

 

 

that you hold that Section 289 entitles the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent-holder to total profit on the article of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacture to which the design patent is applied, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not the profits on the total product.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The problem is, is how to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

instruct the jury on that point.  Both parties, not the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government, both parties kind of leave it up and say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

oh, give it to the juror.  If I were the juror, I simply 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't know what to do under your -- under your test. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

My preference, if -- if I were just making 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

another sensible rule, is we'd have market studies to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see how the -- the extent to which the design affected 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the consumer, and then the jury would have something to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do that.  But that's apportionment, which runs headlong 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

into the statute. 

 

 

20 

            

You can't really have apportionment, so it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

seems to me you leave us with no -- one choice is to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a de minimis exception, like the cup-holder example 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's in the car -- maybe the boat windshield, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a little more difficult -- and just follow the -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just follow the words of the statute.  But it seems to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

5 

1 

 

 

me neither side gives us an instruction to work with. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

3 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  One -- I mean, it's one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

thing to leave it to the jury.  It's the other thing --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if I were the juror, I wouldn't know what to do under 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

your brief. 

 

7 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, we do not propose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

a test that simply leaves it to the jury without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidance.  The instruction we proposed and that was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rejected by the district court appears in the blue brief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at page 21, and what we would have told the jury is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the article of manufacture to which a design has been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied is the part or portion of the product as sold 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that incorporates or embodies the subject matter of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

patent. 

16 

            

17 

simple. 

18 

            

So, Justice Kennedy, our test is very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If I'm the juror, I just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

don't know what to do.  I'd have the iPhone in the jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

room; I'd -- I'd look at it.  I just wouldn't know. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, what we 

  

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

respectfully suggest is that there are two parts to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test for what constitutes an article of manufacture. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And to be clear, I'm now stressing our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article-of-manufacture argument, not the causation 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

6 

1 

argument we gave as an alternative. 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

As the case comes to the Court, all we ask 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

is that you rule in favor of us on article of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

manufacture. 

5 

            

And, Justice Kennedy, the statute tells us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

what to look at --

 

 

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could I really quickly make 

   

  

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

sure I understand that, that in other words, you're --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're saying we should only look to what an article of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacture is and not your other argument that there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be apportionment as to any particular article of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

manufacture. 

13 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  That is correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

We're pressing here, as you all you need to resolve the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, that a jury should be instructed that total profit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must be profit derived from the article of manufacture 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to which the design has been applied. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

And, Your Honor, the statute does support 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

our test because the statute asks us to look at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article of manufacture to which the design has been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

applied. 

22 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And what is that in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

this -- in this case? 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, in this case it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

is -- there are three patents.  The D'677 is on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

7 

1 

2 

front face of a phone.  The rectangular, round-cornered 

   

  

 

 

 

 

front face of a phone. 

   

 

 

3 

            

 

In the D'087, it's also the rectangular, 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

round-cornered front face of the phone with certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspect ratio and corner radii. 

 

 

 

 

            

In the D'305, it is the display screen on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the graphical user interface appears. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So, to answer Justice Kennedy's question, 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury should have been instructed either with our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction:  Instruction 42.1 would have said to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury, I'm giving you guidance.  There's an article of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacture here, but it may be less than the entire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phone.  The article of manufacture may be a part or 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

portion of the phone, and you should look at two things, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

Your Honor. 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

            

You should look at the patent, and, Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kennedy, with respect -- you shouldn't just look at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- at the phones in the jury room.  You ought to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at the patent because, Justice Ginsburg, the patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is going to be the best guide to what the design is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied to in many, many cases, as in this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Ms. Sullivan, you seem 

  

 

 

 

 

to be arguing, as when you opened, that as a matter of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law, you were right.  And I don't see that as a matter 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

of law. 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

8 

              

I believe that your basic argument, everyone 

 

 

 

 

 

is in agreement, that the test is an article of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacture for purposes of sale. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

But I am like Justice Kennedy, which is, how 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

do we announce the right test for that?  Because the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phone could be seen by a public -- a purchasing consumer 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

as being just that rounded edge, slim outer shell.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might be what drives the sale.  I don't know. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

Certainly your expert didn't tell me how to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

figure out the component part.  I don't know where in 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the record you would have enough to survive your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

argument. 

13 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  So, Your Honor, let me back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

up and restate the test, the burden, and the evidence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

The -- the test -- and I want to agree with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

Your Honor.  To be clear, we say that what the Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit held was wrong as a matter of law.  It is wrong 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a matter of law to hold that the entire product is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily the article of manufacture from which you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

measure total profit.  That's wrong as a matter of law, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but we did not argue, Your Honor, that the test has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hold we're right on the article as a matter of law. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

It's an -- it's a -- it's a question of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

either fact or, as you said in Markman, a mongrel 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of law and fact. 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

9 

1 

            

And why does it involve both?  Because we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

know that district courts look at patents.  You assign 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them that task in Markman, and we perform it daily.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when they look at a patent for a claim construction, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

we're asking for part of the test to be very similar. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

The district court can look at the patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

and say, oh, this is Apple's front face patent.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't one of Apple's 13 other patents on other parts of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the phone, or Apple's other patent on the design of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entire case.  This is the front face patent. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then how do -- how would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

you determine the profit attributable to the relevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article of manufacture? 

 

 

14 

            

15 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Three ways, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

First, through ordinary accounting that 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

would look to the cost of goods sold in relation to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revenues for the relevant component. 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

You could look, if -- if a company buys the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

component from an original equipment manufacturer, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would look to their profit margins and apply that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

If, as sometimes happens within a company, 

   

 

 

 

 

22 

23

out the transfer pricing between the divisions.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So we find out the -- the

production cost if -- if a billion dollars were spent on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the inner parts and a hundred million was spent on the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

face, then it's a 10:1 ratio. 

   

 

 

 

4 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  That's absolutely right, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

Honor.  Apple didn't --

  

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you'd have expert 

  

 

 

 

 

7 

testimony on all of that. 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Yes, Your Honor, you would. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

And you would -- but that's just one way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose -- suppose you had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

a case where it's a stroke of genius, the design.  In --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in two days, they come up with a design -- let's --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's assume the Volkswagen Beetle analogy that some of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the briefs refer to.  Suppose the Volkswagen Beetle 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

design was done in three days, and it was a stroke of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

genius and it identified the car.  Then it seems to me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that's quite unfair to say, well, we give three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

days' profit, but then it took 100,000 hours to develop 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

the motor. 

 

20 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Well, Your Honor, here's what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

we would do with the Beetle. 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, that's what -- it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

23 

seems to me that that's what you would be arguing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  It's not, Your Honor.  To 

  

  

 

 

 

 

25 

answer Justice Ginsburg's question, there are three ways

Apple could have but did not even attempt to prove the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

total profit from the relevant article of manufactures 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, the front face, or the display screen.  One could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been accounting.  One could have been consumer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

demand evidence, Justice Kennedy, as you suggested. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Apple could have said well, people really like the front 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

face disproportionately to all the other parts of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phone, so they could have used consumer survey evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to prove that.  But -- and so accounting evidence or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indirect evidence through consumer survey.  But, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor, as to the Beetle, we concede that the total 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

profit from the article of manufacture may sometimes be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a substantial part of the total profit on the product. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

Let's take the Beetle, or let's take a cool, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

shark-shaped exterior body on a car like the Corvette. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

It may be that the article of manufacture to which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

design patent is applied is just the exterior body of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the car, but it may be that nobody really wants to pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much for the innards of the Corvette or the Beetle. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They want to pay for the cool way it looks. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

If that's so, it should be open to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

patent-holder to prove that the bulk of the profits come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the exterior of the car. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Is there any difference in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

practical terms between that and your causation argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

or apportionment? 

 

2 

            

3 

            

4 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Yes, Justice Alito. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  What is the difference? 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. SULLIVAN:  The difference is we concede 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

under article of manufacture that the holder of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent gets profit from the article, even if the profit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not come entirely from the design. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

Let me give you an example with a phone's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18

20 

front face.  Consumers may value the front face because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's scratch-resistant, because it's water-resistant, 

 

 

 

 

because it's shatterproof.  We're going to give the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent-holder under our article-of-manufacture test all 

 

 

 

 

 

the profits for the front face, even if it includes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

profit from those non-design features of the front face, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the pure apportionment test or pure causation test 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would limit the profits to the profits from the design 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parts rather than the functional parts.  So, Your Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's a little bit overinclusive.  We're getting a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

little more with article of manufacture than we do with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a pure causation test, and plaintiffs should be happy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

for that. 

 

22 

            

But the reason we think it's consistent with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

Congress's purpose, Your Honor, is that what Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was trying to do was provide a rule that gives 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

design-patent holders total profit from the article of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

13 

1 

manufacture. 

2 

            

That's a little bit overinclusive, because 

   

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

if you get total profit on the rugs that were at issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Dobson cases, you'll get a little profit from the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

design, and there will be a little extra you're getting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps from the fiber or the weave.  We think Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was entitled to exercise its fact-finding power to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it is appropriate as a matter of causation to say 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that design causes value in a single article product 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

like a rug. 

   

11 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, I look at this 

   

  

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

record, and they were claiming the profits on the whole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phone.  If you read the Federal Circuit's decision, they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were saying people buy -- bought this product mostly --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this was their argument to the jury and it sold the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Circuit -- because of the look of this phone, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, you know, all smartphones basically function the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same.  People don't really put much value on the unit. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This is what they were arguing, and they put on an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert that gave total profits.  If the jury credited 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them, could you -- and you were properly -- it was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

properly instructed jury, could you overturn that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

finding? 

24 

25 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, let's go back to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the proper instruction.  The jury was not properly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

14 

1 

instructed here. 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I accept that, 

    

 

 

3 

Miss Sullivan.  I'm asking you --

  

 

 

 

 

4 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Two answers, Your Honor.  If 

  

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

the article of manufacture was the entire ornamental 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appearance of the phone and Apple does have a patent on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the entire outside of the phone, why didn't they assert 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it here?  Because the entire outside of a Samsung phone 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not look substantially similar to the entire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside of a Samsung phone.  The reason why design 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

patencies carve the product up into multiple partial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

design claims is so they can make a narrow infringement 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument and find a little sliver of the phone on which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement can be found, and it's inappropriate to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give total profit when they do that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

So, Your Honor, if there had been a design 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

patent on the entire case, then, yes, absolutely, Apple 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could have tried to get total profit on the entire case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And you're answering 

  

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

"no" to my question.  You're saying a properly 

   

  

 

 

 

 

instructed jury on the evidence presented in this case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could not have found for Apple.  Is that what --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  That is correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

That is very much our position. 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So besides the jury 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

15 

1 

instruction, what was the legal error? 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  The legal error was in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

jury instruction --

 

 

4 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I said besides a 

    

 

 

 

5 

6 

properly instructed jury, could they have found in favor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Apple on the evidence presented? 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

8 

because --

 

9 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  They could not, Your Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so what, besides the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

jury instruction -- 'cause I'm assuming that a proper 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction was given -- what would have been the legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

error? 

13 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  There would have been -- no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

reasonable jury could have found on this record that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entire product was the article of manufacture to which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the design has been applied.  Two reasons. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

One, design patents cover ornamental 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

appearance.  They cannot, by definition, cover the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

innards of the phone.  So the functional innards of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phone cannot be part of what is claimed by the design 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

patent. 

22 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, you can't claim 

  

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

the design patent for a Volkswagen doesn't cover the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

innards, but you just admitted that a jury could find 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its -- could find that the consumers and others would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

16 

1 

perceive the Volkswagen to be a Volkswagen by its looks 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

only. 

3 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, we're talking 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

about design patents, not trademark or copyright. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's no requirement of consumer confusion here on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

the --

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't disagree with 

    

 

 

 

you, but --

 

 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, let me answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

your question as precisely as I can.  Just because you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can show that most of the profit comes from the Beetle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exterior does not mean the car is the article of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacture.  There's two steps here in our test. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

First, determine what is the article of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

manufacture. 

16 

            

Then second step, determine the quantum of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

damages, quantum of profits in this case, from that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

article. 

19 

            

Under your hypo, what -- if Apple got almost 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

all its profits from the exterior case, people were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indifferent to whether they could read their e-mail, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

navigate, take photos, or any other functions.  If you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could prove that it's a counterfactual that couldn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

happen, but if you could prove that, as in the Corvette 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or the Beetle hypo, then the total profit from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

17 

article of manufacture could be a substantial portion of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the total product and the profit.  That's not this case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did Samsung, at the 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

trial, propose basing damages on profits from an article 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less than the whole phone? 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Six times, Your Honor.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

we were rebuffed every time.  At the -- in the jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction -- sorry.  At the -- before the trial began, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we submitted a legal brief.  It's Docket 1322.  We said 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

very clearly article of manufacture is less than the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

total phone and profit should be limited to the profit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the article.  We said again in the jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions -- and here I would refer you respectfully 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to joint Appendix 206, 207 and to the result of that on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petition Appendix 165A.  What happened is we went to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court and we said please listen to us about article of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacture, if you only get the total profit on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article.  The district court said, no, I already said no 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

apportionment back in the Daubert.  Because I said no 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

apportionment, she shut us out of both theories.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court shut us out of article of manufacture as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the basis for total profit, and it shut us out of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causation or apportionment, which we don't press here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

So that's twice.  Our legal brief, our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

charge conference.  And then again in our 50A and the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

18 

key rulings on 50A at the close of evidence, we again 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said article is separate from apportionment, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article here is less than the phone.  At 197 we said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at -- sorry.  At JA197 we again said article is less 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than the phone.  And in the 50B at the close of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first trial, we again said article is less than the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

phone. 

8 

            

Second trial happens on certain phones. 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Again, in the 50A and the 50B, the trial court says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again, I have ruled that there's no apportionment for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

design patents.  You cannot talk to me about article of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacture.  We tried over and over and over again to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get the article of manufacture's theory embraced, and we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were rejected.  And why does that matter, Your Honor? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because there was evidence in the case from which a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable, properly instructed jury could have found 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the components were the front face, the front face, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the display screen.  And the evidence came out of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Apple's own witnesses, which we're certainly entitled to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rely on.  Your Honor, Apple's own witnesses again and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again said what are you claiming.  And when the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses got on to talk about infringement, they didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say the whole phone, the look and feel.  They said we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claiming a very specific front face, and by the way, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ignore the home button.  We're claiming a very specific 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

19 

front face and surrounding bezel, and by the way, ignore 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything that's outside the dotted lines. 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

And if I could just remind you that we've 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

reprinted the patents for you to see, and they may look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like an iPhone on page 7, which is the D'677.  They may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look like an iPhone in the D'087, which was in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Blueberry, set 8, but the claim is not for the iPhone. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The claim is for the small portion of the external 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appearance of the phone that is inside the solid line. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Apple disclaimed everything outside the solid line.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclaimed portions of the front face with dotted lines. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

And Your Honor, the question for the jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

was not did people think that the look and feel of an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

iPhone was great.  The question for the jury was did the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very small portion of a smartphone that Samsung makes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

look substantially similar to the very small portion of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the patent claim? 

 

 

18 

            

Now that, Your Honor, there is no basis in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

this record for a conclusion that the entire product, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

profit on the phone, corresponds to the entire profit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from those articles.  What Apple should have done is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done either of the two things we discussed earlier, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accounting evidence about revenues minus cost of goods 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sold on the components, or it should have done consumer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

survey evidence like our expert did.

proposed a test with four factors to determine the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

article question.  Do you agree with those?  Are there 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

others you would add?

briefly, and then I'd like to reserve my time.

We propose a briefer test that we think is more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrable.  We propose that you look to two factors: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The design in the patent and the accused product.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think our test is more administrable, and it can often 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be done, Justice Kennedy, by judges as they do in

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This case presents two related questions 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

21 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

about the scope of the remedy that's available for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

design-patent infringement under Section 289.  If I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

understood my friend Ms. Sullivan's presentation 

 

 

 

 

 

correctly, the parties are now in agreement about both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of those legal questions. 

 

 

 

6 

            

Just to summarize briefly, first, the court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

of appeals correctly held that Section 289's provision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for an award of total profits means that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent-holder can recover all of the profits from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sale of the infringing articles and manufacture and not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just the portion of the profits that the patent-holder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can prove was caused by or attributable to the design as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposed to other features of the article. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

But second, we read the court of appeals' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

opinion to have held that the relevant article of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacture for which profits are owed is always the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entire product that the infringer sells to customers. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And we think that's a mistake, and we understand all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties to agree with that now. 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

Instead, the relevant article of manufacture 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

to which a patented design may be applied will sometimes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a part or a component of a larger product sold in 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

commerce.  And when that is the case, all parties now 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree that the patent-holder is entitled only to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

profits from that infringing article and not to all --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When the -- when the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

component -- when the article of manufacture isn't sold 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apart from the entire product, how should the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge charge the jury on determining the profit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attributable to the infringing article? 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  So we think that there'd be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

two factual questions in a case where that's disputed. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

The first one would be what is the relevant article, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there may be a dispute on that as there is in this case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

The second question, once the fact-finder 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

identifies the relevant article, is the question that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you asked, which is how much of the total profits from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the device are attributable to the infringing article? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the first step, 

  

 

 

 

 

and how do you figure it out? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May he -- may he complete 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

his answer to my question? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  So Justice Ginsburg, on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

second step, we urge the Court not to speak to that in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot of detail because it hasn't been briefed in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  This case sort of stopped at the first step.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we think that courts could sensibly look to the way that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts have handled other analogous questions, and I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point to two areas of law where that's happened. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The first is utility patent damages under

22 

the Patent Act, before 1946, permitted an award of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringer's profits.  And in those cases, very often a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent would apply to part of a larger product sold in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commerce, and the fact-finder would say you're entitled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the profits that are attributable to the infringing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part, but not the whole machine. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  This is Justice -- Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg's question.  Is that -- is your answer to her, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adequately summarized, the test that you propose at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 9 of your brief relevant considerations include? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  So I think the test we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

propose at page 9 goes to the first of the two questions 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that I was speaking to, which is what's the article of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacture to which the design has been applied?  Once 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fact-finder makes that judgment, that's the test 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we proposed, and that's, I think, I took to be 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor's question. 

 

 

              

I understood Justice Ginsburg to be asking 

 

 

 

 

 

once the fact-finder decides that the relevant article 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, say, the windshield on the boat or the cup-holder on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the car, how do they separate out the part of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

profits that are attributable to that component from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

whole. 

24 

25 

            

 

 

And as to that question, we haven't briefed 

 

 

 

 

 

it in a lot of detail, but I was trying to explain to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

24

2

Justice Ginsburg that there are analogous problems that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts have confronted in other areas of law.  One was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

utility patent damages, as I described.  Another one is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

discussed at some length in this Court's decision in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sheldon case under the Copyright Act.  That was a case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the copyright was on a script --

   

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would expert witnesses be 

  

 

 

 

 

8 

called on in order to show part one or part two or both? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

10 

both. 

11 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I -- I would think very often 

    

   

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And what would those 

  

 

 

 

 

12 

expert witnesses -- who would they be?  What would they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

say? 

14 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  So I think it will depend 

   

  

 

 

 

 

15 

on -- on the circumstances of the case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

17 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In this case. 

  

 

 

 

MR. FLETCHER:  In this case, I think someone 

   

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

familiar with the industry, someone who had worked in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the industry, either at -- a manufacture of a smartphone 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

company, or someone who is familiar with the market for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

smartphones and who could speak to on the first question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how smartphones are put together, how they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufactured, how they're used by the users, the extent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to which the components of a smartphone are separable. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

And then on the second question, the one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

25 

that Justice Ginsburg was asking, I think they would --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the experts would probably be speaking -- or could be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speaking to some of the issues that Your Honor raised in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your question in the Sullivan, which is things like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consumer surveys, to what extent do the various 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

components of a smartphone drive consumer demand and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

contribute to the value of the phone.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, one of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

things that was mentioned was cost in terms of that.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't understand how that helps on this question.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would seem to me the higher the cost, the less it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contributed to profits. 

 

 

13 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  So I think, Mr. Chief 

   

  

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

Justice, it will depend on the case.  Sometimes you --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you might try to build up the share of the profits from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the bottom up by saying, what's the cost of each of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these components, and then what share of the revenue is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attributable to each of these components.  And then you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say this component is 10 percent of the cost and 20 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent of the revenue, and we -- we do a bottom-up 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calculation and try to do it that way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

Courts haven't always done that.  Sometimes 

  

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

that won't be feasible.  Sometimes instead they've --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they've done a more impressionistic approximation and 

   

 

 

 

 

said the total profits on this product are $10 million, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

26 

1 

2 

and we think that the component at issue here, based on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert testimony, is responsible for a quarter or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

3 

25 percent. 

 

4 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you said based 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

on expert testimony.  What would -- what would they be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

talking about? 

 

7 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  So I think the -- the Sheldon 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

case that's cited on page 27 of our brief from this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court that was a Copyright Act case but discussed these 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problems sort of generally discussed how you apportion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the portion -- the profits from a movie that are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attributable to the script as opposed to the actors or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the directors or other things.  And they had experts who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were familiar with the industry and who said the script 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is important but, really, a lot of the value and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly for a movie like this comes from other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

things. 

18 

            

And there were various expert testimonies 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

that gave varying percentages, and the Court ended up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying that the court below had awarded 20 percent of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the total profits from the movie, and this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirmed that award and said that's a reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

23 

approximation. 

24 

            

We're not -- never going to be able to get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

to certainty, but on these sorts of profits questions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

27 

and these sorts of remedies questions, a reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

approximation is good enough, and it's certainly better 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than awarding all or nothing.  And courts have been able 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to come to those reasonable approximations by using 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert testimony in some of the ways that we've

discussed.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Fletcher, could you 

  

 

 

 

 

speak about this VW Bug example, because as -- as I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand Ms. Sullivan's answer, she said, well, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinctive appearance, that distinctive shape, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

just -- it's still -- the article is only the body of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the car.  And -- and you say, no, there's a real 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question as to whether it is being -- the design is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being applied to the car itself. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So how would you go about thinking about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that question, or how is a fact-finder supposed to, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under what instructions? 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  So we think the basic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question for the fact-finders, what's the article of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacture to which the design has been applied.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think the fact-finder should bear in mind this Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

observation in Gorham.  It's 1871, first design patent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case that the -- what a design is, is it's the thing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that gives the distinctive appearance to an article of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

manufacture.

And the point we're making with the VW Bug 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

example is that in some cases, that's going to be very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

easy.  If the patented design is for a refrigerator 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

latch, no one is going to think that the latch gives the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinctive appearance to the entire refrigerator. 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right.  But let's talk about 

  

  

 

 

 

 

7 

the hard cases. 

 

 

8 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Right.  So the hard cases, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

like the Bug, one can reasonably say that it's either 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the body or the car.  Then we've given the Court four 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors, and we think the fact-finder or a jury, if the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury is the fact-finder, ought to be instructed on those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors.  And so we say you should compare the scope of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the patented design as shown in the drawings in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent, how prominently that design features in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accused article, whether there are other conceptually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinct innovations or components in the article that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are not part of or associated with the patented design, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and finally the physical relationship between the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patented design and the rest of the article. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If you were a juror, how 

   

  

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

would you decide the Beetle case, or what experts would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you want to hear? 

 

 

 

24 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I would want to hear as -- as 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

to the article, what's the article --

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

29 

1 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Shouldn't have given you 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

that second option. 

 

 

3 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I -- I do think it's a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

factual question.  I do think you'd want to hear from 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experts who can speak to the question of how is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Beetle put together, and what other parts of the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

Beetle --

 

8 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How is the Beetle 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

put together?  It's put together like every other car. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I mean, I don't see how that's going to tell you whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the shape of the body is distinctive or not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Well, I think you'd also want 

   

  

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

to know, to put it in terms of all four factors, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the scope of the claim design covers the whole article, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but not the interior of the car.  There are design 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

features in the interior that the driver sees that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aren't the body of the article. 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

As to the second factor, how prominent is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

the design feature, I think that's one that cuts in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favor of finding that the design does cover the whole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

article. 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Then the third one is conceptually distinct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

innovations, and I think that one cuts the other way. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There are going to be lots of other features of the car 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or innovations in the car -- the engine, the steering 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

2 

system, things like that -- that's an area where you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might want to hear adverse testimony. 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's the first 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

part of the test. 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the article of 

  

 

 

 

 

7 

manufacture. 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

            

So now take the second part of the test and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply it to the Bug. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  So supposing that we've 

  

 

 

 

 

decided that the Bug -- the relevant article in the Bug 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is just the body of the Bug. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly. 

  

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Then I think the question is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the best way to determine that, at least that I can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think of right now, would be consumer surveys addressed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to, to what extent are people who buy Bugs making their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchasing decisions based on the look of the car, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to what extent are they instead valuing other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

like --

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you think that that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question is not relevant to the first question.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other words, suppose I think that people who buy VW Bugs 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

buy them because of the look of the car. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

31 

1 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you think that that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

only relevant at question 2 rather than at question 1, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is the question of whether it's the body or the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole car that the design is being applied to? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I do.  I think that's the 

    

    

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

statute -- the way the statute reads.  It says you get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

profits from the article of manufacture.  And so, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

logically, I think the way to approach it would be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identify the article and then let the patent-holder make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the argument that even though the article may be just a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of the product sold -- and here, maybe it's just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case of the front face -- really, that's what sells 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  And so that that test still lets the patent-holder, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a case where it is the design of the article that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

selling the whole product, still recover a very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

substantial portion of the profits --

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

18 

            

19 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But this hypothetical is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FLETCHER:  -- in a different way. 

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  This hypothetical is not 

  

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

helpful to me, because I can't get over the thought that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way it looks.  What if it, you know, costs, I think, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$1800 when it was first sold in the United States?  What 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if it cost $18,000?  What if it got 2 miles per gallon? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What if it broke down every 50 miles? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

32 

1 

            

So if that is a real question, if it is a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

real question whether the article of manufacture there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the design or the entire car, gives me pause about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the test for determining what is the article of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

manufacture. 

6 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Well, I think that those 

   

  

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

things can be taken into account at the second step of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the test, if you decide that the relevant design -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant article of manufacture is the body of the car, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but for all of the reasons you just pointed out. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  But what if you -- you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

were saying it's an open -- it would be a difficult 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question.  You'd have to apply numerous factors to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine what is the article of manufacture there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Well, I -- then I think if 

   

   

  

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

you're skeptical about that, I think our test for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

article of manufacture also lets some of those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considerations play into that test, because it gets to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether there are other conceptually distinct invasions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or other components of the product unrelated to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

design.

4 

5 

6 

7 

8

10 

11 

initiated by Justice Kennedy about what should the jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be instructed under what we and the government believe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be the relevant question -- that is, the factual test 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of whether the relevant article of manufacture is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article as sold or a distinct component of it -- and I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it's very clear to address the questions that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor asked, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ms. Sullivan's response to what actually happened in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

this case. 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

There is no -- whatever you determine the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right instruction should be, there is no basis to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overturn the jury's damages verdict in this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There were two trials below.  In neither 

  

 

 

 

 

 

trial did Samsung, either in argument, statement, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witness testimony, ever identify for the jury any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article of manufacture other than the phones themselves. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In both trials, Samsung's expert witness, Mr. Wagner, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calculated total profits under 289 only on the phones 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves.  And thus there is no -- no reasonable juror 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in these trials could possibly have awarded total 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

profits on anything other than the phones, unless this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court holds --

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

34 

1 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that because the 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

district judge limited them? 

 

 

 

3 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Absolutely not.  What happened 

  

  

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

was, we put in our initial papers saying -- there's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretrial statement that the parties have to file saying, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these are -- the phones are the -- the phones were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringed.  The phones are the things that were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringed for purposes of sale, and here is what our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence is on total profits from the phone. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So disagreement on this 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

point.  So why, if -- we have a hard-enough question 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to figure out what the standard is.  Now, why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't we just ask the lower courts to listen to your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments and theirs, and work it out? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Breyer, this is not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

difficult -- the record in this case is not difficult. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You don't think it's 

  

 

 

 

 

18 

difficult, but they think --

 

 

 

 

19 

            

20 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- they think it's 

  

 

 

 

 

21 

difficult.  In fact, they think it's easy on their side. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

So if I go through and come to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

conclusion, at least, that each side has a good 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument, under those circumstances, why don't we focus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the question that is of great importance across 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

35 

industries and leave the application of that and whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was properly raised to the lower courts? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Breyer, if this were

difficult, it would be entirely appropriate for this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court simply to announce what the law is, which I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is a great need for this Court to do.  And we're 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not suggesting that it wouldn't -- that it isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary for the Court to do it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This is a case very much like global tech, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you found that the lower court had applied the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong standard for intentional infringement, and then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found that the record -- even -- but under the correct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

higher standard, the record admitted no other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion.  What's so easy about this case is that they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never identified to the jury, in either case, any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article of manufacture other than the phone.  And all of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their evidence, Justice Breyer, was calculated based on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the total profits to the phone. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I get your point.  I'll 

    

  

 

 

 

read it and I'll --

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Thank you. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But I have a question on 

   

   

  

 

 

the general issue, which I think is tough.  And the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

general question that I have is I have been looking for 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a standard.  Now, one of the standards -- which are all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

36 

quite close; the parties actually in the government are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fairly close on this -- but is in a brief for the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Internet Association, the software industry.  And you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

know that brief I'm talking about on Facebook and some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

others. 

6 

            

7 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  I do. 

    

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  What they did is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

they went back into history.  They have a lot of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different cases which they base the standard on, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they come to the conclusion, which is a little vague, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but that the design where it's been applied to only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part -- it's on page 23 -- of a multicomponent product 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and does not drive demand for the entire product, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article of manufacture is rightly considered to be only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the component to which the design applies.  And only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

profit attributable to that component may be awarded. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

Now, really, to understand it, you have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

have examples -- but antitrust cases are hard to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand -- and our rule of reason and people do use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples.  And so that kind of standard, with perhaps 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples to explain it to the jury, you know, wallpaper, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you get the whole thing.  A Rolls Royce thing on the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hood?  No, no, no.  You don't get all the profit from 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

the car. 

 

25 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Justice --

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

37 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Now, why not? 

  

  

 

 

 

MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.  I -- I understand your 

    

   

  

 

 

1 

            

2 

            

3 

4 

question, and I just want to bookmark the fact that I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have not yet had a chance to answer Justice Ginsburg's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

question. 

6 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh.  Then go ahead and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

7 

answer her question.  At some point you can come back to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

it. 

9 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.  I'll answer Justice 

  

  

 

 

 

10 

Ginsburg first and then Justice Breyer. 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

Justice Ginsburg, the only thing that 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

Samsung was precluded from doing -- and this happened in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Daubert ruling with respect to their expert report, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Wagner's report -- was they -- he was not allowed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present evidence about that -- about the value of design 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the total product as a whole.  That was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

apportionment, Judge Koh said. 

 

 

 

18 

            

He wanted -- he calculated total profits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

based on the phone.  And his report then said, well, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I believe that only 1 percent of the value of the phone 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is due to the design or the design of the iconic front 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

face of the phone.  And that, she wouldn't allow him to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do because that was apportionment. 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

The question -- the only issue with respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

to article of manufacture that Samsung ever made in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

38 

1 

2 

3 

either trial or in the Court of Appeals was that, as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter of law in a multicomponent product, the article 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of manufacture must be the portion. 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

They never said that to the jury.  They did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

propose a jury instruction, 42.1, which directed the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

jury that that's what it was supposed to do.  It also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directed the jury to apportion, and the judge didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approve it.  Now, it just so happens that they preserved 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no relevant objection to --

 

 

 

 

10 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Waxman, we're 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

spending an awful lot of time on an issue about what was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised below, what wasn't raised below, what was raised 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

below, what wasn't raised.  Maybe it's a good time to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

turn to Justice Breyer's question. 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

16 

that. 

17 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  I would be very happy to do 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Breyer, the -- there is no question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

that in an appropriate case the jury can decide whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the article of manufacture to which the design is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied and to which it provides a distinctive and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

pleasing appearance could either be the article that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually sold to consumers, that's bought by consumers, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or it could be a component of it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

In the case of a wall hanging, there's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

25 

really not much dispute.  In the case of the cup-holder, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

39 

1 

2 

there really isn't much dispute.  It is a question of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact for the jury. 

 

 

 

3 

            

We believe that the -- the four factors that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

the Solicitor General articulated would be appropriate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors to consider. 

 

 

              

I think that a -- in a case in which --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- what is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question of fact? 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Here's --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The article to -- to which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the law applies?  What -- what is the question of fact? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Here is what I would say.  In a 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

case in which the jury heard evidence as to competing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

articles of manufacture, as to what total profits should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be applied to, the jury would be told, if you find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement, total profits are awarded on the article 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of manufacture to which the patented design was applied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the purpose of sale and to which it gives peculiar 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or distinctive appearance. 

 

 

            

You may determine that the article of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacture is the entire product or a distinct 

   

 

 

 

 

 

component of that product.  In making that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

determination, you may consider, and this would depend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the evidence in the case, among other factors I would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include the Solicitor General's, and there may be other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

40 

things.  For example, most importantly the identity of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what it is that is typically consumed by purchasers. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Whether the patented design is likely to cause consumers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to purchase the infringing product thinking it to be the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

patentee's product. 

 

6 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I -- maybe I'm not 

    

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

grasping the difficulties in the case.  It seems to me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the design is applied to the exterior case of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phone.  It's not applied to the -- all the chips and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wires, so why --

 

 

 

11 

            

12 

            

13 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  That's right. 

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So --

  

 

 

 

MR. WAXMAN:  That's absolutely right.  And, 

  

  

 

 

 

14 

15 

you know, of course you can't get a design patent on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that the consumer can't see.  And yet 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

Congress --

 

17 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So there should --

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

there shouldn't be profits awarded based on the entire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price of the phone. 

 

 

 

20 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  No.  The profits are awarded on 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

the article of manufacture to which the design is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

applied. 

23 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The outside, the 

  

 

 

 

 

24 

case is part of it. 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Well, maybe and maybe not.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

41 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

think the -- the difficulty here is that it's important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to understand that design is not a component and the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patented design is not the article of manufacture.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patented design is something that's applied to an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article of manufacture. 

 

 

6 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Well, 

  

  

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

these -- these little, the chips and all are articles of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacture, right?  How is the design of the case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied to those chips? 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  The same way that -- I mean, if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you look at, for example, in the early days, when the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent -- when the design -- when design patents were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first permitted by statute in 1842, the first hundred --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the first hundred patents that were issued, 55 of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them were for stoves and furnaces and steam engines and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things like that.  Congress -- when Congress said that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you are entitled, you know, in response to the Dobson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases, that as an alternative remedy, if there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement of a design -- which, by the way, does not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

happen innocently. 

 

21 

            

When there is infringement of a design, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

patentee may choose an alternative remedy which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially to have the jury put him or her in the shoes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the infringer.  That is, to -- to disgorge the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

profits from the article to which the design was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

42 

1 

applied. 

2 

            

There's no doubt the steam engine had plenty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

of working components, but a design is not a component. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

A design is applied to a thing.  And the jury has to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide in the case of the VW Beetle that you have either 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a cup-holder or a patented hubcap, or the iconic shape 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the car, I think that a jury could very well conclude 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that because someone who sees the iconic shape of a VW 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Beetle and buys it thinks that they are buying the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Beetle, that is, after all the reason why the infringer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

copied it. 

 

12 

            

The -- we know from Samsung's own documents 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

in this case, for example, that are recounted in our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief, Samsung realized that it faced what this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

executive called a crisis of design.  And the crisis of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

design was reflected, the documents show, in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

telephone company saying, you have to create something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like the iPhone, and a directive came out to create 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something like the iPhone so we can stop use -- losing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sales.  And in three months --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Waxman, can we go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

back to the government's test, because if -- so far your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test has a lot of steps, but I don't know what it's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going towards.  Okay. 

  

 

            

They suggest two things.  Article of 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

43 

manufacture is the article of manufacture.  They have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

four-part test.  Do you agree that that four-part test 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with respect to identifying just the article of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

manufacture? 

5 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Yes, with the following caveat 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

only.  What -- the factors that the jury will be told 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will depend on the evidence that the parties educe --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Please don't go to 

  

 

 

 

 

9 

the -- to the record. 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  I'm not going to the -- I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

sticking with the test. 

 

 

 

12 

            

13 

test. 

14 

            

15 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  That's the 

  

  

 

 

 

MR. WAXMAN:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So let's assume, because 

  

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

it makes logical sense to me, it may not to anybody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else, okay, that the Volkswagen body, not the innards, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are the article of manufacture. 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

Now, the government would say, go to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

second test, which takes in some of the things that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were talking about, to figure out how much of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

profits that VW makes from the Bug are attributable to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the shape of the car. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, as Justice Alito said, some people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't care a wit about the shape of the car.  They want 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

44 

1 

2 

just a small car.  They want the car that has a certain 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

trunk.  People buy cars for a multitude of reasons. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

Experts would come in and say, but it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

90 percent of the profits.  It may be that the body 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accounts for only 10 percent of the cost of the car, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

90 percent of the profits are attributable to the shape 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the car.  What's wrong with that analysis? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

That's what I understand the government's 

   

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

analysis to be.  That that's what a jury has to be told 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do, to decide how much value the design is to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

product being sold.  That's the government's test in a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

nutshell. 

13 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  So -- okay.  So this is a test 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

that the government has articulated here at oral 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument.  It has not been briefed by anybody. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

The issue of how you calculate total profits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

on something less than the whole article as sold was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrestled with, I think, best by the Second Circuit in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the second Piano case, where in the second Piano case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court said, well, okay, the first part of the test, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how do you determine what the article of manufacture is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hasn't provided a lot of difficulty.  The real 

   

  

 

 

 

 

difficulty is in calculating a hundred percent of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

profits from that article of manufacture. 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

The -- the few courts that have addressed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

45 

this that I've seen it have done it in a way that I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think probably makes the most sense and is the least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficult conceptually which is to say, okay, what were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the costs of producing that article, that particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subcomponent, and what was the company's profit margin 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the product as a whole applied to that little 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

component? 

8 

            

Now, the difficulty with that -- I mean, I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

think that's what courts have generally done.  And what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it underscores, and in appropriate cases it may be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate, like the cup-holder example, but what it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underscores is the very --

track. 

15

19 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Okay. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you endorse that part 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of the government's test?  How we measure it, you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying, hasn't been briefed adequately.  The government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is saying the same thing.  But is -- conceptually, is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

that right? 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Conceptually, it is correct 

  

 

 

 

 

that under Section 289 the patentee is entitled to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

total profits on the sale of the articles of manufacture 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to which the design has been applied.  That is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relatively straightforward when, in a contested case,

the jury concludes that the article of manufacture is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the product that's sold.  It is more complicated when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury concludes that the relevant article of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacture, as was the case in the piano cases where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

customers could choose an array of cases in which to put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the piano mechanism, it is more difficult to figure out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

total profits from the manufacture and sale of the case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But the decided cases that I have seen have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked at the question what was the manufacture -- what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were the direct costs associated with producing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant piano cases and what was the profit margin on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the piano as applied to that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And may I just add one other point which I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think is still on track.  The problem with that is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it runs headlong into the kind of thing that Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was concerned about in 1887 when it passed the Design 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Patent Act, because the concern was that counterfeiters 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and copyists would -- if the only penalty -- if the only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensation was something that could be viewed as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cost of doing business, that is okay, you're going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get a 10 percent margin on $2.50 for what it cost to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

produce this little component, there would be no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deterrents to what Congress deemed to be an emergency. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Yes, Justice Kagan.

think that the VW example is a good example for this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason -- where the thing that makes the product 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinctive does not cost all that much.  There's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been a lot of input.  Somebody just -- some engineer or 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some graphic artist or whatever woke up one day and said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I just have this great idea for an appearance.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the principal reason why the product has been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

successful.  I mean, the car has to run, and it has to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do all the other things that cars do, but the principal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason why the car has been successful has to do with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this particular appearance, the design. 

 

 

 

 

            

As I understood the government, that does 

   

 

 

 

 

not come into the first inquiry.  That does not come 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into the question of what is the article.  It only comes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into the second inquiry, which is how much of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

profits are attributable to that article. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Do you agree with that? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  I don't think that that -- I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't agree with -- if that is the government's test as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have articulated it, I wouldn't agree with that.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that the government's -- if you look at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's factors, you know, one factor is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relative prominence of the design within the product as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a whole.  And the government says that whether the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

design -- in other words, whether the design is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

48 

1 

2 

3 

significant attribute of the entire product affecting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the appearance of the product as a whole would suggest 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the article should be the product. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

Another factor in the government's test is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

the physical relationship between the patented design 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the rest of the product.  In other words, as the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's brief says, can the user or the seller 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

physically separate it, or is it manufactured 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

separately. 

10 

            

Another factor is whether the design is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

conceptually different from the product as a whole, as, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

for example, a design on a book binding is different 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

from the intellectual property reflected in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright material in the book.  Those -- we agree with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all those factors as relevant, but I do think directly, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, speaking to the question that you raised, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first factor that I mentioned, the relative prominence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of the design within the product of the whole is in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essence asking -- and it is a relevant question in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determining the article of manufacture -- whether the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patented design is likely to cause the consumers to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchase the infringing product thinking it to be the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patentee's product.  So in the VW Beetle example -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't bring myself to call it a "bug."  In the VW Beetle 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, nobody would look at the cup-holder that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

49 

similar to what was in a VW Beetle that was in a Jeep or 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a Porsche and say, oh, this must be a VW.  But somebody 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who looked at the exterior of a Jeep that copied the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

iconic side profile of the VW Beetle might very well say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, and a jury would take that into account.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is the approach -- is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

approach that you're discussing fairly described as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"apportionment," or is that a bad word? 

   

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  That is a really bad word.  And 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

10 

if there's a -- I mean, in some --

   

   

 

 

 

 

11 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What other -- what -- what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

word would you use to describe your approach? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  What is the thing, the article 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

of manufacture, to which the design is applied for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes of sale in order to give it a distinctive and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pleasing appearance.  Apportionment is what their 

  

 

 

 

 

expert, Mr. Wagner, tried to do in his report saying the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

total profits on the phone are X hundreds of millions of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollars, but I find that only one percent of consumers 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

buy phones because of the front face of the phone either 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

off or on. 

 

 

22 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But once you've identified 

  

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

the relevant article, then it seems to me necessarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what you're doing is apportioning profits.  I just don't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

see how we can get away from that word. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

10

Kennedy, the vernacular sense of "apportionment," once 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- if you -- if the jury answers the question at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

step 1 and says no, no, no, the article of manufacture 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the refrigerator latch or the cup-holder, how do we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine total profits from the sale of that thing? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You do have to engage in a kind of an apportionment that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looks to how much did it cost to make the cup-holder and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what is the -- you know, what is the profit margin for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the car or the refrigerator or something like that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That, it seems to me, is the way that you would do it if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you found it. 

 

 

13 

            

So, you know, in this case it's a little 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

difficult to figure out what the alternative article of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacture would be.  I mean, in the trial court even 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before the trial judge, they never even suggested what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the article of manufacture could be for the 305 patent, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the graphical user interface.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

19 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Listing factors is not 

  

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

helpful unless the jury or whoever the fact finder is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knows what the determination must -- what determination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must be made.  The factors are helpful in making the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

determination. 

24 

            

Now what you just said about the article of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

manufacture is, it is the thing to which the design is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

51 

1 

applied.  Is that -- is that basically what you said? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  What I would tell the jury is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

quoting the statute and this Court's decision in 1872 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision in Gorham, is that the article of manufacture 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the thing to which the design is applied for purposes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of sale, and to which it gives distinctive and pleasing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attractive appearance.  That's all you're trying to find 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

out --

 

9 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, but in a physical 

   

  

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

sense -- that -- you can answer it easily, and that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the Chief Justice was talking about.  It's applied 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the outside in a physical sense.  But you mean it in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a different sense, and I don't really understand what --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what that means.  Once you get beyond the pure -- where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the design applied?  Is it applied to the inside? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

No.  It's applied to the outside. 

  

 

 

 

 

17 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Well, the design, by 

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

definition, applies to the outside.  It has to apply to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that --

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  So when you say what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

it's applied to, you're not talking about it in terms of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the physical world, so what is -- what are you talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

about? 

24 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  The jury is being asked to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

decide was this -- if you find that this was a -- that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

52 

this was a patentable design and you find under Gorham 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it was infringed, what is the thing to which that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

design was applied to give it a pleasing appearance. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Obviously, it's not a transistor or some circuit or the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

software.  It is applied to the phone.  Now, they could

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

please the Court: 

 

 

22 

            

Justice Kennedy, Congress did not say that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

all apportionment is forbidden.  Congress said you can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

apportion the value of the design in relation to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article.  We're conceding that here.  What Congress did 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

53 

not say is you can't segregate the proper article from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other articles that make up the product.  So we can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

segregate article from other articles within the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

product.  And, in fact, Section 289 requires us to do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that because it allows total profit only from that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article of manufacture to which the design has applied. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

Now, the test that we ask the Court to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

announce on remand.  As has been discussed, it has two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

parts. 

10 

            

The first is -- the antecedent question is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

identify the relevant article of manufacture.  Sometimes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that will be very easy if you do it from two main 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors.  What does the patent scope claim, a front 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

face, or as the Chief Justice said, the exterior casing? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And, in fact, we asked Mr. Chief Justice for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction, you allude to it, blue brief 21, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually asked the jury to be told that where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article of manufacture is a case or external housing, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the article of manufacture. 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

The second question is quantum of profits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

And I think Justice Kagan put it exactly right in saying 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that a lot of the expert determinations about how much 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did the Beetle exterior drive demand will come into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

play, as the government said and we agree, only at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second question:  What is the quantum of profits from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

54 

1 

the right article of manufacture? 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

But, Justice Alito, you asked how similar 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

are we to the government's test?  And, Justice Kennedy, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you asked if this will lead to a lot of inconsistency 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

among juries. 

 

6 

            

We think the answer to the first question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

can be made more consistent and uniform if we focus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mainly on two factors:  What does the design in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent claim:  front face, exterior casing holding the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

front face?  And second, what is the product to which it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has been applied?  That will help judges to guide 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

juries. 

13 

            

We think we should have had instruction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

42.1, but in a proper case, you might decide at summary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment that the article of manufacture is the front 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

face, and that could be instructed to the jury. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  The problem, of course, is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

that Congress meant the whole wallpaper, even though 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they only want to apply it to the front. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

21 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's the problem in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

the case.  So I thought -- and that's why I pointed to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the brief I did point to -- that history is matters 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, and we're talking here about a multicomponent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

25 

product. 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

55 

MS. SULLIVAN:  That's right, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And if you don't tell the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1

jury that there is that distinction, I think you either 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disregard what Congress meant in its statute or you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

create the kind of absurd results that your brief is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

full of.  So that's what I'm looking for. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's why I looked at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

page 23, and it says that seems to do it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  We're fine with page 23 of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the tech company's brief, and that points to why you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must remand in this case. 

 

 

 

 

            

This case was tried under the improper rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of law.  We tried at every juncture to get the correct 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule of law adopted.  And the district court said, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forbade apportionment.  And we said, no, no, we're not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking for apportionment; we're asking for article of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacture.  And we were shut down over and over again 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

on that. 

 

20 

            

So you must remand and tell the nation's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

economy that no one can claim a partial design patent on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a portion of a front face of an electronic device and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come in and get the entire profits on the phone.  Juries 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be instructed that the article of manufacture 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either is the Beetle exterior or there might be, Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

56 

Breyer, still today, there might be cases of unitary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

articles, just like the Dobson rugs.  The Gorham spoon 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might be a unitary article.  The patents on the handle, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but nobody really cares about the sipping cup of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spoon.  So we say the article of manufacture is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spoon.  And if you get the profits from the spoon, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's all right.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Who has the burden of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

showing what is the relevant article?  I assume in a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case like this, Apple will say it's the whole phone. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Ginsburg, if I leave

24 

25 

you with the most important disagreement we have with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government and with Apple, the burden is on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff.  The burden is on the plaintiff to show what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the article of manufacture is. 

 

 

 

 

            

Why is that?  The burden is on the plaintiff 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to show damages.  And subsidiary questions subsumed in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the damages are are also always the plaintiff's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden, as the entire market value rule in the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit shows.  With respect, we request that you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

remand -- vacate and remand. 

 

 

 

 

            

Thank you very much, Your Honor. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

The case is submitted. 

 

 

 

            

(Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the
