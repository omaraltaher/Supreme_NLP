JUSTICE STEVENS:  We will hear argument in No.


01-1420, Washington State Department of Social Services


against the Guardianship Estate of Daniel Keffeler.


General -- is it Gregoire or Gregory?


ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINE O. GREGOIRE


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MS. GREGOIRE:  Gregoire.


QUESTION:  Gregoire.  Thank you. 


MS. GREGOIRE:  Justice Stevens, and may it


please the Court:


The question presented in this case is whether a


representative payee, appointed by the commissioner of


Social Security, violates the anti-alienation provision of 

42 U.S.C., section 407(a), when it uses Social Security


benefits to pay for the beneficiary's current maintenance.


The plain text of section 407(a) answers this


question, and the answer is no. 


Section 407(a) provides that benefits are not


subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or


other legal process.  The department here does not use


compulsory legal process to obtain benefits.  Instead, the


department is appointed representative payee by the


commissioner, pursuant to 42 U.S.C., section 405(j), and

as payee, the department is under the supervision of the


commissioner and uses the benefits to pay for the current


maintenance of the beneficiary in accordance with the


Social Security regulations. 


In short, when looking at the statutes as a


whole, 407(a) does not prohibit that which is expressly


authorized by 405(j).  The purpose of 407(a) is to ensure


that Social Security benefits are available to pay the


beneficiary's current maintenance by preventing creditors


from taking those benefits.  Legal process, as referenced


in 407(a), is the means by which a court, agency, or


official authorized by -- by law compels compliance with


its demands.  It is compulsory legal process. 


Here there is no legal process.  The


representative payee here stands in the shoes of the 

beneficiary, sharing in the cost of care, consistent with


the Social Security regulations. 


QUESTION:  Can a set-off ever be legal process? 


Suppose there were a tax indebtedness by the beneficiary. 


Could the State just under -- assuming that its set-off


principles allowed it, could the State simply take some of


the beneficiary's money from the Social Security and set


it off against the tax debt?


MS. GREGOIRE:  If -- the violation of 407(a)


comes in -- comes into play when there's a legal process

that actually attaches to those Social Security benefits. 


QUESTION:  So you would say there's no 407


violation in that event. 


MS. GREGOIRE:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  Although I presume there would be a


cause of action against the State for -- for not behaving


properly as the -- what -- what is the -- the --


MS. GREGOIRE:  Representative payee?


QUESTION:  As the representative payee within


that --


MS. GREGOIRE:  I believe that's true, Justice


Scalia.  The questions that have been presented here by --


by the respondents are 405(j) questions as to whether the


representative payee acted accordingly within their


purview. 


Here there is full compliance with the Social 

Security regulations.  In this particular instance, the


department is duly recognized as a representative payee


subject to supervision, having to submit constant reports


and annual reports and accounting system, and there are


audits that have been performed on the department.  It is


acting in accordance with 405(j) as rep payee.


QUESTION:  And why -- why is 405(j) not at issue


here?


MS. GREGOIRE:  Well --


QUESTION:  Because those points are raised, of

course, in the -- in your opponent's brief.


MS. GREGOIRE:  Yes, Your Honor, but if you -- if


you look at the complaint in this particular case by -- by


the respondent, if you look at the certification of the


class that's present here, if you look at the holding


below, in every instance the question presented is whether


a representative payee duly appointed can use the benefits


for the cost of care of the beneficiary.  We think the


plain text of 407(a) says the answer is there is no


violation whatsoever.


QUESTION:  General Gregoire, I'd like to just


find out if -- let's say we accept your argument this is


not a 407 case, and then the question is put, but there


are alleged misappropriations here.  For example, there's


some suggestion of double dipping and there's some other 

things which may or may not be right.  I don't know that


there is such a thing as a right of any individual to go


after the representative payee.  I thought that was


something within the Social Security regs.  I thought I


heard you say, oh, yes, but that's not a 407 claim.  That


would be a 405 claim.  And I was not aware that there is


such a thing apart from the administrative process.  Is


there some right to sue eventually in court under 405?


MS. GREGOIRE:  What the Social Security Act


provides is one of two things.  It can be done by the

commissioner by the removal of the representative payee if


they have violated.  It can be done by a court.  But the


remedy, if -- even if done by a court, is back to the


commissioner to remove the representative payee and


appoint one that would act in -- in accordance with the


regulations. 


Here, while there are allegations --


QUESTION:  And who -- who can invoke the court's


assistance?  The --


MS. GREGOIRE:  An individual, the -- the


beneficiary could. 


QUESTION:  The beneficiary can?


MS. GREGOIRE:  Yes. 


But here, all of those allegations, one, are not


contained within the holding below, but most importantly, 

there is no record to find any violation of 405(j) in this


case whatsoever.  To the contrary.  The department here


has acted absolutely consistent with the Social --


QUESTION:  May I ask you this question related


to that?  Do you agree with the position asserted in the


dissent, with the State court? 


MS. GREGOIRE:  We -- we do not, Your Honor.  We


believe the -- the dissent is wrong on -- on two bases. 


One, the -- the court below suggested that there was some


use of -- of benefits for past debt --

 QUESTION:  Right. 


MS. GREGOIRE:  -- when in fact there -- that is


not the case here and there is no finding to that effect


by the lower court.


QUESTION:  No finding.  Were there allegations


to that effect? 


MS. GREGOIRE:  Only after the -- the remand


and -- and the supplemental brief that was submitted in


the State supreme court. 


But there -- in this particular case, what


happens, by way of clarification, is when the State of


Washington gets a lump sum check for an individual whose


SSI, Social Security Title XVI application has been


pending, they will then use that check to pay current


maintenance for those months for which the child was 

deemed eligible for SSI and was receiving foster care up


to a maximum of 6 months.  That is considered current


maintenance, not past maintenance.  We think the -- the


concurring opinion was confused by that. 


Secondly, the concurring opinion says, you --


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  Why -- why do you say it


is considered current and not past?  You -- you just


decide 6 months is a reasonable currency criterion?


MS. GREGOIRE:  No. 


QUESTION:  Or is it a regulation or what?

 MS. GREGOIRE:  It is.  It is, Your Honor. 


Justice Scalia, what the Social Security regulations put


in place with respect to Title XVI benefits, SSI, that


anything beyond 6 months by Social Security itself is put


into an account and allowed to accumulate interest.  It


cannot be used for the current maintenance of the child.


And the second basis -- Justice Stevens, the


second basis that we think was wrong in -- in the


concurring opinion is where she finds that you have to


look at the extras for the child first, over and above


current maintenance, and that we submit to you is in --


contrary to the Federal regulations themselves, 20 C.F.R.


404.2040, which expressly provides that you look first to


the current maintenance.  That's the very purpose behind


both Title II and Title XVI, first to the current 

maintenance, and then you guess -- within the broad


discretion accorded a representative payee, you may look


to see if there are extras to which those monies could be


spent. 


Here, the Department of Social and Health


Services uses the benefits for both, and the record


verifies that. 


But let me bring to the Court's attention what


we're talking about here.  We're talking about children


who arrive in the State's custody through a juvenile court

proceeding, having been abandoned, abused, or neglected. 


They are subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile


court, and then those children are assessed by an


individual service plan as to what their needs are.  And


what happens when that assessment takes place is their


needs are being met by the department. 


In fact, the average payment for foster care for


a SSI child is $1,776.  The average amount that an SSI


benefit would be is something short of $500.  And the base


foster care amount is something short of $500.  The fact


is the special needs of these children are being met so


their lives can be turned around, they can go back out and


be productive members of society --


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I think we're all


interested in the needs of the children. 

In some cases, though, I take it that the --


that the Social Security payments are being applied to


reimburse the State for something the child would get for


free anyway.


MS. GREGOIRE:  We don't submit, Your Honor -- we


think that's wrong.  The fact that these children are --


are getting foster care doesn't mean it's free.  In fact,


the expectation of both Social Security --


QUESTION:  Well, I mean free in the sense that


the State would pay for it anyway.

 MS. GREGOIRE:  Your Honor, there is an


expectation in State law and an expectation in the Social


Security Act that -- that what this money is to be used


for is the current maintenance of the child.  What would


be the difference if we were to submit that it's free in


the home of a parent?  A parent surely -- and under


Washington State law -- absolutely is obligated to pay for


the child's care and maintenance.  Are we then to suggest


that anytime a child in the home of a parent gets SSA or


SSI, it can't be used for current maintenance because the


parent has to use their own funds for that purpose? 


QUESTION:  Well, but we're talking about the --


the State has a certain -- has assumed a certain


obligation and made certain payments.  And in the event


the representative payee is someone other than the State, 

the State is going to pay -- pay those benefits and -- and


the SSI will be available for other purposes.  So it's --


it's not necessarily always in the best interest for the


child. 


MS. GREGOIRE:  But, Justice Kennedy, that would


be -- that would be the case with a parent.  A parent is


obligated to pay for the current maintenance of the child. 


Does that mean they can never use their SSA or SSI benefit


for the child for the current maintenance of the child? 


We think not.  Consistent with the very purpose of the

Social Security Act, is -- these monies are to ensure that


that child gets a minimum income to pay for their current


maintenance.  The State shouldn't be treated any different


here than a parent would be treated. 


QUESTION:  General Gregoire, can I ask you about


the person who started all this?  As I understand it, the


-- the grandmother that the State was trying to displace


as representative payee refused to pay anything for the


child's current maintenance.  She was putting it away in a


kitty for the child's college education.  And I suppose


her theory was the State is going to pick up the tab


anyway, so I think the best use for these Social Security


benefits is to put them in a bank account so one day he


can go to college. 


Is -- and I understand there were two attempts 

to replace her because she was not spending the money on


current maintenance. 


When the -- when the social service agency is


not the representative payee but a relative who doesn't


have custody is, is there any means of getting those


Social Security benefits used for the current maintenance?


MS. GREGOIRE:  Not by legal process, Justice


Ginsburg, which was a lesson learned by the grandmother,


Wanda Pierce, in this case.  The department wrongfully


attempted to get at the Social Security benefits by legal

process.  That's why there is no appeal of the specific


Danny Keffeler case.


QUESTION:  Why is it wrong?  I mean, this money


is there to pay for the child's care and maintenance.  If


the grandmother won't pay it, why couldn't the State go to


HHS and say, appoint us?


MS. GREGOIRE:  Well, you --


QUESTION:  Why wouldn't they do it?


MS. GREGOIRE:  You could.  The issue is a 405(j)


issue.  The issue is whether that person should be paying


for the current maintenance of the child. 


QUESTION:  Why shouldn't they? 


MS. GREGOIRE:  They should.  But what happened


in this particular case is Washington State has a specific


statutory provision that says if the child has a guardian, 

the State cannot go in there and then ask to be


representative payee.  So there's a violation of State


law.


QUESTION:  Oh, I see.  So there's a


particular -- a particular State law --


MS. GREGOIRE:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  -- that stopped that.


MS. GREGOIRE:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  So --


QUESTION:  Is that the basis on which the ALJ

ruled?  I thought that was within the Social Security


structure. 


MS. GREGOIRE:  The ALJ in the case of Danny


Keffeler said that there was no finding that she had


wrongfully used the benefits, but went on to suggest at


the end that the State hadn't done anything like submit a


bill to her showing an expectation that she was


responsible to provide for the benefit and care of this


child. 


QUESTION:  But that wasn't under State law, was


it?  That was -- that was a Federal --


MS. GREGOIRE:  That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. 


The point being --


QUESTION:  Then that's what creates the problem


because if you have a State law and the grandmother just 

says, no, I'm not going to pay this money, which I would


have thought was earmarked for that purpose, pretty much,


and they won't do it, and then you say, okay, appoint us,


and the State says, no, we -- we cannot appoint ourselves,


and then you say to the grandmother, well, pay us, well,


then you really are a creditor in respect to that.


MS. GREGOIRE:  Well -- and specifically what


happened in the case of Danny Keffeler, when the State


attempted legal process against Wanda Pierce, that was


wrong.  That was a violation of 407(a) --

 QUESTION:  And you're in an anomalous situation,


aren't you?  I mean, here -- here you have -- if you -- if


you -- you're a creditor in respect to the grandmother who


won't pay.  I -- I don't quite see how to work it out. 


There's going to be an anomaly no matter what you do. 


You're a creditor in respect to the grandmother, so you


can't force the parents to pay.  And you can't go and ask


HHS to appoint you because of the State law.  And then


there you are in those instances where you did manage to


get yourself appointed, and you're now trying to reach a


different result than would be there in the other cases.


MS. GREGOIRE:  But Justice Breyer, the remedy is


the State could go to the Social Security Administration


and ask them to consider an alternative representative


payee for the child in this case because Wanda Pierce was 

not providing for the current maintenance of the child as


we believe she should.


We believe --


QUESTION:  And she might have if she had to care


for the child.  If she -- if the representative payee --


if the child is in the custody of the representative


payee, then the representative payee has to pay for the


child. 


MS. GREGOIRE:  Under State law, we believe the


representative payee should pay for the current

maintenance of the child whether in the custody of that


individual or not.  The remedy, however, is not by legal


process 407(a), but the remedy is 405(j) process by going


to the Social Security Administration and asking --


QUESTION:  Which gives it -- there's no role for


the State court in that.


MS. GREGOIRE:  Correct.


QUESTION:  In that 405(j) process.  It's all


Federal. 


MS. GREGOIRE:  That's correct.


And with that --


QUESTION:  And under 405(j), when you go to the


Social Security Administration, its options are what?


MS. GREGOIRE:  To remove that individual as a


representative payee and appoint another. 

QUESTION:  Put you in.


MS. GREGOIRE:  If -- unless we have a State law,


as I indicated in the specific case of Danny Keffeler,


would not allow us because she was named guardian.  That's


correct, Your Honor. 


With that, I would like to reserve my remaining


time for rebuttal.


QUESTION:  Very well.  Thank you.

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


MS. MILLETT:  Justice Stevens, and may it please


the Court:


There is no question that the use of Social


Security benefits to pay for current maintenance needs by


a beneficiary or by a parent as representative payee is


permitted under the Social Security Act.  There is no


reason that the identical use of funds would suddenly


become a prohibited alienation of Social Security benefits


just because it's done by a State as representative payee. 


The anti-alienation provision of the Social Security Act


prohibits the use of judicial processes or similar


coercive processes to divert funds away from meeting the


needs of a beneficiary. 


But there's nothing in the text 

or the purpose of the anti-alienation provision that


supports the Washington Supreme Court's conclusion that it


prohibits particular types of payments and expenditures of


funds that the representative payee provision of the


statute specifically permits. 


And that is because -- it's very important to


understand that when a State serves as a representative


payee, it does not receive funds, and it does not spend


funds as an interposing claimant or creditor.  Instead,


under the Social Security program, it steps into the shoes

of the beneficiary.  It cannot act unilaterally.  It has


to be appointed by the commissioner and, once appointed,


must act pursuant to the commissioner's direction,


supervision, and control. 


QUESTION:  Is -- is the issue of whether there


was compliance with section 405(j) properly before us, do


you think? 


MS. MILLETT:  No, it is not, Justice O'Connor. 


The question presented is limited to the violation of the


anti-alienation provision 407(a).  The complaint in this


case is limited to 407(a).  If you look at the joint


appendix, page 118, specifically the -- the claim for


relief, the aforesaid actions violate 42 U.S.C. 407, no


allegation of violating 405.  And there would be no basis,


I don't think, for the class action. 


The class action 

allegations were based on this general rule of the 407


violation.  If there's particular allegations of misuse in


particular cases for particular children, that would be a


misuse claim.  It should first be brought to the Social


Security Administration. 


QUESTION:  Do -- do beneficiaries of SSI funds


have a Federal right that they can enforce through a


section 1983 action to have the representative payee act


in their best interests? 


MS. MILLETT:  What they would do is bring --

bring a complaint.  If you're -- if you're a beneficiary


and you're dissatisfied with the way your payee is


spending your money --


QUESTION:  Right. 


MS. MILLETT:  -- then you can bring a complaint


with the Social Security --


QUESTION:  Would there be alternatively some


lawsuit open --


MS. MILLETT:  They -- I think --


QUESTION:  -- under 1983?


MS. MILLETT:  I'm not sure whether under 1983,


but you could bring certainly a State law conversion out


-- suit against someone if you thought that they were


misapplying your funds.  And -- and I assume you're


talking about 1983 because we're talking about the State 

as --


QUESTION:  Right.


MS. MILLETT:  -- payee, but the vast majority of


representative payees are private individuals. 


QUESTION:  Does -- does the State have any set-


off rights that private entities don't?  Suppose a private


person were the representative payee.  Do they have the


same sort of set-off rights for other debts as the State


does? 


MS. MILLETT:  Neither -- make sure I understand

what you're talking about by set-off.  But neither private


nor State officials would have the right to set off money


against -- on -- on their own unilaterally to --


QUESTION:  Well, I'm just talking about 407 now. 


I'm just talking about 407.  Because the attorney general


indicated that the State could, so far as 407 is


concerned, set off a tax debt.


MS. MILLETT:  I didn't understand that to be her


-- her response.  But if -- but, first of all, you have to


ask how you come into possession.  To undertake an offset,


you somehow have to be in possession of the Social


Security check, and the State and private people would not


come into possession of that check unless they're


appointed as a representative payee.


QUESTION: 


I'm assuming there -- my -- my 

question is whether -- what I'm trying to explore is


whether the State has some special advantages that other


representative payees might not in the area of being -- of


being allowed to make certain set-offs to take certain


funds.  Because if that's so, then it sounds more like


legal process.  That was the --


MS. MILLETT:  I'm sorry.  I misunderstood your


question.  I didn't know that they had been appointed


representative payee. 


Once you are a representative payee, the State

and a private payee are in the same position in that when


it comes to reimbursing yourself for past debts, as


opposed to meeting current maintenance needs, the -- you


-- you are subject to the Social Security Administration's


rules.  They have specific POMS and regulations on payment


of past debts and --


QUESTION:  In other words, the State of


Washington is not relying here on any special statutory


authority for set-offs that's applicable only to a State.


MS. MILLETT:  No, it is not.


What's important to understand here -- and I


think one of the premises for respondents' position is


some confusion about the difference between current


maintenance and past debts.  Past debts are defined both


in a POMS, the -- the interpretive manual done by the 

Social Security Administration, but also in the


regulations on page 216 of the petition appendix,


402.2040(d), when it talks about claims of creditors to be


paid by a representative payee.  It -- the limitation is


on claims that arise prior to the first month for which


you become entitled to benefits.  That's what a past debt


is.  It would be reimbursed by a payee. 


Any debts that arise after you start receiving


benefits are current maintenance costs.  So if I get a


benefit check for January but for administrative reasons

the State does not pay my bills for that month until


March, that's not a reimbursement.  That is payment of


current maintenance by the January check for January


costs.


QUESTION:  May I -- may I ask you a question


about mechanics here?  Just the facts are a little hard


for me to understand at times.  As I understand it, many


of these children are in foster homes and the foster


parents are paid by the State.  Is the State agency that


pays the foster parents the same agency that receives the


Federal check? 


MS. MILLETT:  Yes, it is.  There are two


different units within -- it's the department -- in


Washington, it's the Department of Social and Human


Services that --


QUESTION:  And the second question I had --


there's a lot of discussion in the briefs about something


called sweeping, which I don't understand.  Would you tell


me what it is? 


MS. MILLETT:  Well, I'm afraid it may have


different meanings depending on whom you ask the question


to.  But as -- as it's discussed by the Court here, the --


our understanding is that it -- it is this confusion about


reimbursement and current maintenance.  What Washington


was doing was it would get a check in May that would be a

lump sum payment for February, March, April, and May.  And


it would go back and apply February's -- the -- the


percentage of that lump sum check that was for February to


the February expenses, March to the March expenses.  That


is the account sweeping that's talked about in the Court


here and that's all that the record talks about.


That is not impermissible.  That is, under our


view, the use of -- use of this -- proper use of these


benefits for current maintenance.  The fact that for


accounting reasons it happens 4 months later doesn't


change anything. 


Now --


QUESTION:  What if it happens --


QUESTION:  What if it happens 7 months --


QUESTION: 


-- even 6 months later? 

QUESTION:  -- 7 months --


QUESTION:  Yes.  Is there a 6-month cutoff on


that? 


MS. MILLETT:  With respect to the SSI, the Title


XVI benefits, there is -- there was after October 1996,


and that's why there's some confusion because this case


spanned that bridge.  But as of October --


QUESTION:  It's a little complicated, doesn't


it?


MS. MILLETT:  There's a lot of complicated

things here. 


But the -- but -- but for that reason, the fact


the commissioner has been administering this program and


the representative payee's program since it started in


1939 and it has recognized and endorsed the practice of


all 50 States having foster care agencies doing this as


not violating the anti-alienation provision is, I think,


very important to keep in mind and that adopting the


definition of anti-alienation provision, using that to


police allegations of misuse under the representative


payee system would be very confounding and confusing to


the system. 


QUESTION:  May I ask you one question I asked


the attorney general too?  Do you also disagree with the


analysis in the dissenting opinion? 


MS. MILLETT:  Yes, for -- for two reasons.


QUESTION:  The same reasons she gave.


MS. MILLETT:  Well, yes, I think it has again


the confusion about past reimbursements which could still


be for current maintenance and the payment of past debts.


But the other thing that the Washington Supreme


Court's concurring dissenting opinion did was it said you


could -- you could pay for maintenance, but first you have


to pay for special needs.  That gets it exactly upside


down.

 The -- there's much concern here about the best


interest -- the best interest test here, but the best


interest is a regulatory test designed to implement the


purpose of these benefits.  And the purpose of these


benefits in the case of Danny Keffeler, Title II benefits,


is just to replace the income stream of the lost parent. 


That parent is legally obliged to pay child support to the


State of Washington.  All Washington is doing is what his


mother would have been legally obligated to do under --


under State law with that same income.  So it's consistent


with the purpose of these benefits to use them for what


they're doing.  The SSI benefits are minimum income,


establish a minimum floor.  All that Washington has said


is when the Federal Government --


QUESTION: 


But, of course, there's -- there's a 

statutory restriction on what the -- when the money comes


from the Federal Government that does not apply when the


money comes from the family.


MS. MILLETT:  On?


QUESTION:  407.


MS. MILLETT:  That's right.  But it's important


-- it's important to understand the limited role of 407. 


It said you can't come get these benefits, but it doesn't


mean that -- that debts and obligations to pay can't arise


and that you can't enforce, against the parents who may

have other income, child support through other mechanisms. 


You just can't come after, through a legal process, the


Social Security benefits. 


Thank you, Justice Stevens. 


QUESTION:  Thank you very much. 


Ms. Roseborough.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF TERESA W. ROSEBOROUGH


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  Justice Stevens, and may it


please the Court:


I think the Court's questions have hit on the


key issues here, and I'd like to point out what I believe


to be the errors in the State of Washington and the United


States' analysis in this case. 


I agree with Ms. Millett that the Social 

Security benefits that the State receives as


representative payee on behalf of these children indeed


belong to the children.  And in its role as representative


payee, the State essentially steps into their shoes to use


the benefits to serve their best interests. 


The regulation-mandated transfer from a State


trust fund account, which is the account in which the


State deposits the children's funds when they are


received, to the State treasury occurs in the State of


Washington because of the operation of the State statute


26

and two regulations, one superseding the other, that


mandate that the State shall use those benefits to


reimburse its previously advanced costs of care.


There's a singular exception in the regulations


that permits a State to advance costs of care to a Social


Security disability recipient and then later seek


reimbursement out of the paid disability benefits for that


care, and that is found at 42 U.S.C., section 1383(g)(1). 


That provision specifically provides an exception to the


operation of section 407(a), and provides that where


appropriate agreements are in place between the State and


the commissioner of Social Security and between the State


and the individual, that a State may advance costs of care


in the period between the application for benefits and the


date on which benefits are received and then seek 

reimbursement out of the Social Security funds for that


period of interim assistance. 


Apart from that exception, the use of Social


Security benefits to reimburse previously advanced costs


of care or public assistance is the payment of a debt


within the meaning of the Social Security regulations. 


QUESTION:  Ms. Roseborough, I want to make sure


that I understand what you're saying because it seems to


me you're telling us the Social -- the food and shelter


and clothing must be provided to the child today and

tomorrow and the next day.  So the State is paying for


that immediately, directly.  The Social Security check for


that month comes in a little later.  It comes in a month


later.  If I understand what you're saying correctly, when


the State takes the check which it gets in March for


services rendered in January, it cannot use the -- that


check to pay itself back for services it rendered in -- in


January.  Is that what you're saying?


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  Yes, Your Honor.  It cannot


use that check to pay itself back for services rendered in


March or January without complying with the Social


Security rules and regulations applicable to the authority


to pay a debt.


QUESTION:  Why isn't the same thing true of the


guardian who's been appointed the -- the designated 

beneficiary?  When a guardian gets money, the -- the


guardian reimburses himself for past expenses.  Is that


also the payment of a past debt? 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  It absolutely would be the


payment of a debt -- past debt, and it would be subject to


the same restrictions.


QUESTION:  Why isn't the same thing when you


have an EZ pass if you go through the tolls?  One of the


kids buys an EZ pass and unfortunately it shows up on his


credit card a month later.

 MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  Then the representative payee,


having in its possession funds belonging to that child,


makes a determination whether or not that is a debt that


should be paid in the best interest of the child or not.


QUESTION:  But if they had to put up a deposit,


for example, the State couldn't pay for the EZ pass. 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  The State could pay for it if


they had, in their possession, Social Security benefits


that made that an appropriate expenditure of the funds.


QUESTION:  In their possession.  And let's skip


EZ pass and go back to a parent who has custody of her


child. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  A parent has custody of her child. 


She pays for that child's food, clothing, and shelter in 

January.  She gets the check from Social Security in


March.  So you're telling me that she cannot use that


March check to reimburse herself for money that she spent


in January.


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  Whether or not the parent


could use this child's Social Security benefit check to


pay herself for having advanced care to the child in


January is wholly dependent on whether or not that


reimbursement would be in the best interest of the child


at the time the benefits are received.

 Ms. Gregoire and the Government misunderstand


the regulations.  They cite to 2040 --


QUESTION:  No.  I just would like to know if --


if -- as I see it, the State agency is identically


situated with the parent.  They're both providing food,


clothing, and shelter now, and they will get the Federal


check for that food, clothing, and shelter 2 months later,


at least a month later.  And if you're saying that then it


-- they both -- the parent, the social agency -- they are


debtors -- creditors.  They're both creditors because they


provided the service already?


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  If they -- if they are using


the -- the obligation under the Social Security laws is


not to use the month's benefits --


QUESTION: 


So the mother gets the check. 

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  -- in the -- for the month for


which they are paid. 


QUESTION:  The mother gets the check in March.


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  Then she must --


QUESTION:  And she cannot use that for services


that she has or food, clothing and shelter she has bought


for the child in January.


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  She has to make a


determination in March at the time she receives the


benefits as to what expenditure of benefits is in the best

interest of the child.  Let's say in the interim between


the use of the funds in January to -- to pay for whatever


items were paid for in January, the child has suffered


some event in February or March that requires the


expenditure of those benefits or the child needs a


communication device or a prothesis --


QUESTION:  Or that -- or that she wants the


child to go to university.  Why -- why would it not always


be in the best of the interest of the child not to pay


back his parents and put it into a -- a trust account for


future education?  It would always be in the -- in the


better interest of the child than paying off the past debt


to the parent. 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  And that's why the Social


Security regulations impose stringent guidelines on 

representative payees that want to use benefits to pay


back for things that happened in the past.


QUESTION:  No, but your theory, it seems to me,


is there's a choice here, when you apply the best interest


test, between a child with a full stomach and no trust


fund and a child with a full stomach and a trust fund. 


And you're saying the trust fund always wins.  The parent


cannot pay back because it's always in the child's best


interest to have the trust fund as well as the full


stomach.  Isn't that what you're saying?

 MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  Not necessarily.  In fact, the


Social Security regulations point out that in the case of


a -- of a family unit, that is dependent on the Social


Security benefits of the children in that unit, that they


-- those benefits can be used to promote the stability of


the family.  And it may be -- well be --


QUESTION:  I don't know -- I'm not quite sure


how stability works into this, but let's -- let's forget


the exceptional case for the moment.  Save for that


exceptional case, aren't you saying full stomach plus


trust fund always wins under the best interest test?


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  If the child has a full


stomach and if the --


QUESTION:  Right.  That's the -- that's the


hypothesis: 


stomach is full, will be full, trust fund or 

not.  Best interest says, put the money in the trust fund. 


Isn't that your position? 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  Absolutely true.


QUESTION:  Does it bother you that the Social --


QUESTION:  How would you square that --


QUESTION:  Go ahead. 


QUESTION:  -- know how you square that position


with a statute that seems aimed at giving children this


money so they can pay for room and board and meet their


basic subsistence.

 MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  The question is when do you


apply the test of current maintenance and using the


benefits at the time they are received to provide directly


for the care of the child which is the obligation under


the Social Security regulations, and when are the


regulations with respect to the payment of past debts


invoked. 


Now, Ms. Gregoire argues -- excuse me -- General


Gregoire argues that it's not invoked for 6 months, and


she is relying on the provisions of the code related to


certain lump sum benefits that provide additional


protection to those benefits.  Solicitor Millett says the


same thing relying on section 24(d).  But they are


mistaken that -- one illustration of their mistake is


found in the Social Security Administration's audit of 

Contra County, California, where the OIG found that that


county was using Social Security benefits to reimburse


itself for care provided before the benefits were actually


received --


QUESTION:  You've lost me a long time ago


because I have a sort of basic question.  It seems to me


if a mother or somebody in the family who is the recipient


of this extra money coming in from the SSI can use it, has


the right to use it to pay a bill that the child ran up


for some food or from shelter or, for that matter, EZ pass

or tuition -- and I -- I gather they have at least the


right to do that if they want to pay those bills.


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  Not if they want to.  They


have the right --


QUESTION:  They think it's the right thing to


do, and so they -- yes, they think it's --


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  They think it's in the best


interest of the child. 


QUESTION:  Well, all right.  Let's -- let's


imagine that doing what you think is right for the child


is in the child's best interest.  And therefore you do the


right thing which is to pay the bills for food, shelter,


tuition, and whatever that the child ran up.  Now,


assuming that that's okay, why can't the State do exactly


the same thing? 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  The State can do exactly the


same thing as long as it applies the same test.  As long


as it looks at whether or not the use of the benefits to


reimburse the debt is the --


QUESTION:  Okay.  Now I got your point. 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  -- that is the best interest


of the child. 


QUESTION:  Your point is neither the one nor the


other can pay -- has the right under the statute or under


the -- to pay these past debts for food, for example.

 And now my question would be they're the agency. 


They know what Congress had in mind.  A naive reading


would say Congress had in mind pay these bills for food


and shelter, but they know it.  They're the experts.  They


know their own regs, and they come in and tell you your


reading of this is totally wrong.  Of course, Congress


wanted guardians, whether they're States or not States, to


pay bills for food and shelter for this child who has no


parents.  All right.  Now, they say, of course, they


wanted that.  There's nothing in the statute that says


clearly to the contrary.  So they win.  Now, what's your


response? 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  One, the Social Security


Administration has consistently, prior to its pleadings in


this case at least, made the exact same demarcation that 

we are arguing here.  The Social Security Administration


has said that once a benefit payment is received, you look


backwards at every debt that occurred prior to that date


and judge whether or not that debt can be paid on the


basis of whether or not the current and foreseeable needs


of the beneficiary have been met and whether or not it's


in the best interest of the beneficiary to pay that debt. 


As to going forward --


QUESTION:  Well, doesn't -- doesn't the statute


basically leave it to the commissioner to -- to evaluate

whether a representative payee is acting in the best


interest of the child? 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  It does ask the --


QUESTION:  And we have a representative of that


commissioner here before us today saying that under the


statutory and regulatory scheme, that payments such as


these for foster care are in the best interests of the


child.  Why should we strain to find otherwise --


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  Because the --


QUESTION:  -- and -- and upset what's going on


all across the country?  I think your position is


troubling for that reason. 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  If I may first respond that


factually it's not true that this is what's going on


throughout the country. 


The facts of the various cases 

that we know about, through cases that have occurred in


the various States, illustrate that they take very


different or use very different procedures with respect to


the funds.  And we only know of Washington that has a


process that compels the State administrator to ignore


their obligation to evaluate the best interests of the


child at the time the benefit is received and instead make


a determination that all of the benefits should be used to


pay past debts to reimburse public assistance that was


expended without regard to the eligibility of the child

for Social Security benefits. 


QUESTION:  Well, the representative can be --


the representative can be removed if the representative is


misappropriating funds or misusing the representative's


position at responsibility.  But that has nothing to do


with -- with the legal process provisions of 407.


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  It has to do with that in this


sense.  The State argues that section 407(a) doesn't apply


to it because it is acting properly as a representative


payee.  We contend -- and I think we demonstrate in our


brief, and the State supreme court in fact held -- that


Washington was not acting as a properly regulated


representative payee within the meaning of section 405(j).


QUESTION:  But that we're -- we're told by the


Government is none of the State court's business.  I asked


that question expressly to find out whether in the


Government's view 405 is something that any State court


could enforce, and the answer was no.  405 is for -- if --


if you think the representative payee is not acting


properly, you go complain to the Social Security


Administration, and it's entirely a Federal law, not any


State court that interferes with the representative


payee's control.


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  I -- I believe that her


response was that you could bring a State law action, for

example, for conversion against the representative payee


that failed to administer benefits in accordance with the


Social Security Act.  Those Social Security regulations


themselves provide that you cannot sue the administration


for a representative payee's failure to use the benefits


properly, but that you may be able to sue the


representative payee themselves.


QUESTION:  But -- but your answer to my 407


question talked about 405.  I don't -- I don't understand


that.


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  407(a) clearly prevents a


State from using legal process like the administrative


regulations here to collect for past expenditures.


QUESTION:  Okay.  Why -- why is this -- why is


this legal process?


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  It's legal process --


QUESTION:  Why is it -- why is it something that


any representative payee, whether they're a State entity


or not, could not do?


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  Because Washington is not


making an evaluation that the payment of the debt to


itself is in the best interest of the child.  What it is


doing is acting pursuant to the compulsion of a regulatory


scheme that requires that the first use of the benefits be


to reimburse itself.  The Social Security regulations do

not state that the use of the benefits to pay current


maintenance --


QUESTION:  But that's an odd term of the use


legal process, unless you're saying any set-off is legal


process.


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  A set-off --


QUESTION:  Suppose a private entity just sets


off an earlier debt against current funds.  That's --


that's not legal process in the ordinary sense of the


term.  It's a set-off.


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  That would be depending on


whether they were doing so by operational law or because


of their own volition.  Here the State is clearly acting


under what it contended below at least was the volition or


the -- the obligation of law. 


It was saying that the law 

gave it the right to secure or require the use of these


Social Security benefits to pay a specific obligation,


that specific obligation being the debt to the State that


arose when the State advanced funds for the child's care.


QUESTION:  Well, you're saying that anytime the


law provides for action or provides that action will be


lawful, that taking that action involves resort to legal


process.  Is that your definition?


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  I'm saying that anytime the


law allows or permits the securing of Social Security

benefits to the payment of a specific obligation, that


that is legal process or the application of legal process


to those benefits in violation of section 407(a).


QUESTION:  But the reasonable word in there I


think is securing.  All the State is doing is taking from


this account and putting into that account.  And -- and I


think all the State is doing is saying, under the law,


we're able to do that.  The law says we can do that, or at


least it doesn't say we can't.  And I think you're saying


that whenever the State claims legal authority, it is


using legal process within this statute.  Is -- is that --


isn't that your position?


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  No.  My position is that --


QUESTION:  Then I still haven't gotten it.


MS. ROSEBOROUGH: 


-- that when the State here 

acts to transfer the benefits from the trust fund to the


State treasury coffers, it does so by presenting a bill,


in essence, a statement of account or a statement of


expenditures, to the trust fund unit reflecting the past


expenditures of the State on behalf of that child. 


Essentially it's saying, I have advanced monies for the


care of this child and I now want to be paid back out of


the child's trust fund unit.  Fair enough.  But the


obligation of the State, wearing its hat as representative


payee of the child, is to make a determination at that

point whether that repayment would be in the best interest


of the child. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but you have to go -- go on and


say what that -- why that's legal process.  If the


grandmother does it, you would also have to say it is


legal process under your view because it's authorized by


the common law, I suppose, of the State or maybe by a


statutory law.  Suppose you have a statute that says a


creditor can set off against an earlier debt money that


the creditor receives.  That's not legal process in any --


in any usual sense of the term. 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  Absolutely it would be, the


latter thing that you said, that if a State allowed -- if


a State statute allowed a set-off against a Social


Security benefit to pay a past debt, that would be a 

violation of section 407(a).  In fact, Federal law


provides that even if the United States itself seeks to


set off a debt like past due taxes against Social Security


benefits, that it has to have a specifically set out in


the statutes exception to section 407(a), and that in fact


is what exists.  There's a statute that says by express


reference to section 407(a) as required by section 407(b)


that the United States may set off past due taxes against


Social Security benefits. 


Absent that statutory authorization or exception

to section 407(a), a set-off compelled by law or


authorized by law would be within the ambit of legal


process or an application of legal process to benefits


prohibited by section 407(a).


QUESTION:  Would -- would you say the same thing


if the State were simply funding the -- the cost of food


and clothing for the current month and on -- on Wednesday


it -- it paid a bill for groceries and on Thursday it


presented this document that allowed the transfer from the


trust fund to the -- to the State's account?  That too


would be legal process?


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  That -- if it was doing so --


QUESTION:  So the only way the State could do it


then, I take it on your theory, is to use the money to pay


in advance of its own expenditure a -- a fund from which 

it then could draw under its separate hat to pay the


groceries. 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  The presentation of the


grocery bill to the representative payee for payment may


-- and -- and the payment that comes as a result of that,


may not -- may or may not be legal process depending on


what it is that authorizes that transaction and whether or


not --


QUESTION:  Well, it -- it paid the grocery bill


on Wednesday, and Thursday it says, we're going to

transfer the money to pay the grocery bill.  That's


process on -- on your theory, isn't it? 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  No, not necessarily. 


QUESTION:  What's the difference between


Wednesday and Thursday and February and March?


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  Under my theory, it's clearly


a reimbursement.  And as a reimbursement, it then falls


under the regulations with respect to reimbursements.


QUESTION:  Why isn't it a reimbursement between


February and March?


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  It is absolutely a


reimbursement.  That's exactly what we claim. 


QUESTION:  Then -- then if -- if there's legal


process for the February/March transfer, there's legal


process for the Wednesday/Thursday transfer. 

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  It's the Wednesday/Thursday


process in the hands of a private representative payee not


acting under compulsion of law. 


QUESTION:  I'm -- I'm talking about the State.


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  There's two --


QUESTION:  I'm talking about what we've got


here. 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  Acting --


QUESTION:  It's legal process when -- when we --


when we buy the groceries Wednesday and we make the

transfer Thursday.  Right? 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  Then -- but the State of


Washington is doing that because it is compelled by


statutes and regulations that mandate that it shall use


those benefits to reimburse the foster care costs.  If it


was not operating -- if it was making a choice --


QUESTION:  That's true --


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  -- on Thursday --


QUESTION:  That's true in either instance, isn't


it? 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  Not --


QUESTION:  I mean, that's -- that's a wash, as


between February and March and Wednesday and Thursday.


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  That is a wash. 


QUESTION:  Okay. 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  So the question is in both


instances on Thursday or a month later, is the use of


these benefits to pay for that which has been provided in


the past in the best interest of the child. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  Then it's --


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  That --


QUESTION:  -- then it's -- that's why I -- I


tried to lead to the conclusion -- let me try it again --


that the only way on your analysis to avoid the


implication of legal process would be to set aside funds

received from the Social Security Administration in


advance for payment for future groceries.  Is that


correct?


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  That would be the only way to


avoid a reimbursement scenario, would be to use the Social


Security benefits first to pay for those things that the


child needs.  That would -- that would avoid the


regulations respecting past debts and reimbursement.


QUESTION:  So you would have no case if you take


the Social Security check that you receive in February for


January to cover the January period instead of reimbursing


the State for what it supplied in January.  It takes that


check and puts in the account and says, now, this will


cover the March food, clothing, and shelter.  That would


be all right, and you wouldn't have any 407 --

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  And that appears to be what


many States do.  For example, it appears from the brief --


QUESTION:  Even though the check was supposed to


be for January and not for April.


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  The check is -- the


eligibility of the check, if it's an SSA check, is


determined by the child survivorship through January.  So


that's why it's paid at the end of January.  A disability


check, however, is paid at the beginning of the month for


which it is intended to be used.

 QUESTION:  So what all this -- so what all this


litigation will have achieved is just to compel the States


to use the current checks that they get for next month


instead of for last month.  You -- you get maybe a 3-


month ride.  I mean, I guess they -- they lose 3 months'


worth.  But so long as they re-gear up their system so


they're paying for next month, all of this will go away. 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  They will avoid violation --


avoid encroaching or violating section 407(a) --


QUESTION:  Does that make a lot of sense?


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  It does make a lot of sense


because the problems in Washington's administration with


accounts, we think, with double dipping, with use of the


benefits to pay administrative and programmatic costs


instead of to pay for items, food, clothing, shelter, and 

special needs of the child, could not occur in a system


where the Federal benefits were used in the first instance


to pay for those things.


Moreover, in Washington --


QUESTION:  But why -- why --


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  -- the average payment to a


disabled child is less than the guaranteed minimum under


Federal law so that this child would at least be assured


of the use of the full amount of the Federal benefit to


which they are entitled without set-off by the State.  The

State could add to it but it cannot, as Washington does,


subtract from it. 


QUESTION:  Instead of --


QUESTION:  Is it not true that -- that in the


overwhelming number of cases, the Federal benefit is not


nearly enough to cover the care of the child, that the --


the average SSI payment doesn't make it to cover the


monthly needs? 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  Nor does the payment that the


State makes under its foster care program.  In the -- in


the case -- in the specific case of the State of


Washington, the guaranteed minimum payment under Federal


Social Security law to an SSI-eligible child averages $715


a month.  The State of Washington pays the -- a stipend to


the household of that child of some $300 to $400 a month 

depending on the age of the child.  That means --


QUESTION:  But now if we -- if we had the new


system now where you take the January check and you pay


for March or April with it, then the other things that


you're complaining about, the double dipping, what you


allege -- and they may say, no, it's not happening -- the


proper forum to determine that would be the Social


Security Administration.  Wouldn't it be? 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  In this case, the claim was


brought under State law against the State of Washington

for using the benefits in a way that was inconsistent with


Social Security law.  The State of Washington offered


as -- by way of defense, that it was complying with


section 405(j) and that section 407(a) did not apply to


it.  But the State law claims for conversion and misuse of


the benefits remain and are not dependent on -- they're


dependent on establishing, as we have, that the State was


misusing the benefits, but they're not dependent on the


availability of a direct remedy under the Social Security


rules. 


Moreover, section --


QUESTION:  There's one -- one question that I'd


like you to ask because it's really troubling me more than


anything else here.  We have a brief from the Children's


Defense Fund that says most of these children don't have a 

Wanda Pierce.  They have no one but the State.  They have


no one to make out an application to Social Security


Administration.  Were not the State agency operating the


way it is operating, there simply would be no benefits, no


Social Security, no -- no SSI.  There would be that much


less available for the care of all these children in the


system. 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  This is exactly true that what


the State of Washington is doing is using the Federal


funds that are intended for the individual benefit of

disabled children and children who are SSA recipients to


fund the general foster care system. 


QUESTION:  I asked you to answer that question. 


Is -- what the Children's Defense Fund is saying is that


because Washington is doing what it is doing -- and it is


doing it because it's going to get -- it's going to get


the Federal Government to pay, as these benefits were


designed to pay, for the food, clothing, and shelter of


the child -- that there would be no one to do this and


there would be less money in the entire system.  And


that's the question I asked you to answer, not another


question. 


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  We believe that States will


continue to serve as representative payees even if they're


compelled to administer the benefits in a way that is 

consistent with the Social Security rules.


QUESTION:  What's the basis for that belief?


MS. ROSEBOROUGH:  The basis for that belief is


that the State receives enormous benefit from having


available to itself the Federal benefits and being able to


expend those benefits in the best interest of the child


and to pay for those things that come within the defined


needs of the disabled children.  It has no reason to give


up that money.  And we don't ask it to.  What we do ask it


to do is to administer those funds properly under the

of the child.  That's exactly what the Social Security


Administration has consistently required of representative


payees. 


In this case where a State had -- where a child


has already received public assistance, which is in part


State and in part federally funded, for a State to use


another Federal benefit that the child receives to


reimburse the expenditures not only of the State dollars


but also of the Federal dollars that were provided to the


State under that program for the use of the child is an


abuse of the representative payee system.  It is a -- and


is a disservice to the disabled child. 


Social Security disability benefits were


intended to provide for the special needs of the disabled


child, to assist them in the transition to adulthood, and


to provide them some relief from the burdens of their


disability.  In the State's concept, as it would use those


funds, without any heed to the best interests of the


child, no dollar of Social Security benefits received by a


disabled child before they reach their 18th birthday would


be available to meet those special needs because the State


of Washington refuses to acknowledge an obligation under

the Social Security laws to determine what expenditure is


or is not in the best interest of the child. 


2040(d) does not provide that a -- any payment


of a benefit is current maintenance if -- as long as it


was for food, clothing, or shelter.  It makes a clear


demarcation between -- and the example in the regulation


makes clear -- between benefits that are used at the time


they are received to provide for care and benefits that


are sought to be used for care that was provided before


that.  We simply ask that the Court apply the generally


applicable Social Security benefit regulations to the


State of Washington's use of the funds for reimbursement.


If there are no further questions. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Roseborough.


General Gregoire, you have 4 minutes. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINE O. GREGOIRE


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MS. GREGOIRE:  Where is the legal process in


this case?  There is in fact none.  The only thing that's


being suggested is reimbursement is the legal process.  In


the case of Title II benefits, an individual is eligible


in January.  Social Security doesn't pay until February. 


That has to be construed as reimbursement.  Counsel's


interpretation would then turn the entire program on its


ear.  The fact of the matter is that is not legal process.

It's what --


QUESTION:  Your definition of legal process is a


process that requires judicial involvement?


MS. GREGOIRE:  Judicial, quasi-judicial.  If an


individual has the authority by law and -- who goes out


and -- and actually implements something that takes the


benefits, but it's more than reimbursement as we have --


QUESTION:  Well, that's what your adversary has


-- has stated, that this is pursuant to authority of the


law.  That's why it's legal process.


MS. GREGOIRE:  We would submit, Justice Kennedy,


if you look at Bennett and Philpott, what this Court found


in both those cases was legal process was actual in the


one case in implementation of a lawsuit; in the other


case, the actual attachment. 


We have nothing of that nature here.  We have a


simple -- in answer to your question about is the State


asking for special rights, to the contrary.  The State is


simply asking not to be disadvantaged, to be treated no


different than any other representative payee which was


your holding in Philpott.  So the fact of the matter is


here we're simply asking to do that which any parent would


do in fulfilling his or her responsibilities in caring for


a child. 


Let me also, if I can, turn to the -- the Social

Security reimbursement idea of -- of using it in the best


interests of the child.  What counsel has suggested is the


only thing that's in the best interests of the child is


extras.  The State of Washington pays thousands of dollars


for these children because they come with psychiatric


kinds of needs.  We are not paying the minimum.  We are,


in fact, paying significant amounts of money.


In the case of one of our randomly selected


children, Nacole Blimka, in one month, over $2,000. 


In the case of another randomly selected child,


Denita Smith, in one month, over $3,000.  And yes, we held


the benefits, got no reimbursement whatsoever, to help


Denita Smith be reunited with her parent so that her


parent could set up a home, pay for the food and the


clothing and shelter that was necessary for that child. 

The fact of the matter is the State of


Washington does exercise discretion which is accorded it,


broad discretion in the best interests of the child.  She


would simply ask you only extras are in the best interest. 


We would submit supplying food, clothing, shelter is


always in the best interests of the child and that is what


Social Security suggests. 


She indicates that her complaint suggests that


there is some State law claims.  To the contrary.  The


complaint all the way along has suggested a 407 violation.

 She further suggests that R.C.W. 74.13.060, the


statute in question here, is mandatory.  To the contrary,


it is not.  It allows the State discretion to use Social


Security benefits for the special needs of a child and to


reimburse the State which is precisely what occurs in this


particular instance. 


I ask you to return to the question presented. 


Is there a violation of 407(a) in this case because a duly


designated representative payee, supervised by the Social


Security Administration, is using the monies for the


current maintenance of the child.  The plain reading of


407(a) to that question is no.


With that, we would ask you, respectfully, to


reverse the decision of the Washington State Supreme


Court.  Thank you. 


JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, General Gregoire.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
