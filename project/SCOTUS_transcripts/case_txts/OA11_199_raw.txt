CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 11-199, Vasquez v. United 
States. 

Mr. Brindley. 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BEAU B. BRINDLEY 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. BRINDLEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

When determining whether an error affects 

substantial rights pursuant to the harmless-error 
statute, courts should first begin the analysis with the 
error itself, consider it in the context of the entire 
record, determine what potential impact it may have, and 
then ask the question:  Can the government prove to the 
requisite degree of certitude -- in this case, fair 
assurance -- that the error did not substantially impact 
the verdict of the jury that heard the case? 

It is impermissible for the reviewing court 
to merely ask the question of whether some other jury, a 
reasonable jury that didn't hear the error that this 
jury heard, would convict him and determine harmlessness 
on that basis.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My problem --
MR. BRINDLEY:  Yes. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- is I can accept that 

formulation certainly for purposes of this case.  I just 
don't see where in the opinion -- I have the opinion of 
the court of appeals -- it focused on the wrong test. 

It didn't use the magic words, and it 

started out with let's look at the big picture, and it 
said, well, here's the defense he elected to put on, and 
this is a tough sell because.  But then it quotes what 
happens with the jury.  It -- and it -- and it ends its 
analysis for -- saying:  We -- this evidence would have 
moved the jury to convict Vasquez without a nudge from 
anything it heard in the government's case. 

I just -- I just don't see that you have 

supported your theory by what the -- by what the court 
says. 

MR. BRINDLEY:  Before the harmless-error 

analysis, the question the Court asks is, what we have 
to decide is whether a reasonable jury would convict him 
absent the error.  And so, the question that they ask 
doesn't require any consideration of the error.  And the 
conclusion they reach that he would be convicted without 
any consideration of the error also doesn't consider the 
error.

They do not address the error or its impact 

at all, despite a robust dissent, which set forth the 
extraordinary prejudicial possible impact of this error. 
They don't disagree with the dissent; they simply don't 
address it at all. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you tell me what 

the error actually was?  I see -- and you can add 
another -- three potential things about these calls or 
three potential errors:  One, that they proved as a 
matter of fact that she was biased.  But, as the 
majority points out, she already said she was before the 
tapes were played.  So, whatever error may have been 
occasioned by the jury using the tapes as for the truth, 
it really was cumulative to an already admitted bias. 

The second is some sort of ambiguous 

statement by her that all of them were in trouble, 
meaning all the defendants, and a similar statement by 
the -- by Petitioner's lawyer.  So, what was it that was 
error that affected or influenced the jury among these 
three choices? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  The -- the statements from 
counsel, two statements:  One, that everyone was going 
to lose the case, which was repeated several times by 
government counsel during the cross-examination of Ms. 
Perez.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It was never referenced 

in the summations, however, or in the reply. 

MR. BRINDLEY:  They were not specific -- the 

recordings were referenced, and they told them to look 
at the recordings.  They didn't reference that specific 
statement.  It was referenced three times in the 
cross-examination.  When the witness suggested that 
it -- who was going to lose the case only referred to 
her husband, the government corrected her and said, no, 
it was everyone.  And then they played the tape to make 
that clear. 

They also played a portion of a recording 
where it said that counsel was talking to Mr. Vasquez 
about pleading guilty.  Now, if you take those two 
statements together for their truth, what they mean is 
that counsel believes he's guilty and was telling him he 
should plead that way. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, that's the error 

that you think --

MR. BRINDLEY:  I think that's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- influenced this 

trial? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  I think that's the most 

substantial one. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Now, tell me

what in this record reflects that influence. 

MR. BRINDLEY:  Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The fact that they asked 
for her testimony -- well, she was your client's entire 
defense.  So, what does the asking for her testimony 
show that they were interested in that particular part 
of the transcript? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  Well, asking for her 

testimony shows that they were focused on the -- they 
were asking for a transcript that would have contained 
that part of the record.  We don't -- we can't prove, 
and we don't have the burden -- I think that's 
important -- to prove that she -- they were focused on 
that specific statement.  However, they did ask for that 
transcript. 

I also think they rendered the split verdict 

in the case, which is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Which transcript?  The 

transcript of her testimony? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  Her testimonies, both on 

direct -- and then they asked for both, plural, 
indicating they wanted the rebuttal testimony, which 
would have included these statements. 

And I don't think there's any way for the 

government to prove on this record to any degree of

assurance that they weren't concerned about that error, 
an error that I think if they took these things for 
their truth, then they could have thought he essentially 
confessed to his lawyer.  His lawyer knew he was guilty. 
Those are fair inferences if taken for their truth.  And 
then they could have disregarded all arguments that were 
made on his behalf.  That's a sort of error that could 
infect the entire proceeding. 
And when you ask --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Is it correct that the 

difference between your position and the Government's 
position is that the Government says the focus should be 
on a rational jury, and you say the focus should be on 
this particular jury? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  That is one of the important 

differences.  I think --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that I understand. 

But beyond that I really don't understand the difference 
between the two positions. 

MR. BRINDLEY:  I -- well, in the 

Government's brief, at some times, as we indicate in our 
reply, it seems that they support a very similar test to 
ours, and at others, it seems like they want to say that 
you can just look at a reasonable jury and how they 
would view the evidence.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me -- let me read 
you two sentences and tell me whether you think there's 
a difference between them.  First one:  "Is there a fair 
possibility that this particular evidence caused the 
jury to convict?"  Second statement:  "Is there a fair 
possibility that this jury would have" -- "that this 
jury would have convicted without the evidence?" 

Do you see a difference between those two? 
MR. BRINDLEY:  I do. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  What is the difference? 
MR. BRINDLEY:  The difference is one of them 
was going to focus on the entire record, which includes 
the error.  The other is going to focus on the evidence 
in the record without the error, and that's important, 
particularly with an error like this, an error that 
could have a pernicious effect that could affect a 
large, substantial part of this evidence, everything the 
defendant presented.  Itâ€™s really --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could I --
MR. BRINDLEY:  Yes. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- stop you there? 
I -- where in the Government's brief do you 
see the statement that the analysis should not look to 
the error, should not include the error? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  Part of the Government's

brief asserts that you can look at whether a reasonable 
jury would convict him absent the error.  That 
assessment doesn't require a consideration --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where -- where --
MR. BRINDLEY:  -- of the error. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where exactly is 

that in their brief?  That the -- the question is 
whether a jury would convict him without considering the 
error.  Because I look at the Government's brief, and 
they have fairly extensive analysis of -- of the error, 
why they think it's not important, why they -- you know. 
But I don't see them saying you don't look at the error 
at all. 

MR. BRINDLEY:  I think there's a 

significant -- I don't have the exact citation. 

On page 29, Your Honor, it indicates: 

"Although the Court's analysis often has not focused 
exclusively on the overall strength of the government's 
proof, its decisions demonstrate that a court's 
determination of harmlessness can properly rest on the 
conclusion that the admissible evidence of guilt is 
sufficiently strong such that the prejudicial effect of 
erroneously admitted evidence can be deemed not to have 
altered the outcome." 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, exactly.  In

other words, you look at the prejudicial effect of the 
erroneously admitted evidence and see if that altered 
the outcome. 

MR. BRINDLEY:  If that's the -- and there's 
parts of -- the Government's brief, I think, agrees with 
us in large part on what this test should be.  And as 
far as that goes, I think the problem is the majority 
below asked a different question and appeared to do a 
different analysis. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What would you point at in 
the majority opinion below that suggests that they did 
an analysis that didn't look at the error and its 
possible prejudicial effect? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  Two things:  First, the 

question that they asked.  The question that they asked 
was whether a reasonable jury would convict him absent 
the error.  There is no focus on this jury that heard 
the case or this verdict.  And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Where -- where is that 

statement?  Where is that statement? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  In the -- you mean in the 

majority opinion? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes. 
MR. BRINDLEY:  It's immediately prior to the 

harmless-error analysis.

If we go to page 16A of the appendix to our 

cert petition, it states at the bottom of that first 
paragraph:  "On appeal, the burden lies on the 
government to prove that a reasonable jury would have 
reached the same verdict without the challenged 
evidence." 

That's the question they're asking.  That 

question doesn't --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but in the context 
of the opinion -- and this was my first question -- they 
then proceed to analyze -- and that's toward the very 
end of its discussion -- what happened in this 
particular case.  And it concludes, from this evidence 
we believe -- "This evidence we believe would have moved 
the jury to convict." 

MR. BRINDLEY:  I think the problem is they 

asked that question, which I think is the wrong 
question.  Kotteakos says you can't ask that question 
because you can't strip the error from the whole. 
That's the question they ask.  And to answer that 
question, you don't have to consider the error. 

Then I think it's important they didn't 

address the error at all; they didn't address its 
potential impact, despite that dissent which laid out 
that this is one of the most prejudicial errors you

could have in a trial.  They ignored it. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They say --

immediately after the sentence you gave us, they say 
"looking at the evidence as a whole." 

MR. BRINDLEY:  They do say that.  But then 

later on, in that same paragraph, they indicate that 
here's where the evidence was.  And I think it's 
important that the only evidence they talk about is the 
government's evidence, and they talk about it in a way 
that views the evidence in the light most favorable to 
the government. 

In their harmless-error analysis, they don't 

address Mrs. Perez's testimony, and they -- the more 
important thing is they don't address the error at all. 
They don't even disagree with the dissent's contention 
that it's this terribly prejudicial error. 

Instead, they do what many of the courts 
below have been doing when they do this guilt-based 
approach to answer this question.  They focus on the 
government's evidence viewed in the light most favorable 
to the government and then find, well, he could be 
convicted on that basis by a reasonable jury. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You didn't -- you didn't 

read the whole thing.  I -- it's a little hard to 
understand.  And looking at the transcript on page 769,

am I right?  I want to get my own understanding right. 
At that moment your client's lawyer, who they call 
"Beau" -- is that right? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  Yes, that was me, Judge. 

Yes, Your Honor, yes, it was me. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  All right. 
Your client's lawyer, namely you --
(Laughter.) 
MR. BRINDLEY:  Yes. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- has not yet seen the 

client; is that right?  They think you haven't seen the 
client yet.  They say somewhere you haven't even talked 
to him yet or -- he hasn't even talked to Beau.  He 
hasn't seen his lawyer yet.  They say that two 
paragraphs earlier. 

So, is that right, basically, that they 
think that, anyway?  You see at the top of the page, 
about six lines down:  He hasn't even talked to the 
lawyer yet.  He hasn't even talked to Beau. 

MR. BRINDLEY:  I think that actually what 

they're talking about was whether Mr. Perez's lawyer had 
talked to me, Mr. Vasquez's lawyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, they're talking about 
the lawyer.  All right.  And what you're trying to do, 
as far as I can read this, is they think what you're

trying to do is you want Perez to plead guilty.  Is that 
the fair thrust of this? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  There's some discussion 

between them --

JUSTICE BREYER:  What do you think it means? 
MR. BRINDLEY:  There's -- it's hard for me 

to tell exactly what --

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So, it's hard 

to tell what they're talking about, I grant you that.  I 
thought they were talking about trying -- that you 
thought it would be better if everybody got some kind of 
agreement worked out. 

And then she says, Perez's wife:  "How can I 
not worry?"  He says:  "I don't understand what's going 
on."  Which is fair comment.  "But it's not the way 
Beau -- he's putting it two different ways.  If he 
didn't explain to you the way, then, either -- then it's 
a different story.  If you don't ask him" --

Then she says:  "Yes, he's saying that 

everybody's going to lose.  He's saying that whatever 
he wants to say.  I don't believe him." 

Well, by the time I got through reading 

that, I wasn't certain what they were talking about, and 
I thought it sounded like they're talking about:  Let's 
all make an agreement or everybody's going to lose.

And -- and I could see that you could say 

that's prejudicial.  I could also see that the 
government could say it isn't prejudicial.  And it's 
pretty hard for me to read their opinion as thinking 
they were really not thinking about that error.  I mean 
that was -- or not an error.  I mean, of course, they'd 
be thinking about that; that was the issue. 
And as I read the opinion, they 

said, well, there's so much other evidence in the case, 
and in our opinion, this is weak enough that it didn't 
-- wouldn't have made a difference and -- and if you 
didn't, say, take it for the truth. 

And the other, dissenting judge, common, is 
thinking:  No, I don't know; you know, it's pretty hard 
to understand what it means, but there's an implication 
there the lawyer thinks he's guilty of some kind, and in 
context that might have made a difference.  So, he comes 
to a different conclusion. 

That's what I saw going on.  And I didn't 

see some big war of standards.  I just saw judges 
disagreeing about a fairly tough question in an 
individual case.  So, what can you say to make me change 
my mind and think this is a war of standards that we 
ought to --

MR. BRINDLEY:  Well, because -- I think -- I

think the most important thing is what I've already 
said, is the question they ask isn't about the error, 
and they don't address it at all.  And when you consider 
a dissent with that robust of language, the idea that 
they wouldn't address it at all is problematic. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So, would it satisfy 
you in your opinion if we said:  We aren't finding your 
opinion totally clear.  And, luckily, people don't have 
the right to send cases back to us on that basis, but we 
have the right to send cases back to you on that basis. 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE BREYER:  And, therefore, we would 
like you to clarify whether you do or did or did not 
take in the actual transcript page there, when you 
reached your conclusion. 

MR. BRINDLEY:  I don't think that would be 
sufficient, because I think the important thing here is 
that they be required to ask the right question, to 
focus on this jury that heard the case. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Brindley, I mean, 
I guess one difficulty -- and this is really repeating 
Justice Alito's question, but it seems that you're 
parsing things pretty closely.  If I ask the question 
whether an error altered the verdict, it seems to me I'm 
asking pretty much the same question as whether without

that verdict the -- whether without that error, the 
verdict would be the same.  That seems like just two 
ways of saying the same thing. 

Now, if what you're saying is put aside that 

formulation, there are lots of courts that are doing 
something wrong, which is that they're not looking at 
the error and its possible prejudicial effect at all, 
then I understand the argument; but then I ask the 
question, well, is that what this court did? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  And I think that the -- by 

asking the question in that way and talking only about a 
reasonable jury absent the error, when you start saying 
absent the error and you start looking at the evidence 
without the error, you're looking at a case the jury 
didn't hear.  And I think that's the biggest problem. 
If you're looking at a case the jury didn't hear, then 
the reviewing court sort of makes its own guilt judgment 
about a case they didn't hear. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, look, if you -- if you 

win, your client will get a new trial.  Let's suppose 
that the new trial is exactly like the trial that took 
place.  Every single thing is the same except the error 
is corrected.  All right.  Isn't that essentially the 
harmless-error analysis? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  No, I don't think so.

JUSTICE ALITO:  No? 
MR. BRINDLEY:  I don't think so, because I 
think if you do the analysis that way and you say the 
error is corrected, you don't take into account its 
impact.  The question has been to be whether it 
contributed to the jury's verdict, not whether the 
verdict would be the same in another trial.  That's 
where that Sixth Amendment problem that this Court was 
worried about all the way back in Kotteakos, and even in 
Neder, where this Court said to safeguard the jury's 
province, we have to do an exacting review of the entire 
record including -- that would include the error, 
obviously, and its impact. 

And here this court didn't address the error 

or its potential impact, and I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are you -- are you saying 
that it doesn't matter that the verdict would have been 
the same by this jury if the error had not been made? 
You're --

MR. BRINDLEY:  Yes, I am saying that.  I'm 

saying that the question --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're saying that the test 
is whether it contributed to the verdict, and if it did, 
it doesn't matter whether the same verdict would have 
been pronounced absent that evidence?

MR. BRINDLEY:  That is correct, Your Honor, 

20

yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, then, what is 

harmless error?  Every error is harmful.  Every error 
that's -- that's there contributes to the verdict. 
There's no such thing as harmless error. 

MR. BRINDLEY:  I think -- I don't think that 

should be the formulation of the test.  I think it has 
to have a -- what the government has to be able to do is 
prove to the necessary degree of certitude that the 
error doesn't substantially impact the verdict.  And the 
reason I --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what does that 

mean?  To say that it doesn't substantially impact the 
verdict means the verdict would have been the same 
despite this evidence.  But you're saying, no, that's 
not the test; you have to ask whether it contributed to 
the verdict.  The Government says, well, it did, but the 
verdict would have been the same anyway. 

That's what harmless error is, it seems to 

me. 

MR. BRINDLEY:  I think what the -- when you 
ask the question about whether the verdict contributed 
substantially to -- or, I'm sorry, whether the error 
contributed substantially to the verdict, what you're

doing is you're -- you have to then look at the entire 
record and you have to look at the error's impact.  And 
when you do that, you can make a determination whether 
there's anything in the record that would allow the 
government to prove to the right degree of assurance 
that it didn't. 

Now, you could -- it could be the case that 
you look at all of the evidence and you can say, well, 
in light of all the other evidence, the error was 
cumulative, or it was essentially uncontested.  And then 
you can find that error is harmless.  It couldn't have 
contributed to the verdict, and we know that to the 
right degree of certitude. 

I think the problem comes in when you're 
talking about this reasonable jury and whether they 
would convict without the error.  That's some other 
trial. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could we get a little 
more practical here?  I think I understood your basic 
argument, which is:  My defense was by this one woman, 
the wife of one of the codefendants.  She tells a story, 
and if the jury had believed her story they would have 
acquitted your client. 

MR. BRINDLEY:  Yes. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So, I am

assuming what you're saying -- and you can correct me if 
I'm wrong -- which is if we believe that the error 
committed affected her credibility in a meaningful way, 
that that deprived you of a defense.  Is that what 
you're saying? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  Yes. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Of the potential of 

convincing the jury. 

MR. BRINDLEY:  Yes, absolutely, in addition 
to the fact that the error -- if those things are taken 
for their truth, they serve as an independent basis for 
conviction, believing he had essentially confessed. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay.  Now, assuming 

that's your argument --

MR. BRINDLEY:  Yes. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- I go back to my 

question.  Okay?  Because what you said to me earlier, 
it wasn't about believing her or not; it was about 
believing the defense attorney when -- whether the 
defense attorney thought the defendant was guilty or 
not. 

MR. BRINDLEY:  I think that -- well, I think 
the two go hand in hand.  I think that if they take these 
statements for their truth, they could disbelieve her 
and the defense attorney who called her because the

defense attorney knew he was guilty and then called this 
witness to say otherwise.  I think that would in that 
situation make it appear as if she wasn't telling the 
truth.  And I think the important thing about this whole 
analysis --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's -- let's --
MR. BRINDLEY:  Okay. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you -- are you 

taking the position in this case that a reviewing court, 
under no circumstance, could conclude that this error 
was harmless?  Or are you taking the position in this 
case that the court here, the Seventh Circuit, I think, 
committed review error and we should send it back for 
them to do it the right way? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  I -- I am first saying that 
the court committed review error.  But I think -- I'm 
also saying on top of that if you do the error -- review 
properly in these cases, as we've asked the test to be 
formulated, then what this -- this case is going to come 
down to is really one question, and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, you're -- and 

you're agreeing with the dissenting judge, who I think 
did say this error is harmful. 

MR. BRINDLEY:  Yes, of course. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And so, you're not saying

that it's just that they didn't use the right formula, 
but you would say, given what occurred here, the 
importance of this witness, that -- that this was a --
this was a harmful error? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  Yes, absolutely.  I -- I 

think if you do the test appropriately and do the proper 
analysis focused on this jury and the potential impact 
of the error, then this is a harmful error. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Back to Justice --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is your argument something 

like this?  Let's assume there are 10 pieces of 
evidence.  Evidence 1 through 9 are properly admitted. 
Evidence item 10 is (a) wrongfully admitted and (b) so 
prejudicial that that's all the jury looked at.  There 
is a substantial likelihood of that. 

I think this is your argument:  If the jury 
was so obsessed, focused, transfixed by item 10, which 
was improperly admitted, what would happen if we 
concluded that this jury in this case on these facts, if 
they had looked at 1 through 9, would have convicted? 
What result? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  I think if you did the 

examination that way and didn't consider 10 at all, what 
you're saying is it's possible to convict on 1 through 
9, but you're not considering the possibility that you

could convict as an independent basis on 10.  And the 
government would have to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We're not only saying it's 

possible to convict, but that likely, probably would 
have happened. 

MR. BRINDLEY:  I don't -- well, if the error 

is the error in this case, that's number 10, then I 
think when you consider the possible impact, sweeping as 
it might be, I don't think there's any way on this 
record that the government can prove with fair assurance 
that that didn't infect the jury. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, my hypothetical is 
that the court of appeals says that if the jury had 
looked at 1 through 9, which was properly admitted 
before them in this trial, they would have convicted, 
likely. 

Now, we -- then the hypothetical is:  We 

don't think they did because this item was so 
prejudicial that all they looked -- that's all they 
looked at.  Is that what your argument is?  It seems to 
me that's stronger than the argument you're making.  I'm 
not sure even that works for you. 

MR. BRINDLEY:  I -- the formulation you've 
stated, I agree with that.  If number 10 is such that 
there's no way that they can prove that it didn't impact

the jury's verdict substantially -- and I don't think 
they can in this case -- then, yes, that's -- that's our 
argument.  And the one reason I think it's most 
important in this case is because this case comes down 
to -- at the end, we have -- you know, you have --
essentially it's a circumstantial case.  This isn't like 
Harrington or Schneble or the cases with direct evidence 
where this Court has found harmless error. 

This is a case where the ultimate question 

is, if you believe Mrs. Perez is credible, he's not 
guilty; if you don't, he is.  And in order to find 
harmlessness, you have to have a reviewing court on a 
cold record making that credibility determination, 
something that this Court has continually said a 
reviewing court is not in a position to do.  And when a 
case can be ground down to the point where it's going to 
come to a credibility determination about a witness the 
reviewing court did not see --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, maybe the majority in 
the court of appeals was wrong in its application of the 
harmless-error test.  I didnâ€™t think that was the reason 
why we took this, why we took this case.  What I'm 
concerned about is the test.  Now, the only aspect of --
the only thing that I understand that really 
differentiates your position from the Government with

respect to the test is whether the focus is on a 
rational jury or on this particular jury. 

And when you say the focus should be on this 
particular jury, aren't you calling for a speculation by 
the -- by an appellate court?  How is an appellate court 
supposed to tell whether this particular jury was 
different from a hypothetical rational jury? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  Because this -- the reviewing 

court has to look at everything in the entire record. 
That includes in this case the jury note.  It includes 
in this case the split verdict.  All of those things. 
And when you look at all of those things, you can get 
insight into the jury that heard the case and how they 
viewed it. 

You can also look at how a reasonable jury 
would view the case as heuristic device to get back to 
what this jury thought.  But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought -- I thought 

your main point -- yes, you said "this jury" rather than 
a hypothetical jury.  But I thought your main point is 
that what's wrong is to say strip out the infected 
testimony, take that out, look at the rest of the 
record, and if the rest of the record warrants 
conviction, no harmless error. 

I thought that what you're saying is that

the basic mistake is what -- what are they looking to; 
are they looking to all of the evidence, or are they 
just asking the question, let's take out the tainted 
evidence, see if there's enough to convict? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.  I 

agree with that.  The problem is the question asked by 
the majority strips out the error and it also focuses on 
the reasonable jury rather than this jury. 

And with that, if there aren't any further 
questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my 
time. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Mr. Brindley. 

Mr. Yang. 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. YANG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The harmless-error inquiry, as this Court 

explained in Neder and prior decisions, turns ultimately 
on one question:  Whether a rational jury -- and this is 
a quote -- "whether a rational jury would have found the 
defendant guilty absent the error."  Now --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Yang, that does raise 
the question that I think most separates you and Mr.

Brindley, and it's the question that Justice Alito 
suggested.  So, let me give you a hypothetical. 

Let's say that this jury was not out for 8 

hours but was out for 8 days.  And on the 7th day, a 
note came from the jury, and the note said we really 
think that these tape recordings are extremely 
important, but we're -- we're having a dispute about how 
important they are, and we'd like to listen to them 
again.  And they do that, and then they come back with 
this compromise verdict. 

Now, what you are suggesting is that we 

cannot look at any of that.  Essentially, the best proof 
that's available to us about whether the error in fact 
affected this jury's decision, you would have a court 
close its eyes to.  And I guess -- why would that be? 

MR. YANG:  Well, I don't believe our view is 

quite so firm.  I think, as a general matter, our view 
is that indications mid-deliberation of what a jury 
might or some subset of the jury might be considering is 
generally very unreliable.  And that, in your case, the 
Court shouldn't shut its eyes to that question, but what 
it should do is redirect the court back to the evidence 
that was before the jury.  Because if we're assuming a 
rational jury, there often is some correspondence; it 
should be an indication to go back and look again.

If the Court were to conclude, wow, the 

evidence was so overwhelming, so overwhelming that no 
rational jury would have, you know, had a problem with 
convicting absent the error, it's very unlikely that the 
situation that your hypothetical poses would result. 
So --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, let me make sure I 

understand what you're saying to me, that you're saying 
to me:  No, we didn't mean to say that that was 
irrelevant; we just mean to say that an appellate court 
should be cautious about it and look at that kind of 
evidence in the -- in light of everything else that 
happened at the trial. 

MR. YANG:  Ultimately, the appellate court 

should look back at what the jury was supposed to 
consider, the evidence in light of the instructions.  It 
should be a cautionary note but ultimately should 
redirect the court back to the evidence. 

And I think that focuses on, again, one of 

the two related legal points that Petitioner made in 
argument that I think there's real disagreement between 
the Government and Petitioner on:  one, the inquiry of a 
reasonable jury or a rational jury, which is the 
Government's view, versus this particular jury; and the 
related claim that the inquiry is how this influenced

the deliberative process, if it was like a factor that 
this jury might have considered in reaching its 
verdict --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't know how to 

separate out an admitted error situation.  And let me 
explain why, okay?  Let's assume the facts of this case, 
but instead of this tape recording, the improperly 
admitted evidence was a confession by the defendant. 
Would you be prepared to say that in a circumstantial 
case of guilt -- now, we've already said that 
confessions are one of the most powerful pieces of 
harmful error -- that in this, in a confession, that 
somehow this was still harmful -- harmless? 

MR. YANG:  Are we taking Marina's testimony 

out now? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR. YANG:  Okay.  If Marina's testimony was 

not in and you had the evidence here -- now, an 
unconstitutional confession, of course, would raise the 
bar, right? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's a different 

standard. 

MR. YANG:  We're going to --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's -- let's talk 

about it under the Kehota standard.  Let's talk about

the standard we're assessing. 

MR. YANG:  If you're -- all you're asking is 
a fair assurance, then I think you could get to the same 
result here, because what you -- when you take Marina's 
testimony out of the picture, there was really no 
defense at all.  What the government had was a strong 
case --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no, no.  He 

testifies, but he testifies to everything Marina said. 
Meaning, he -- when I used the word "confession," I'm 
sorry, I misspoke. 

He takes the stand.  He -- or doesn't take 
the stand.  He says everything he said to the police. 
And that confession that he was there, et cetera --

MR. YANG:  So, he testified to the substance 

of Marina's testimony, that he happened to just drive 
there? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  She called him --
MR. YANG:  Right. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- et cetera. 
MR. YANG:  And then the error is the same 

error? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It was improperly 

admitted.  Without Miranda --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- Miranda warnings. 
MR. YANG:  The tapes? 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Uh-huh.  Not the tapes, 

just the story. 

MR. YANG:  I'm a little confused --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right. 
MR. YANG:  -- because if he's testifying in 
court, the government is not putting him on.  He's going 
on as -- there's no Miranda question or anything. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  My hypothetical is not 
working for this reason, and I understand what you're 
saying.  It's hard to identify a comparable mistake. 
But my point is that -- doesn't the harmfulness of the 
error sort of vary with the strength of the government's 
case? 

MR. YANG:  Undoubtedly. I think that's right. 

Now, let --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If he had not run away, 

and the tapes were admitted --

MR. YANG:  We would have a weaker case, and 

it would be -- ultimately, these lines that the Court 
has to draw between a fair assurance or harmless beyond 
a reasonable doubt are guides to reasoned judgment by 
the court of appeals.  The Court has repeatedly 
recognized that this is a reviewing court's judgment

based on the record. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly. 
MR. YANG:  Now -- now --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And what the defense 
said was there's only one defense here, and it's the 
wife's defense that he was there by accident, not 
intentionally.  There was a lot of countervailing 
evidence to disprove that, but the question is could a 
reasonable jury have -- might have or could have 
credited that defense? 

MR. YANG:  Well, I'm not sure that that's 

Petitioner's view.  I mean, I would -- there's two 
aspects to this case.  We can talk about the fact-bound 
ins and outs of that, which is interesting in its own 
right.  But I think one of the key legal questions for 
the Court is what's the standard that the Court must 
apply.  And there's a real difference between 
Petitioner's and the Government here. 

And that standard the Petitioner has 

advocated is that this jury, as opposed to the 
reasonable jury, and that looking at this jury, you must 
look at the thought process of this jury to decide 
whether the error might have had some influence.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, you look at how the 

case was tried.

MR. YANG:  Well, no, I think the position 
about this jury versus a rational jury, in looking at 
the deliberative process, is entirely foreclosed by this 
Court's decision in Shinseki. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But, Mr. Yang --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, you just told me it 
wasn't, Mr. Yang.  Because -- well, I think that the --
that the reason why this jury versus a reasonable jury 
is important is whether you're going to take into 
account what you know about what this jury did:  how 
long it stayed out, what notes it wrote to the court, 
what eventual verdict it reached. 

And you just suggested to me that that was 

fair game to consider in this analysis, although one 
should be cautious about doing it. 

MR. YANG:  I should qualify that.  I didn't 

intend to give the Court the misconception that we're 
looking at this jury.  The ultimate question is whether 
a rational jury would have convicted absent the error. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, a rational jury is not 
the jury that I said stayed out for 8 days and sent back 
a note on the 7th day.  That's this jury. 

MR. YANG:  And the reason that I believe 

that the Court can use that as a benchmark to look back 
at the evidence is it is some indication of perhaps what

the evidence should be saying to a rational jury.  But 
the ultimate question is the rational jury. 

And let me give you a few examples from the 

Court's case law, because I think this really puts it 
beyond dispute that the real question is the question of 
a rational jury, what they would do absent the error. 
First, in Neder the Court explained that 

erroneous admissions of evidence or exclusions of 
evidence, just like an erroneous instruction on an 
element of the offense, or failure to instruct on a 
necessary element of the offense as was the case in 
Neder, will infringe on the jury's factfinding role and 
will affect the deliberative process in ways that are 
not readily calculable. 

The error in Neder was that the jury was 

instructed not to consider the question of materiality, 
which was an essential element of the defense.  And the 
Court specifically rejected that the -- that the fact 
that this jury didn't actually make a finding based on 
the evidence was not -- did not foreclose harmless-error 
analysis. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You're going back then to 

your position in your brief where you said that you 
would not include, in the harmless-error calculus, that 
the jury requested to hear Marina's testimony again, the

length of their deliberations, the divided verdict?  You 
said in your brief, at pages 32 to 35, that you would 
not include those. 

MR. YANG:  That's right.  Those types of 

indications are entirely unreliable and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I thought you 

answered Justice Kagan that you could take them into 
account, the court could take them into account but 
cautiously, not give them -- not give them undue weight. 
MR. YANG:  What I think the court should do 
is when you have a -- what is a much better indication 
or at least a -- of what this jury might have been 
doing, you use that as a reason to go back and look 
again at the evidence. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I suspect --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose you have a case in 
which, after the verdict of guilty, there's a motion for 
a new trial, and it's being heard by the trial judge, 
and the trial judge said:  I now acknowledge that this 
court committed error in introducing item 10 in 
evidence.  And the court remembers that when this came 
into evidence, the courtroom was quiet, the jury was 
transfixed, jurors were weeping.  This was the high 
point of the trial. 

That's wrong for the judge to say.  All he

has to say is, well, I have to ask whether items 9 -- 1 
through 9 would have been in, and some other jury, a 
rational jury -- so, that's the end of it.  Judges do 
the -- do what I suggested all the time. 

MR. YANG:  Well, we think that, again, the 

-- the inquiry that needs to be focused on is what a 
rational jury would do.  And let me give you an 
example --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's starting to look, Mr. 

Yang, very much like a directed verdict for the 
government on the part of a judge, because you're so 
abstracting it from this case and this jury and what 
this jury's reactions to everything that happened was 
that, you know, why not just go to the directed verdict 
route? 

MR. YANG:  This Court has repeatedly 

rejected that.  The reason it's not a directed verdict 
is you have a jury verdict.  You have a jury verdict 
that beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury has factually 
determined that this defendant is guilty of the offense 
charged, on proper instructions.  Then the question is: 
What remedy do you have? 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You do have a jury -- excuse 
me.  You do have a jury verdict, but you are giving us a 
formulation of the test that essentially pretends that

the jury is not there and that we know nothing about how 
it reacted to various things. 

MR. YANG:  The reason --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Sorry.  A question mark. 
(Laughter.) 
MR. YANG:  This I think can be answered if I 
could just get out a few of the Court's cases, because I 
think this shows the Court's rationale here and shows 
that our view has to be the right view. 

For instance, in a series of cases, this 

Court has concluded that the unconstitutional admission 
of a confession, either of the defendant or the 
codefendant, can be harmless when there is overwhelming 
evidence such that a rational jury would convict without 
the evidence. 

Now, if we're looking at what a jury would 
have considered, whether they were brought to tears or 
whatever, when you're talking about a confession, 
there's no doubt that a rational jury or any jury is 
going to have that far in the forefront of their minds 
when they are deciding guilt or innocence.  But the 
question --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I just don't 
see how you can do it without the error.  I keep going 
back to this point.  How about if the prosecutor had

done in summation the following:  Ladies and Gentlemen, 
whatever the wife told you disbelieve because the lawyer 
said he was guilty. 

MR. YANG:  I'm sorry.  I just --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The lawyer -- the 

prosecutor got up at the end of trial and said: 
Disbelieve everything the wife told you, because the 
lawyer said the defendant was guilty.  All right?  I'll 
go through all the other evidence I have that might 
prove that she was not telling the truth, but the 
central, most important piece of evidence in this case 
about his guilt is that the lawyer said he's guilty. 

Can you say that this jury was uninfluenced 

by that error? 

MR. YANG:  No. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because under your 

formulation --

MR. YANG:  No.  You can't --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- a rational jury would 

have convicted absent the lawyer saying that. 

MR. YANG:  That's right.  But this Court has 

repeatedly said, for instance in Rose, where the 
question was the jury was told to presume certain malice 
in a -- in a homicide, the fact that the error may have 
altered the basis on which the jury decided the case is

not the question; you look to the reasonable juror. 

Similarly in Pope, the Court said the 

question does not turn on whether the jury did not, in 
fact, have this error in mind when it found the 
defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, because --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You would -- you would 

take into account that the prosecution apparently 
thought this was important, so important.  The trial was 
over.  The prosecutor said:  Judge, I'd like to come 
back so these tapes can be introduced. 

That -- the -- we have the witness 

testifying that defendant is there by chance; he was not 
part of the scheme.  We have no direct evidence, because 
Cruz never spoke to this defendant, to Vasquez.  He's at 
the scene, we know that.  And an explanation, an 
innocent explanation, is given why he's at the scene. 
And then the government comes back, after everything is 
done, and says:  We want the jury -- we want these tapes 
to be before the jury. 

Isn't that -- don't we take into account 

that the government itself thought this was very 
important? 

MR. YANG:  I -- I think it's a factor that 

you consider, again, in directing the courts look at 
really what the trial evidence was.  I mean it, I think,

belies the facts of this case -- obviously, that's a 
hypothetical.  But when you look at how cases really 
develop, prosecutors don't focus on a fleeting, you 
know, sentence in a series of -- series of long tapes 
that weren't transcribed --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But my point to you is it 
wasn't fleeting if the government says we want to extend 
the trial so that we can play these tapes, all of them. 
And they contain not just the one statement.  There's 
the one statement that the trial will be bad, a trial 
will be bad for all of them, and they all -- that --
they should take a blind plea. 

MR. YANG:  I think when you look at what 
happened at trial, you see that the tapes were played 
for two reasons:  one, to show that Marina had bias 
because she was told by Petitioner's counsel that 
Petitioner's counsel -- well, she thought this --
Petitioner's counsel would be able to make motions and 
arguments on behalf of her husband at sentencing. 
And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The dissent pointed out 

that she admitted that before the tapes were played. 

MR. YANG:  Correct.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That she was testifying 

in the hopes of getting a lesser sentence for her

husband.  So, she -- the tapes weren't necessary for 
that. 

MR. YANG:  Well, the tapes certainly were 

reinforcing of that.  And, in fact, when the 
government's closing argument -- it did not reference 
anything about this -- what I think you and 
Justice Breyer correctly identified as a very ambiguous 
sentence in a series of long tapes.  And, remember, 
these --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was --
MR. YANG: -- the transcripts that are in the 

record are only one portion of the tapes.  So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What was your second --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was the line that 
the government, the prosecutor, repeated three times 
while she was on the stand, the exact line? 

MR. YANG:  The exact lines? 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes. 
MR. YANG:  This is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The government thought --

thought it was important for the jury to hear it, 
because they said it three times. 

MR. YANG:  Well, to be fair, I think you 

need to look at what's before and after it.  The 
government is focusing on three different statements

that are at issue in the case. 

The first one is that -- with some 

profanity, suggesting that her husband is not likely to 
succeed at trial.  The second one is that defense 
counsel suggested -- that she said that defense counsel 
suggested that everybody was going to lose.  And then, 
third, she thought everybody was in, again with 
profanity -- I'm going to paraphrase -- a bad situation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Yang, why does any of 
this have to do with her credibility?  Did the dissent 
say that the way this affected the jury was that it 
rendered her less credible?  I thought --

MR. YANG:  The --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that the dissent just 
said it's bad to tell the jury that even the defendant 
thought he was guilty -- or even the defendant's lawyer 
thought he was going to lose. 

MR. YANG:  The reason that this was in --

and I don't -- it's not contested here -- is because the 
argument was made that these statements equating 
Petitioner and Perez in terms of their level of guilt or 
their likelihood of being convicted is inconsistent with 
Marina's subsequent testimony that all of us -- you 
know, Vasquez just -- or Petitioner just showed up 
unknowingly because she asked him.  That was the theory.

It's not contested.  And, in fact, nothing 

that the jury heard in this case under Petitioner's 
theory would be different.  The only difference would be 
a limiting instruction that would simply say you can't 
take these statements for the truth of the matter. 

So, nothing that the jury heard would have 
been different.  When you read the short passage in the 
context of these tapes -- and the tapes, again, are not 
fully transcribed.  Petitioner asked for the entire 
tapes to come in at the -- at the tail end of the trial, 
which -- which was -- based on the government's showing 
that was uncontested that Petitioner was at the scene, 
he drove the $23,000 there, he waited with Perez and 
Cruz while the informant was coming back, he was there 
when the call was made to the informant that said they 
had the money. 

Now, there's some dispute over whether he 

said that, but certainly he was there when that call was 
made because that's what triggered the raid.  All of 
that was basically undisputed.  You've got all these 
calls that tie Petitioner to Perez -- to Perez, 
27 calls --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You're going over 

the evidence.  And I may simply be asking the same 
question Justice Kennedy asked earlier.  But let's say

you have a situation where it's the same thing, and at 
the -- you, know, and the improperly admitted evidence 
has the defendant saying:  I'm guilty, I'm guilty.  And 
the evidence is the same as all you've set forth at 
pages 2 through 9, very complicated, who's driving what, 
you know, kind of car where, and where they're meeting. 
And the jury goes out and comes back in 2 minutes:  You 
know, the guy said he was guilty. 

Is that a situation in which we're supposed 
to then go back, look at all the complicated evidence, 
and see if a jury would have convicted?  Or can we with 
a fair degree of confidence say that the error is what 
led the jury to convict? 

MR. YANG:  Well, I think the former, but let 

me explain.  And again, I'm going to go back to Neder, 
if I may, for a second.  In Neder, the jury never found 
an element of the offense.  Never did.  There's no 
question that the jury's verdict was affected by the 
failure to instruct.  In fact, it was not just a failure 
to instruct.  The district court told the jury this is 
not for them to consider.  And --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But critical to the Court's 

view in that case was that the -- the defendant could 
not have contested that element. 

MR. YANG:  Well, but if we're -- again, if

we're focusing on the legal dispute between us and the 
other side about whether we're looking at this jury or 
what a rational jury would do when you excise the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I would like very 
much to know what your answer is to Justice Kennedy's 
hypothetical and the Chief Justice's.  As I understand 
those hypotheticals, they're trying to imagine a case --

MR. YANG:  Right. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- where the particular 
piece of improperly admitted evidence -- we know from 
how the jury reacted, or the kind of evidence -- it's 
the kind of thing that could really make a difference. 
I mean, they were in tears, et cetera. 

MR. YANG:  And --
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, in my 
reading of this, which I once had to read about 100 
harmless-error cases, and it seemed to me -- and you can 
confirm or deny this -- that in cases like that, the 
judge who knows this is a tough case when the jury's 
feeling this way, asks himself or herself the question, 
could this illegally admitted evidence make a 
difference?  Could it have made a difference in this 
case?  Could it have?  And the answer is going to be 
"no" where that judge thinks a reasonable jury would not 
have thought it made a critical difference.

And that's just putting the same thing I 

think slightly differently.  But the answer in 
Justice Kennedy's case would be a judge just isn't going 
to think it has nothing to do with rationality.  If the 
jury's in tears, they're going to think it's a close 
case.  And, therefore, if in fact this could have made a 
difference, the judge says, yes, it's not harmless. 
And if the judge thinks, no, it couldn't 
have made a difference to any rational person, he's 
going to say "harmless."  Period. 

Now, that was my impression reading those 

cases.  And I felt that those hypotheticals were getting 
at that.  And -- use them.  Answer them rather than me, 
because that's what I'm interested in. 

(Laughter.) 
MR. YANG:  The answer is that in a case 

where the jury -- where you have some very provocative 
evidence, but there's also a very strong case that 
exists -- it may depend on the level of certainty that 
you need to get to, whether it's a fair assurance or 
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  But even in those 
cases, you can -- if the court looks at the evidence as 
a whole and says that there was so much evidence before 
this stuff came in, this bad -- this error came in, that 
a rational jury would have gotten to the same result,

that it would have convicted, then --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose -- suppose the 

judge concludes that both this jury that I had and some 
hypothetical rational jury would have been so focused on 
this evidence that that's all they would have looked at, 
but if they had looked at 1 through 9, the admissible 
evidence, they would still have found guilt. 

Is that -- is that what you're -- is that --
MR. YANG:  I think so, but let me give you 

an example. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- a proper application of 

the -- of the framework? 

MR. YANG:  I think so, but it's not, again, 
what a -- what this particular jury was doing, because 
we know, for instance, from Neder or in the confession 
cases, the jury hears a confession, an 
unconstitutionally obtained confession, 
unconstitutionally admitted, from the defendant, that is 
going to be -- right there.  You know?  A jury -- a 
juror could say:  Let's go home, we have a confession. 
It's out of his own mouth.  There's very little else to 
debate. 

But when the evidence is beyond that 

confession, so overwhelming that no rational jury would 
have gotten to a different result, and you could say

that with a fair assurance or if there's a 
constitutional error as it would be with a confession 
beyond a reasonable doubt, the Court says that this is 
harmless. 

And the reason that the Court's taking that 

inquiry is because it recognized -- the Court's long 
recognized that no trial is perfect, that there are very 
significant costs of retrial.  And so, the premise 
there --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you -- you are 

essentially saying, as I understand you, that if there 
was such a thing as a directed verdict in a criminal 
case, if the judge would say, you know, I will direct a 
verdict here because there's only one way a rational --
rational jury could come out. 

MR. YANG:  This -- that argument was 

specifically rejected by this Court in Neder.  The same 
question came up, and in fact, Neder is a much -- more 
difficult case for the government than this, because at 
least in Neder, the defendant had the argument that this 
jury could -- did not find guilt beyond reasonable doubt 
because it was never instructed to find an element of 
the offense.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Yang, I think you may be 

taking a harder position than you really need to.  Why

shouldn't the rule be that the -- the appellate court 
should look at what would be done by a rational jury, 
except in the kind of extraordinary circumstances that 
have been posited by Justice Kagan's hypothetical and a 
few of the other questions, simply because it's so 
difficult to determine what a -- what the jury was 
actually doing? 

We have a rule that prohibits consideration 
of what goes on in the jury room.  But suppose we didn't 
have that.  Suppose that it was all videotaped, and the 
jury didn't know what was going on, so you could -- you 
could watch it and see.  If that were the case, then 
surely the rule would be what would this jury have done? 
But most of the time, it's just speculation to tell what 
a jury -- what they -- did they come back quickly? 
Well, that shows that this evidence was so bad that it 
caused them to render a quick verdict in what otherwise 
would have been a difficult case. 

Did they take a long time?  Well, it shows 

it was a close case, and, therefore, any error might 
have tipped them one way or the other. 

You just can't tell. 
MR. YANG:  I'm -- I don't want to resist 
this too much, because I think we're fighting about 
things at the very extreme.  Most of the times that

we're talking about these purported indications from the 
jury, it's entirely ambiguous.  And the -- so, there may 
be well be extreme examples.  And I think those would 
rightfully influence a court's consideration in a case. 

But, again, when you have harmless-error 
cases in which we know for a certainty, as in Neder, 
that the jury did not find an element of the offense, 
the inquiry has to be, it has to be, on what the Court 
has repeatedly said in -- this is I believe on pages 19 
of our brief -- that the focus of the harmless-error 
inquiry is bringing the court's attention to the fact 
that the primary purpose of a trial is the factual 
question of guilt or innocence. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And you read --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, when you 

began, if I'm remembering correctly, you said there were 
two ways in which your position was different from Mr. 
Brindley's. 

MR. YANG:  Right. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  One I understand is 

that you look at a rational jury --

MR. YANG:  Right. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- and not the 

particular jury. 

What's the second?

MR. YANG:  Well, it's related.  His focus on 

the -- this jury I believe is seeing whether there's 
some influence on the process, deliberative process, 
even if the outcome would have been the same absent the 
error.  And so, he's kind of trying to get into the 
minds of the jury.  And this Court has repeatedly 
rejected that.  Again --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I ask you a different 

question, Mr. Yang, which is, you know, this difference 
in the formulation of the test, which I find it hard to 
wrap my mind around, but -- and it strikes me that 
there's two different ways of saying the same thing. 
But I'm told that there's a fair bit of scholarship out 
there which suggests that courts that use one 
formulation tend to come out one way, and courts that 
use the other formulation tend to come out the other 
way. 

And I'm just wondering what your view of 

that is, that somehow one formulation seems to put the 
emphasis on the entire case, whereas the other 
formulation seems to put the emphasis on only the 
government's evidence, and that that makes a difference 
in the end.

 MR. YANG:  We don't think that there is this 

deep -- there are some disagreements or some things we

disagree with about what courts of appeals do in any 
particular cases.  But with respect to this formulation 
of the -- I think Petitioner calls it the guilt-focused 
versus effect-of-the-error-focused approaches, the 
scholarship -- I think he relies principally on Judge 
Edwards' opinion about harmless error.  That came out in 
1995, when it was already swimming against -- upstream 
against this Court's harmless-error decisions. 

But he had in his pocket the Sullivan 

decision, which was admittedly a structural-error case, 
but there was language in Sullivan which suggested that 
you need to look at what this particular jury was going 
to do. 

Then we have Neder and -- I can't pronounce 

this very well -- but Recuenco.  It's the -- the 
Apprendi application of Neder, which specifically rejects 
this kind of broad logic in Sullivan as being 
inconsistent with the Court's harmless-error cases. 

Now --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You do agree -- you do 

agree that the government has the burden of showing that 
the error is harmless? 

MR. YANG:  Yes.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's the government's 

burden.  And you also agree that we should look at the

evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant in 
making --

MR. YANG:  No.  The Court, even in -- I 

think most recently, the Court explained in Shinseki, 
talking about Kotteakos, that you don't use these kind 
of presumptions or rigid rules.  And the reason that you 
do, that you're kind of looking from the perspective of 
a reasonable jury, is the jury has in fact found the 
defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  And then 
the question is, are you setting aside that verdict 
because -- do you think that this error was the thing 
that tipped the scales from not guilty to guilty?  And 
so, taking a look at the evidence, kind of with all 
presumptions favoring one side or the other, is not how 
this Court has conducted the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, what does it mean 

that the government has the burden?  What does the 
government have to do? 

MR. YANG:  The government has to show, as --
this is the formulation in Neder and which the Court has 
said in Neder is the same thing that applied in 
erroneous admissions or exclusions of evidence, that a 
rational jury would have found the defendant guilty 
absent the error, and that involves the three core 
elements we explained in our brief.  And then the Court

takes into account --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The absent error.  So, 

that means -- wait.  You look at just the evidence 
that's not tainted? 

MR. YANG:  In some cases you can do that, 
where the evidence is so overwhelming -- if I -- if I 
may finish. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Briefly. 
MR. YANG:  Briefly.  In some cases, you 

might do that.  In other cases where it's close or the 
evidence is not so strong, you need to look at the error 
to see if that error was going to be a dispositive thing 
in getting to guilt. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The Chief Justice allowed 
me to ask one question.  Could I amend your statement so 
that you would say a rational jury in all the 
circumstances of this case, given what this jury heard, 
would have? 

MR. YANG:  Yes.  It's -- in the position of 
this jury, based on the evidence presented to the jury, 
correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
Mr. Brindley, you have 4 minutes remaining.

MR. BRINDLEY:  I first want to address 

Neder, which Government counsel continually referenced. 
Neder talks about the reasonable jury, but Neder also 
limits itself to situations where the evidence is 
uncontroverted and inconvertible, I think because in 
those situations the difference between the reasonable 
jury and this jury would be deemed to be nonexistent 
because it would be impossible for the error to have an 
impact. 

Secondly, I think it's important to note 
from Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, if you don't 
consider the error, then even that extreme case, that 
would have to be ignored.  And so, I think the 
Government's formulation and the formulation used by the 
appellate court below would justify -- would lead to 
that bad conclusion. 

I also think that when you do that 

formulation, where you're talking about the reasonable 
jury and absence of error, the reason those cases come 
out different is because those courts think they don't 
have to address the error, which is I think what 
happened in the majority below, why they didn't address 
it despite the dissent.

 The other thing I think it's important to 

note is the reason you have to look at the error and its

possible impact and not just whether you could be 
convicted on the other evidence is because you say, 
well, he could be convicted on the other evidence.  If 
that's all that you're saying and you -- and it's not on 
the evidence which could independently in this case be a 
reason to convict, then I think you're making that guilt 
determination that this Court says is not supposed to 
happen.  And I think the majority's opinion below is 
consistent with that approach, and there's nothing in it 
to suggest that's not exactly what they did. 

I also think that in the end -- there was a 

mention of the limiting instruction; a limiting 
instruction would have cured this problem.  We assume 
juries would follow it.  That means they wouldn't have 
concluded that his lawyer thought him guilty and then 
put Mrs. Perez on the stand and concluded she wasn't 
telling the truth. 

What this error allows, what -- if taken for 
its truth, a jury could believe that he confessed to his 
lawyer.  They could disregard everything that was said 
on his behalf.  They could say we know that he's guilty; 
his lawyer knew he was guilty; we can convict him on 
that basis.  That's an error that can infect the 
entirety of the proceedings. 

And if you look at this jury and what they

heard, and the question comes down to whether Mrs. Perez 
is credible or not, there is nothing in this record the 
Government can point to that would allow a reviewing 
court to make that determination.  A reviewing court 
that didn't see --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Did the panel majority in --

did the panel majority in this case say anything that 
differs from what this Court has said about harmless 
error?  If we were to reverse, what would we point to in 
the panel majority's opinion that was erroneous? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  I think you would point to 

that first statement of the test where they say whether 
the reasonable jury would convict him absent the error, 
because Kotteakos says you can't strip the error out. 
This Court has never overruled Kotteakos. 

The other thing --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Hasn't this Court said 
exactly what Seventh Circuit said there?  In other 
cases? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  This Court has used, I think, 

dicta that has language of that sort.  But in those 
cases, what the Court does -- like in Harrington, they 
look at what the error was; they put it in the context 
of the whole case, and they can say the government could 
prove the jury didn't look at this to the right degree

of assurance, because it was cumulative, because --
there's no -- there's nothing --

JUSTICE ALITO:  You want us to say -- you 

want us to say we're reversing you, Seventh Circuit 
panel, because you said what we have said in prior 
cases, but we were wrong? 

MR. BRINDLEY:  I think the reason to reverse 

them is because that formulation has proven to lead to 
the wrong analysis, in all of these lower courts, this 
guilt-based approach; and it is not the law of 
Kotteakos.  This Court has never overruled Kotteakos. 

And to focus on it allows a guilt 

determination by a reviewing court that would be 
violative of the Sixth Amendment that this Court was 
concerned about in Kotteakos, that this Court was 
concerned about in Sullivan, that this Court was even 
concerned about in Neder, outside the scope of cases 
where the evidence is uncontestable. 

Because if you took these statements as true 

and then you came down to a question, well, is Marina 
credible or not, Mrs. Perez, there's nothing the 
government can do on this record to prove that the jury 
would have found her credibility differently because 
this Court can't figure that out on a cold record. 

It said so, many times.  It's not possible
