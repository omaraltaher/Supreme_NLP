ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. WAGNER


            8                    

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


            9              

MR. WAGNER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


           10    

please the Court:


           11              

On April 3rd of 1992, Judge Foster dismissed


           12    

criminal charges against Timothy Hall.  She noted on the


           13    

docket, case removed from docket, defendant deceased, and


           14    

then signed her name.  3 inches above that reference on


           15    

that docket sheet was the name, Bryan Saunders, in big


           16    

letters, court appointed counsel for Timothy Hall.


           17              

On April 6th of 1992, warrants charging Walter


           18    

Mickens with the capital murder of Timothy Hall came


           19    

before Judge Foster.  Judge Foster telephoned Bryan


           20    

Saunders and asked if he would receive the appointment on


           21    

that case.  He accepted that appointment. 


           22              

This case presents this Court with the


           23    

extraordinary circumstances of a judge appointing a lawyer


           24    

to a death penalty case when that judge knew or reasonably


           25    

should have known that the lawyer represented the victim

            1    

at the time of the victim's death.  As a consequence,


            2    

Walter Mickens has been deprived his constitutional rights


            3    

under the Sixth Amendment to conflict-free representation.


            4              

QUESTION:  In the U.S. -- in the Public


            5    

Defender's Office, couldn't this situation arise fairly


            6    

frequently?  Sometimes in a small office, somebody in the


            7    

office would have represented a victim many years before


            8    

on a totally different matter. 


            9              

MR. WAGNER:  Yes, it could.


           10              

QUESTION:  All right.  Well, if it arises fairly


           11    

often, then what kind of a rule would you suggest?  I


           12    

mean, does it mean that they have to -- public defenders


           13    

have a hard time.  I mean, they -- they can't -- you know,


           14    

they -- they can't have a thousand people in their office,


           15    

and sure enough, some members of the people -- sometimes


           16    

this will happen.  So, what kind of rule would you


           17    

suggest?


           18              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, the rule that's in place


           19    

here, the rule from Holloway v. Arkansas, the rule from


           20    

Cuyler v. Sullivan, the rule from Wood v. Georgia, is an


           21    

appropriate rule, and it's appropriate because it requires


           22    

that the trial judge or the -- or the judge in the case


           23    

knows or reasonably should know that there is, in fact, a


           24    

particular conflict.  So --


           25              

QUESTION:  But, Mr. Wagner, what difference

            1    

should it make from the point of view of the defendant


            2    

whether the judge knew or the judge didn't know?  You make


            3    

a sharp distinction between this case where the judge


            4    

knew.  But suppose Mickens didn't know and the judge


            5    

didn't know.  Why should Mickens be worse off?  In both


            6    

cases he doesn't know. 


            7              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, in Holloway v. Arkansas, this


            8    

Court announced a rule which if a defense attorney


            9    

presents to the court an objection on the basis of a


           10    

conflict of interest, and the court fails to inquire into


           11    

that conflict, then prejudice is presumed.  And the focus


           12    

of the Holloway decision was on the court's responsibility


           13    

to inquire into that conflict.


           14              

QUESTION:  But I was asking you what the rule


           15    

should be, not the rule -- I probably wasn't specific


           16    

enough.  I can't necessarily reconcile all the cases.  So,


           17    

if we were starting from scratch and you had a lawyer in a


           18    

-- in a public defender's office who many years before had


           19    

represented a victim, what should the rule be about


           20    

whether he can represent this person before him? 


           21              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, the rule should be, first of


           22    

all, if the -- if the court knows or reasonably should


           23    

know --


           24              

QUESTION:  Forget whether the court knows or


           25    

doesn't know.

MR. WAGNER:  Then it should be if there's an


            2    

actual --


            3              

QUESTION:  I want to know what the rule should


            4    

be. 


            5              

MR. WAGNER:  If there's an actual conflict, Your


            6    

Honor, as opposed to a particular --


            7              

QUESTION:  That doesn't help me.  If the facts


            8    

are that many years before the person represented the


            9    

victim on a different matter.  Now, what kind of a


           10    

standard is the judge supposed to apply? 


           11              

MR. WAGNER:  If the -- the attorney is compelled


           12    

to refrain from doing something because of his ethical


           13    

obligations to the victim, if there's that compulsion by


           14    

that defense attorney where he can't do certain things for


           15    

his --


           16              

QUESTION:  Fine.  I got it.  That's helpful.


           17              

Then why not just say, and that's what you have


           18    

to do here?  The judge should look into whether or not


           19    

your client was significantly harmed in the way you just


           20    

said because his lawyer couldn't do a proper job given the


           21    

preceding representation.  Why isn't that just -- that


           22    

would take care of all these cases just as you say.


           23              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, and if -- if the -- the judge


           24    

in this case had conducted that inquiry properly and had


           25    

determined whether or not Mr. Saunders had that -- that --

            1    

the compulsion to refrain from doing something on behalf


            2    

of Mr. Mickens, then in fact that would have been cured


            3    

right away and we wouldn't --


            4              

QUESTION:  Fine.  So, now he didn't do it.  Why


            5    

not just send it back and tell him, do it? 


            6              

MR. WAGNER:  Send it back and tell him to -- to


            7    

do the inquiry?


            8              

QUESTION:  Say where there's that prejudice, you


            9    

lose; if there isn't that prejudice, you don't.


           10              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, because this Court has -- has


           11    

provided that there's a fundamental right to conflict-


           12    

free representation. 


           13              

QUESTION:  Didn't -- didn't the district court


           14    

find against you on the -- on the point of whether there


           15    

was an adverse effect? 


           16              

MR. WAGNER:  They did in fact, Your Honor.


           17              

But that's not what the question before the


           18    

Court is.  According to Wood v. Georgia --


           19              

QUESTION:  The question before the Court is


           20    

whether, in addition to a Sixth Amendment violation, you


           21    

have to show an adverse effect. 


           22              

MR. WAGNER:  That's right.  That's right, Your


           23    

Honor. 


           24              

And we -- we would suggest to the Court that


           25    

under Wood v. Georgia, we aren't compelled to show an

            1    

adverse effect.  All we need to show here is an actual


            2    

conflict.


            3              

QUESTION:  But your answer to Justice Breyer --


            4    

correct me if I'm wrong -- was that there had to be some,


            5    

at least strong possibility of adverse effect in the


            6    

instance where he represented the victim years before.


            7              

MR. WAGNER:  And that's exactly what


            8    

distinguishes actual conflict from adverse effect.  With


            9    

an actual conflict, there's a compulsion to refrain from


           10    

doing something.  With adverse effect, there's an actual


           11    

lapse in representation, and -- and that's a significant


           12    

difference --


           13              

QUESTION:  Well, but here it seems to me that


           14    

two inquiries tend to become conflated in a case like


           15    

this.  If there's no adverse effect, that shows that there


           16    

was no conflict.


           17              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, I would suggest --


           18              

QUESTION:  And -- and that's quite different


           19    

from a case where there's multiple representation over the


           20    

defendant's -- over the counsel's objection.  I mean, we


           21    

could say that in that line of cases, prejudice is


           22    

apparent from the record.  It -- it -- a burden on counsel


           23    

inheres intrinsically in the representation to which he


           24    

objects. 


           25              

But that's not -- there -- there are hundreds of

            1    

different kinds of conflicts.  The -- the defense attorney


            2    

is a candidate for the prosecuting attorney in an upcoming


            3    

election.  One attorney has been interviewed -- the


            4    

defense attorney has been interviewed for a position in


            5    

the DA's office 4 weeks before. 


            6              

All of these things you say there's an absolute


            7    

requirement of a new trial without any inquiry into


            8    

whether there's an adverse effect?  This is an astounding


            9    

proposition.


           10              

MR. WAGNER:  Your Honor, I would suggest,


           11    

though, that the key issue here is in the trial court's


           12    

duty to -- to inquire into a conflict that it knew or


           13    

reasonably should have known.  And that was the focus of


           14    

Holloway v. Arkansas. 


           15              

QUESTION:  Yes, but Holloway and Cuyler were


           16    

both multiple representation cases where the trial court


           17    

could see the whole thing right before him at that time. 


           18    

This was not a multiple representation case. 


           19              

MR. WAGNER:  Your Honor, I agree.  But I would


           20    

suggest that in this type of case, it's even more


           21    

dangerous for the defendant that the court doesn't


           22    

initiate the inquiry.  In that case, at least the court


           23    

knows and the defendant knows that the co-defendant is


           24    

being represented by the same attorney.  In this case, Mr.


           25

conflict.


            2              

QUESTION:  May I ask if -- if in your view would


            3    

everything have been satisfactory, as a constitutional law


            4    

matter, if the judge had said, go ask your client if the


            5    

client has any objection, and the client had said, no, I


            6    

have no objection?  Would that have taken care of it?


            7              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, I believe that the court


            8    

should have indulged in some inquiry of the client


            9    

himself.  The court should have asked the client if he


           10    

understood everything that was involved in waiving that


           11    

conflict.  And in this situation --


           12              

QUESTION:  Excuse me.  You're -- you're


           13    

presuming a conflict.  I -- I really don't follow your


           14    

argument for that -- whether the judge had an obligation


           15    

to inquire into a conflict about which he knew or should


           16    

have known.  What he should have known was -- was not the


           17    

existence of a conflict, but simply that this defendant --


           18    

that the deceased had previously been represented by


           19    

counsel who's representing this defendant.  That does not


           20    

constitute a conflict. 


           21              

The -- what follows from that -- from that


           22    

relationship?  Does anything follow other than the fact


           23    

that the lawyer cannot, in -- in a subsequent


           24    

representation, disclose any confidential information


           25    

which he learned in the prior representation.  Right?

            1    

Isn't that the only thing that follows? 


            2              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, it is that, but there's also


            3    

ethical consideration 4-5 of the Virginia Code of


            4    

Professional Responsibility which states that anything


            5    

obtained by Mr. Saunders through his representation of


            6    

Hall could not be used to Hall's disadvantage. 


            7              

QUESTION:  That's fine, but that doesn't show a


            8    

conflict.  That shows at most the potential of a conflict,


            9    

and -- and you're representing it here as though there is


           10    

a conflict and -- and the judge had an obligation to


           11    

inquire into it.  But the whole issue is -- is whether


           12    

there was a conflict.  That hasn't been established at


           13    

all.


           14              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, I believe it has, Your Honor,


           15    

and it's been established because Mr. Saunders in this


           16    

case obtained confidential information from Mr. Hall. 


           17    

That's clear from the record.  The district court found


           18    

that.  And in preserving those confidences of Mr. Hall, he


           19    

was precluded from doing certain things. 


           20              

QUESTION:  Would you -- would you say what they


           21    

were?  Because it seemed to me that some of the things you


           22    

listed were just matters of record and not at all -- there


           23    

was one conversation between this lawyer and the client. 


           24    

We know it took place for 15 to 30 minutes, and that was


           25    

it.  And a number of your recitations do involve matters

            1    

of public record that would not involve betraying any


            2    

client confidence if Saunders brought them out.  So, what


            3    

was it that Saunders knew that was not available to the


            4    

public? 


            5              

MR. WAGNER:  First of all, all of this happened


            6    

in -- in juvenile domestic relations court, and under


            7    

Virginia law, all of those files, all of that information


            8    

from that case was confidential and couldn't be revealed


            9    

to the public. 


           10              

But nonetheless, even if it was public, under


           11    

ethical consideration 4-4 of the Virginia Code of


           12    

Professional Responsibility, which governed Mr. Saunders


           13    

at that time, he was absolutely required to preserve the


           14    

confidences and secrets of Mr. Hall regardless of the


           15    

source or nature of those confidences --


           16              

QUESTION:  So what?  So what?  Why does that


           17    

constitute a conflict?  Unless you connect up that


           18    

confidential information which he knew with something that


           19    

was relevant to the defense of his new client, there's no


           20    

conflict. 


           21              

MR. WAGNER:  I want to get to that point, and


           22    

the point is that in death penalty cases, it's absolutely


           23    

essential that the attorney looks into the background of


           24    

the client.  In this case --


           25              

QUESTION:  You're asking for a special rule in

death penalty cases? 


            2              

MR. WAGNER:  I'm not, Your Honor.  I believe --


            3              

QUESTION:  Well, they why do you -- why do you


            4    

stress the fact this a death penalty case? 


            5              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, I also stress the fact that


            6    

this is a sex case, Judge.  This is a case of forcible


            7    

sodomy, and also in that type of case, it's absolutely


            8    

essential for the attorney to look into the background of


            9    

the defendant --


           10              

QUESTION:  Well, isn't -- wouldn't that be true


           11    

in most criminal cases? 


           12              

MR. WAGNER:  It would be true that the -- the


           13    

attorney should look into the -- the background of the


           14    

victim.  Absolutely, Judge.  But I think it's particularly


           15    

true because of the sentencing phase in a death penalty


           16    

case.  In the sentencing phase of the death penalty case,


           17    

the attorney needs to -- or the team of attorneys need to


           18    

look into the background of the victim, need to engage in


           19    

a -- in brainstorming about the background and an


           20    

investigation about the background.  And Mr. Saunders


           21    

couldn't engage in that brainstorming, couldn't engage in


           22    

that investigation because he had to preserve those


           23    

confidences, and he had a duty of loyalty to Mr. Hall. 


           24              

QUESTION:  Well, this may not get us very far so


           25    

far as a general rule is concerned, but isn't your

argument, insofar as this case is concerned, pretty much


            2    

undercut by the fact, number one -- let's take an example. 


            3    

Let's take the issue that you -- you rightly stress about


            4    

the response to the victim impact evidence, the -- the


            5    

mother's testimony.  Isn't your case pretty much undercut


            6    

here by the fact that the information, on the basis of


            7    

which defense counsel could have responded to the mother's


            8    

testimony, had already been published in a newspaper? 


            9              

And isn't it also undercut by the fact that


           10    

there was co-counsel here and there is no claim that co­

           11    

counsel had any conflict, actual or potential.  So, if we


           12    

-- even if we accept your -- your premise that proof of


           13    

conflict would be enough in this situation, don't you lose


           14    

anyway?


           15              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, as to the newspaper issue,


           16    

Your Honor, under ethical consideration 4-4, it doesn't


           17    

matter where the information is in the public.  That


           18    

attorney has an absolute responsibility to maintain those


           19    

confidences and secrets.


           20              

QUESTION:  But there's no confidence --


           21              

QUESTION:  It's no longer a secret.  How can you


           22    

keep a secret that is no longer secret? 


           23              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, because the ethical


           24    

considerations in the Virginia Code of Professional


           25    

Responsibility required Mr. Saunders to do that.

QUESTION:  Require somebody to keep a secret


            2    

that is something that is no longer a secret?  I don't


            3    

think that's what they require. 


            4              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, I don't believe that -- that


            5    

an attorney under those circumstances can pursue anything


            6    

from the confidences and secrets that he --


            7              

QUESTION:  All right.  But I -- I don't --


            8              

QUESTION:  He can pursue it from the newspaper. 


            9    

He doesn't have to pursue it from his confidential


           10    

knowledge.  He can pursue it from -- from the newspaper.


           11              

MR. WAGNER:  I would simply suggest, Your Honor,


           12    

that that's contrary to what is -- is provided in the


           13    

Virginia Code of Professional Responsibility. 


           14              

QUESTION:  All right.  I find that -- I find


           15    

that hard to accept, but I'll accept it for the sake of


           16    

argument. 


           17              

MR. WAGNER:  As far as --


           18              

QUESTION:  And that gets us to co-counsel.


           19              

MR. WAGNER:  Absolutely, Your Honor.


           20              

QUESTION:  Co-counsel wasn't bound by that


           21    

because co-counsel hadn't represented the victim.


           22              

MR. WAGNER:  That's right.  That's right.  But


           23    

the fundamental right to conflict-free representation is


           24    

not that you -- you have unconflicted counsel.  It's that


           25    

you have conflict-free representation.  The fact that he

may have had 10 unconflicted attorneys makes no difference


            2    

in this case.  The fact that he has one conflicted


            3    

attorney is enough to poison the well. 


            4              

QUESTION:  One apple spoils the whole barrel?  I


            5    

mean, is --

MR. WAGNER:  I'm sorry?

QUESTION:  I mean, one bad apple spoils the


            8    

whole barrel? 


            9              

MR. WAGNER:  That's what we're suggesting.  If


           10    

that one bad apple was, in effect, trying to sabbotage the


           11    

defense in that case --


           12              

QUESTION:  Well, is there -- is there anything


           13    

close to that sort of a showing here, that this -- the


           14    

lawyer was trying to sabbotage the defense?


           15              

MR. WAGNER:  No. 


           16              

QUESTION:  Then why -- why do you make that


           17    

statement? 


           18              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, because if a rule of law is


           19    

to be promulgated in this case, I think that needs to be


           20    

anticipated.

QUESTION:  Well, but you're saying that if -- if

a person, say, has a team of six lawyers, if there's one

            3    

adverse effect or in the event where the judge failed to


            4    

inquire into a conflict that that judge --


            5              

QUESTION:  But I thought you were telling us you


            6    

don't inquire about an adverse effect.  I thought that's


            7    

your whole point.  Correct me, please, if I'm wrong.  I


            8    

thought you were arguing --


            9              

MR. WAGNER:  I may have misspoken.


           10              

QUESTION:  I thought you were arguing to us the


           11    

proposition that it is wrong to inquire into adverse


           12    

effect.  Once there has been a failure on the part of the


           13    

trial court to inquire, that's the end. 


           14              

MR. WAGNER:  That -- that's right, but in the --


           15              

QUESTION:  So then -- so then your argument


           16    

whether there's an adverse effect is completely contrary


           17    

to your own proposition. 


           18              

MR. WAGNER:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  I was


           19    

speaking more generally about general conflict of interest


           20    

cases where an attorney may be there to -- to sabbotage


           21    

the defendant.  In that situation, if there was no duty of


           22    

the trial court to inquire, then you would have to go the


           23    

actual conflict/adverse effect analysis, and that question


           24    

will have to be addressed.

            2    

known of the conflict and failed to inquire, then of


            3    

course, you're absolutely right.  There would be no --

QUESTION:  This is the -- this is the second


            5    

time, Mr. Wagner, you've referred to an attorney being


            6    

there to sabbotage the defendant.  You feel that's


            7    

something that fairly frequently happens? 


            8              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, I'm not saying that it fairly


            9    

frequently happens. 


           10              

QUESTION:  I would think you would be very


           11    

careful about making a statement like that.

MR. WAGNER:  Absolutely, Your Honor.


           13              

QUESTION:  Then why did you make it? 


           14              

MR. WAGNER:  I made it because I think it's a


           15    

compelling point.  I believe that -- that it can happen.


           16              

QUESTION:  Why is it a compelling point if it


           17    

hardly ever happens? 


           18              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, it may very well be in this


           19    

case that Mr. Saunders was trying to sabbotage.  We don't


           20    

know all of the confidences and secrets that he obtained. 


           21    

We don't know everything about his reasons for accepting


           22    

this case knowing that he had represented the victim in


           23    

this case and performing in this case in the way he did,


           24    

failing to look into a consent defense in this case,


           25    

failing to investigate critical information in this case.

We --


            2              

QUESTION:  All right.  So, if you're right then


            3    

on this point, then there was loads of prejudice. 


            4              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, there would be if we had --


            5              

QUESTION:  All right.  So, what are we supposed


            6    

to do then in your view? 


            7              

MR. WAGNER:  What -- what --


            8              

QUESTION:  I mean, use -- send it back?  I


            9    

thought they found no prejudice.  So --


           10              

MR. WAGNER:  The district court, in fact, found


           11    

no prejudice, Your Honor. 


           12              

And -- and what we're saying in this case is,


           13    

first of all, to adopt the rule of Wood v. Georgia, the


           14    

rule where if we show an actual conflict --


           15              

QUESTION:  Mr. Wagner, may I stop you there? 


           16    

Because it seems to me, reading the Wood v. Georgia case


           17    

and those facts, in those -- in that case the actual


           18    

conflict and the adverse effect coincided.  If the lawyer


           19    

were loyal to the employer and the employer was interested


           20    

in setting up a test case, then that very conflict would,


           21    

at one and the same time, establish the adverse effect. 


           22    

Therefore, I could not take from the Wood case what you


           23    

are urging this Court to take. 


           24              

And if that's so, then the Wood case is in no


           25    

different category.  It's a case where adverse effect has

            1    

been claimed and the two are not distinguishable.


            2              

MR. WAGNER:  I understand, Your Honor.  And --


            3    

and if you look to the Cuyler v. Sullivan case, Cuyler v.


            4    

Sullivan very specifically draws out a test in which you


            5    

must show both actual conflict and adverse effect.  If you


            6    

then look to the dispositional paragraph of Wood v.


            7    

Georgia, that speaks only of actual conflict, and it


            8    

speaks of it three times.  In Wood v. Georgia, the only


            9    

requirement upon a showing that the defense attorney had


           10    

not inquired into the conflict but that the judge knew or


           11    

reasonably should have known of the conflict is that there


           12    

be an actual conflict showing.  And again, it's three


           13    

times in the dispositional paragraph. 


           14              

QUESTION:  But if, on the facts of that case,


           15    

those two are opposite sides of the same coin -- there's


           16    

no -- if you show one, then you inevitably show the other


           17    

-- then how can we extract the words of the decision from


           18    

the fact background against which Justice Powell was


           19    

writing?


           20              

MR. WAGNER:  I don't believe that you


           21    

necessarily show one by showing the other.  In an actual


           22    

conflict situation, it's really the potential of a lapse


           23    

in representation that the Court focuses on.  When you get


           24    

to the actual -- the adverse effect, then it is the actual


           25    

lapse of -- of -- in representation.  So, it's the

            1    

potential in the actual conflict versus the actual lapse


            2    

in the -- in the adverse effect, the impeded


            3    

representation in that case.  So --


            4              

QUESTION:  Well, you are making a nice statement


            5    

in the abstract.  I'm trying to bring it down to earth in


            6    

the Wood case, and I said, well -- you answered both


            7    

questions if the employer has a conflict -- if the lawyer


            8    

has a conflict because the employer's interest diverges


            9    

from the employee's. 


           10              

MR. WAGNER:  Yes.  And in that case, the Court


           11    

did actually find -- in Wood v. Georgia, did find an


           12    

actual conflict, found that there were competing


           13    

interests, and sent it back to the trial court to


           14    

determine whether or not there was an adverse effect. 


           15              

QUESTION:  I thought the Court found nothing


           16    

because it raised this question on its own.  It was never


           17    

briefed and argued. 


           18              

MR. WAGNER:  I'm sorry. 


           19              

QUESTION:  And we said you find out about this,


           20    

lower court.  We were supposed to hear another question


           21    

entirely.  We found that there is this lurking issue that


           22    

should be decided first.  There was no briefing.  How can


           23    

you use that as establishing a whole new category, a case


           24    

like that where the -- the Court didn't even have the


           25    

benefit of briefing on the issue?

            1              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, again, I would point to the


            2    

dispositional paragraph and the very language, the precise


            3    

language of the case of Wood v. Georgia that said, we --


            4    

you know, if -- if the defendant fails to inquire and if


            5    

the judge knew or reasonably should have known or if the


            6    

defendant fails to advise the court of a conflict and if


            7    

the -- the court knew or reasonably should have known of a


            8    

conflict and failed to inquire, all that needs to be shown


            9    

is an actual conflict, and didn't mention adverse effect. 


           10    

That -- that's as specific as I can get in -- in that


           11    

specific case.


           12              

And you're right, Your Honor.  I misspoke.  They


           13    

did not find an actual conflict but sent it back to the


           14    

court to determine if there was an actual conflict, back


           15    

to the -- to the court that -- that did the probation


           16    

revocation hearing in that case to see if there was, in


           17    

fact, an actual conflict.  And -- and that's what the


           18    

Court found, just that the court had to find an actual


           19    

conflict, and if it did find an actual conflict, then that


           20    

case appropriate for reversal.  And that's what we're


           21    

asking.


           22              

QUESTION:  I take it in any case at this point


           23    

you're not claiming the benefit of the Holloway rule.


           24              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, we are, Your Honor.  We --


           25              

QUESTION:  Well, but as I -- you correct me if

            1    

I'm wrong, but I thought if -- if you had the benefit of


            2    

the Holloway rule, you wouldn't have to show even an


            3    

actual conflict.


            4              

MR. WAGNER:  That's correct, but -- but it is


            5    

the part --


            6              

QUESTION:  Are you -- are you arguing that we


            7    

should adopt that rule?  I mean, if we did, that would --


            8    

that would answer the point that has just been raised.


            9              

MR. WAGNER:  No.  I -- I believe that the


           10    

Holloway rule was extended in Cuyler v. Sullivan, but the


           11    

Holloway rule focuses on the court's failure to inquire.


           12              

QUESTION:  No.  But you started -- at least, as


           13    

I recall back in your brief, you started out by arguing


           14    

that what puts the court on notice doesn't matter so long


           15    

as the court is on notice.  You said in Holloway counsel


           16    

raised it before the court, and you're saying in this


           17    

case, under the -- at least the rule that the court should


           18    

have known of the -- of the potential conflict, that was


           19    

the functional equivalent to counsel's raising it in


           20    

Holloway, and therefore the result should be the same.


           21              

As I understand Holloway, if the result were to


           22    

be the same, we would not even look any further into the


           23    

question of actual conflict.  We would say if there was


           24    

enough to put the court on notice, reverse.  And I take it


           25    

you're not arguing for that now, or are you?

MR. WAGNER:  We are not, Your Honor.


            2              

QUESTION:  Okay. 


            3              

MR. WAGNER:  And the reason we're not is because


            4    

of the component of Holloway v. Arkansas that deals with


            5    

the defense attorney's advisement of the court of the


            6    

conflict and -- and the importance that that --


            7              

QUESTION:  So, you're -- you're -- maybe I -- I


            8    

misunderstood your position when I was running through the


            9    

briefs, but you're not taking the position that Holloway's


           10    

counsel's advice to the court should be equated with the


           11    

court's kind of obligation under the should have known


           12    

standard that you argue for here.  You're not equating


           13    

those two.


           14              

MR. WAGNER:  I'm sorry.  I don't understand --


           15              

QUESTION:  I thought in your original argument


           16    

you were saying, look, in Holloway defense counsel said,


           17    

there's a problem, judge.  Here the judge knew or should


           18    

have known about the problem.  Those two facts are


           19    

equivalent, and I take it now you're not saying those two


           20    

facts are equivalent. 


           21              

MR. WAGNER:  They're equivalent to a certain


           22    

extent, but the fact that the defense attorney raised it


           23    

to the court has a certain significance.  As the Solicitor


           24    

General indicates in their -- in their brief, there is


           25    

some significance to the defense attorney raising that

issue to the court and the court's compulsion to inquire


            2    

into it at that point.  It's not as significant as the


            3    

trial court's role in inquiring into that conflict, but it


            4    

is significant.  And Wood v. Georgia takes that


            5    

significance, that component into effect when it requires


            6    

an actual conflict, a showing of an actual conflict --


            7              

QUESTION:  But, counsel, I'm a little puzzled at


            8    

this point too.  It seemed to me that you would have no


            9    

case if the judge were not on notice of the potential


           10    

conflict.


           11              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, I believe --


           12              

QUESTION:  You're not -- you're not arguing that


           13    

a lawyer could have this relationship and keep it secret


           14    

for 5 years and then come around and say, now set aside


           15    

the conviction. 


           16              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, Your Honor, we would say that


           17    

the adverse effect prong would not be required under the


           18    

circumstances where the judge knew, but we're not


           19    

conceding that we can't satisfy the adverse effect prong. 


           20    

But you're right, Your Honor.


           21              

QUESTION:  Well, but we're taking the case on


           22    

the assumption there's been a hearing and there's been


           23    

evidence that established an absence of adverse effect. 


           24    

At least I thought that's the way the case comes to.

            2              

QUESTION:  So, I thought the key to your case


            3    

was the fact that the judge had a duty, when advised or on


            4    

notice of a potential conflict of interest, of making an


            5    

inquiry as to find out whether in fact there was such a


            6    

conflict.  I thought that's your whole case. 


            7              

MR. WAGNER:  That -- that is the focus of our


            8    

case.

QUESTION:  Is that -- is that your -- see, I

don't -- you -- you haven't put it that way.  You --


           11    

you've put it that if the judge knew or should have known


           12    

of the conflict.  Now, is that it?  Which is it?  You've


           13    

said this morning if he knew or should have known of the


           14    

conflict.  Is that he should have known of the conflict or


           15    

should have known of the potential conflict?


           16              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, in Cuyler v. Sullivan, it


           17    

talks to a particular conflict.

            2    

your blue brief.  It's potential conflict.  That's what


            3    

you put in your brief.  Now you're changing your position?


            4              

MR. WAGNER:  Well, I don't mean to change my


            5    

position, Your Honor, but a potential conflict in the


            6    

context of where we have it in the brief would -- would


            7    

essentially equal a particular conflict.  So, it is a


            8    

potential conflict --


            9              

QUESTION:  Well, but -- a very different


           10    

question.  You mean whenever there's a potential conflict,


           11    

if the -- if defense counsel had -- had represented the


           12    

victim 20 years ago on a totally unrelated matter, there


           13    

-- there's always some confidential information he might


           14    

have obtained.  The judge always has to inquire into that?


           15              

MR. WAGNER:  That's true, Your Honor. 


           16              

No.  If -- but if the judge knows --


           17              

QUESTION:  Well, how potential does potential


           18    

have to be then? 


           19              

MR. WAGNER:  Potential has to be, as Cuyler


           20    

describes, a particular conflict.  If -- if the judge


           21    

knows that there's some information that that attorney may


           22    

have obtained from a previous client, that there's some


           23    

kind of conflicting interest that needs to be probed.


           24              

QUESTION:  No, no.  That may be conflicting. 


           25              

MR. WAGNER:  That may be conflicting.  That's

right.  There is the potential for damage to the


            2    

defendant.  It's that potential that the -- the judge


            3    

needs to inquire.  It's the peril that the defendant finds


            4    

himself in by being represented by a conflicted attorney


            5    

that the judge has a responsibility to --


            6              

QUESTION:  20 years ago.  Is that enough of a


            7    

peril? 


            8              

MR. WAGNER:  In that case, it's very difficult


            9    

to -- to imagine how the judge would have known of that


           10    

conflict.  So --


           11              

QUESTION:  But he knew about it. 


           12              

MR. WAGNER:  If he knew about it, then -- then I


           13    

would suggest that that judge should at least inquire,


           14    

just take the very -- the very reasonable measure, the


           15    

very simple measure of inquiring into the conflict.  It


           16    

takes a very short amount of time, and you -- you


           17    

alleviate the problem of all the litigation that we've had


           18    

in this case.


           19              

If I may reserve the remainder of my time, Mr.


           20    

Chief Justice. 


           21              

QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Wagner. 


           22              

Mr. Harris, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT Q. HARRIS


           24                    

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

            1    

the Court:


            2              

The Fourth Circuit correctly required a showing


            3    

of adverse effect for Mickens to establish a conflict of


            4    

interest claim.  There is a rule.  The Court has


            5    

established a rule and the general application for


            6    

deciding conflict of interest claims, and it was decided


            7    

in Sullivan.  It's consistent with the repeated admonition


            8    

of this Court, that in order to claim an interference with


            9    

the right to counsel, you have to show that it had some


           10    

effect on the representation.  Sullivan states the Sixth


           11    

Amendment standard.  Justice Breyer, the rule that you're


           12    

looking for is in Sullivan. 


           13              

QUESTION:  Well, Holloway doesn't stand for that


           14    

proposition, does it?  Holloway is consistent with what


           15    

you said?


           16              

MR. HARRIS:  Well, Sullivan explicitly --


           17              

QUESTION:  I'm asking you about Holloway. 


           18              

MR. HARRIS:  Well, Sullivan explicitly carves


           19    

out Holloway.


           20              

QUESTION:  Do you think Holloway is good law or


           21    

not? 


           22              

MR. HARRIS:  Holloway is -- is not been


           23    

overruled.  It is perfectly good law. 


           24              

QUESTION:  Well, that didn't require any showing


           25    

of adverse effect.

            1              

MR. HARRIS:  What the Court said in Holloway is


            2    

that relying on the representations of counsel that there


            3    

was a conflict of interest and that he would be unable to


            4    

examine his multiple clients, the failure to inquire into


            5    

that was itself error. 


            6              

And I think if you -- you can put Holloway into


            7    

the exact same terms of the Sullivan over-arching


            8    

standard.  The fact that counsel has taken these steps of


            9    

advising the court that he sees a conflict of interest,


           10    

the fact that counsel tells the court, when they get to


           11    

trial, that he is not able to examine his several clients


           12    

because of the confidences he knows, that is, as -- as


           13    

Holloway said, relying on counsel being in the best


           14    

position to know.  That is persuasive evidence that, in


           15    

fact, the conflict existed.  And obviously, the impact on


           16    

the representation in that circumstance is evident.


           17              

The -- the --


           18              

QUESTION:  May I ask you this question?  Do you


           19    

think the lawyer in this case had a duty to tell his


           20    

client that he had represented the victim?  Just an


           21    

ethical -- not a constitutional duty, as an ethical


           22    

matter.


           23              

MR. HARRIS:  The district court found that he


           24    

should have -- under the rules of ethics, he should have


           25    

advised his client of the fact that he had previously

            1    

represented Tim Hall. 


            2              

QUESTION:  And then the next question I have is


            3    

do you think -- again, not necessarily a matter of


            4    

constitutional law, but that it would have been good


            5    

practice for the judge to inquire of the lawyer whether he


            6    

thought there had been any -- any difficulty in the


            7    

representation? 


            8              

MR. HARRIS:  I -- I certainly agree that it


            9    

would have been good practice both for defense counsel and


           10    

for trial -- the trial -- well, in this case it wasn't a


           11    

trial court.  It was a juvenile court that -- that made


           12    

the appointment.  Certainly it would be a good practice. 


           13    

I think that is part and parcel of what Sullivan was


           14    

saying when it is encouraging trial courts to make those


           15    

inquiries even on facts that may not be based on the


           16    

objection of counsel or the defendant. 


           17              

QUESTION:  Would you say it was unethical for


           18    

the lawyer not to have revealed to the court and his


           19    

client not what is the better practice, but that it was,


           20    

in fact, a violation of the ethical constraints for the


           21    

lawyer, knowing that he had represented the victim, not to


           22    

tell his client so his client could make the choice


           23    

whether to keep the lawyer or not? 


           24              

MR. HARRIS:  I cannot make the final call on


           25    

whether it was ethical or not.  We have an independent

body in Virginia that is -- is there to do that very


            2    

thing, the Virginia State Bar. 


            3              

I would agree, as the district court said, that


            4    

the obligations, the ethical obligations, of counsel would


            5    

be to provide disclosure of such information to his -- to


            6    

his client. 


            7              

The -- it is the next step that you are, I


            8    

guess, deliberately not taking that -- that I would have


            9    

to say that that is not the type of conflicting interest


           10    

that would -- that was being addressed in the Sullivan


           11    

standard for finding a Sixth Amendment violation. 


           12              

QUESTION:  In other words --


           13              

QUESTION:  And I wasn't -- I wasn't asking you


           14    

any question about the Constitution.  I was asking you


           15    

about the ethical canons that govern lawyers. 


           16              

MR. HARRIS:  I --


           17              

QUESTION:  Does the lawyer have a duty to advise


           18    

the client of a potential conflict?


           19              

MR. HARRIS:  There is a general duty of counsel


           20    

to advise his client of any circumstances which the client


           21    

would want to know, as far as matters that may affect the


           22    

loyalty of counsel to client.  That is the general and


           23    

accepted ethical statement.  Certainly that is an


           24    

obligation that was Mr. Saunders' obligation at the time


           25    

of this case.

QUESTION:  May I ask -- take it one step further


            2    

and turn away from the ethics to the Constitution?  What


            3    

-- what would you say about a case of the same facts, but


            4    

the -- the client tells the -- the client finds out about


            5    

it and asks the judge to relieve the lawyer because the


            6    

client doesn't want a lawyer who represented the -- the


            7    

victim?  Would the judge have a constitutional duty to --


            8    

to discharge counsel?


            9              

MR. HARRIS:  Well, the -- I think Holloway I


           10    

think doesn't make a distinction between the defendant


           11    

himself or his client.  So, in that very circumstance, the


           12    

judge would have a duty to inquire.  That much I think is


           13    

clear from Holloway.


           14              

QUESTION:  No.  I've given you the facts.  The


           15    

-- the client -- all the client says is, I don't trust a


           16    

lawyer who's represented the man that I'm accused of


           17    

killing.  I would like a different lawyer.  Would the --


           18    

would the judge have a duty to give him a different lawyer


           19    

as a constitutional matter? 


           20              

MR. HARRIS:  No.  I would say this, as this


           21    

Court pointed out in Wheat, the judge certainly has the


           22    

discretion, a very broad discretion at that point in time,


           23    

to anticipate the possibility of conflicts and to


           24    

substitute counsel on the risk, on the possible danger of


           25    

a conflict appearing later on.

QUESTION:  What -- what if the lawyer says that? 


            2    

What -- what if the lawyer says that?  I don't feel


            3    

comfortable representing this -- this defendant because --


            4    

because I represented the decedent that he's accused of


            5    

murdering.  The same question as -- as --


            6              

MR. HARRIS:  I understand. 


            7              

QUESTION:  -- Justice Stevens, only it's -- it's


            8    

counsel who --


            9              

MR. HARRIS:  And the answer is -- is essentially


           10    

the same as well.  If counsel is representing to the -- if


           11    

that can be interpreted as representing to the court that


           12    

he is objecting to representing this man because of his


           13    

prior representation, the court has to inquire. 


           14              

Now, of course, the duty that Sullivan and


           15    

Holloway set out, as far as the duty to inquire, is not a


           16    

duty to grant relief.  It's a duty to inquire to determine


           17    

whether or not there is a risk that the Sixth Amendment


           18    

rights will be jeopardized. 


           19              

QUESTION:  Well, except in Holloway exactly that


           20    

happened.  The -- the lawyer said, judge, I can't


           21    

represent these three defendants, and the judge said, you


           22    

go ahead and do it.


           23              

MR. HARRIS:  Well, that's --


           24              

QUESTION:  And -- and this Court reversed. 


           25              

I read the opinion as saying that in this case

            1    

the conflict is apparent on the face of the record.  The


            2    

-- the attorney is -- is -- has such a burden that it --


            3    

the conflict inheres in the very objection the attorney


            4    

makes.  You don't even need to look any further.  That's


            5    

the way I read that opinion. 


            6              

MR. HARRIS:  I think that is exactly what


            7    

Holloway gets to.  The point is when counsel makes the


            8    

effort of telling the judge that he sees a conflict of


            9    

interest and that he cannot do his job effectively, that


           10    

essentially makes out the Sixth Amendment violation. 


           11              

QUESTION:  Going back to the earlier questions


           12    

about the counsel's ethical duty, as you understand it,


           13    

quite apart from the Constitution, is there a duty of


           14    

loyalty to the former client or just a duty of maintaining


           15    

confidentiality? 


           16              

MR. HARRIS:  After the close of the


           17    

representation of a former client, I -- I believe that the


           18    

general duty of loyalty devolves down to that duty of


           19    

maintaining the confidences of your former client.  That


           20    

is how the duty of loyalty is represented.  I -- I don't


           21    

think we can impose a -- even an ethical obligation on


           22    

counsel to continue to have good feelings about a former


           23    

client or -- or this general notion of having once


           24    

represented an individual, he is forever subject to the


           25    

attorney's care.

            1              

QUESTION:  The trouble I'm having with the


            2    

standard is not whether the judge happens to know he


            3    

should have looked in or shouldn't have looked into it,


            4    

which were unusual circumstances.  If a lawyer is under a


            5    

real conflict -- a real one, a very serious one, a


            6    

terrible one -- his client cannot get effective


            7    

assistance.  So, I would have thought that's the standard.


            8              

MR. HARRIS:  I believe that is --


            9              

QUESTION:  Did the client get effective


           10    

assistance or not? 


           11              

MR. HARRIS:  I believe it is.


           12              

QUESTION:  Now, the difficulty comes up because


           13    

the lawyer doesn't normally tell him, just like any other


           14    

ineffective case, and now the judge has to decide what is


           15    

and what is not ineffective assistance.  So, to do that in


           16    

the conflict category, do we just look to the ABA rules? 


           17    

They're often quite attenuated. 


           18              

What do we use to decide whether the conflict is


           19    

serious enough so the client couldn't get effective


           20    

assistance?  Once he didn't, I guess you do presume


           21    

prejudice because you can't go back and second guess every


           22    

second of what the lawyer was doing.  But what's the


           23    

standard? 


           24              

MR. HARRIS:  Well, again, Sullivan addresses the


           25    

very concern.  It indicates that counsel must be actively

            1    

representing conflicting interests before we have a


            2    

presumed prejudice.  He must have an actual conflict


            3    

adversely affecting --


            4              

QUESTION:  And what is that -- so, that's --


            5    

it's exactly at the time you say the words actual


            6    

conflict, that I think have gotten me mixed up in these


            7    

cases. 


            8              

MR. HARRIS:  Well, of course --


            9              

QUESTION:  And sometimes they mean one thing,


           10    

sometimes another. 


           11              

MR. HARRIS:  Well, I don't think there's any


           12    

inconsistency in this Court's cases on --


           13              

QUESTION:  No, maybe not.  But whether there is


           14    

or not, can we do better than saying actual conflict? 


           15    

Should we say actual conflict creating ineffective


           16    

assistance?  Should we say look at the ABA rules?  What


           17    

should we say in your opinion? 


           18              

MR. HARRIS:  Well, I would take us back to


           19    

Sullivan because what Sullivan was doing was identifying


           20    

what the lower courts had already been doing prior to the


           21    

time of its decision, which was finding something called


           22    

an actual conflict.  And what that involved was


           23    

identifying diverging interests, inconsistent interests,


           24    

essentially potentially conflicting interests, and then


           25    

looking to see whether or not that existence of diverging

            1    

interests actually had any effect on the representation. 


            2              

Now, the lower court decisions often spoke --


            3              

QUESTION:  This is what confuses me about this


            4    

discussion.  I'm -- I'm not -- sometimes it seems to me


            5    

that -- that we're equating the existence of an actual


            6    

conflict with prejudice.  Is that what you're saying, that


            7    

-- that when you show an actual conflict, there is


            8    

automatically prejudice?  I -- I didn't understand that to


            9    

be the law.


           10              

MR. HARRIS:  No, and that's not what I'm


           11    

arguing. 


           12              

QUESTION:  I understood it to be the law that no


           13    

matter how actual and apparent the conflict is, if it had


           14    

not effect on the trial, there's no foul. 


           15              

MR. HARRIS:  I would argue that it is the


           16    

adverse effect that makes a potential conflict actual.


           17              

QUESTION:  Then how do you explain Holloway?


           18              

MR. HARRIS:  Holloway I think can easily be


           19    

explained as the -- the adverse effect and actual


           20    

impairment of defense counsel's ability to conduct the


           21    

representation --


           22              

QUESTION:  But that -- all --


           23              

MR. HARRIS:  -- was provided by his own


           24    

statement. 


           25

            1    

Holloway was that there was an actual conflict.  There was


            2    

no showing of what effect that conflict had upon the


            3    

representation. 


            4              

MR. HARRIS:  Again, what Sullivan said about


            5    

Holloway was that Holloway did not find an actual


            6    

conflict.  So, I will stop short as well.


            7              

QUESTION:  Well, there was no finding in the


            8    

sense that the Court made a formal finding.  I think what


            9    

Justice Scalia was -- in any case, what I've been assuming


           10    

is what Justice Kennedy said a moment ago, that when


           11    

counsel in a multiple representation situation says,


           12    

judge, I can't go on representing all of these people,


           13    

that the conflict is so obvious that we'll take it as a


           14    

given.  And -- and I'm -- I'm inclined to read Holloway


           15    

that way. 


           16              

MR. HARRIS:  Well, perhaps --


           17              

QUESTION:  The conflict is so obvious or the


           18    

prejudice is so obvious? 


           19              

QUESTION:  Well, the conflict is -- is so


           20    

obvious because it seems to me -- and this was going to


           21    

get to my next -- my -- my question to you. 


           22              

Isn't the difference -- reading Holloway the way


           23    

I am reading it, isn't the difference between Holloway and


           24    

-- and Sullivan something like this?  We realize that if,


           25    

through no fault of anybody, through the -- the client was

not asleep, the judge was not asleep -- it nonetheless


            2    

turns out later that there was a conflict, we want to make


            3    

sure that that conflict actually had an effect on


            4    

representation before we -- we start reversing


            5    

convictions.  But if there was reason to believe in


            6    

advance, if somebody told the judge like the lawyer in


            7    

Holloway, that there is a problem here, we want to have an


            8    

inducement on the trial court to pursue that problem right


            9    

then and there.  And in order to get that inducement,


           10    

we're going to have a rule that says, you don't have to


           11    

prove effect.  All you have to prove is conflict.  In


           12    

other words, in order to induce the trial courts to be on


           13    

their toes, the defendants later on have a lesser burden. 


           14              

Do you think that's the way to read Holloway and


           15    

Sullivan together?  And do you think that is a sensible


           16    

rule? 


           17              

MR. HARRIS:  I substantially agree with that,


           18    

with the following caveat.  I don't think that Holloway


           19    

necessarily is saying the actual conflict as a separate


           20    

concept, actual conflict.  It's so evident that we will


           21    

presume prejudice.  I think they are saying that in those


           22    

particular circumstances where the matter is objected to


           23    

and brought to the trial court's attention, both the


           24    

actual conflict and the expected prejudice from the


           25    

attorney telling the judge he cannot represent all of the

people are so obvious that --


            2              

QUESTION:  Well, isn't that what Holloway is


            3    

talking about?  Expected prejudice basically.  If the


            4    

attorney says I can't represent these people, instead of


            5    

letting it go ahead and prove that he's right, which you


            6    

have every reason to think he's right, you simply say,


            7    

we'll have to stop right now. 


            8              

MR. HARRIS:  Well, we are giving a great deal of


            9    

weight to trial counsel's ability to know because he is


           10    

the only person that has the access to the confidences of


           11    

multiple clients who will know for certain, or at least


           12    

with a high degree of certainty, that there is going to be


           13    

a conflict and that it will affect the representations of


           14    

the various clients. 


           15              

But to -- if I could get back to your question,


           16    

there is a difference, I think, in the circumstance where


           17    

the attorney has made that representation to the trial


           18    

court, which I think is the same as saying I see an actual


           19    

conflict that will affect my representation.


           20              

QUESTION:  If we want -- you know, I realize


           21    

that, but if -- if we want to keep the trial judges on


           22    

their toes -- and having been a trial judge, I can tell


           23    

you that inducements do matter -- doesn't it make sense to


           24    

treat the -- the knowledge that the appointing judge has,


           25    

in a case like this, as being the equivalent of the -- of

the objection by counsel?


            2              

MR. HARRIS:  No. 


            3              

QUESTION:  Why -- why not equate them? 


            4              

MR. HARRIS:  I think it is -- it is fair to say


            5    

that the trial judge's notice of facts that would cause


            6    

him to -- to perceive a -- the language that the Court


            7    

used was a particular conflict.  But the notice of that


            8    

certainly imposes an obligation upon him to inquire into


            9    

it.  But I don't think you can then say that having


           10    

knowledge of facts that would suggest an actual conflict


           11    

or even suggest a particular conflict can be equated with


           12    

the attorney's representation that it exists. 


           13              

QUESTION:  Okay.  The trouble -- the trouble is


           14    

if you follow -- I mean, I think I follow your -- your


           15    

argument.  But if I -- if I understand you correctly, then


           16    

nothing is really added to the law by saying the trial


           17    

judge has an obligation to inquire into it because when we


           18    

-- when we come at the -- at the question after the fact,


           19    

the trial judge hasn't inquired, there's been a trial,


           20    

there's been a conviction, then the issue of conflict gets


           21    

litigated. 


           22              

MR. HARRIS:  Well, that is --


           23              

QUESTION:  On your -- on your rule we proceed


           24    

under the same standards whether or not the trial judge


           25    

should have known.  Isn't that right?

MR. HARRIS:  It is not so much my rule.  It is


            2    

this Court's rule.  That's what Sullivan said.


            3              

QUESTION:  No, but I mean, regardless of who it


            4    

belongs to, on the -- on the argument that you are making,


            5    

the -- the standards are exactly the same whether the


            6    

judge should have known or should -- need not


            7    

necessarily --


            8              

MR. HARRIS:  As far as ultimately finding --


            9              

QUESTION:  But -- but the world changes.  I -- I


           10    

assume that trial judges generally do what we say they're


           11    

supposed to do. 


           12              

MR. HARRIS:  That -- that is correct. 


           13              

QUESTION:  Now, it may mean it may well be that


           14    

if they don't, nothing happens afterwards, but usually


           15    

they'll do what we suggest.  Won't they? 


           16              

MR. HARRIS:  Well, it -- it is true that the


           17    

State judges and Federal judges -- lower Federal judges


           18    

all are sworn to uphold the same Constitution. 


           19              

QUESTION:  It didn't seem to happen here,


           20    

though, did it? 


           21              

QUESTION:  May I suggest that the -- the problem


           22    

is not the bright line distinction between potential


           23    

conflict and actual conflict, but rather the serious --


           24    

the potentially serious character of the conflict. 


           25              

And your point is that the lawyers in Holloway

            1    

made it clear to the judge it was a serious problem. 


            2    

Whereas, here it's not all that apparent because it may


            3    

have been just a routine appointment of the public


            4    

defender's office that just happens.  But if this lawyer


            5    

had been the family attorney for the victim for the last


            6    

30 years and knew them intimately and so forth, I think


            7    

you would agree then the judge had a greater duty of


            8    

inquiry than he might have had here. 


            9              

MR. HARRIS:  I would say to the extent that you


           10    

make the two relationships, the between representations


           11    

more connected -- and you can certainly do that by virtue

of a personal relationship -- you inch your way along --


           13              

QUESTION:  It was more likely to be prejudicial


           14    

would be the point.  If it's reasonably likely to the


           15    

judge to know -- I mean, if it's reasonably apparent on


           16    

the face of the matter, whether said by the lawyer or just


           17    

from the facts, that there's a real danger of prejudice


           18    

here, you would agree the judge has a duty of inquiry, I


           19    

would think. 


           20              

MR. HARRIS:  I -- I certainly agree that the


           21    

judge's duty of inquiry is -- is presented at a much


           22    

lesser level than actual prejudice to the defendant.  And


           23    

it's obvious these things should be taken care of --


           24              

QUESTION:  Okay.  But does that -- does that


           25    

duty of inquiry have any consequence later in the

            2    

collateral attack? 


            3              

MR. HARRIS:  No, and for a very simple reason. 


            4    

You do not have the one ingredient that you have in


            5    

Holloway v. Arkansas.  You do not have the representation


            6    

of counsel, the person in the best position to know, that


            7    

in fact he sees a conflict and he sees the impairment.  In


            8    

fact, you have the opposite.  The fact that counsel has


            9    

not raised any matter to the trial court when he is in the


           10    

best position to know and when he does not see that there


           11    

is a conflict sufficient enough to call to the court's


           12    

attention over -- for an objection to be resolved, we have


           13    

a different record.  In that case --


           14              

QUESTION:  Why does it -- from the defendant's


           15    

vantage point, why should it make a difference?  He's got


           16    

a counsel who has betrayed his obligation.  He doesn't


           17    

know anything.  The client doesn't know anything.  Why is


           18    

Mickens, who has a lawyer who doesn't tell the court --


           19    

why is -- would he be better off if the -- the judge knew


           20    

or should have known than when nobody knows and he's


           21    

totally in the dark?  From the defendant's point of view,


           22    

the judge's knowledge isn't significant.  It's that he has


           23    

a lawyer who is not totally able to represent him with


           24    

undivided loyalty.


           25

notion that we have one Sixth Amendment standard for


            2    

conflicts of interest regardless of whether or not the


            3    

trial judge was on notice of some facts that could have


            4    

prompted the inquiry, that we will go beyond that standard


            5    

in the circumstances such as Holloway where the attorney


            6    

himself has made it an essential fact of the case that he


            7    

has identified a conflict and impairment in his case.


            8              

The difference is not so much that the -- I


            9    

mean, I guess the -- the answer is the defendant is not


           10    

entitled to a different or more lenient standard of review


           11    

of his conflict claim, you know, because of the judge's


           12    

failure to act on notice of additional facts.  It doesn't


           13    

get us any closer to determining whether or not there


           14    

actually was an infringement of his Sixth Amendment


           15    

rights.  To assume it on the basis of a judge's failure to


           16    

act on notice, it simply --


           17              

QUESTION:  And what is -- what is the test for


           18    

determining whether there was an impairment?  You're not


           19    

saying you have to be able to show that the defendant


           20    

might have been acquitted --


           21              

MR. HARRIS:  No.

QUESTION:  -- or might not have gotten the death


           23    

penalty.


           24              

MR. HARRIS:  No.  The --

            2              

MR. HARRIS:  Well, the Court is using the


            3    

adverse effect to -- as a -- as a lesser showing of


            4    

prejudice.  As an example, it is not so much that a


            5    

defendant would have to show Strickland prejudice, a


            6    

reasonable probability of a different outcome, but he


            7    

certainly has to show the likelihood that trial counsel's


            8    

conduct or assessment of different defenses in the case


            9    

was affected, not --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN


           13         

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


           14                     

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT


           15              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


           16    

please the Court:


           17              

When a district court has reason to know about a


           18    

potential conflict and fails to initiate inquiry, the


           19    

Sixth Amendment is violated only when there is a showing


           20    

of an actual conflict and an adverse effect on the quality


           21    

of performance.  And we say that for three reasons. 


           22              

First, it is a central tenet of this Court's


           23    

Sixth Amendment jurisprudence that a Sixth Amendment


           24    

violation does not occur unless there has been prejudice


           25    

to the defense.  It would be inconsistent with that basic

principle to set aside a jury verdict and order a new


            2    

trial with all the societal costs that entails when --


            3              

QUESTION:  I must interrupt you here, though. 


            4    

The prejudice standard under -- under Strickland is not


            5    

the standard we're talking about here, is it?


            6              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  It is not.  Under Sullivan,


            7    

there has to be an adverse effect on the quality of


            8    

performance, but it is still -- from that, there is


            9    

inferred prejudice.  It would be inconsistent with the


           10    

central thrust of showing some kind of prejudice to


           11    

reverse a conviction, set aside it, and -- and order a new


           12    

trial when there has been no showing that the quality of


           13    

representation has been affected. 


           14              

And in Sullivan, the Court held --


           15              

QUESTION:  Well, let me just push that all the


           16    

way.  Supposing in -- in Holloway itself the judge said,


           17    

well, I -- I really think you -- he thought it through and


           18    

said, I think you could represent both.  Could he have


           19    

just gone ahead and insisted on the lawyer representing


           20    

them? 


           21              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  In -- in Holloway, if there's no


           22    

inquiry conducted by the judge, there's automatic


           23    

reversal.


           24              

QUESTION:  The question here is when does the


           25    

judge have a duty of inquiry.

MR. GORNSTEIN:  The judge --


            2              

QUESTION:  Are you saying he never has a duty of


            3    

inquiry unless there's going to be actual prejudice? 


            4              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  No.  I -- I think that what the


            5    

Court said in Wood about the duty of inquiry and -- and --


            6    

this is somewhat vague, I will agree, but it said there


            7    

has to be a clear possibility of a conflict. 


            8              

QUESTION:  All right.  Supposing there's a clear


            9    

possibility of prejudice, but no actual proof of


           10    

prejudice, is that enough to impose a duty of -- of


           11    

inquiry on the judge?


           12              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  There's a duty of inquiry, but


           13    

if the duty is not fulfilled and a trial is held and a --


           14    

there's a conviction and the defendant is seeking to


           15    

overturn his conviction, at that point the defendant still


           16    

must show an actual conflict and an adverse effect on the


           17    

quality of his representation. 


           18              

QUESTION:  We've been trying to find a way to


           19    

distinguish Holloway from this case.  One way is to say


           20    

that multiple representation is so fraught with


           21    

difficulties that it's simply a separate category. 


           22    

Another is to say that the likelihood of an adverse effect


           23    

is so significant, so serious that we'll presume it.


           24    

Another is to say that the conflict itself is much more


           25    

serious in most cases than -- how would you --

            1              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  I would say that there would --


            2              

QUESTION:  How would -- how would you have us


            3    

deal with Holloway? 


            4              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  I would say that Holloway is a


            5    

special case where prejudice was presumed conclusively


            6    

based on two factors.  The first is that deference to the


            7    

contemporaneous judgment of counsel that he was operating


            8    

under a disabling conflict, and when he's representing


            9    

that he's operating under a disabling conflict, it's not


           10    

just a representation that he has a conflict, but that


           11    

this is going to affect his performance.  He's not going


           12    

to be able to represent the defendant adequately. 


           13              

And the second is that prejudice inheres in the


           14    

situation in which a judge orders a defense counsel, over


           15    

his objection, to continue representation even though the


           16    

attorney believes he is not going to be able to perform


           17    

adequately. 


           18              

And those two circumstances together create a


           19    

per se rule of prejudice, and it's a carve-out from the


           20    

Sullivan rule. 


           21              

QUESTION:  Does Wood stand for a similar


           22    

proposition, or is Wood different? 


           23              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Now, Wood is a situation where


           24    

the Sullivan rule was applied in a case in which there was


           25    

reason to know a clear possibility of an actual conflict.

            1    

And what the Court said in that circumstance is that the


            2    

Constitution would be violated if it was found that the


            3    

lawyer had a -- a conflict that influenced his basic


            4    

strategic decisions.  And that is the same exact test as


            5    

the Sullivan test.  There not only has to be a showing of


            6    

an actual conflict but an effect on performance for there


            7    

to be a Sixth Amendment violation. 


            8              

QUESTION:  Are you saying Wood is an effect


            9    

case.


           10              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  It is both an actual conflict


           11    

and effect.  That's what it directs when it says the words


           12    

actual conflict --


           13              

QUESTION:  So, you're saying in this case if the


           14    

lawyer had said to the judge, my client doesn't trust me


           15    

because I -- I represented the decedent and he won't be


           16    

candid with me, then the judge would have had a duty to


           17    

discharge counsel. 


           18              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  I'm not saying that they -- he


           19    

would have had a duty to discharge counsel.  He can


           20    

inquire --


           21              

QUESTION:  Why would that case have been


           22    

different from Holloway? 


           23              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  He can -- first of all, Holloway


           24    

is a situation where the lawyer himself is representing


           25    

that he cannot adequately represent --

QUESTION:  Correct.  It's because my client


            2    

doesn't trust me. 


            3              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well, if he represents that he


            4    

cannot adequately represent the -- the defendant, and then


            5    

the district court has to conduct an inquiry.  And if the


            6    

inquiry reveals that in fact representation can be


            7    

adequately given, then the judge need not dismiss.  But if


            8    

the judge concludes that adequate representation cannot be


            9    

given, then the judge should dismiss. 


           10              

QUESTION:  No matter how severe the conflict.  I


           11    

mean, no matter how -- in your view, no matter how severe


           12    

the conflict, still unless you can show that it actually


           13    

affected the lawyer's representation, it is not a


           14    

constitutional error. 


           15              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  After a trial has been held and


           16    

the defendant is seeking to overturn his conviction,


           17    

that's correct. 


           18              

QUESTION:  Well, Strickland doesn't say that. 


           19    

Strickland says that it's important to maintain a fairly


           20    

rigid rule of presumed prejudice for conflicts of


           21    

interest. 


           22              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Yes, but Strickland goes on --


           23              

QUESTION:  Should we change Strickland? 


           24              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  No.  No, because Strickland goes


           25    

on to say that in that situation, prejudice is presumed

performance, both an actual conflict and an adverse effect

doesn't have to show the additional burden that is -- that

is present in most Strickland cases of showing there's a


            6    

reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would


            7    

change.  But what -- Strickland reaffirms Cuyler v.


            8    

Sullivan, which requires both an actual conflict and an


            9    

effect -- an adverse effect on performance. 


           10              

QUESTION:  Suppose the victim were the fiance of


           11    

the lawyer's niece and the lawyer was very close to the


           12    

niece, and he says, I can't do this, judge.  I -- I can't


           13    

represent this murderer.


           14              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well, then you have a Holloway


           15    

situation if the -- if the defendant -- defense counsel is


           16    

representing that he's operating under a disabling


           17    

conflict and the judge doesn't conduct an inquiry, then


           18    

there's automatic reversal at that point.  That's the


           19    

Holloway carve-out. 


           20              

QUESTION:  In the worst case, when the lawyer


           21    

says nothing, you end up not getting rid of him -- I mean,


           22    

or not -- assuming prejudice --


           23              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well, there's a -- there's a --


           24              

QUESTION:  But in the case where he's more


           25    

honest about it and comes straightforward, then you're

            1    

going to presume the prejudice. 


            2              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  But that's because of the


            3    

reasons for Holloway have to do with the deferring to the


            4    

contemporaneous representation of a counsel that he is


            5    

operating under a disabling conflict and that is given


            6    

deference, together with the fact that when somebody is


            7    

ordered to -- to provide representation over his


            8    

objection, that a certain amount of prejudice inheres in


            9    

that.  And that's why the Holloway rule is as it is. 


           10              

And in this situation where that's not there and


           11    

the defendant is seeking to obtain a new trial with all


           12    

the societal costs that that entails, it is not too much


           13    

of a burden for him to be able to identify a particular


           14    

way in which --


           15              

QUESTION:  Of course, the irony of the rule is


           16    

that it gives greater protection when the lawyer is --


           17    

conceals -- unethically conceals a known conflict than


           18    

when he's candid with the court. 


           19              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  There's a certain amount --


           20              

QUESTION:  And the argument -- that's the


           21    

argument here, that in order to get the higher rate of --


           22    

of fees for representing a defendant in a capital case, he


           23    

didn't want it to be known that -- that he represented --


           24    

you know, had this prior --


           25              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  That -- that was the argument,

but the district court found against the --


            2              

QUESTION:  I understand that.


            3              

MR. GORNSTEIN:  -- against the defendant on both


            4    

of those points.  The district court carefully examined


            5    

the questions of whether there was a conflict and whether


            6    

there was an adverse effect.  Those were the correct


            7    

inquiries. 


            8              

And the argument that's being made here is that


            9    

you can skip the second step, and it's our submission that


           10    

under Cuyler against Sullivan and under Wood and under


           11    

this Court's general Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, there


           12    

has to be a showing of an adverse effect on the quality of


           13    

representation. 


           14              

If the Court has nothing further. 


           15              

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Gornstein. 


           16              

Mr. Wagner, you have 3 minutes left. 


           17               

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. WAGNER


           18                    

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


           19              

MR. WAGNER:  Thank you, Your Honor. 


           20              

The thrust of the respondent's argument here is


           21    

that Holloway stands for the proposition that if a defense


           22    

attorney raises an objection to the court and the court


           23    

compels that representation over that objection, then that


           24    

is where the prejudice is presumed. 


           25              

If you take this argument to its logical

            1    

conclusion, then anytime a defense attorney raises an


            2    

objection on the basis of a conflict to a court and the


            3    

court compels that representation over that objection,


            4    

then prejudice should be presumed.  In other words, when


            5    

you have a situation where a defense attorney raises an


            6    

objection to the court, the court properly inquires of


            7    

that defense attorney about that conflict and properly


            8    

finds that there is no debilitating conflict here and then


            9    

requires that -- that defense attorney to proceed with the


           10    

representation, then under what the respondents say here,


           11    

prejudice should be presumed. 


           12              

That's not what Holloway stands for.  Holloway


           13    

stands for the proposition that the trial court has the


           14    

duty of protecting the essential rights of the defendant. 


           15    

The trial court has the duty of seeing that the Sixth


           16    

Amendment rights of a defendant are protected.  And in


           17    

this case, the trial court failed in that responsibility. 


           18    

It knew or should have known of that conflict, failed to


           19    

inquire into that conflict and that's where the prejudice


           20    

lies here.


           21              

I thank the Court. 


           22              

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Wagner.


           23              

The case is submitted.


           24              

(Whereupon, at 11:00 a.m., the case in the


           25    

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
