CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 01-298, Paul Lapides v. the Board of Regents


of the University System of Georgia.


Mr. Bederman.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BEDERMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. BEDERMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


When a State affirmatively invokes the


jurisdiction of the Federal court by removing a case, that


acts as a waiver of the State's forum immunity to Federal


jurisdiction under the Eleventh Amendment.  This principle


has been confirmed as recently as this Court's decision in


the College Savings Bank case where it was indicated that


a State may waive Eleventh Amendment immunity by invoking


Federal court jurisdiction.


This rule also finds support in a long line of


decisions holding that where a State enters a Federal


proceeding as an actor in any role, that effectively


relinquishes any objections to Federal jurisdiction a


State may have under the Eleventh Amendment.


QUESTION:  When you say as an actor in any role,


does it ever intervene as a defendant?

 MR. BEDERMAN:  Yes, Justice Scalia.  This


Court's precedents seem to indicate that wherever the


State is cast in the role of plaintiff, defendant,


intervenor, or claimant, that the entry into the Federal


proceeding submits the State to the jurisdiction of the


Federal court.


QUESTION:  How about the Ford Motor Company


case?


MR. BEDERMAN:  Well, of course, the


authorization requirement in Ford Motor -- and that's the


particular holding in Ford Motor that I think is of


concern to this Court -- need not be reached here because,


of course, Ford Motor did not involve a case where a State


was actually invoking Federal court jurisdiction.  So --


QUESTION:  So, you think a line can be drawn


between the State defendant being drawn in as a respondent


or involuntarily as opposed to removing and thereby


invoking Federal jurisdiction. 


MR. BEDERMAN:  Yes, Chief Justice.  I think the


key element here is precisely the invocation of Federal


court jurisdiction.  And again, this -- that's consistent


with this Court's rulings in -- in Gardner and in -- and


in Gunter and Clark where it's made clear that where the


State actually is invoking Federal court jurisdiction, the


proper inquiry is not the authority of the State officer

or attorney to waive Eleventh Amendment immunity.  The


proper inquiry is whether the State officer or attorney


had the power to engage in the litigation conduct leading


to the invocation of Federal court jurisdiction. 


QUESTION:  In all -- in all those cases, they


were cases in which a State really consented to have


litigated against it a Federal claim in a Federal court. 


And it's hardly surprising, once you agree to that, that


you also are agreeing to have related things litigated


against you. 


But this isn't that.  This is a case where the


only reason that the State went into the Federal court was


so that the individual defendants would be able to invoke


their right to have the matter heard in a Federal court.


So, why isn't the obvious solution here -- there


are only State claims left against the State which doesn't


want these heard in the Federal court.  They haven't


agreed to have anything heard there against them.  So,


judge, send it back to the State court.  What's it doing


here?  They don't want it here.  Call that pendent


jurisdiction, pendent claims, but it's an abuse of


discretion, at least, not to send it back.


MR. BEDERMAN:  If I may make a number of


responses to your question, Justice Breyer. 


First of all, I believe this Court's holdings

particularly in -- in Richardson, in Gunter do present a


situation where -- where a State is entering the


proceeding and -- in the role of a defendant and later


decides to regret that -- that casting and tries to


extricate itself from the proceeding.  So, I think there


is authority in this Court's precedents to that extent.


To your more general observation in terms of the


harm here, in essence, weighing the plaintiff's interest


in a single and unitary proceeding in State court, a


result which has been the -- this Court's jurisprudence


construing 28 U.S.C. 1441(c) for almost a century that --


that the removal statute does not entitle defendants to


remove and then split up claims --


QUESTION:  All right.  Well, that's exactly --


what if it's that?  The interest of the plaintiff in


having the action against the individuals in the State


tried in one place, on the one hand, against the interest


of the State having a State matter tried in State court


where the State has refused to waive its immunity from


Federal jurisdiction.  That for me is easy.  One is a


constitutional right; the other happens to be a right of a


plaintiff that he wouldn't have anyway if he had brought


his suit in Federal court, which is what removal


jurisdiction is about.  So, why doesn't the State clearly


prevail on that one?

 MR. BEDERMAN:  Well, Justice Breyer, again with


respect I think the -- the proper analysis I think closely


analyzing the State's professed interests in removing and


claiming immunity was, first of all, to engage the


expertise of Federal tribunals on questions arising under


section 1983 and qualified immunity.


QUESTION:  May I stop you there?  Because you


mentioned section 1983, and that makes this case terribly


puzzling because I thought States were not persons.  So,


if you're not subject to suit under 1983 --


MR. BEDERMAN:  That -- that's --


QUESTION:  That's the basis of -- you're suing


the State and the State is not a person within 1983.  So,


even if you prevailed 100 percent on your Eleventh


Amendment claim that you could remove despite that


sovereign immunity claim --


MR. BEDERMAN:  Justice Ginsburg, I -- I would


remind the Court that, of course, there was relief pled


for declaratory relief in the complaint, and under this


Court's jurisprudence following from Will, a declaratory


relief claim is properly pled in this kind of proceeding. 


Of course, Will says --


QUESTION:  Against the State?  I thought a State


was not a person, period, under 1983.  A municipality is,


a county is, but a State is not.  It doesn't matter

whether it's declaratory, injunctive, whatever.  They're


not subject to suit under 1983.  Isn't that right? 


MR. BEDERMAN:  No, Justice Ginsburg.  Under I


believe the footnote in -- in Will and also in the


following case, Arizona's Official English case, it made


clear that that interpretation of section 1983 of a person


for purposes of suit was for money damages and that


declaratory and injunctive relief, in order to keep the


symmetry, presumably with Ex parte Young, as I believe


this Court indicated, was -- was a permissible pleading --


QUESTION:  Well, Ex parte Young is something


different.  You're suing the officer, not the entity. 


MR. BEDERMAN:  That's right, but recall that not


only are the regions being sued here but also individuals


in their official capacity and as well as in -- in their


individual capacity.


QUESTION:  No.  But Justice Ginsburg I think has


said the individuals are out of it.  Qualified immunity. 


We're left with the State.  She wrote for the Court in


Arizona Official English -- she says, the barrier was not,


as the Ninth Circuit supposed, Eleventh Amendment immunity


which the State could waive.  The stopper was that 1983


creates no remedy against a State.  Now, that's what the


Court held.  So, 1983 creates no remedy against a State. 


So, you have no Federal claim against the State, and your

other Federal claims are disposed of. 


So, we're left with a purely State matter in the


State court -- in the Federal court, and the State says,


remand this, send it back.  Now, why shouldn't they?


MR. BEDERMAN:  Well, again, my response to that


would be plaintiffs do have an interest in seeing -- in


filing a single, unitary action in State court, as was


properly done here.  And what the State of Georgia has


attempted to accomplish via its removal and claiming


immunity tactic is -- is to break the -- break the


plaintiff's claim into discrete parts and dispose of them.


QUESTION:  I don't understand that either.


What's very puzzling here is you wanted the case to be in


State court, and then it was removed.  You moved to


remand, didn't you? 


MR. BEDERMAN:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  And now you're getting just what you


want.  You're getting the remand and you don't want it.


MR. BEDERMAN:  Well, it's -- it's the remand


apparently with the -- the other consequences of the


Federal court decisions to date.  That's, of course,


unfortunately one of the consequences of litigating


Eleventh Amendment immunity is that this was taken as an


interlocutory appeal, and other proceedings of course have


occurred since then.

 QUESTION:  But there's been no kind of


adjudication on the merits against the State -- against


the State entity in any way, shape, or form. 


MR. BEDERMAN:  No.  You are correct, Justice


Ginsburg.  To date, there have only been rulings by the


district court as affirmed by the court of appeals on the


qualified immunity defense as against the -- the


private --


QUESTION:  May I ask why it proceeded -- let me


read you something else from one -- a fairly recent


opinion.  We have routinely addressed, before the question


whether the Eleventh Amendment forbids a particular


statutory cause of action to be asserted against States,


the question whether the statute itself permits the cause


of action it creates to be asserted against States.  Why


didn't the lower courts follow that procedure and -- and


decide the 1983 substantive issue of whether the State is


liable first? 


MR. BEDERMAN:  I -- I do not know, Justice


Scalia.  In terms of -- in terms of what I understand is


the briefing and argument, the State of Georgia did raise


the Will defense in its papers.  The district court chose


to proceed with the case on another ground, dismissing the


section 1983 claims against the private parties in their


individual capacities on qualified immunity.  Maybe there

was some concern about the status of the Board of Regents,


but -- but I'm as mystified, frankly, as you are about


that disposition. 


Again, if I may repeat, the concern that


petitioner ultimately has about the use of removal and


claims of immunity in this context is it splits claims


which seems to be a result that's specifically prohibited


by the removal statute and this Court --


QUESTION:  But that seems to be a purely


academic question not in this case because the qualified


immunity question, as I understand it, was decided against


the individual officers.  So, what Federal question --


this goes back to what Justice Breyer asked.  I don't see


any Federal question left in this entire case.


MR. BEDERMAN:  If -- if you're not taking well


my point about the availability of declaratory relief --


QUESTION:  Well, at least the footnote that was


read didn't make any distinction based on declaratory


judgment.  It said a State is not a person for 1983


purposes.  Period.  That's what that footnote said. 


You're telling me now that I was wrong. 


MR. BEDERMAN:  I would never presume such,


Justice Ginsburg. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. BEDERMAN:  I -- I think maybe the safest

result -- of course, this has not been briefed -- is


whether this Court's judgment in Will and subsequently in


Arizonans for an Official English reaches this precise


issue that I'm speaking to.  No lower court has addressed


Professor Lapides' request for declaratory relief.  No


briefing has been accomplished on that, and there's been


no --


QUESTION:  But if you're not right about 1983,


assume now that a State is not a person for purposes of


1983.


MR. BEDERMAN:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Then what Federal element -- what


Federal question is left in the case? 


MR. BEDERMAN:  There would be none left. 


QUESTION:  And then with all the Eleventh


Amendment jurisprudence in the world, it would make sense


for any district judge to hang onto a case that at the


threshold had all the Federal elements taken out of it and


has nothing but State claims left. 


MR. BEDERMAN:  Certainly after these


proceedings, that might be the result that a district


court judge in the exercise of -- of its discretion may


wish to -- to achieve.  Our concern is precisely the one


that when Georgia invoked the jurisdiction of the Federal


courts for removal, it should have been with the

understanding that all claims would move to Federal court,


that the State could raise whatever defenses it wished to,


in other words, the defenses travel to Federal court.  But


what is not a permissible result is, in essence, the --


the splitting of claims, the disposition to Federal court


and then --


QUESTION:  I don't see how that -- how your


client is in any way harmed by any of this because he ends


up with what he wanted is his suit in State court.


MR. BEDERMAN:  Well, if I may make a broader


point.  The Eleventh Circuit's judgment, from which appeal


is sought here, is not entirely clear about this


distinction between barred and non-barred claims.  That


was not, of course, settled in any further proceedings in


the district court as to whether now the State claims


would proceed by remand back to State court. 


Of course, the State of Georgia sought the


dismissal of the entirety of Professor Lapides' case under


rule 12(b)(6) when it removed the case.  So, it's -- it's


now -- not entirely clear at the outset what Georgia's


intentions were in removing the case and then seeking


immunity.


Our proposition is simply that, as a matter of


not only judicial efficiency but also the integrity of the


removal statute and the fair meaning and understanding of

this Court's Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence, is that


when a State invokes Federal court jurisdiction under the


Eleventh Amendment, the entire case then moves to Federal


court and that the State cannot, thereafter, claim


immunity from the jurisdiction of the Federal courts in


those circumstances. 


If the State does not have the authority -- and


this was an earlier question -- under Ford Motor Company


to waive the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity via


removal, the proper course should have been in this case


simply for -- to find the removal was void ab initio and


have the entire matter remanded --


QUESTION:  But that's the end result you're


getting.  You're getting a remand and you want to have a


different label put on it.  But the bottom line is you


wanted a suit in State court.  That was removed.  There --


there's no Federal element left.  I can't imagine a


district judge who would hang onto such a case. 


MR. BEDERMAN:  Well, again, I would not presume


to anticipate the future proceedings and that may --


QUESTION:  Well, your legal position is


basically that a State should not be able to talk out of


both sides of its mouth I guess.  It should not be able to


remove and then when it gets to Federal court claim


Eleventh Amendment immunity.  Now, how much of that

argument is still valid after what's happened in this case


I'm not sure.


MR. BEDERMAN:  Well, I think even though


petitioner is, understandably, reluctant to introduce an


idiom of judicial estoppel into these proceedings with --


with obviously the clear indication that rules of estoppel


tend not to run against the sovereign, but again that is


precisely our concern. 


In the matter of -- of the -- the symmetry and


parity that occurs that when a State enters a Federal


proceeding, it submits the entire case to the -- to the


jurisdiction of the Federal courts.


QUESTION:  May I ask you, Mr. Bederman?  In the


brief in opposition to the certiorari petition, did anyone


point out the fact that maybe the State was not a person


within the meaning of 1983 and that that was the reason


not to take the case? 


MR. BEDERMAN:  Well, if I may review quickly. 


Yes.  And I do recall that the State did raise in its op


cert at page 10 the argument under Will.  I -- yes.  They


do opine that Will would -- would act against the -- the


claims raised for monetary relief by petitioners here.


QUESTION:  They're only after monetary relief.


MR. BEDERMAN:  I would not want to put that


gloss on -- on the States.  I'm reading just an isolated

passage on page 10 of their op cert.  That -- that is, in


essence, the -- the open question. 


If I could return, Chief Justice Rehnquist, to


your -- to your observation.  Again, while we don't think


it's necessary for the Court to rule on any judicial


estoppel principles, clearly this is an appropriate case


to draw a bright line rule in terms of States invoking


Federal court jurisdiction.  Either they have the


authority to do so and waive Eleventh Amendment immunity


and the entire case proceeds to Federal court or the State


officials or lawyers do not have that authority and the


proper disposition is remand. 


If I may reserve the balance of my time.

are afforded by the Eleventh Amendment.  Certainly a State


has both of those rights under the Eleventh Amendment.


But the question is the State can waive one


without waiving the other, and that's what it did here, by


selecting a forum, Federal forum, for the adjudication of


the claim.  But in doing that, it did not give up the


defenses that it had in State court.  And one of the


defenses that it had in State court, and it would also


have in Federal court, is a right not to be sued at all on


constitutional claims.  But what it did give up is the


right to proceed in State court, rather than Federal


court, on the claims that it already has waived in State


court. 


Now, the principle that justifies -- the -- the


State's invocation of Federal court jurisdiction through


removal is a particularly clear example of a State


voluntarily invoking Federal court jurisdiction.


QUESTION:  Mr. Gornstein, may I deflect you? 


Because I got from your brief the notion that this case is


academic, and let me read you from page 23, note 8.  The


question whether a State that removes a case waives its


immunity to constitutional claims is largely academic. 


Section 1983 does not authorize a suit against a State in

either State or Federal court.  It seems to me that you


were telling us in that footnote that whatever is said


about the removal, this case goes because the State is not


subject to 1983. 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  To the extent that there are


constitutional claims against a State, that's correct.  To


the extent that there are State law claims against the


State, that is not correct because the State has waived


its forum immunity with respect to the State law claims --


QUESTION:  Would a district judge be acting


reasonably to hold onto a case that has no Federal claim


that involves the State tort claims act, that those are --


the State claims are under the State's own tort claims


act, like the Federal Tort Claims Act.  Can you -- could a


Federal judge justify sitting to adjudicate a case against


a State under the State's tort claims act?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Justice Ginsburg, that would be


a question for the exercise of the district court's


discretion under the supplemental jurisdiction grounds. 


That -- certainly if the Federal -- all the Federal claims


were out of the case, one ground for remanding the rest of


the cases under the supplemental jurisdiction statute


would be present.  It would be a matter, though, for the


exercise of the district court's discretion.


QUESTION:  It was always my understanding that

the district court would take into account how far have we


gotten into the case --


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Correct.


QUESTION:  -- from the Federal --


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Right. 


QUESTION:  If you drop here, the Federal issue


drops out at the very threshold.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Correct, and that would argue


more strongly in favor of the district court exercising


its discretion in that direction, assuming there's no


other Federal claim in the case.  And let me just address


that briefly because it is our understanding that a suit


against a State official in his official capacity for


injunctive or declaratory relief is not a suit against the


State and it is a suit against the person under -- under


section 1983.  So, if there is a claim -- and I'm unsure


of whether the complaint should be read that way, but if


there is a claim against the individual defendants in


their official capacities for declaratory or injunctive


relief --


QUESTION:  I thought the -- the motion to


dismiss as to the individuals was granted on the grounds


of qualified immunity. 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Only as to the claims against


them in their personal capacities, not as -- with respect

to the claims against them in their official capacities. 


So, that claim, if it's -- if it was there to start with,


it's still there. 


QUESTION:  I don't understand the difference


between a claim against the State itself and the claim


against the State officer in his or her official capacity.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  The distinction that the court


drew was -- is this -- traces its origins to Ex parte


Young, that that is a suit against the officer in his


official capacity.  There's no allegation that he's done


anything in violation of State law, and you're not trying


to --


QUESTION:  What Mr. Lapides wants -- Mr.


Lapides, as I understand it, wants a money judgment.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  I think it's -- it's largely


true that he wants a money judgment, but there is one


allegation in his complaint upon which he relies in saying


that he's also seeking declaratory relief against an


individual -- an individual officer in his official


capacity.


QUESTION:  So, that's like suing the State.  In


-- in other words, there is a claim.  Under -- under 1983. 


A State is a person when you ask -- say I want an


injunction.  The State is a person. 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  I would say -- I don't want to

quibble too much with the semantics, but I would just -- I


would put it this way.  The official is not the State for


purposes of --


QUESTION:  All right.  Then that's a different


matter.  So, what you're saying is there is an action


against the official.  All right.  That's not the issue


because they dismissed all the claims against the


officials. 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  No, they did not --


QUESTION:  Oh.  So, there's still an action left


against the officials.  Fine. 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  If it was ever there, Justice


Breyer --


QUESTION:  Fine.  Okay, I got it.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  -- it's still there. 


QUESTION:  Now, if that's so, how could it not


be an abuse of discretion?  Assuming if that's even there,


how could it not be an abuse of discretion to refuse to


send this back to the State?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Again --


QUESTION:  A purely State matter. 


And -- and I'm not, you know, overwhelmingly far


out I think in this area, but I don't really see why --


why the State here wouldn't have a right to have it sent


back on the ground it would --

MR. GORNSTEIN:  It -- it wouldn't have a right


to have the case sent back.


QUESTION:  Why not? 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  It would never -- because it's a


matter for the district court --


QUESTION:  There is an abuse of discretion under


certain circumstances. 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  And what I would say --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  That would be the question


whether there is an abuse of discretion.


QUESTION:  And why not?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  And the -- I don't want to argue


that part of the case too much, but the reason would be if


there are still Federal law claims against -- 1983 *games


against the -- individuals and they arise out of a common


nucleus of operative facts with the claims against the


State, then it would still be fair to try those claims in


Federal court because the State made a voluntary choice to


bring this case into Federal court.  It had an option to


leave the entire suit in State court if it wanted to.  It


exercised the option to bring the case into Federal court.


Now, once it did that, under Federal law, the

Federal consequence of that is that a Federal court has


authority to adjudicate the very claims that the State has


brought there.  And the principle that --


QUESTION:  Are you saying that it's a different


case because the State removed it than it would have been


if the same factual circumstance had occurred in the case


originally brought in the district court?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  I am, Mr. Chief Justice, because


under this Court's decision in Pennhurst, if a plaintiff


files a suit in Federal court that includes both Federal


law claims and State law claims, the State law claims


against the State are -- have to be dismissed under


Pennhurst. 


But the situation is different.  This plaintiff


did just what the Pennhurst opinion suggested that he


should do, which is to file his claims against the State


under State law in State court.  And -- and with that, he


added his Federal law claims so that he could have a


single lawsuit filed in a single forum. 


Now, what the removal statute says is that


there's only can be removal if there -- you get the


consent of all the parties to the removal of the entire


case.  The removal statute does not allow for State court


defendants to divide up a single case or controversy into


two different cases in two different forums.  And the

State is effectively seeking to accomplish that goal. 


Now, it says it needs to do that because it


wants to get the benefit of a Federal forum for its State


employees.  But the -- just because the State has a


difficult choice to make about whether to remove a case to


Federal court or not doesn't mean its decision to bring


the case to Federal court isn't voluntary.  It's still a


voluntary decision to bring the case to Federal court.


It's also a little surprising to hear the State


say that it needs to have a Federal forum for its State


officials on Federal law issues when the State has


repeatedly and successfully argued to this Court that


State courts are fully competent and just as competent as


Federal courts to adjudicate Federal law issues. 


And it's -- it's particularly surprising that


the State thinks it's in the State's interest for its


employees to get an interlocutory appeal in Federal court


when the State's own policy is that they aren't entitled


to an interlocutory appeal.


QUESTION:  Well, the State is certainly entitled


to make a tactical judgment --


MR. GORNSTEIN:  It certainly is.


QUESTION:  -- that it's better off in Federal


court than it is in State court.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  It absolutely is, Mr. Chief

Justice, and all we are saying is once it does that, then


it has to accept the consequences of that choice, which is


the Federal court then has authority to adjudicate the


entire case that has been brought before them -- before


it.


I wanted to say a word about the -- the Ford


Motor Company case because in the Ford Motor Company case,


the Court did deem State law authority to consent to be


the critical issue.  But all other decisions in which the


Court has addressed the invocation issue, the Court has


held that an individual when -- I mean, when a State


invokes Federal court jurisdiction, it waives immunity as


a matter of Federal law. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Gornstein. 


Ms. Orland, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEVON ORLAND


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MS. ORLAND:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The State, along with its employees, removed


this case to Federal court so that its employees could


take advantage of a -- in a Federal forum. 


This does not amount to a waiver for two


reasons.  First, it is not a clear and unequivocal


expression of the State's desire to waive its immunity,

and second, the attorney --


QUESTION:  Is it a waiver of forum immunity as


opposed to immunity from suit?  Is there such a


distinction? 


MS. ORLAND:  Your Honor, this Court has never


made such a distinction, and the first I've ever heard of


the concept of forum immunity being parceled out from the


rest of the immunity was in this case.  Apparently there


was a recognition at some point by the petitioner in this


case that the Federal claims would be barred even in State


court, and then they've come up with this forum immunity


concept.


QUESTION:  It's not -- it's -- I mean, the


concept has been around.  I mean, we've -- we've held that


a State does not -- just because a State is willing to be


sued in its own courts does not automatically mean that it


can therefore be sued in Federal court.  Isn't that right?


MS. ORLAND:  Your Honor, the concept of what --


QUESTION:  Which -- which means that -- that you


can be immune in one forum and not immune in another


forum, although you're not immune from the suit entirely.


MS. ORLAND:  Your Honor, that is exactly what


the Court found in Pennhurst, but I would suggest that the


Court has also found in Pennhurst that the absence of that


choice, that concrete choice, would emasculate the

Eleventh Amendment.  So, what is being argued is by the


exercise of procedural device for the benefit of our


employees would cause a State to sacrifice a part of the


immunity which the absence of would emasculate --


QUESTION:  Well, that's -- you know, that's too


bad, isn't it? 


MS. ORLAND:  Well, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  The cost of getting the advantage of


Federal courts is that you -- you come into Federal court. 


It seems to me self-evident. 


Now, you say I have a good reason for wanting to


be in Federal court.  Well, you may indeed.  But there you


are.


MS. ORLAND:  Your Honor, first of all, I'd like


to point out that that cost is just too high.  As the


zealous advocate on behalf of all of my clients, I have to


choose between the individual's right to deal with the law


as it is in the State of Georgia, whether that's the State


of Georgia's choice or not, but the law in the State of


Georgia at the present time is that there is no right to


direct appeal.  So, as a zealous advocate on behalf of the


individual employees, we have a desire to protect the


individual employees from the right --


QUESTION:  But that's a right of the State of


Georgia to protect the individual employees, and the State

of Georgia has said the right to an interlocutory appeal


is not all that important.  You have the substantive


defense that you just can't because Georgia has its own


choice of whether it's better to have this decided after


the whole case or in the middle.  They think it's better


to wait till the case is over.  Now, why can't Georgia


make that decision? 


MS. ORLAND:  Georgia absolutely can make that


decision, Your Honor, through its legislative process, and


that's part of the point.


QUESTION:  Well, why shouldn't that decision


also influence the tactical decisions of the attorney


general when he's litigating? 


MS. ORLAND:  Because the attorney general


represents more than just the State in a lawsuit such as


this.  The individuals are also being represented by the


attorney general, and the State should not be required to


sacrifice all or part of its Eleventh Amendment immunity


so that the attorney general can zealously advocate --


QUESTION:  But it's the State of Georgia's


legislature who have made the decision that's troubling


for the State of Georgia's employees. 


MS. ORLAND:  Your Honor, but the employees have


to take the law as it is.


QUESTION:  Well, and the legislature didn't say

that no Georgia employee shall ever have an interlocutory


appeal in any court.  It had just said they don't happen


in Georgia courts. 


MS. ORLAND:  That's correct, and Congress has


seen fit to allow for a procedural device for State


defendants or any other defendants to take advantage of


the procedures available to them.  But nowhere did


Congress --


QUESTION:  But you're missing one very key thing


here.  Congress said in order to remove, all defendants


must remove.  Those officers could not have been -- could


not have removed on their own.  They had to have the


State's consent.  And for the State, after consenting, to


say, oh, we're going to accommodate you, we'll join in the


removal, but as soon as we get there, we're going to come


out, it seems to me that is just the clearest end run


around Congress' direction that all defendants have to


join in the removal petition.  It would be a sham removal


if someone were to say, okay, I agree to remove and be in


the Federal court, but the minute I get to Federal court,


I'm going to say, Federal court, you can't get me.


MS. ORLAND:  First of all, Your Honor, Congress


did not expressly state that all defendants needed to


agree.  That is a court-created doctrine, and I'm not


going to challenge the -- that doctrine.

 QUESTION:  It's a court interpretation of the


removal statute.


MS. ORLAND:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And -- and you're not going to


challenge that.  So, it's as good as if it were in the


statute, just as the sovereign immunity doctrine, although


it's not in the Eleventh Amendment, is there.


MS. ORLAND:  Your Honor, all that is true.  But


Congress also contemplated the remand of certain claims. 


And the only thing the State is asking in this case is for


the case to be treated as if it were originally filed in


Federal court, which it is our belief is the true intent


of the congressional removal statute.  They didn't allow


partial claims to be brought up, and the reason they


didn't allow for it is because of the court's potential


exercise of supplemental jurisdiction. 


But in this case, there can be no exercise of


supplemental jurisdiction simply because the legislature


for the State of Georgia has not waived its sovereign


immunity as to the Georgia Tort Claims Act for actions


within the courts of the United States. 


So, in this case, by the exercise of a


procedural device, the attorney general would not be only


overriding the very principles established in the concepts


of federalism, but would also be overriding the -- the

decisions of the State legislature and the Georgia


constitution. 


QUESTION:  Ms. Orland, then it seems to me the


obvious thing that the zealous representative of the State


would say is, sorry, we can't join in the removal


petition.  This case belongs in State court and we're not


going to engage in any subterfuge.  We -- it's just as


though it were brought originally.  It would be no good. 


So, we are not going to go through the sham of signing our


name onto a removal petition only to say that this case


can't be brought in Federal court.  If the State were


zealous in its position that only the State court can


adjudicate this, it had no business signing on to any


removal petition.


MS. ORLAND:  Your Honor, I understand the


concerns of the Court regarding the concept of saying


we're going to Federal court, but no, we're not.  The --


but the reality of the removal statute is, is it doesn't


allow for the removal of some claims, and that's a


procedural device available.  If there's a remedy to be


had, the remedy to be had is with Congress.  If there's a


problem with the removal statute not allowing certain


claims to be brought in Federal court and therefore the


whole case can't be removed --


QUESTION:  There's nothing wrong with the

statute.  It says all defendants have to join in the


removal, and the removal has to be -- it seems to me that


the State of Georgia really is playing rather fast and


loose with the -- with the Federal court when it says,


aha, we're going to bring this to accommodate -- to


accommodate two people who couldn't do it on their own.


MS. ORLAND:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  It seems to me that the case on


Georgia's own theory is non-removable from day one, and


that's the position that Georgia should have taken.  This


is not a case for a Federal court.


MS. ORLAND:  Then by very virtue of a sham


joinder of the State in a case, which in this case


arguably was done by suing the case -- State under 1983


and further by attempting to sue the State, for which


there has been no waiver of sovereign immunity as to


defamation of liable, a plaintiff can shamly decide that


individuals won't be entitled to --


QUESTION:  The plaintiff in this case wanted to


be in the State court.  It's the State that said Federal


court.  So, you can't -- this -- that's why this case is


so puzzling because it's the plaintiff who wants to be in


the Federal court -- in the State court.  And -- and the


State wants to take it into the Federal court.  It really


is something that only a lawyer could conceive.

 (Laughter.) 


MS. ORLAND:  Your Honor, I think that the


problem here is, is that by virtue of 1983 litigation,


individual employees get sued.  And it does create sort of


a quandary of issues because the individuals have a


desire, quite understandably I'm sure, to get the case


resolved, to --


QUESTION:  But -- but you're asking for a


broader principle, which it may well be that in -- in its


application to your case there's some -- you can


understand why the -- why the State wanted to go into


Federal court.  But what you're asking for is the general


principle that by coming into Federal court, you do not


waive State sovereign immunity, and that general principle


would have applied even if you had been the only defendant


in the State court.  And you removed to Federal court, and


then having gotten into Federal court, you moved to


dismiss on grounds of sovereign immunity, which is absurd.


MS. ORLAND:  Your Honor, I would agree it's


absurd, and that type of behavior could be sanctioned by


the court.  If a lawyer is going to play those kinds of


games, it is certainly within the court -- district


court's province to sanction ill-behavior.  And that's


what is being alleged that we did. 


But what I would point out is that every --

 QUESTION:  On what -- on what grounds would you


sanction the behavior if you're saying that it's lawful. 


I don't understand that. 


MS. ORLAND:  Your Honor, if it --


QUESTION:  You're saying, counsel, you have


exercised every right that we can give you under the law. 


We're now sanctioning you for doing that.  That -- I don't


understand that. 


MS. ORLAND:  I'm sorry if I misspoke.  If a


lawyer is going to remove a case and do it for the


purposes of delay or some other misconceived purpose --


QUESTION:  Lawyers do all sorts of things for


the purposes of delay. 


(Laughter.)


MS. ORLAND:  And it's improper. 


QUESTION:  I'm not -- I'm not sure it is.  I


think in many cases an attorney will look at two different


choices, particularly if you're a defendant, and you'll


choose the thing that will delay the case's final


resolution.  And nothing improper about that. 


MS. ORLAND:  There's nothing improper about


that, but in the scenario that if it is improper, if it is


determined that there is some attempt to elongate


litigation for an improper purpose, the court has the


discretion to sanction that behavior.

 Moreover, Congress has the ability to change --


QUESTION:  Yes, but you're not -- they're not


elongating the case.  They're trying to terminate it in a


hurry in this particular --


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  And I just don't understand how that


could possibly be sanctionable conduct if we say it's a


proper usage of the removal statute and it doesn't waive


sovereign immunity.  They'll do it all the time. 


MS. ORLAND:  Your Honor, I'm not saying we did


anything improper.  I'm saying that in the event that


somebody did do something improper, that's sanctionable.


QUESTION:  Yes, but the question is whether this


particular maneuver is -- is authorized by law or not. 


And if it's authorized by law, it surely isn't improper.


QUESTION:  Indeed, it would be improper not to


take advantage of it.


QUESTION:  Sure. 


QUESTION:  You should be sanctioned as


incompetent counsel. 


(Laughter.) 


MS. ORLAND:  Hence, the quandary of being a


State litigator, Your Honor.  And that's exactly the


point.  We have several clients here.  The -- the attorney


general's office represents the individuals as well as the

State entity on both State and Federal claims. 


You're right.  All of the Federal claims are


gone.  Even if you read at joint appendix 17 the


plaintiff's assertion that he is seeking declaratory


relief, which I would suggest is not a clear statement of


declaratory relief -- it is a request for declaratory


relief under State law.  So, if the Court --


QUESTION:  It just occurred to me that maybe


there is sanctionable conduct here because you have a


conflict of interest.  Your interest in the employees is


definitely directly opposed to your interest representing


the State.  So, maybe you should have gotten separate


counsel. 


MS. ORLAND:  Well, Your Honor, in fact at some


point in this litigation we did.  But at the initial point


of the removal, there was no reason to. 


And I think this goes to Justice Kennedy's


concurrence in Wisconsin, which is if the State is going


to be placed in some tactical disadvantage, this rule


should not be adopted. 


The tactical disadvantage in this case is quite


simple.  The State would be at odds with its employees. 


The State would not be in a position where there is no


Eleventh Amendment protection as to some claims perhaps --


or it hasn't been decided yet for ADA Title II claims --

to have a Federal court be the first to adjudicate those


types of issues and have the fastest course to this Court


for a determination --


QUESTION:  The State would be at odds with its


employees because the employees want an interlocutory


appeal and they can't get it in the State court?


MS. ORLAND:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  That -- that sort of thing arises


frequently.  Do you move for a change of venue or not in a


particular case where you've got multiple defendants?  And


as Justice Stevens said, perhaps a lawyer ought not to


have multiple defendants if they're going to have


different -- different approaches to the thing.


MS. ORLAND:  Well, Your Honor, I think that's --


that's exactly the point here is -- and also the point as


to why the attorney general, as the litigator on behalf of


the State and its employees, should not be in a position


to make a decision as to waiver.  That's why it goes to


the legislature.


QUESTION:  May I interrupt once more?  I hate to


-- I'm sorry --


MS. ORLAND:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  -- I'm interrupting so many times.


But is it your position that the general rule


should be that removal waives the State's sovereign

immunity, but there should be an exception when there's a


good reason because of a conflict of interest?  Or is your


-- your position is that it will never waive sovereign


immunity?


MS. ORLAND:  Your Honor, the only time that it


could waive sovereign immunity is if the State legislature


says I authorize the attorney general --


QUESTION:  No.  Absent a State legislature --


you're arguing for a general rule, not just for a rule


that will protect you in this particular case.


MS. ORLAND:  That is correct. 


QUESTION:  Well, a general rule.  My goodness. 


Suppose the State comes in and they have four claims and


they -- they wanted -- they say, oh, I have a great idea. 


I'm going to get this claim litigated over here in the


Federal court and there are three related claims.  It's a


bankruptcy matter, for example, and they just pick and


choose.  I mean, normally when -- when you have waiver in


constitutional law, say the Fifth Amendment, you -- you


start waiving answers to one question and related


questions are going to be waived too. 


MS. ORLAND:  Well, Your Honor, and that's


exactly the point, is there is no clear statement of


waiver here by Congress or the State legislature.  I don't


think you can just pick and choose a waiver.

 QUESTION:  All right.  Well, I mean, but Justice


Stevens' question is that you're arguing for a general


principle that -- that they don't waive anything.  Is that


right? 


They -- they come into Federal court.  Why did


they do it?  They came into Federal court in all these


others because there was a claim they wanted litigated


either for them or against the State.  So, I would have


thought they would at least have waived all related


matters. 


MS. ORLAND:  Your Honor, in all the cases relied


upon by the petitioner where the State has come into


Federal court, the court's first inquiry was whether the


Eleventh Amendment applied.  In all of those cases, the


court first found that the Eleventh Amendment simply was


inapplicable.  When the State is acting as a plaintiff or


in any form or fashion or entering in as a party, it's not


a suit commenced or prosecuted against the State.  The


petitioner in this case conceded that the act of removal


does not translate the State from a defendant to a


plaintiff.  Yet, they are asserting that the cases where


the State has entered in as a plaintiff somehow are


applicable, and they are not applicable.


QUESTION:  But on your theory, even if the State


had come in as a plaintiff in the first place, you would

have sovereign immunity, wouldn't you?  Because the


legislature hasn't waived it.


MS. ORLAND:  Your Honor, the Eleventh Amendment


would just simply be inapplicable if the State entered as


-- as a plaintiff. 


QUESTION:  I thought you were claiming sovereign


immunity.  I mean, it -- I mean, sovereign immunity today


is something broader than the strict terms of the Eleventh


Amendment, and I thought you were making the -- the full


claim.


MS. ORLAND:  Your Honor, I'm sorry.  I'm


baffled.  But I think that sovereign immunity --


QUESTION:  Well, I have had that problem too in


some of the prior cases. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  But I -- I haven't agreed with them,


but I -- I have to accept what they are.  And -- and the


-- the principle of sovereign immunity is a principle


today that is not limited by the -- by the strict terms of


the Eleventh Amendment.


MS. ORLAND:  As was pointed out I guess in Alden


is the Eleventh Amendment has stood for the greater


principles of sovereign immunity, and I think that that's


what we're talking about here.  And I think it's also been


concretely held that the Eleventh Amendment in its broader

principles perhaps doesn't apply to the State when it


enters into an action as a plaintiff.  And I think that


that's an entirely different -- I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  No.  I -- I want to ask you a -- a


kind of question which is subsumed -- a narrower question


which is subsumed within the broader one, and that is


let's -- let's put this situation aside and assume that we


have the -- the conflict-free situation in which the


employees have their own counsel and the -- the State is


-- is represented simply by -- by separate counsel.  The


employees want to remove and the State, as -- as a


defendant separately represented, agrees to the removal. 


On your theory, as I understand it, the State would still


be able at a later time to claim its immunity because the


legislature had not authorized that removal.  Is that


correct?


MS. ORLAND:  It's not that the legislature


hasn't authorized the removal.  It's that the legislature


hasn't authorized a waiver of the State's immunity.


QUESTION:  All right.  And -- and so, in -- in


that particular case that I -- I posed to you in which we


have separately represented defendants, the State consents


to the removal.  The State still would not have lost its


immunity by consenting to the removal.


MS. ORLAND:  No, it would not, Your Honor, and I

think --


QUESTION:  All right.  Now, in that situation


then, how do you answer the argument that came up in the


briefs that that would give the -- the State the


opportunity to sit back and see how things go?  And if the


-- if the case turns out well for them, they can claim the


-- the judgment.  If the State doesn't go well for them,


they can simply raise the question of immunity not only to


escape the judgment, but to escape any estoppel later on. 


I mean, is -- is there any answer to that, or do you


simply say, yup, that's a great position to be in and


that's our position?


MS. ORLAND:  Well, Your Honor, first of all, I


would say that that is a different situation.  Obviously


the Court knows that.  But this Court's jurisprudence is


consistent with the State being able to assert its


Eleventh Amendment immunity at any time.  The Court has


not differed from that jurisprudence. 


But what I would point out in this case is the


State was very up-front from the beginning.  This


wasn't --


QUESTION:  No, I'm not talking about this


situation.  I'm talking about where your position leads


us.  And I take it that your position does lead us to the


-- to the sort of the options that -- that I've just

described. 


MS. ORLAND:  Your Honor, it does but -- and I


think that that would be consistent with this Court's


jurisprudence.  But at the same time, I would suggest that


the State has a vested interest in not going to trial at


all.  So, I would suggest that since Ford, there probably


haven't been a lot of situations where the State has been


in a position of litigating a case to the end, and it


hasn't come up since Ford.  So, I think that that's fairly


significant. 


QUESTION:  Ms. Orland, what if -- what if your


-- your State attorney general brings suit in Federal


court?


MS. ORLAND:  Then the Eleventh Amendment simply


doesn't apply.


QUESTION:  Why?  He has no authority to waive


sovereign immunity you say.


MS. ORLAND:  There's no waiver of sovereign


immunity --


QUESTION:  What about a counterclaim by the


defendant? 


MS. ORLAND:  There's no dipping into the State's


pocket.  The counterclaim can go as far as the defense. 


This Court has repeatedly found that an entry into a forum


or the beginning of suit allows the party being sued to

defend against the claim.  But that's not the same as

What the petitioner is alleging is that somehow


the bifurcation of cases is an unheard of result and that


it should be exchanged from the State's -- thank you. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Orland.


Ms. Parsley, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JULIE C. PARSLEY


ON BEHALF OF TEXAS, ET AL.,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS


MS. PARSLEY:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The decision to waive sovereign immunity and


consent to suit traditionally rests with the State's


legislature, a body uniquely able to both balance


challenges to the public fisc and determine when such a


waiver is both in the citizens' will and the public good.


QUESTION:  Have we inquired, when States bring a


suit in Federal court, whether the State attorney general


has authority to appear?  Because, you know, when you come


in Federal court and you're subject to a counterclaim. 


Have we -- have we asked district judges to inquire


whether the State attorney general has authority to waive


sovereign immunity?


MS. PARSLEY:  No, Your Honor, the Court has not.

 QUESTION:  We have not.  And -- and is it your


position that as soon as a counterclaim is filed, what? 


The whole suit has to be dismissed or -- or what -- what


happens then? 


MS. PARSLEY:  No, Your Honor.  Our position


would be that as to the -- the specific compulsory


counterclaim that may be litigated against the State as a


plaintiff, that is permissible to the extent of the res. 


In other words, when the State comes in as a plaintiff --


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  To the extent -- I didn't


hear the word. 


MS. PARSLEY:  The res, the subject matter of the


litigation. 


QUESTION:  So, you say the attorney general,


even though he has no power to waive State sovereign


immunity, can achieve a waiver of State sovereign immunity


by bringing suit which is subject to a compulsory


counterclaim. 


MS. PARSLEY:  He does have the authority to


represent the State, and presumably he has the authority


also by the legislature to bring the cause of action that


he is asserting with the State as a plaintiff. 


QUESTION:  So, the same here when -- when he


doesn't have authority to waive sovereign immunity, but he


has authority to remove to Federal court.  And if that

results in a waiver of sovereign immunity, so be it.


MS. PARSLEY:  But the two are specifically


different because, as a defendant, you're looking at this


-- it would be an implied waiver as opposed to an express


waiver.  As a plaintiff, even the United States, it has


been admitted, they are not -- they are also subject to


waiver for compulsory counterclaims to the extent of the


res.  It has been --


QUESTION:  Why isn't that an implied waiver too?


Brings suit -- the -- the State brings suit in Federal


court is subject to a counterclaim.  And you're saying


that the State is -- is subject to adjudication of that


counterclaim.  Now, there's no express waiver there.  It's


just an implied waiver from bringing the action in Federal


court.  Why isn't removal the same? 


MS. PARSLEY:  Well, that is the situation that


occurred in Gardner, Your Honor, for the -- for the proof


of claim instance with bankruptcy litigation.  And that is


-- so, it is not -- and it's not been seen as an implied


waiver because the State has put in issue the res and the


subject matter of the litigation. 


But in this case --


QUESTION:  Well, you speak of the res of the


litigation.  Supposing the State simply wants to collect a


bad debt from somebody.  There's no res.  Maybe he doesn't

have anything at all.  But it simply wants a money


judgment against him for $100,000.


MS. PARSLEY:  Yes, Your Honor.  That would be --


then the State would be able --


QUESTION:  There's no -- there's no res there.


MS. PARSLEY:  But it is the subject matter of


the litigation; that is, his -- that would be what the


State would be adjudicating. 


In this instant, what distinguishes it is that


the State is not transformed from a defendant to a


plaintiff when it removes to Federal court, and the


literal text of the Eleventh Amendment proscribes cases


prosecuted against a State.


QUESTION:  What happens under State law, say, in


Texas if -- it's a tort action.  It's against the State. 


Everybody in your office thinks that there is no sovereign


immunity, but just before the jury is about to come in,


somebody dredges up a statute and says, oh, my God, we had


sovereign immunity.  We forgot to make the defense.


MS. PARSLEY:  The Texas Supreme Court has held


that sovereign immunity is subject matter jurisdiction.


QUESTION:  So, in other words, you can come in


in Texas, a jury is about to come in, you're just about to


lose the case, the last minute you discover this defense,


and just they'll -- they'll dismiss the case?

 MS. PARSLEY:  That actually, to my knowledge,


has not happened yet.  That case was decided only a couple


of years ago.


QUESTION:  They wouldn't say you had waived it.


MS. PARSLEY:  No.  We -- we would not assert


that we have waived --


QUESTION:  I know you wouldn't assert that.  I


just wonder what the judge in Texas --


MS. PARSLEY:  We would hope the judge would


agree with us.


But that -- and that is.  You put your finger on


the point that some -- that people dislike about sovereign


immunity.  It does give the State superior rights in some


instances to other litigants, but that is because the


State is a sovereign, just like the U.S. is a sovereign. 


The immunity --


QUESTION:  I don't -- I don't object to that.  I


object to -- to a dog in the manger, I mean, to say one


thing and then say another thing.  And here's the State


saying I want to be in Federal court and -- and gets there


and the State says, I don't want to be in Federal court. 


I mean, that -- that's what I object to.


MS. PARSLEY:  Well --


QUESTION:  You can have all the sovereign


immunity you want.  Just -- you know, just decide whether

you want it or don't want it. 


MS. PARSLEY:  And all -- all we are really


asking for, Justice Scalia, is to have the same defenses


that would be available to us if the plaintiff had chosen


to file the lawsuit in Federal court.  We are just


employing a procedural device to bring us into Federal


court so that we can adjudicate the claims of our


employees and that, if we have defenses, they can be


heard.


QUESTION:  Well, they could be adjudicated in


State court, couldn't they?  The Federal issues?


MS. PARSLEY:  They could be.  They -- they could


be adjudicated in State court.


QUESTION:  What they don't like here is no


interlocutory appeal I gather.


MS. PARSLEY:  Yes, that is -- that's true.


QUESTION:  Well, that's the State's own fault. 


I mean, the State could have an interlocutory appeal if it


chose to do so, couldn't it? 


MS. PARSLEY:  They could, but in the Johnson


case, of course, this Court stated that the State courts


do not have to have a parallel system similar to the


Federal courts.


QUESTION:  I take it the State of Texas is not


asserting that its courts are less capable of interpreting

Federal law than Federal courts are? 


MS. PARSLEY:  Not -- not at all, Justice


Kennedy.  Not at all.  And we don't mean any disrespect in


that regard. 


QUESTION:  In fact, you prefer your


interpretation of Federal law, don't you?


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  It seems to me everything that you've


said leads to the conclusion that this was a non-removable


case from day one and that the State should not have --


should not have joined that removal petition.


MS. PARSLEY:  Actually that -- we do not agree


with that because there's no clear statement in the


removal statute indicating that the State would have


waived its immunity had it removed.  Also, there's no


section 5 power on behalf of Congress to actually abrogate


the State's immunity.  So --


QUESTION:  I don't get -- I don't get it all. 


If the State is immune from suit in the Federal court,


then it seems to me it follows it has no authority to


remove the case to the Federal court.  It can't initiate


action.  It can't say, Federal court, hear this case, and


then say, Federal court, you don't have power to hear it. 


It seems the two go together.  If the Federal -- if the


State is not amenable to suit in Federal court, the State

is not positioned to remove the case to Federal court.


MS. PARSLEY:  But that would be similar to the


-- to the argument they made in Schacht in that you cannot


remove a case with barred claims.  The removal statute


does not prohibit the State -- States from removing --


QUESTION:  Not barred -- the statute of


limitations is a defense.  You're saying that the -- the


State has not consented to suit.  As long as it doesn't


consent to suit in Federal court, it seems to me it's in a


non-removable position in the State court because either


it's going to consent or it's not going to consent.  If it


doesn't consent, it -- it doesn't have any authority to


remove.


MS. PARSLEY:  Well, it may be a fine


distinction, but consenting to the removal, we would argue


and is argued in the briefs, is not the same thing as


consenting to waive our Eleventh Amendment immunity.  The


only way we could actually waive our Eleventh Amendment


immunity is if we were vested with that power by the


legislature.  And Texas is not, Georgia is not.  And under


Ford Motor Company, that's the appropriate analysis that


the court would engage in, whether we were --


QUESTION:  What -- what do you think is at stake


now?  On the -- I think that you did -- you did bring up


the question of 1983 liability, that there -- that this

was not a Federal case to begin with.  Is that -- is that


right?


MS. PARSLEY:  I believe that -- that Georgia,


when they moved -- when they answered, they both raised


Will and the Eleventh Amendment in their answer.  That is


correct. 


QUESTION:  So, it seems to me that we are


arguing over an academic question because no matter what,


this case is going to return to the Georgia State court.


MS. PARSLEY:  It's not academic on this -- for


this point.  This is really a reinvigoration of the


implied waiver doctrine that the Court fully rejected in


College Savings Bank.  This is -- the analogy is parallel


to the market participation theory.  In the market --


market participation theory, the State was held as having


waived its immunity because it voluntarily engaged in an


activity --


QUESTION:  Yes, but all those could be very


interesting questions.  The bottom line, no matter how you


look at this case, is it goes back to the State court. 


So, if -- you -- you had said initially no 1983 liability. 


Right?  And that the Federal court should --


MS. PARSLEY:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And I had thought that in the recent


case we had said if you have that picture, the Federal

court is supposed to deal with the 1983.  Wasn't it


Vermont Agency?


MS. PARSLEY:  Yes, Vermont Agency.  The


statutory question. 


QUESTION:  Yes, right. 


MS. PARSLEY:  That it could be dealt with first,


yes.


QUESTION:  Right.


MS. PARSLEY:  That is entirely possible, and the


district court -- it would have been well advised to have


done that, but the district court did not choose to do


that.  Instead, it ruled on the Eleventh Amendment.


QUESTION:  But in any -- any way you look at


this, the case ends up in -- in the State court.  So, it


seems to me that you really are arguing an academic


question. 


MS. PARSLEY:  Well, to the extent that the


petitioner is challenging the Eleventh Circuit's judgment,


they do want to remain in Federal court.  And so,


therefore, they are actually challenging the judgment and


not just the opinion.  So, there is a justiciable question


on appeal.


I did want to say quickly that in relation to


the implied waiver doctrine, that a State shouldn't have


to choose between what is an otherwise legal activity,

which is removal, and the forfeiture of its immunity.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Parsley. 


Mr. Bederman, you have 4 minutes left. 


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BEDERMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. BEDERMAN:  If I may, Justice Ginsburg, I was


not entirely as helpful as I could have been in response


to your earlier lines of questioning.  If I can be of


assistance to the Court.


Professor Lapides, in his complaint, alleged


declaratory grounds and declaratory relief at -- at pages


-- joint appendix pages 17 and 19. 


And a review of the district court's first order


at petition appendix 27a, while admittedly the -- the


holding is not entirely crystal clear, in terms of


reserving the claims against individuals in their personal


capacity, although no mention is made of the nature of the


relief, the cases cited by the district court maybe are


indicative that in the district court's mind was the open


question of the availability of declaratory relief. 


QUESTION:  Are you talking about paragraph 26 of


the complaint? 


MR. BEDERMAN:  Yes, sir, I am.


QUESTION:  Well, that just says, I want a


judicial finding that what Kansas did amounts to

defamation.  I take it that's a defamation claim under


State law.  What has that got to do with it?


MR. BEDERMAN:  Well, I think, of course, all


paragraphs in a complaint need to be read together in view


of the earlier allegations, in view of this course of


conduct interfering with Professor Lapides'


constitutionally granted due process rights at both


paragraphs 1 and at paragraph 8 of the complaint.  I think


when read together, paragraph 26 fairly raises in terms


of --


QUESTION:  Read them together.  I just read it. 


What he says is I want a judicial finding that Kansas


State action gives rise to a new -- is defamatory, thereby


giving rise to a new cause of action every time the


information is published.  Okay?  Read it together so it


states a Federal claim.  I'm not saying you can't.  I just


want to hear it. 


MR. BEDERMAN:  No.  I'm not sure on the bare


terms of paragraph 26 that the request for declaratory


relief is particularly tied to a Federal cause of action. 


All I can point the Court to is both paragraphs 1 and 8 of


the complaint which frame the Federal question. 


If I may, in terms of -- of a second point,


about the concern for tactical disadvantage that the State


may be put in, if the Court rules either that removal

constitutes waiver, that the Georgia Supreme Court in a


1994 decision made clear that denials of qualified


immunity defenses are subject to immediate certification


for appeal by trial court judges.  So, I think it's


extravagant to suggest that under Georgia law currently


that there is no effective mechanism for the review,


immediate review, of -- of denials of qualified immunity


defenses.  And this is more fully explained at reply brief


page 11 filed by the petitioner. 


If I may make one last point, and that is by no


means is petitioner asserting that by virtue of removal,


plaintiffs become defendants and defendants become


plaintiffs.  Instead, our submission is simply that


removal is a forum selection, that when the State engages


in that forum selection, it is waiving, for purposes of


the case and the authority of the Federal courts to


adjudicate, the State's forum immunity under the Eleventh


Amendment.


If there are no other --


QUESTION:  Well, I don't mean to pursue a red


horse.  I just don't want to miss something if it's there. 


Where in paragraph 1 or 8 does it ask for a declaration?


MR. BEDERMAN:  It does -- neither paragraph 1


nor 8 specifically refers to declaratory relief.  If you


-- if you flip to the prayer for relief at pages 18 and


57


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

19, of course, most of it is for -- for monetary damages. 


But, of course, the last prayer is for all relief that the


court may deem just and proper. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you.  Thank you,


Mr. Bederman.


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
