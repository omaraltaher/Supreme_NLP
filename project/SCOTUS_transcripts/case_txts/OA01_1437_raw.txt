JUSTICE STEVENS:  The Court will hear argument


in Number 01-1437, Branch against Smith, and the cross-


appeal of Smith against Branch. 


Mr. McDuff, you may proceed.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT B. McDUFF


ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS/CROSS-APPELLEES BRANCH, ET AL.


MR. McDUFF:  Justice Stevens, may it please the


Court:


For 40 years, ever since the decision in


Baker versus Carr, State court judges, like Federal


judges, have played a role in addressing constitutional


problems stemming from malapportionment.  This was


reflected in Scott versus Germano in 1965, and again in 

Growe versus Emison in 1993 when the Court said not only


that State judges play a role, but they are preferred to


Federal judges as agents of reapportionment. 


In this congressional redistricting case from


Mississippi, the Chancery Court of Hinds County, acting


with the blessing of the Mississippi Supreme Court,


stepped into the breach and adopted a plan when the


legislature defaulted.  That plan has been enjoined by the


Federal district court, and the United States Department


of Justice has said not once, but twice that it was

postponing the statutory time period for preclearance


under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act so that even now,


nearly 1 year after the plan was adopted and submitted, no


preclearance decision has been made.  A Federal court


order is in place telling State courts they may not hear


congressional redistricting cases. 


QUESTION:  Now, did -- did Mississippi appeal


from the injunction?


MR. McDUFF:  They did not, Your Honor, but we


did.  And we were allowed to intervene in this case to


defend the State court judgment, which my clients had a


right to seek, and which they did secure redistricting the


State of Mississippi. 


QUESTION:  But -- but the issue is whether the


State was still pursuing the -- the redistricting that was 

the subject of the application to the Attorney General,


and whether it was doing so or not depended upon whether


the State was appealing from the Federal injunction. 


If the State accepted the Federal injunction, it no longer


was pursuing the -- the reapportionment.


MR. McDUFF:  I don't -- I don't know -- I


respectfully disagree, Justice Scalia.  This is a State


court order, and the Attorney General of Mississippi has


no right to refuse it or not, and he certainly has no


right to undo it.

 QUESTION:  Well, and he also has no right to


ignore a Federal injunction --


MR. McDUFF:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  -- unless he -- unless he appeals it. 


He has every right to appeal it.  He represents the State,


and he chose not to appeal it.


MR. McDUFF:  That's correct, but -- but unlike


the situation -- but we -- I guess my first answer is, we


did appeal it, and so the injunction is --


QUESTION:  But you're not the State.


MR. McDUFF:  -- is subject to being overruled. 


QUESTION:  The problem with that is that you're


not the State. 


MR. McDUFF:  That's correct.  But unlike a


situation where, for example, an injunction is issued 

against a criminal law, or regulatory provision that the


Attorney General, or the State defendants have some


discretionary authority to enforce, and where it makes


sense that if they do not want to appeal, no one else


should be allowed to appeal if they're not -- if they


don't care enough about enforcement, this is an order that


the Attorney General, and the State defendants are


required to obey, assuming Federal obstacles are


eliminated.


Now, if the Attorney General doesn't appeal for

whatever reason, it makes sense to allow the people who


secured the judgment in State court to intervene and


defend that.  Otherwise --


QUESTION:  Why does it make sense under a


statute in which the action of the State is by -- by


definition crucial? 


MR. McDUFF:  Because the action of the -- the


action of the State here is the action of the State


courts, and they have issued an injunction.  The Attorney


General cannot undo that.


QUESTION:  But if we're talking about section 5,


the language of section 5 is whenever a State shall enact


or seek to administer any voting qualification, et cetera. 


And because the State is not currently seeking to


administer anything, enact, I take it means legislation. 

Seek to administer could be the executive, but the


executive, since it's not appealing the injunction, isn't


currently seeking to administer anything. 


MR. McDUFF:  I think -- I think the executive is


seeking to administer it just as much as he was back when


the plan was first submitted.  If the Federal obstacles


are removed -- the constitutional injunction, and the


preclearance obstacle -- the State defendants are going to


abide by the order of the chancery court, and submit this


plan --

 QUESTION:  But we would -- we would not require


the -- the State or the -- the Federal courts to do a


vain -- or the Attorney -- the Federal Attorney General to


perform a vain act.  What use would it be for him to


approve the reapportionment when the State Attorney


General is still subject to a Federal court injunction


which he has not appealed and therefore cannot ignore? 


What possible good would it be for the Attorney General


to -- to approve the -- the apportionment?


MR. McDUFF:  To remove the section 5 obstacle as


quickly as possible, consistent with the 60-day deadline


in the statute, so that once the constitutional obstacle


is removed, the plan can be in force.


QUESTION:  But the constitutional obstacle won't


be removed as long as the Attorney General doesn't --

doesn't appeal the Federal court injunction.


MR. McDUFF:  Well, that -- that is assuming


that -- that my clients don't have standing, and I think


we clearly do as parties who secured the State court


judgment.  Otherwise, you would be in a situation where


the Attorney General could unilaterally nullify the State


court injunction simply by not defending it.  That's one


reason my clients were allowed in this case, was to defend


the State court injunction they secured.


QUESTION:  Mr. McDuff, can I ask you what is the

status of the State court litigation?  Is there an appeal


pending there? 


MR. McDUFF:  There is an appeal pending filed by


the State court intervenors challenging the chancery


court's plan. 


QUESTION:  And how do you explain the failure of


the Mississippi Supreme Court to rule on that appeal?


MR. McDUFF:  That -- the briefs have been filed. 


No oral argument is scheduled.  I think -- I -- I don't


know, but I think the Mississippi Supreme Court is waiting


to hear from this Court what it should do because it is


looking at a Federal court order telling it it has no


business in congressional redistricting.  And the --


the --


QUESTION:  Well, excuse me.  Is our decision


going to affect that Federal court order? 


MR. McDUFF:  I'm sorry? 


QUESTION:  Is our decision going to affect that


Federal court order? 


MR. McDUFF:  Well, we -- we are certainly asking


this Court to -- to vacate the Federal court order. 


And --


QUESTION:  It's a -- that's the problem I have


trying to figure this out.  Suppose -- suppose we looked


at the preclearance, and suppose I thought that it hasn't

been precleared and it should have been.  And the reason


it hasn't been precleared is the reason that's been


discussed, that -- that they haven't tried to administer


it yet and when -- and they -- and the Department has


60 days from the time that the State tries to administer


it.  I mean, I thought that's what the statute says,


doesn't it, that they have --


MR. McDUFF:  It says 60 days after it's


submitted, it's --


QUESTION:  Yes, enacts or seeks to administer. 


MR. McDUFF:  That is correct. 


QUESTION:  They have to enact, and this doesn't


sound like an enactment.  It sounds like something -- seek


to administer, and they haven't sought to administer it.


All right. 


So then we'd send it back. 

Then the Department would have to decide whether


to preclear it.  Well, they may well preclear it.  Or what


happens next?  That's where I'm a little confused.


I mean, it -- the -- the real constitutional


issue here -- or one of them anyway -- is assuming there


is the preclearance, then has the Mississippi court acted


unconstitutionally in assuming authority to issue a plan,


whereas previously, the Mississippi court had said you


lack -- we lack that authority.  And all of a sudden, we


have an order here which seems to overrule in earlier

cases, and it doesn't even have an opinion. 


In other words, can you help clarify what we


should say in this case on the assumption that we ended up


thinking it should be precleared?


MR. McDUFF:  I think -- I think there are two


things we want you to say.  First is that the Federal


court's constitutional basis for the injunction is wrong,


and that Mississippi courts, like courts -- like courts


throughout the country, do have a right to adjudicate


congressional redistricting cases, at least where the


legislature defaults. 


And then, second, we are asking you to rule that


as a result of the passage of the 60-day period, the plan


has been precleared. 


If you agree with us on the first issue, 

disagree on the second, then the -- then the matter will


be remanded to the district court and the preclearance


process --


QUESTION:  But Mr. McDuff, the --


MR. McDUFF:  -- will go forward in the Justice


Department. 


QUESTION:  Mr. McDuff, on your first point,


which you would like us to decide first, I thought the


district court expressly made that a contingent ruling. 


Didn't it say if we're wrong on that this plan hasn't been

precleared, if we're wrong, then we have this alternate


constitutional point.  They phrased it that way as if to


say, we would like the court to understand that our


principle ruling is that this plan hasn't been precleared.


MR. McDUFF:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  But if we're reversed on that, then


we have something else we want the court to know about. 


So, it seems to me that it was a highly conditional


ruling, the kind of ruling, let's say, that a -- that a


trial court would make under rule 50, when it


conditionally rules on a new trial motion.


MR. McDUFF:  I don't know if it was a


conditional ruling, Justice Ginsburg.  It was an


alternative ruling, and we are appealing both grounds. 


And I think it makes perfect sense to deal with them both 

in one appeal rather than --


QUESTION:  Why?  It makes perfect sense to reach


the constitutional issue when there's no need to do so? 


I mean, if -- if we agree -- if -- if we disagree with you


on the second point, there's no need for us to -- to rule


on -- on the first point.  Is there? 


MR. McDUFF: 

Well --


QUESTION:  By the same token --


QUESTION:  Whether -- whether or not the -- the


Federal district court used it as a makeweight, there's

just no need for us to reach it. 


QUESTION:  Well, there are two questions I had.


First of all, was it proper for the district


court to decide a constitutional issue which was totally


unnecessary to support its judgment? 


MR. McDUFF:  The -- I -- I think it was, and


I do think it is necessary to reach that issue because


otherwise, we're going to go -- if -- however you rule


on the section 5 issue, the case goes back down. 


Hopefully the plan is either declared precleared by this


Court or later precleared by the Attorney General.  The --


the district court is simply going to reinstate that


constitutional ruling.  This case will come back up here


on appeal, and we'll be into the 2004 election cycle.


QUESTION:  All right. 
 That's -- that's true, 

but look, there's a case, Wise v. Lipscomb --


MR. McDUFF:  Yes, sir. 


QUESTION:  -- which you've seen, and in that


case, this Court says, in those circumstances -- which are


these -- until clearance has been obtained, a court should


not address the constitutionality of the new measure.  So,


we said specifically, don't address it. 


Now, what -- what are we supposed to do about


that?


MR. McDUFF:  That -- that's correct, Your Honor,

but the cases from which that statement emanates, and the


only cases in which this Court has been called upon to


apply that principle are Connor versus Waller, and


United States versus Board of Supervisors of Warren


County, which we discuss at the beginning of our reply


brief.  But those are cases that are very different


from this one.  In those cases, the Federal district


courts substituted constitutional analysis for the


preclearance process and -- and ordered the use of un­


precleared plans.


Here the Federal district court enjoined the use


of a -- an allegedly un-precleared plan and gave an


alternative ruling the same way courts do -- the -- in the


same fashion that courts do all the time.  And in these


circumstances, I think it makes sense to go ahead and deal 

with both issues on the appeal so we don't have this case


bouncing up and down the appellate ladder while, number


one, the Mississippi Supreme Court is trying to figure out


what to do, and number two, we've got a March 1, 2004


deadline approaching.


QUESTION:  Is there any chance the


legislature -- which is its job, I take it -- will, in


fact, enact a plan during that period of time? 


MR. McDUFF:  I -- there's certainly no


indication that the legislature will, Your Honor.  And --

and that's why it is important for -- as -- as the Court


said in Growe v. Emison, for State courts to be able to


step into the breach, and deal with the problem without


the sort of obstacles that the Federal court has imposed


here, first on the constitutional grounds, and then


second, on the section 2 grounds because we contend the


plan has been precleared.


And let me respond to one other thing --


QUESTION:  So I -- I take it --


MR. McDUFF:  I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  -- the State court would have to make


the same constitutional determination, or the State court


isn't free from making constitutional determinations. 


MR. McDUFF:  That -- that's right.  The --


QUESTION:  In fact, just the opposite.  It


has to.


MR. McDUFF:  That's right.  But if this Court


resolves the issue on the -- in -- in reviewing the


Federal district court's injunction, then the State court


will not be in the position of having to do that.


And the -- the -- I want to go back to the


question of seeks to administer because I think it is


very clear that the Mississippi court -- the Mississippi


courts adopted a plan to be used in elections as long


as the section 5 obstacle is used -- is removed, and any

other Federal constitutional obstacles are removed.


And as -- as the opinion says -- Justice


O'Connor said in the opinion for the Court in Lopez versus


Monterey County -- the second Lopez decision -- seeks to


administer is simply -- it -- it's not necessarily a term


of discretion.  You can either seek to administer or not,


but is a -- it is a -- the seek is a temporal phrase


showing that the -- the plan should be submitted prior to


its administration.


And here, the Attorney General doesn't have any


discretionary authority, and I think it would be contrary


to section 5 if he were able to undo the chancery court's


order simply by the fact that he didn't appeal this case


when he knew we were appealing. 


The -- in fact, there's -- we've referred 

frequently to the North Carolina preclearance of the plan


adopted there by a State court regarding legislative


districts.  And if you look in the appendix to the NAACP


amicus brief, there is the letter of submission sent by


the trial judge in North Carolina to the Justice


Department where he submitted the plan.  The Attorney


General didn't submit it.  In fact, the Attorney General


had opposed imposition of the State court plan during the


State court proceedings. 


That plan was precleared, and it certainly seems

to me that if the Justice Department can preclear a plan


submitted by a State court judge, it cannot come here in


this case, and say that a State court judge -- a State


court plan from a Mississippi judge is -- has been


withdrawn, or has been suspended simply by the simple act


of -- simply by the simple fact that the Attorney General


did not take an appeal in this case.  That was taken by


us.


QUESTION:  But that was -- that was never an


issue in -- in the North Carolina case, was it? 


MR. McDUFF:  I'm sorry? 


QUESTION:  That was never an issue in the North


Carolina case.


MR. McDUFF:  Oh, no, there was not an issue, but


I'm just pointing out that -- I mean -- I mean --

QUESTION:  Maybe -- maybe Justice shouldn't have


taken the -- the request. 


MR. McDUFF:  The -- the -- oh, I think Justice


should -- Justice definitely should consider a submission


from a State court judge.  Section -- section 5 says --


QUESTION:  Sure.  But you were making the


argument a moment ago that if, in fact, they took the


request from the State court judge in North Carolina, they


can hardly object here. 


MR. McDUFF:  That's correct.

 QUESTION:  And that's a different kind of


argument.  And -- and since that was not an issue, I --


I don't know that they are precluded, or would be


precluded from changing their mind now. 


MR. McDUFF:  Oh, all I'm -- all I'm saying,


Justice Souter, is I don't think they can come in here and


say that the fact that the Attorney General did not appeal

QUESTION:  No, that's -- that's not what they're

withdrawn or suspended.

they did not object to is the fact that it was not the


Attorney General who had to submit the request here. 

That's all.  I mean, in -- in the North Carolina case,


they were not violating any provision of the statute which


required, before it could be precleared, that the State be


about to administer it.  The statute doesn't say that the


person, or the -- the entity of the State that is seeking


to administer it must be the one who applies for


clearance.  That's not what the statute says.  So, all


that was at issue in North Carolina is whether the -- the


administering person has to be the one to seek clearance. 


And at most, the case stands for no answer to

that question.  It certainly doesn't answer the question


of whether, when the State has no intention of


administering it, which is the situation here, and was not


the situation in North Carolina, the -- the Attorney


General, nonetheless, has to reply. 


MR. McDUFF:  Justice Scalia, I respectfully


disagree with the premise that the State in Mississippi


has no intention of administering this plan.  Once the


constitutional obstacle is removed, if it is, and once


preclearance is declared, if it is, the State defendants


are going to administer their plan -- that plan.  They are


under a State court order to do so.  And it seems to me to


say that the Mississippi situation is somehow different


from the North Carolina situation is to -- is to exalt the


form over the substance. 


Certainly in Mississippi the State court judge


could have submitted that plan.  The State court judge,


I guess, could have intervened in the case, in the Federal


case, and appealed if the Attorney General didn't.  But


that would be quite unusual, instead --


QUESTION:  Could he have administered the plan? 


That's --


MR. McDUFF:  I'm sorry? 


QUESTION:  That's the crucial question.  Yes, he


could do all that, but could he have administered the

plan?  If not, his intention to go forward is no


indication that the State is -- is seeking to administer


the plan. 


MR. McDUFF:  But -- but, Justice Scalia, the --


the failure of the Attorney General to take an appeal is


no indication that he will not administer the plan once


the Federal obstacles are removed.  I think we have to


assume that he will obey the State court order.


QUESTION:  But does it remove the Federal


obstacle if -- instead of passing on the hypothetical of


whether the Federal ground, which is a alternative ground,


et cetera is good or bad -- if we just repeated the


language from Wise versus Lipscomb, said it's premature to


decide this constitutional issue, our cases say not to,


but there's an alternative ground here?  That would make


it clear to everybody, wouldn't it, that the ground on


which the Federal injunction rests is the preclearance


ground?  And then, would the State say, okay, if it's the


preclearance ground, we're going to administer it.  And


then, the 60 days would begin to run, and then you're out


from under this strange stalemate. 


MR. McDUFF:  The -- the 60 days, in our view,


Justice Breyer, has already run.


QUESTION:  I know that, but if I don't agree


with you about that, then would it satisfy what you're

really after which is to get out of the stalemate?  You


see, we would just simply point out that this is an


alternative ground and -- and it has no real -- we're not


reaching it because it's -- there's this other ground. 


In other words, I'm repeating what I've said.


MR. McDUFF:  Then I -- I think -- I think --


QUESTION:  I'm trying to get you out of the


stalemate.  I'm trying --


MR. McDUFF:  I -- I think that gets us exactly


nowhere because the Department has said it is not going to


resume the preclearance process as long as the


constitutional injunction is in place.  So unless it's


vacated, the preclearance process --


QUESTION:  Are there two injunctions?  I thought


there was just one injunction and --


MR. McDUFF:  I'm sorry.  There's one injunction. 


Two grounds. 


QUESTION:  -- two grounds.  So if we suggest


that one of the grounds was premature, then doesn't that


do the trick? 


MR. McDUFF:  Well, I think it does -- it does


get the process ticking again.  But the problem is at that


point, once it is declared precleared, the Federal


district court will impose its constitutional injunction,


we'll be back up here.  The Mississippi Supreme Court will

QUESTION:  Is there any clue why, in all this


time, the legislature has not acted? 


MR. McDUFF:  No.  I think it was the difficulty


of pairing two incumbents, and they couldn't agree.  They


couldn't agree on how to do it because we lost a seat in 

Mississippi.


Let me make one --


QUESTION:  They -- they won't have that problem

MR. McDUFF:  No, they won't have that problem

there's been no indication thus far that any action is


going to be taken in that respect.

QUESTION:  Mr. Feldman. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE


MR. FELDMAN:  Justice Stevens, and may it please


the Court:


It's our position that the State court


redistricting plan was not precleared on either of the two


occasions that appellants --


QUESTION:  Mr. Feldman, let's assume that we


agree with everything you say in your brief, and we agree


it's not been precleared.  Isn't the -- will the


injunction that's now in place prevent further


preclearance? 


One of the reasons for not preclearing 

before was there's this injunction standing --


MR. FELDMAN:  It's --


QUESTION:  -- and that's still an obstacle,


isn't it?


MR. FELDMAN:  If it's clear that this injunction


is -- rests only on section 5 grounds, and not


constitutional grounds, that certainly would --


QUESTION:  The only way to make that clear would


be to vacate the --


MR. FELDMAN:  Well --

 QUESTION:  -- the other ground.  Is that right? 


MR. FELDMAN:  The -- what the injunction


actually says is something like the injunction will last


until, and unless there is a constitutional plan that's


precleared.  And insofar as it uses the word


constitutional, and we know the views of the district


court about that, I think that as long as that -- that


word, constitutional, is there, that -- that that remains


an obstacle to administering the plan.


QUESTION:  So unless that injunction is vacated,


we're at a stalemate.


MR. FELDMAN:  At least that part -- at least the


injunction has to be modified to remove the word


constitutional. 


QUESTION: 


Well, but that's -- that's dictum. 

I mean, what the district court said about that is -- is


dictum. 


itself.


QUESTION:  No, it's part of the injunction


QUESTION:  It isn't --


MR. FELDMAN:  It --


QUESTION:  It says until a constitutional plan


is -- is precleared, but what is a constitutional plan was


not before the court.  Now you may well know how the


district court is going -- going to rule on it, but you

don't know that the district court will be affirmed in


that ruling, or -- I don't -- I don't see how the -- the


constitutional ruling is embodied in the injunction.


MR. FELDMAN:  If the Court made clear, I think,


that -- that the -- that this injunction couldn't rest on


the ground that Article I, section 4 of the Constitution


was violated by the -- by the State court plan, then I


think it would be ripe for a preclearance. 


QUESTION:  Wouldn't -- wouldn't it also be


ripe -- wouldn't the time run simply if -- if the State


moved to vacate the injunction? 


MR. FELDMAN:  Yes.  If a State moved to vacate


the Federal court injunction?


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. FELDMAN:  In the --


QUESTION:  Because at that point wouldn't it


have signified that it was, indeed, attempting to


administer the plan? 


MR. FELDMAN:  There -- well, there's really two


grounds on which we think the injunction is -- is


relevant.  There's a narrower ground, which I think it --


primarily the -- the argument so far has been concerned


with, which is that the State was no longer seeking to


enforce the plan because it didn't appeal it.  And that --


QUESTION:  If it now seeks to vacate --

 MR. FELDMAN:  -- if the State took action,


they're still not appealing it, but I suppose, after this


Court's order, if they went back to the district court,


and said, in light of this Court's order, we're trying to


seek to enforce it again, and if they had the ability to


do that, then that -- then that would be eliminated.


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. FELDMAN:  There is a broader ground,


however, because the -- insofar as the injunction is a


injunction that's based -- rests on constitutional


grounds, it's the Department's position that -- that the


preclearance -- the section 5 uses the terms seek to --


seek to administer.  It says it may be enforced once the


Attorney General acts, and it talks about voting changes


that are in force and effect. 


And all of those things 

point to a contemplation by the statute of a change going


to the Attorney General when it's ready to be -- ready --


ready to go into effect, when there's no present legal


obstacle.  As long as there's a present legal obstacle


other than a section 5 injunction to its current


administration, then the Attorney General -- it's too


early -- it's too early to go to the Attorney General.


QUESTION:  Okay.  Then that goes back, I guess,


to the earlier suggestion.  If -- if this Court indicated


that, in fact, the alternative ground was prematurely

raised, wouldn't that respond to the -- to the second --


MR. FELDMAN:  I think -- as I said, I think it's


clear that if the -- if the Court made clear that this --


this injunction rests on section 5 and doesn't rest on the


proposition that it violates Article I, section 4 for


the -- for the plan to go into effect, then it would be


ripe for a preclearance at that point. 


QUESTION:  Of course, we have a doctrine that we


don't decide constitutional issues unless we have to.  Do


you think that doctrine should have applied to the


district court in this case because the section 5 ground,


as I read the opinion, was -- was self -- was sufficient


to sustain the objections? 


MR. FELDMAN:  I think -- I do think the section


5 ground was sufficient to sustain it.


QUESTION:  And therefore it was really wrong for


the district court to reach out and unnecessarily decide a


constitutional question. 


MR. FELDMAN:  I -- you certainly -- the -- the


only reason I would hesitate for that, before I'd quite go


that far, is district court was faced -- if you put


yourself in the situation that the court was, with very


tight deadlines -- and there are -- even -- although


courts should avoid deciding constitutional questions when


possible, there may be some extreme circumstances where --

 QUESTION:  But those deadlines -- you've


demonstrated in your brief that the -- the clearance


hadn't occurred.  I mean, if -- if we agree with your


position on the preclearance, the deadlines were not a


real obstacle.


MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I agree.  And actually I --


I do think the district court certainly could have said


and -- and perhaps should have said, this is a


constitutional issue.  Especially, it's a novel


constitutional issue that raises novel questions that


haven't been addressed before, and the section 5 ground


was sufficient to sustain the injunction.


QUESTION:  But the district court -- didn't --


isn't that what the district court said when it said this


is our alternative holding in the event that on appeal, it 

is determined that we erred in our February 19 ruling? 


It seems to me that that's a contingent ruling.  If we're


right about that it hasn't been precleared, then this


doesn't come into play. 


MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I guess only insofar as when


you read the actual order of the court, it says a --


this -- this shall go into -- the State may not enforce


the State court plan until the State -- there's a


constitutional plan that's precleared.  And if you read


that word --

 QUESTION:  But one -- one could agree with the


court, what it was intending to do and give effect to what


it was intending to do, and if we should hold, if we


should agree with the court, that there's no precleared


plan, then it would be appropriate to vacate the decision


to the extent that it rests on the constitutional ground. 


MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I think that may -- that may


well be right.  I -- I don't disagree with that. 


I'd like to go to, actually the first -- the


first alleged preclearance which is supposed to have


occurred 60 days after the plan was initially submitted to


the district court, and that preclearance did not occur --


was initially submitted to the Attorney General.  Excuse


me.  That preclearance did not occur because on


February 14th, before the 60-day period had expired, the 

Attorney General sent the State a letter saying, I need


more information before I can preclear this plan.  That


procedure, under which the Attorney General did that, was


specifically held valid by this Court in Georgia against


the United States, and the Court in Georgia specifically


held that that stopped the 60-day clock from running.


Later, in Morris against Gressette, the Court


held that the Attorney General's substantive


determinations under section 5 are not subject to -- are


not subject to judicial review at all.  And therefore, the

Attorney General's determination that more information is


needed, that the information before him was not sufficient


to permit preclearance -- to permit him to make the


determinations he had to make -- also is not subject to


judicial review. 


And therefore, because that whole process was --


was approved by the Court in Georgia against the United


States, because more information was sought, that that


terminated the 60-day clock then, and it did not -- the


plan was not precleared some days later when -- when the


60-day period would have expired. 


I think for the reasons I said earlier, it also


was not precleared at the later period both because the


State didn't -- on the narrower ground that the State did


not appeal the injunction, and on the broader ground that 

the injunction was there.  And the section 5 process is


designed so that something that's ready to go -- the


Attorney General should reach his decision on an act


that's ready to take effect. 


Finally, I'd like to just briefly go to the


statutory question of the interaction of sections 2c


and 2a(c).  With respect to that question, it's our


position that the district court, as a remedy here,


correctly ordered the districting of Mississippi's


congressional delegation, and did not order that they be

elected at-large.  And that was required by Federal law,


specifically by 2 U.S.C., section 2c, which provides that


there shall be established by law single-member districts


in each State, and that Representatives shall be elected


only from districts so established.  That command, it


seems to us, is unequivocal, and required the district


court, when it was faced with the problem of what to do


about Mississippi, to create single-member districts. 


It would -- did not have the power --


QUESTION:  But you could -- you could view it,


I guess, if you had to look at it at all -- and I'm not


sure we do -- you could say that 2a(c) applies before a


plan has been redistricted in the manner provided by State


law, and that 2c applies afterwards.  I mean, you could


harmonize them.


They've been in -- in existence, these two


provisions, for a very long time, and we normally don't


see repealed by implication, or hold that there is such a


thing --


MR. FELDMAN:  I --


QUESTION:  -- that you can harmonize them. 


MR. FELDMAN:  I think generally, but I do not


think in general these can be harmonized, or at least


within the scope of where it's possible for 2c to -- to


operate.  For -- one reason is that the language,

Representatives shall be elected only from districts so


established, is unequivocal, and, in fact, it shows that


the earlier portion of 2c that says, there shall be


established by law congressional districts in each State,


has to mean established either by a court, or by a


legislature, or by anyone who acts. 


QUESTION:  What if it meant just by a court? 


It would really put a lot of pressure on the legislatures


to -- to do what they're supposed to, and to enact these


districts by law.  It would take a lot of -- a lot of


these cases that -- that place the burden upon the


district judge to reapportion a whole State would go away. 


He'd say, if the legislature doesn't ask, all of you guys


are going to run at large.  Boy, that would -- you know --


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  That would not happen.  The


legislature would, indeed, do the job it's supposed to. 


QUESTION:  Isn't that --


QUESTION:  It -- it would make a lot of sense to


interpret it that way. 


QUESTION:  Isn't that Mississippi's own default


rule?  Doesn't Mississippi have that same statute?


MR. FELDMAN:  They do have the same statute,


which we would view as pre-empted by section 2c.  But that


was the -- the scheme that was in effect in -- from 1941

to 1967.


The reason why 2c was enacted, and the way to


give 2c some effect is that Congress at that time was


faced with a situation where there were at least six


courts that had threatened to order at-large election of


entire congressional delegations in the aftermath of Baker


against Carr.  And Congress responded to that.  The


concern specifically was that courts would order


at-large elections, and the response was the enactment of


section 2c. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Feldman.


Mr. Wallace.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. WALLACE


ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES/CROSS-APPELLANTS SMITH, ET AL.


MR. WALLACE: 


Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court:


It seems that the Court is focusing on the


question of preclearance here, and the real problem with


the question of preclearance is that the Justice


Department has stopped the preclearance process because of


the injunction. 


Now, we believe that the Justice Department


acted properly in so doing.  They have a regulation that


says, we will not consider premature submissions, and this


Court said in Georgia that any reasonable regulation will

be enforced. 


Their position is that whenever the State has


been told it cannot administer a change, then it cannot be


seeking to administer a change within the meaning of


section 5, and therefore, this was premature.  So they


stopped. 


Now, the question is what can be done about


that, and I think, in all probability, the only thing that


can be done about that is for the Attorney General of


Mississippi to go down the street to the district court


and ask them to preclear the change under section 5


because there does not seem to be any other mechanism


whereby anybody can force the Justice Department to get


moving on a section 5 preclearance. 


QUESTION: 


But, Mr. Wallace, don't you agree 

that with the injunction outstanding, the Justice


Department would have the same reason for refusing to


preclear that it's already given?


MR. WALLACE:  I think not, Your Honor, and I


think that's because of the very strange system of divided


jurisdiction that Congress consciously created back in


1965 when it said, we will let the District of Columbia


deal with statutory questions.  We will let the court back


home deal with constitutional questions.  That's been in


the act from day one, and it's given this Court trouble

from day one. 


QUESTION:  How long does it take if you take


the -- if you said derail the preclearance procedure


before the Attorney General, switch to the D.C. District


Court track?  How long do those proceedings -- section 5


proceedings -- in the district court ordinarily take?


MR. WALLACE:  I've never been in one, Your


Honor.  I don't know that I could tell you, but I would


think it would take close to a year anyway.  Now --


QUESTION:  Well, then why can't we just do what


we'd -- I'd suggested anyway -- I think others did too --


that -- that you -- you -- we'd simply say, look, here's


an injunction.  It rests on two grounds.  Ground one, this


plan hasn't been precleared, the Mississippi plan, the


court plan.  Ground two, it's unconstitutional.  You'd say


ground two is, A, premature, doesn't really support the


issue, it's an injunction -- because it's premature, et


cetera.  And now you'd have a decision that, I guess, from


a legal point of view insofar as we were right about that,


would just rest on the ground that it hasn't been


precleared. 


And since that's the only reason for issuing the


injunction, then the Department, if the State of


Mississippi wants to put the plan in effect, would


preclear it.  If the State doesn't want to put it in

effect, well, that's their business.  But -- but if they


are going to put it in effect, then the Department would


have to get busy.


MR. WALLACE:  As a practical matter, Justice


Breyer, that might get the process moving, because I think


I've understood the United States to indicate that they


would get moving if that's what the Court did.  But under


the usual rules of this Court's jurisdiction, it sits to


review judgments and not opinions.  And the judgment is


that -- that the -- that the district court plan shall


stay into effect -- shall stay in effect until


preclearance of a constitutional plan takes effect. 


That's true --


QUESTION:  Yes, but in affirming that, we


certainly can say why we're affirming it.  And -- and if


we say, yes, the injunction is valid for one reason, and


one reason only, we do not reach the other -- the other


reason, and there is no basis for reaching the other


reason.  Certainly we can say that.


MR. WALLACE:  And if -- and if the Court does


say that, and if the Justice Department does get moving as


a result of that opinion, then that will move the process


along.


QUESTION:  So we're in an unusual -- I mean,


this is unusual because I guess we would be reviewing a

reason for the judgment.  It's unusual because there's a


legislature that doesn't want to reapportion.  And the


third aspect in which it's unusual is that the Supreme


Court of Mississippi, according to some of the parties,


has overturned previous cases of that court which said the


chancery court lacks the power to enter the plan, and it


did it without writing an opinion.  It's normal that a


court writes an opinion. 


Now, is there any likelihood or chance that the


Mississippi Supreme Court, before this issue comes back to


us, if it does, would explain what the reason is for


departing from what seems to be a long precedent?


MR. WALLACE:  I suspect the Mississippi Supreme


Court can take a hint as well as the Justice Department,


Justice Breyer. 


There was no error in this injunction, 

and ordinarily, the Court would not edit opinions on valid


judgments.  But if the Court does that, then certainly the


Justice Department may move.  I think the Supreme Court of


Mississippi may move. 


We moved for a stay at the Supreme Court of


Mississippi.  That stay was denied.  The briefing is


finished.  There has been no stay order.  I presume they


will set the case for oral argument in due course.  But if


they get an opinion from this Court that says, we'd


certainly like to know what you have to say, I think I can

say with confidence that they will set the case with --


for -- for argument in due course. 


So as -- as Justice Breyer says, it is a strange


case.  We think it is a case in which the judgment is


absolutely correct, and the -- and what the Justice


Department has done is absolutely correct under its


regulations. 


QUESTION:  But would you say it's absolutely


correct if the constitutional reasoning were wrong, and if


they say we won't approve a -- a Mississippi plan that is


in violation of our constitutional holding?


MR. WALLACE:  The -- as -- as Justice Ginsburg


has observed, I think that is an alternative ground in the


opinion.  I do not think that it affects -- infects the


judgment, but it makes a problem, as Mr. McDuff has noted, 

because even if there is section 5 preclearance down the


road, this district court would enjoin it again. 


QUESTION:  Is it your view that the section 5


ground of decision is sufficient to -- to uphold the --


the injunction below?


MR. WALLACE:  We believe that it is sufficient


to uphold the judgment below because there is no error in


the judgment, and there is no error --


QUESTION:  But if -- if that's true, did not the


district court violate our rule against deciding

constitutional issues unnecessarily?


MR. WALLACE:  I think they did not, although


it's a close call.  In Ashwander --


QUESTION:  Why is it a close call if -- if the


judgment is clearly correct on the section 5 ground?


MR. WALLACE:  The -- the district court --


QUESTION:  It seems to me it's only a close call


if you think there's doubt about the section 5 ground.


MR. WALLACE:  And that's why the district court


set the alternative judgments.  I think they thought they


were making it easier for this Court.  Ashwander doesn't


say never decide a constitutional question. 


QUESTION:  It doesn't -- says you don't do it if


it's not necessary, and it clearly was not necessary if


they're right on the section 5 ground, which everybody 

seems to agree they were. 


MR. WALLACE:  We certainly agree that they were,


and if they're -- and if --


QUESTION:  The other side doesn't agree they


were.  Would -- would you bet your life that they're --


that they're right about that? 


(Laughter.) 


MR. WALLACE:  I would be -- let me turn to that,


if I may, Justice Scalia, because we believe that they


are -- that the Justice Department and the district court

were correct on the section 5 ground.  And that goes back


to the February 14th letter for more information.  As the


Assistant Solicitor General has said, that's a standard


application of Georgia versus United States.  When you


have -- when you need more information to decide a


section 5 issue, then the Justice Department is entitled


to stop the clock and ask for more information, and the


clock won't move again until they get more information. 


This is a -- a straightforward application of a regulation


that this Court has already approved. 


The district court so found, believed that the


request for more information was absolutely valid, and


therefore said, there has been no approval, there is no


plan in place, and for that reason, we must put in a plan


of our own. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, there is something


unusual about that request for information.  It seems to


have been triggered by the district court.  I'm looking at


page 100a of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement


where the district court is commenting on this opinion,


this opaque opinion, of the Mississippi Supreme Court that


says the chancery court has authority, and then says --


this is the end of the first paragraph on the page -- that


at the very least, the Attorney General of the United


States will consider the implications very carefully and

might perhaps request more information.  I'm not aware of


the -- of district courts telling the Attorney General how


the preclearance process should run.  Is this standard


operating procedure? 


MR. WALLACE:  By no means is it standard,


Justice Ginsburg.  But what the district court was doing


in this case was deciding whether or not there would be


enough time for the preclearance to be completed before


the qualifying date.  The intervenors were suggesting we


did not need a Federal trial, we should wait for the


Justice Department to finish its work. 


The Justice Department already had before it a


complicated submission from the -- from the Attorney


General of Mississippi, which begins on page 228 -- 221a


of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement, and that 

presented not only the -- not only the congressional


redistricting plan itself, but also the decision of the


Supreme Court of Mississippi to overrule 70 years of


precedent and allow trial courts to do redistricting.  So


those two issues were already before the Justice


Department when the district court wrote.


But all the district court wrote -- said is, we


think we better get busy and try this case because this


looks like a real hard submission to us, and we're not


sure that they're going to be able to decide this case

before our qualifying date.  So it's unusual, but it's


certainly well within the -- the scope of what the


district court was being asked to do.  And I think they


properly pointed out problems. 


And -- and with the help of the district


court -- the help, indeed, of the submission that Attorney


General Moore had already made, I think the Justice


Department properly saw that there were questions that


needed to be asked.  They asked those questions, and that


stopped the 60 days from running. 


QUESTION:  We also have to reach your issue,


don't we?  Even if we agree with you on that, we still


have to reach the cross-appeal issue, don't we?


MR. WALLACE:  I -- I think you do.


QUESTION:  Or do we? 


MR. WALLACE:  I think you do because in --


because once it is conceded that the -- the district court


had to impose a remedy in 2002, then the question arises


of what that remedy should be.  And it was our position in


the district court, and it is our position here that the


district court should have enforced the law of the State


of Mississippi, as Justice Stevens has observed, says that


you must have at-large elections, and an act of Congress


dating back to 1941 that says you must have at-large


elections in these circumstances.  That's section 2a(c)(5)

of Title II.  We ask for that to be enforced, and that's


an issue that I think must be reached in this case


regardless. 


I think the United States has the only argument


for not enforcing the 1941 act.  They claim that it is


absolutely incontrovertibly inconsistent on its face.  For


the reasons that Justice O'Connor has stated, we think it


is not inconsistent on its face. 


We also point back --


QUESTION:  No court has ever done it before --


MR. WALLACE:  No court --


QUESTION:  -- in all of the years that courts


have been operating under this act.


MR. WALLACE:  This Court did it under almost


identical statutes 70 years ago in Smiley and Carroll and 

Koenig.


QUESTION:  2c didn't exist then.


MR. WALLACE:  There was a 1911 act that said


basically the same thing.  The 1911 act says you shall


elect Representatives by districts, but at the same time


it says, but if districts have not be redistricted, then


any new Representatives will be elected at large.  And


that's --


QUESTION:  To get your -- to get your result,


you have to read, there shall be established by State law

a number of districts, et cetera.  And -- and, in fact,


it's pretty hard to read it that way, for me it seems,


because this thing, there shall be established by law a


number of districts, i.e., not at-large, was enacted by


Congress in response to courts that had threatened --


courts, not legislatures -- that had threatened at-large


elections.  And so they were quite unhappy about that in


Congress, and they passed this law saying there shall be


established by law a number districts.  It seems to me


their object was certainly court districting, wasn't it,


as well as legislative districting?


MR. WALLACE:  As difficult as it is to read the


mind of Congress, Justice Breyer, I think that while they


were clearly unhappy, they were unable to agree in any


detail on what ought to be done. 


And even on section 2c, 

there was -- there were people who stood up in both houses


of Congress and suggested that this law would not be


enforced in States -- in court proceedings, that it was


being -- that it was addressing itself to legislatures.


QUESTION:  It was repeating the 1911 law that


you just mentioned? 


MR. WALLACE:  There it --


QUESTION:  Why -- why did they -- why did


they pass it if it didn't do anything but -- but say what


the -- what the 1911 law already said?

 MR. WALLACE:  I think it's -- I think it is

reports --


QUESTION:  Well, you've got to give me some


plausible reason.  I mean --


QUESTION:  Legislative history helps, by the


way. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  I gather the legislative history


you've just told us is, as usual, on both sides of this


thing.  Is that right?


(Laughter.) 


MR. WALLACE:  We believe it is, Your Honor. 


As -- as was noted in the Hanson decision in the D.C.


Circuit, I think there was gamesmanship on both sides in 

both houses.  Gamesmanship is a word that comes from the


Hanson case. 


QUESTION:  But, Mr. Wallace, one thing isn't, I


think, debatable and that is since 2c is on the books, no


court has ever resorted to whatever -- was 2a, whatever. 


Since 2c is there, that's the one that the courts have


used, is that not so?


MR. WALLACE:  It is -- I don't know that they


have enforced 2c.  I think most of them have believed that


they were acting under this Court's oversight which tells

courts always to read -- always to do single-member


districts when they can.  But it's certainly true,


Justice Ginsburg, no court since 1967 has ordered at-large


elections in -- in redistricting cases. 


But we believe what -- if you look at the rules


of construction, and at what Congress actually did,


without trying to speculate on what they were trying to


do, they enacted language that had been before this Court


in 1911 and was -- and was construed in 1932 to allow


at-large elections.


QUESTION:  I assume --


QUESTION:  Except --


QUESTION:  Go on. 


QUESTION:  No. 


Except for one fact, and that is now we have a 

districting statute which -- which is the later one in


time.  The -- the districting command and the at-large


command are no longer of -- of even weight.  The


districting command is later in time and therefore, to the


extent that there's any conflict, that's got to get some


precedence.


MR. WALLACE:  That would -- and that is a


difference in 1911 because those two parts of the act were


enacted at the same time. 


QUESTION:  Yes, yes.

 MR. WALLACE:  But if they could be construed


consistently in 1911, then I think they can be construed


consistently in 2002.  And if they can be construed


consistently, it doesn't matter which one was enacted


first.


QUESTION:  Except that there would be no


possible reason for reenacting it if they're -- if they're


going to be construed consistently, just as they were when


they were both enacted simultaneously. 


MR. WALLACE:  The -- the difficulty of figuring


out what Congress thought it was doing on this single


piece of legislation tacked onto a private immigration


bill is very difficult, Justice Scalia.  I recognize it. 


But as we noted in our brief, which did discuss the


legislative history, they had thought about this for 

2 years and specifically considered repealing the 1941


act, and they didn't do it.  They came back and did


something else.  And we think under standard rules of --


of construction, that means the 1941 act --


QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, do you agree with the --


with Mr. Feldman that in any event the Mississippi statute


is out of the picture because that's pre-empted no matter


which way we go on this issue?


MR. WALLACE:  I think it would be hard to argue


that Congress impliedly repealed a 1941 act and didn't

intend to pre-empt a State law that said the same thing. 


I've tried to come up with that argument, Justice Stevens,


but I don't think I can make it. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. WALLACE:  So --


QUESTION:  What do you -- what do you answer to


the -- the fear that one has to have that redistricting by


having all the elections at large is precisely what those


who were interested in diluting minority vote would like?


MR. WALLACE:  Well, first of all, Your Honor,


the -- the answer that I have is that an act of Congress


is not subject to the Voting Rights Act, and would be


enforced on its face. 


But the other answer I have is this.  We have a


long history over the last 20 and 30 years in Mississippi 

of coming up with remedies which will protect the rights


of minority voters.  The most common remedy since Gingles


is to do single-member districts, but it's not the only


remedy.  And there are remedies where you can elect people


at large and because of the way the election is held, all


people running together, not requiring majority votes, not


having -- not having anti-single-shot requirements, those


have worked in Mississippi.  Minorities have been elected


in white jurisdictions in multi-member races by using


those sorts of procedures.

 Congress didn't tell us what sort of procedure


to use in an at-large election, and in Young v. Fordice,


this Court made clear that whatever procedures you use


would have to be precleared.  I don't think the


legislature will act for all of the reasons we've seen,


but the district court would certainly use those remedies.


They've used them before.  Minorities will be protected.


QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, can I go back to the


constitutional issue that the district court decided in


this case?  Your -- your adversaries say that you do not


defend the reasoning employed by the district court, even


though you defend their judgment.  Do you think that's a


fair comment on your position?


MR. WALLACE:  I think I defend the reasoning of


the district court as far as it went.  I draw a


distinction between this case and Growe that they -- they


simply said that in Growe, the Supreme Court did not


consider this issue, which is true, and therefore we look


at the chancery court.  It's not the legislature.  It


can't act. 


There is a distinction -- another distinction


between Growe and this case, which -- which the district


court did not dwell on and we dwell on in our briefs.  In


Growe, there was a Federal claim before the district


court -- before the State court.  And under the Supremacy

Clause, ordinarily a State court must litigate Federal


claims, and this Court recognized their authority to do


so in Growe. 


Here, for whatever reason, the plaintiffs in


the -- in the chancery court who are intervenors in this


Court did not assert a Federal claim.  They made it quite


plain, we are proceeding only under State law.  We do not


want to proceed under Federal law, and that under


U.S. v. Term Limits simply doesn't exist.  There is no


Federal -- there is no State law claim for congressional


redistricting.  So that's the difference between Growe and


this case, and this is -- that's the grounds on which we


defend it. 


QUESTION:  You mean there is no State law


requiring redistricting at all?


MR. WALLACE:  There is -- there is no State


law -- first of all, there is no State law requiring


redistricting.  There are statutes that talk about how the


legislature proceeds, but there is no substantive law that


says redistricting shall take place. 


QUESTION:  So as a matter of State law, the


Mississippi legislature is under no duty to -- to


redistrict?


MR. WALLACE:  It is under no duty to redistrict,


and could be under no duty to redistrict because the

redistricting requirement comes only from the United


States Constitution.  The authority to redistrict comes


from the Elections Clause, and the State of Mississippi


cannot impose on their legislators any requirement having


to do with congressional redistricting.  A decision was


made by the Framers over 200 years ago that legislators


are the people to regulate congressional elections, and if


they fail to do it in their job of representing the


people, then Congress will do it in its job of


representing the people. 


QUESTION:  Why can't a State just say we require


our legislature under State law to conform to the Federal


requirements by having a plan by January 15th by going to


the chancery court if you don't have a plan, et cetera?


MR. WALLACE: 


Because at that point, Your Honor, 

it -- it -- the -- perhaps the legislature could do that.


QUESTION:  And if the State of Mississippi says,


well, that in effect is what they did, don't we have to


take their word for it? 


MR. WALLACE:  No, I don't think you do, Your


Honor.  First of all, perhaps they could delegate


authority.  If the legislature said this problem is too


hard for us, we want to delegate it to State courts, then


that -- that issue would be tested like any other


delegation.

 QUESTION:  In a State court, and here we have an


unexplained judgment without an opinion of the Mississippi


Supreme Court which seems to say that's what it is.  It


doesn't say, but that's the holding of it. 


MR. WALLACE:  But it -- but when you are dealing


with Federal constitutional guarantees and provisions, you


do not always take the State courts as -- as gospel even


on State law.  The district court here said there is no


delegation, and as Your Honor knows, there was no


explanation of why the writ of prohibition was denied. 


It really doesn't set much of a precedent for anything,


but the district court, which is familiar with Mississippi


law, says there is no delegation in this case.  We have


looked at Mississippi law, and nothing has been delegated.


So the question of whether a legislature could 

delegate power to the courts is not here.  What we have


before us is a case where the legislature has not


delegated power to the courts.  It has simply done nothing


and when it does nothing, the States in that circumstance


are powerless to act if we go back to the acts of


Congress, and we think we enforce the at-large statute


from 1941 as the district court should have done. 


If there are no questions, I thank the Court.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Wallace.


Mr. McDuff, you have 5 minutes left.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT B. McDUFF


ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS/CROSS-APPELLEES BRANCH, ET AL.


MR. McDUFF:  Thank you, Your Honor. 


Justice Breyer, the State of Mississippi does


want to put the plan into effect.  That was the order of


the Mississippi Supreme Court, however brief it was,


saying the chancery court's plan will remain in effect


until -- unless superseded by a timely plan of the State


legislature.  The Attorney General submitted the plan for


preclearance under order by the chancery court.  He has


done -- he has not withdrawn the preclearance submission.


QUESTION:  The statutory language is not -- is


not whether it's in effect or not.  It's whether he's


seeking to administer it.  That's the problem. 


MR. McDUFF: 


And -- and there's nothing about 

the absence of the appeal here, particularly where we are


taking the appeal, that suggests he's not seeking to


administer it, Justice Scalia. 


And let me mention one other thing along those


lines.  The language is enact or seek to administer.  Now,


the lesson of Growe v. Emison, at least we think, is that


a State court stands in the shoes of the legislature when


the legislature defaults on redistricting, and certainly


if the legislature had enacted this plan, and the -- it


had been enjoined by the Federal court for whatever

reasons, and the Attorney General had not taken an appeal,


but legislative leaders had or intervenors had, I don't


think we would say that the preclearance submission was


thereby withdrawn.  It seems to me the State court is in


no different position, and we shouldn't say that the


Attorney General's failure to appeal here would withdraw


the submission where it wouldn't in the legislative


context. 


The -- and -- and the plan has been precleared


in our view, if not the -- by the first 60 days, certainly


by the time of the second 60 days, where the Justice


Department said, we're not going to continue to review


this plan because of the constitutional injunction.


Well, there's no language in section 5 that


stops the 60-day period from running on that ground. 

That -- it is a statute that admits of no exceptions. 


There is no regulation that allow -- by which the Justice


Department says, we will not continue to -- to consider


a -- a plan that has been enjoined on constitutional


grounds.  And in fact, the Solicitor General has not even


said in his brief that that is the regular practice of the


Department. 


Here there are compelling reasons why it is


important for the 60-day period to be removed even if


there's a constitutional injunction.  Often these cases

are decided under severe time constraints.  If a


constitutional injunction is imposed, State officials may


try to remove it as quickly as possible and restore the


plan in time for the election.  If the section 5 obstacle


is delayed in the meantime, the -- it -- it, in effect,


prolongs itself by feeding off the constitutional


injunction, and even if the constitutional injunction is


vacated, the State still has to deal with this


now-postponed section 5 obstacle that will not be removed


in some situations in time for the election.


Let me say one other thing about the


constitutional ruling, the fact that it was an alternative


ground.  We think there is doubt about the section 5


ground, as we've suggested here, and particularly given


the importance of resolving these cases so that elections 

can go forward without continued Federal court


interference, I think it is crucial for this Court to rule


on the constitutional ground, as well as the preclearance


ground here.


The rule of Connor, and the rule of the Warren


County case are not jurisdictional rules.  They're


supervisory rules imposed by this Court to ensure the


orderly processing of the section 5 issue when it's --


when it's in a case in which other issues are involved.


Here the orderly processing of this litigation,


54

and the creation of the situation where Mississippi can


conduct its elections in 2004 without continued confusion


of the type that we had at the last election, that


interest favors resolving the constitutional issue now, at


the same time the section 5 issue is resolved. 


And so for all of these reasons and the reasons


set forth in our brief, we respectfully urge that the


Court vacate the injunction of the district court on all


grounds. 


JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. McDuff.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:08 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
