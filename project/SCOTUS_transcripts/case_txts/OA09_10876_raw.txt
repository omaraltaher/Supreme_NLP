 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 09-10876, 

Bullcoming v. New Mexico.

 Mr. Fisher.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FISHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The text, purpose, and history of the 

Confrontation Clause make it clear that the prosecution 

cannot introduce one person's testimonial statements 

through the in-court testimony of someone else.  Thus, 

having held in Melendez-Diaz that a lab analyst's 

statements in a forensic lab report are testimonial, 

this is an easy case.

 The State violated the Confrontation Clause 

by introducing lab analyst Curtis Caylor's statements in 

a forensic lab report without putting him on the stand. 

The New Mexico Supreme Court resisted this analysis, 

straightforward as it is, on the ground that 

Mr. Bullcoming, as the defendant, had the opportunity to 

cross-examine a substitute or a surrogate witness, 

Mr. Razatos.

But a surrogate witness procedure violates 

all four components of the right to confrontation.  It 

quite obviously violates the defendant's right to have 

the witness testify in his presence, in the presence of 

the jury so the jury can observe it, and under oath, as 

happened in this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Fisher, when you say 

"in the presence," do you -- do you mean it necessarily 

must be in the courtroom, or would a video-conferencing 

set-up be permissible so that the technician or the 

analyst could testify from the lab, rather -- but it 

would be screened in -- in the courthouse?

 MR. FISHER:  Well, the default rule under 

the Confrontation Clause is in presence, in the 

courtroom.  Now, in Maryland v. Craig, this Court held 

in a child witness setting -- of course, very different 

than this case -- that closed-circuit TV would be 

permissible, and I believe, you know, in a future case, 

if the State perhaps made some sort of showing that the 

lab analyst couldn't come to court for some reason, and 

certainly if the defendant stipulated, and maybe even if 

the defendant didn't stipulate, a court could 

accommodate -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The defendant didn't give 

his consent, so we don't -- that's not a concern, but

let's -- let's suppose defendant doesn't stipulate.  Is 

this adequate to meet the Confrontation Clause?

 MR. FISHER:  I don't think it would be 

adequate, Justice Ginsburg, with at least some -- absent 

at least some showing of unavailability of the witness 

or -- making the witness unable to come to court.

 Now -- now, there is an amicus brief in the 

case, I believe, that suggests some flexibility that 

trial judges might employ in -- in accommodating lab 

analysts' schedules.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about police 

witnesses?  What about not requiring the officer who -­

who took the confession or who witnessed the alleged 

crime -- not requiring him to appear because he's busy?

 MR. FISHER:  Well, that's never been -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can't make it.  He's out on 

the beat.  So can we have him appear by television?

 MR. FISHER:  That's never been the rule, 

Justice Scalia, and I don't think there would be a need 

to -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why is a lab 

technician different?

 MR. FISHER:  I don't think -- I don't think 

one is, and you don't have to reach that in this case, 

because the State never attempted to make any showing

that Mr. Caylor was unavailable for any reason.  This -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Fisher, what if 

you had two people doing this procedure?  They're 

sitting in, you know, chairs right next to the other. 

The one, you know, takes the blood samples from the 

vials, puts them in another vial, and puts the aluminum 

stuff on and crimps it.  The other one then takes the 

vials and puts them in the machine and runs it.  Do you 

have to have both of them testify?

 MR. FISHER:  Only if the State wants to 

present statements from them both.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, they want to -­

MR. FISHER:  They both -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They want to present 

the results of the blood analysis -­

MR. FISHER:  I think -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- the numbers the 

machine spits out.

 MR. FISHER:  I think in that scenario, if 

both people were there for the whole thing, the State 

could have either one of them testify.  What the State 

couldn't do -­

didn't do it?  Even though the question is going to be, 

did you put the aluminum on and crimp it, and the answer 

is going to be, no, Joe did it; he sits right next to 

me?

 MR. FISHER:  That's right.  The 

Confrontation Clause is a purely procedural right, Mr. 

Chief Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  That's 

right.  Does -- do they both have to testify, then, or 

not?

 MR. FISHER:  They do not have to.  The 

Confrontation Clause is a purely procedural right.  It 

all depends on what -- whose statements the State wants 

to introduce.  So, if the State is satisfied to prove 

its case by having somebody testify, saying, I watched 

the thing go into the machine and I watched this result 

come out and I saw that it wasn't tampered with and it 

was Mr. Bullcoming's sample, then that would be fine. 

And in fact, what some labs do -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I don't understand 

that.  How is that any different than the supervisor of 

the lab saying, I know what these people do, I -- I 

watch them on a day-to-day basis, and they perform their 

work correctly?

 MR. FISHER:  Again, the question, Justice

Kennedy, is not who the State has to bring in.  The 

question is whose statements the State wants to 

introduce.  Here, the State wanted to introduce 

Mr. Caylor's statements, and so it therefore needs to -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What the State wanted to 

introduce is the result of the exam, and the Chief 

Justice gives you the hypothetical.  Say, two people are 

necessary for the exam.  You say only one has to be 

there if both saw it?

 MR. FISHER:  If only -- if the State is only 

introducing one person -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it -- but it's hearsay 

as to what the first person did with -- with crimping -­

MR. FISHER:  I don't -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- crimping the thing. 

It's not direct testimony from that person.  You didn't 

say, are you experienced in crimping?  Did you use your 

right hand or your left hand?  Is there a danger of 

spillage?  And so on.  All that is beyond the ability of 

the defense to ask.

 MR. FISHER:  No, I -- Justice Kennedy, I 

don't think it's hearsay.  It's simply being an 

eyewitness and saying:  Here's what I watched.  I 

watched this person put it into the machine, and this is 

the result that I saw come out.

Now, again, the only question is whose 

statements the State wants to introduce.  By all means, 

Mr. Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy, if the State 

wanted to introduce statements from both of the lab 

analysts who worked together on the case, they would 

need to bring them both in, but if they only want to 

introduce one lab -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The State takes its 

chances, right?  I mean, as to how much it has to bring 

in, in order to persuade the jury?

 MR. FISHER:  That's right.  That's the 

decision the State makes in every case, whether it be 

multiple police investigators, multiple eyewitnesses, 

or -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You always take your 

chances with a business record.  That's a given, of 

course.  Of course, the State takes a chance with the -­

with the admission of any admissible hearsay testimony 

that the jury will be -- that you'll make the argument 

to the jury that you should discount it if the person 

isn't there.  That's always true.

 MR. FISHER:  I'm not sure I -- I disagree 

with anything you said, but the rule of the 

Confrontation Clause applies to a particular kind of 

statements, testimonial statements.  And our rule today

and the one that resolves this case is, if the State 

wants to introduce a witness's testimonial statements, 

it needs to bring that witness to court.

 Now, footnote 1 in Melendez-Diaz -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now, I take it it's a 

testimonial statement that this blood that was taken at 

the hospital was the blood of the defendant.  That's a 

testimonial statement?

 MR. FISHER:  Yes, I believe it would be, 

Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And so I assume that in 

this case, the nurse and the police officer were both 

present.

 MR. FISHER:  Yes, and, in fact -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I assume under your 

position, you could not have a record showing that 

the -- the nurse withdrew the sample at 10:08 p.m. on 

such-and-such a date and that she followed the regular 

procedure.  That would be insufficient if the State 

wanted to introduce just a certificate or just -- just 

that record?

 MR. FISHER:  I think that's what footnote 1 

in Melendez-Diaz says.  If the defendant wants to 

challenge the chain of custody, then the State needs to 

bring in the witnesses.  Now, I think it's an

interesting fact in this case, and it shows why that 

rule isn't so -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's not -- I don't 

think that's what Melendez-Diaz' footnote 1 says.  It 

says that the State may be able to prove chain of 

custody by testimony other than the actual individuals 

who handled the sample, and then it has to take its 

chances as to whether the trier of fact is going to 

believe -- is going to believe that.  Isn't that right?

 MR. FISHER:  I think that's right.  I think 

what footnote 1 says is the defendant -- when the State 

chooses whose testimony it wants to introduce, the 

defendant has the right to insist that that be done 

live.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It does -- it does not -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does not Melendez-Diaz also 

say that if the defendant wants to challenge the -- the 

chain of custody, the State can adopt rules that 

requires the defendant to assert that challenge or his 

intention to make that challenge, or his intention to 

make that challenge, prior to the trial so that the 

State will know whether it has to introduce any live 

testimony?

 MR. FISHER:  Of course, that's correct under 

the notice and demand regimes that Melendez-Diaz

approved of.  And the Public -- the PDS brief in this 

case showed that many States do use those regimes.  Now, 

Justice Kennedy, I did want to -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the chain -- the chain 

of custody does involve a testimonial statement that 

this is the blood, that I took it out at 10:05 p.m. on 

Saturday evening.  That's a testimonial statement.  It's 

the defendant's blood.

 MR. FISHER:  Yes, it can, Justice Kennedy, 

but chain of custody is proved by live witnesses every 

day in -- every day in courtrooms across the country -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  But it's not just -­

MR. FISHER:  -- long before Melendez-Diaz or 

Crawford.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It's not just chain of 

custody.  I think the Chief Justice is trying to get at 

this problem, or I am:  Lab technician Jones looks at a 

vial, and it's blue.  She says to Smith, "it's blue." 

Smith turns a lever on a machine to B.

 Jason sees the B and goes into court -- you 

make him go into court; that's our case.  And what I 

wonder is, is the defendant now entitled to the 

following instruction:  Jury, because he's in court, he 

can say that the machine read B, but that proves nothing 

about the vial, nothing.  All it proves is what someone

said in the laboratory to another person, and those two 

people aren't in court.

 Now, that's -- you see, that's the problem, 

I think, of the intermediate step.  I'd either like to 

be told I'm wrong about that, you don't have to have 

them, or explain whatever you'd like.

 MR. FISHER:  If I understand your 

hypothetical correctly, I think that if the defendant 

wanted -- the defendant can certainly make that argument 

to a jury, and the defendant, if he wanted to insist -­

if the prosecution wanted to tie the results -- let's 

bring it back to the facts of this case -- wanted to tie 

the .21 to Mr. Bullcoming by saying that was 

Mr. Bullcoming's sample, then they'd need to bring 

somebody into court if the defendant insisted upon it.

 But the one thing I want to add is that the 

Public Defender Service brief makes clear, and the facts 

of this case make clear, it's going to be very rare that 

a defendant wants to do that.  The defendant in this 

case wanted to stipulate to the nurse's blood draw and 

that it was his blood that was drawn in the hospital. 

It was the State that insisted on putting her on the 

stand.  It happens in courtrooms all across the country.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but if you want to 

tell us, don't worry, it won't happen, I think that's an

unacceptable argument.  You're saying the defense has 

certain rights, and we have to presume there is a 

defense attorney who's going to afford his client every 

right the Constitution has.  So the fact that we're not 

supposed to worry because it won't happen very often is 

(a) it seems to me, an unlikely hypothetical; and (b) it 

seems to me, irrelevant to your argument.

 MR. FISHER:  Well, Justice Kennedy, I will 

gladly accept (b) if we want to say that consequences 

are irrelevant, because I think that's what -- the Sixth 

Amendment is what it is, but I think the only thing I 

would add is that all I can say is, empirically, in the 

States that have followed the rule we advocate today, 

long before Crawford or Melendez-Diaz, it simply is a 

manageable burden.  I'm not saying it's no burden.  But 

it is a thoroughly manageable -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Fisher, I thought -- I 

thought the Court put this worry behind us in Crawford. 

Wasn't the same worry raised in Crawford?

 MR. FISHER:  Well, I think it was raised 

even more pointedly in Melendez-Diaz when it comes to 

lab analysts.  I think in both places the Court, yes, 

set that aside.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Said, yes, it may be 

something of a risk, but the States have managed it in

procedures, et cetera.  I'm assuming that you're 

claiming that those -- those are the Confrontation 

Clause violations, that exhibit itself, because it is 

attesting or certifying to something.

this data shows that the blood level concentration was

the Confrontation Clause, using the raw data itself?

But if that expert then read that data and testified 

that this was of a certain amount or percentage of

proved or stipulated to, I think an expert could take

when they said printout plus an analyst who didn't do 

this particular run but knows how the process works?

 MR. FISHER:  No, Justice Ginsburg.  I'm 

certainly not here today to agree with the New Mexico 

Supreme Court.  What they said doesn't -- doesn't make 

any sense in this case because (a) the printout was 

never introduced into evidence or looked at, and (b) it 

would matter a great deal -- and this is how I continue 

my answer.  It mattered a great deal what was on the 

printout.  If the printout is nothing more than a graph, 

then I don't think you can say that's a testimonial 

statement.  If a printout comes out of a machine that 

also says at the top blood sample was Donald 

Bullcoming's, here's the test that was run, et cetera, 

those may well be testimonial statements that the 

analyst triggered the machine to spit out.

 So the Fourth Circuit has wrestled with this 

issue in the Washington case, and you can -- you can

look at the majority and the dissenting opinions in that 

case.  I think that the question would arise in that 

scenario, if the graphs were -- if the machine printouts 

were introduced into evidence, the question would be, 

are the machine printouts testimonial?  And to the 

extent they are, you'd have the same problem in this 

case.  To the extent they are not -- as the Fourth 

Circuit suggested, at least to some degree they may not 

be -- then you don't have a -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What part -­

MR. FISHER:  -- Confrontation Clause 

problem.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What part do you see as 

testimonial or not?  What can an outside expert look at?

 MR. FISHER:  I think an expert can look at 

anything.  The only question is what's introduced into 

evidence.  There's no -- there's no Confrontation 

Clause -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I -- that -­

MR. FISHER:  -- barring an expert from 

reviewing whatever he wants.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's two different 

issues:  one, what can be introduced into evidence, 

which is the reports themselves; and what can he or she 

testify to is a different question.  That's a form of

evidence.  And so that's the line I'm trying to get you 

to describe for me, which is, when does that testimony 

become a violation of the Confrontation Clause?

 MR. FISHER:  In one of two scenarios, 

Justice Sotomayor, the first which is the scenario we 

have in this case, when the report is introduced and 

it's testimonial.  The second -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's assume the 

hypothetical I proffered.

 MR. FISHER:  The second is that it's not 

introduced.  Then you have a Confrontation Clause 

violation if the expert -- and this is the words many 

lower courts have used -- is a mere conduit for 

introducing the out-of-court testimonial statement. 

So -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Could we break this down in 

-- in this way?  I see three things that the -- three 

statements that the -- the State was attempting to -- to 

prove.  The first was that the sample that was tested 

was the sample that was taken from the defendant. 

Second was that the standard procedures were followed in 

this case, and the third was that the result was .21. 

Would you agree with that?  Those are the three things?

 MR. FISHER:  I think there's one other 

thing, Justice Alito, which is that the sample had not

been tampered with -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.

 MR. FISHER:  -- or contaminated.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  That the sample had not been 

tampered with.  Now, as to the first three, in other 

words, everything other than the results, could the 

State prove those things without having -- simply by 

introducing testimony regarding the way things were 

generally done in the lab, and ask the jury to infer 

that the general procedures were followed in this 

particular case?

 MR. FISHER:  I think that would be a 

question of State law, Justice Alito.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  It wouldn't be a 

Confrontation -­

MR. FISHER:  It wouldn't be a Confrontation 

Clause question.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Now, in this 

case, as I read the record, it seems to me that's what 

the prosecutor was attempting to do.  This is on page 50 

of the Joint Appendix.  The analyst is beginning to 

testify, the second answer on page 50:  So what we do is 

we will get the sample in the mail, et cetera.

 The analyst is beginning to testify about 

standard lab procedures, and then defense attorney says,

"Your Honor, I'm going to object to what's done in the 

status quo."  I take that to mean what is generally 

done.  "I don't object to what was done in this case."

 So the defense attorney is preventing -- is 

objecting to the prosecution's attempting to discharge 

its responsibility with respect to those first three 

propositions through testimony about standard 

procedures, and is insisting that the analyst provide 

the testimony that you say was a violation of the 

Confrontation Clause; namely, testifying as to what was 

done in this particular case.

 MR. FISHER:  Justice Alito, I think if you 

look earlier in the Joint Appendix, I believe it's at 

page 40, where the State for the first time says we're 

going to put Mr. Razatos on the stand instead of Mr. 

Caylor, there's a -- there's an objection there as well 

that says you can't then put the document into evidence 

that Mr. Caylor wrote if he's not going to be on the 

stand.  That's the critical objection here.

 Now, you're right, there's nothing wrong 

with Mr. Razatos having taken the stand in this case, 

there's nothing wrong with him having described typical 

procedures in the lab.  I think the objection you're 

pointing was to the one that said -- again, as far as 

the State law objection, saying he can't testify to

something he doesn't have personal knowledge about, 

which is whether the procedures were followed in this 

case.  But Mr. -- Mr. Razatos could certainly take the 

stand and testify to -- to general procedures.  But at 

page 54 and 55 of the Joint Appendix, he -- he simply 

reads the report's results.

 And so you have two Confrontation Clause 

violations, really.  You have the report being 

introduced in the first instance, and then you have -- I 

believe it's at 54 and 55 of the Joint Appendix.  You 

have the prosecutor asking Mr. Razatos, what was the 

result?  He says the result was .21.  As the State 

itself says at page 58, note 15 of its brief, there was 

no independent analysis being applied there.  All Mr. 

Razatos was doing was repeating and giving the jury the 

conclusions that Mr. Caylor had reached.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But if the -- if the machine 

had expelled a piece of paper that said .21, that piece 

of paper would not be a -- introduction of that piece of 

paper, the contents of the piece of paper, would not be 

a violation of the Confrontation Clause?

 MR. FISHER:  If it said nothing more than 

the .21 coming out of the machine, I think probably not. 

Now, judge Michael in the First Circuit would disagree; 

and so that's an issue that's not in this case, and I

think you could debate whether that should -- even that 

should be considered hearsay of the operator.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, how can -- how can you 

debate it?  The purpose of the Confrontation Clause is 

to allow cross-examination.  How are you going to 

cross-examine the machine?

 MR. FISHER:  Well -- well, the question that 

would arise there would be whether the .21 should be 

treated as Mr. Caylor's statement.  Let me -- if I give 

you two hypotheticals, maybe it explains.  On the one 

hand, I don't think anyone would claim that a time stamp 

on a fax machine, for example, is a human statement. 

It's a machine statement, and so therefore it can't be 

testimonial.  On the other hand, if someone types out an 

affidavit on a word processor and hits print, you can't 

say, well, that's the machine talking, not the human.

 So the question arises in the lab context 

whether a .21 or anything else that comes out of the 

machine has enough human influence that it ought to be 

treated as the -- as the person's statement.

 Now, you don't have to resolve that in this 

case, and what's important to emphasize is that that 

hypothetical of the .21, even though the State would 

like it to be this case, is really miles away for the 

reason you said, because the State proved a lot more

than .21 by Mr. Caylor's lab report, and that's why 

these hypotheticals I think are important.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But all of those other 

things could potentially be proven by indirect evidence, 

by establishing standard procedures and asking the jury 

to infer that the standard procedures were followed in 

this case.  They might -- they might believe that; they 

might not -­

MR. FISHER:  The State could -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  They might make the 

inference; they might not.

 MR. FISHER:  The State could make that 

choice, but it would be a considerably weaker case, 

Justice Alito, not just because they wouldn't have 

anyone saying that the procedures were actually followed 

in this case, but also in this case it would be a far 

weaker case because they'd have somebody on the stand 

who would now be subject to cross-examination as to why 

he had been recently put on unpaid leave.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But as to this case, didn't 

the defendant actually testify that he was drunk at the 

time of -- at the time when the blood was extracted?  He 

took the stand and he testified that after the accident 

he went off into the woods and he came upon people who 

were drinking vodka and he drank, they drank -- what was

it -- a gallon of vodka together, and then he went back 

to the scene and his blood was tested?

 MR. FISHER:  That was -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't that correct?

 MR. FISHER:  That was his defense, Justice 

Alito, and here's why the lab report is still important, 

though.  Because you're right, he did admit he was 

drunk.  But remember, he was not convicted simply of 

DUI; he was convicted in New Mexico law of aggravated 

DUI.  And to have aggravated DUI you need to have up to 

a .16 blood alcohol count.  So the report is the only 

the State could have proved over .16, even if Mr. 

Bullcoming admitted that he had been drinking that day.

 So that's why it's important in this case. 

That's why he wanted to challenge -- that's one reason 

why he wanted to challenge the report.

 Let me come back to the -- to the important 

point, I think, though, that what the State wants to be 

able to do -- I don't want to ascribe a bad motive, but 

what the State's rule would allow States to do is to 

insulate people from cross-examination, not just Mr. 

Caylor in this case, but -- but -- but please pay 

attention to, for example, the Dungo case that's cited 

in our opening brief, from California.  That's a case 

where a coroner had been fired from his job, blacklisted

by law enforcement, and prohibited from testifying in 

many counties because he falsified his reports, his 

autopsy reports, by writing them with the police report 

sitting right next to him.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But the State can't -­

MR. FISHER:  And -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  The State can't immunize 

those people from testifying.  You could have subpoenaed 

Caylor, couldn't you?  You could have asked for a 

continuance and -- and a subpoena, and brought him in to 

testify?  It's just a question of who has to take the 

step, right?

 MR. FISHER:  Well, we -- we could have, but 

Melendez-Diaz makes clear that doesn't satisfy the 

Confrontation Clause.  And when you deal especially with 

a garden variety DUI case there is only so much time and 

resources at issue, and that's why the Confrontation 

Clause I think is especially important in a case like 

this, that the prosecution bring its witnesses into 

court.

 And if I could just finish the Dungo story, 

in the -- in the California Court of Appeal, when they 

reviewed that case, they said the prosecutor's intent in 

that case had been to shield Mr. -- I'm sorry, the -­

the actual analyst in that case from cross-examination.

And, in fact, the supervisor when he took the stand at 

the preliminary hearing told -- told the court the 

reason why they have me here is the prosecutors find it 

too hard to have this person in court.  So that would be 

perfectly permissible, if -- if the State win this case 

today and surrogate testimony were allowed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do you answer the 

practical situation that Caylor, who did this particular 

run, does some dozens day in and day out, and he will 

have no memory, in fact, of this particular test.  So 

having him there -- he knows how the process operates; 

he doesn't remember this particular one -- how does 

having him there -- what could be elicited on 

cross-examination of him that couldn't be from his 

supervisor?

 MR. FISHER:  Let me give you two answers, 

Justice Ginsburg, but first let me say we don't know 

whether somebody doesn't remember it until he's put on 

the stand.  What the NACDL brief says is that even 

though analysts don't ordinary remember run-of-the-mill 

tests like this, that do remember if something went 

wrong or if something went haywire.  So we don't know 

that.

 But assuming you're right that -­

these tests are unusual in this particular jurisdiction?

 MR. FISHER:  That's my understanding, 

Justice Scalia.  So that's another reason why he may 

have remembered.

 But even if he didn't, there's two things 

that could be importantly probed here.  One is his 

credibility.  And I've explained why that was a very 

serious issue in this case, because he was put on unpaid 

leave.

 The other is his competence.  Again, 

Melendez-Diaz says it's important to have the person on 

the stand to explain how he does his job, for the jury 

to observe his professionalism, for him to explain 

here's my understanding of these procedures, et cetera. 

That could be very important, and if I could leave you 

with one thing before I -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I assume that even if 

he doesn't remember, his testimony is not worthless to 

the prosecution.  He -- the prosecution can bring out 

his high qualifications, and he can testify:  It -- this 

is always the way I do it.  I do it this way all the 

time.  I don't remember this particular incident.

 All of that can be persuasive to the jury, 

can't it?

 MR. FISHER:  Of course, it can, Justice

Scalia.  And on the flip side, even if he doesn't 

remember, cross-examination is very important.

 If I could leave you with one thing that I 

think isn't highlighted in the brief maybe the way it 

should have been.  There's a line of cases from this 

Court, California v. Green, Delaware v. Fensterer, and 

United States v. Owens, that all hold that if a witness 

takes the stand and doesn't remember anything, that the 

Confrontation Clause is still -- is still satisfied, as 

long as that witness is on the stand for the reason 

Justice Scalia explained and because the jury can 

observe them, et cetera.

 And so, the flip side of that has to be -­

it's the holding of Owens most recently is that those 

are meaningful things that the Confrontation Clause 

requires.  And so the flip side of those cases has to be 

that if the witness takes the stand and doesn't 

remember, the ineffectiveness potentially of a 

cross-examination there doesn't matter, either.

 If I could reserve what little time I have 

left.

Mr. Fisher.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. KING:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 As the Court said in Michigan v. Bryant, a 

police interrogation resembles an ex parte examination 

when the primary purpose of the examination is to 

create, quote, an out-of-court substitute for trial 

testimony, end quote.

 A public record not prepared by a police 

officer is not the product of structured interrogation. 

It is neither ex parte nor is it an examination.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand that. 

You mean so long as all -- all hearsay by non-police 

officers can be admitted without, without confrontation, 

just because they're not police officers?

 MR. KING:  No, Your Honor, I don't believe 

that that's the -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I didn't think that was 

your point, because it's certainly not true, is it?

 MR. KING:  It is not my point, Your Honor.

 Your Honor, the point that I am making is 

that in this case, the document, the report that we're 

talking about is a public record, and that 

differentiates it from the affidavit in Melendez-Diaz, 

and so the case that -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, could you 

tell me what that means?  Why is it different than the 

affidavit?  It's certified, and my understanding of the 

dictionary meaning of certification is that that's an 

attestation as to the truth of the statements contained 

therein.  That's the common definition.

 So I'm assuming it's the equivalent of an 

affidavit.  So how is it different than the 

Melendez-Diaz lab report?

 MR. KING:  Your Honor, and I understand, and 

I'll answer your question with regard to your 

expectation that the certification is the same as the 

affidavit.  It's not our position that they're exactly 

the same, but there are several -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Tell me why not.

 MR. KING:  There are other distinguishing -­

distinguishing features that are significant between the 

affidavit in Melendez-Diaz and the report in this case. 

For one, the affidavit in Melendez-Diaz was prepared 

pursuant to an statute in Massachusetts that called for 

the preparation of an affidavit from the lab at some 

point in time after the actual test was done, and it was 

to be used specifically as an in-court statement to 

replace the live in-court testimony of the affiant.

 In our case, the report being a public

record was a record that is kept contemporaneously by 

the analyst in the lab, it is, in this case, the .21 is 

a single data point that is taken from the raw data in 

the machine and recorded on a standard document that's 

provided by the -­

for fun, not for use in trial?

 MR. KING:  No, Your Honor.  I believe 

that -- that that statement is planned to be used in 

trial, and -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So what difference does it 

make whether the statute requires it to be taken to be 

used at trial or whether the police send it over to be 

used at trial as a use of the State?  What difference 

does that make?

 MR. KING:  Your Honor, I think the key is to 

look at the purpose of the analyst who was preparing the 

report, who is a public employee, who is just carrying 

out, as our court said, copying the information from the 

machine onto the report.  And so, that's significantly 

different than the amount of analysis that was done 

by -- by the -- the witness in -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  He's not 

simply looking at a number and putting it on a report.

He's certifying to certain things.  He's certifying to 

following certain steps, that the evidence wasn't 

tampered with.  He's certifying that he's complied with 

all the requirements of New Mexico law with respect to 

the report, so he's just not copying a number.

 MR. KING:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

In -- in this case the certification doesn't necessarily 

make the report testimonial.  There -- there are several 

other examples of -- of cases where -- where evidence is 

introduced at court that -- that have certifications.

 For instance, it may be necessary for a 

public records custodian to provide a copy of a birth 

certificate in -- in a trial, and in that case, the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't the difference 

between those two documents is that one was prepared 

primarily for the purposes -- this lab report, for 

prosecution purposes, and the birth certificate is not 

prepared for that?  It's prepared to mark the birth of a 

person, then it's used for many other purposes besides 

trial; is that correct?

 MR. KING:  That is correct with regard to 

the birth -- birth certificate, Your Honor.

the prosecution of an individual?  Would they have 

tested this blood if -- if it wasn't to prosecute him?

 MR. KING:  Your Honor, in -- in this case, 

no.  This -- this case is all about a sample that was 

sent to the lab to be tested for this.  But I think you 

made it clear in Michigan v. Bryant that -- that there 

might be a variety of purposes that should be analyzed 

in order to decide whether or not the statement is 

testimonial or not.

 In this case, the purpose of the -- of the 

lab analyst is significantly different from the purpose 

of the police officer who requested the analysis.  The 

lab analyst does this for a living, and it's -- it's 

their public duty.  The lab in this case is -- is 

operated by the State Department of Health, scientific 

lab division, and -- and they do a variety of different 

kinds of analysis.

 And so, the -- the analyst who does the test 

wouldn't necessarily have the same purpose in -- in 

creating their statement for that document.  As a matter 

of fact, the analyst would most likely be driven by the 

desire as a scientist -­

MR. KING:  Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Who else do they test 

for?

 MR. KING:  This lab also tests for, in this 

particular case, the gas chromatograph analyses of blood 

alcohol, they test for the office of the medical 

examiner and -- and under New Mexico law, interestingly 

enough, the -- the defendant can also ask for a test. 

They would use the same form to ask for this test.

 So, the analysis might be being done for a 

defendant as well as for the State.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Are these lab analysts civil 

service employees?  Are the lab analysts civil service 

employees?

 MR. KING:  Yes, Your Honor, they are.  They 

work for the New Mexico Department of Health.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Is there any way in which 

your office or prosecutors or the police could cause 

them not to get promotions if they weren't producing the 

kind of lab reports that the police and the prosecution 

might like?

 MR. KING:  No, Your Honor, they could not. 

As a matter of fact, there -- there is a separation 

between the operation of the Department of Health lab 

and the police that even extends to the point of a

physical separation.  Police officers are not allowed

JUSTICE SCALIA:  This analyst was fired, as 

I recall.  Was he fired, placed on administrative leave 

or something?

 MR. KING:  No, Your Honor, the record 

indicates that -- that Mr. Caylor was not available for 

court because he was on leave without pay, which -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  On leave without pay?

 MR. KING:  Uh-huh.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And do we know why it was 

leave without pay?

 MR. KING:  We don't know why, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does the defense know why 

it was leave without pay?  Could the defense have found 

out in cross-examination that the reason he was leave 

without pay because he was -- had shown himself to be 

incompetent, and they were in the process of firing him? 

I don't know whether that's true, but wouldn't that be 

important to the defense?

 MR. KING:  Your Honor, I -- I think that the 

defense would like to know the answer to that question.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And didn't -- and didn't 

the prosecution intentionally set it up this way so that 

this person would not have to testify, so that he could

not be cross-examined?  Isn't that why they sent the 

substitute to testify?

 MR. KING:  No, Your Honor.  In this case, 

that's -- that's not the case.  I -- the -- this case 

came about in a little bit of an unusual circumstance, 

because both sides had been negotiating a plea agreement 

and when the -- when the plea agreement was not 

successful, the defendant asked for the trial to be 

expedited and moved quickly to trial.  So the defendant 

didn't do as much discovery, I think, as you would 

normally do in a case like that, but -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know what the facts 

are, but boy, it smells bad to me.  It really does.  And 

even if that was not the case, the mere possibility that 

it could have been the case shows why you should have to 

bring this person in if you want to introduce his 

testimony.

 MR. KING:  Your Honor, I think that the key 

here is that if you would not look at the -- at any of 

the qualities of the declarant in deciding whether the 

statement is testimonial or not.  And so once -- once 

the Court makes the determination as to whether it is 

testimonial or not, you wouldn't -- even if you would 

like to ask those questions, you wouldn't have the 

opportunity to ask those questions.

In this case, factually, it might also be 

that Mr. Caylor was on unpaid leave because he had run 

out of his regular leave time, and he decided to do 

that.  We -- it would all be speculation -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I agree that whether it's 

testimonial does not depend upon whether there's 

skullduggery or not, but the possibility of 

skullduggery, even in machine -- machine situations such 

as this, is a good reason for saying this is 

testimonial.

 MR. KING:  Your Honor, I think that's why 

it's -- it's important that this is a public records 

case, because that is one of the assumptions that courts 

have made for hundreds of years with regard to the fact 

that there is -- there is a duty by the person who's 

taking down the information to -- to observe in a 

regular manner, to record in a regular manner, and so 

that's important here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That was the principal 

thrust of your brief, that this isn't testimonial at 

all.  You have not said because it was unsworn, because 

you recognize the certification is the same, but you're 

trying to equate it to a business record, public record?

 MR. KING:  Yes, Your Honor.

that this record was created for a specific purpose.  It 

was created to provide evidence for use in a criminal 

prosecution.

 MR. KING:  Your Honor, I don't believe that 

that is the only purpose that this form 705 could be 

used for.  It is the common purpose for this form, but 

it is a form that the lab uses in every circumstance. 

And indeed, as I said, in New Mexico law, the defendant 

can ask for a second test.  They can have that done. 

It's done at the State's expense.  They can have it done 

at any laboratory that they want to.

 But if they have the report done at the 

State lab, and they're entitled to have that done, they 

would utilize the same form.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, does the -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does the analyst 

know whether he's being asked to do one for the 

prosecution or the defendant?

 MR. KING:  Not necessarily, Your Honor. 

I 

-- I actually don't know the answer to that specifically 

except that the form -- and if you look at it, it's in 

the Joint Appendix -- does have some information in part 

A that -- that indicates that there is a police officer 

that -- that sent the test to the lab.  There's a nurse

that did that in this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, so they would 

know the difference, right?

 MR. KING:  They -- I think that the same 

information would be on the form whether the defendant 

submitted it or whether the -- or whether the 

prosecution submitted it, and -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, not the same 

information.  One would say the police submitted it and 

the other one would say the defendant submitted it, 

right?

 MR. KING:  Your Honor -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So if the police submitted 

it, the -- the person doing the -- the test would know 

that the police submitted it, I assume.

 MR. KING:  If you look at the form, Your 

Honor, it would have the same information, but we're 

not -- we're not here today arguing that the analyst 

wouldn't know that the police submitted this form.  But 

it is an arm's length request, and once again, the Court 

addressed that in your most recent case, in Michigan v. 

Bryant, I believe because the -- the question is whether 

or not there was an interrogation.  One of the key 

questions is whether there was an interrogation.

 This clearly does not look like a case where

there was an interrogation by the police.  It was a 

request on a standard form that was -- that was sent. 

And so the purpose test, it appears from Michigan v. 

Bryant, would not even apply in cases where there's not 

a police interrogation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why is a key question 

whether this was an interrogation?  Does the 

Confrontation Clause apply only to confrontations?  To 

interrogations?  I mean, if a -- if a witness, before 

the police ask any questions, blurts out, you know, 

"Jones did it," can that statement get in because it has 

not been in response to an interrogation?

 MR. KING:  Your Honor, the analysis would be 

somewhat different.  That's the point, is that -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It would be different 

because interrogation doesn't make any difference.  That 

is not the condition for the application of the -- of 

the Confrontation Clause.

 MR. KING:  Your Honor, we -- it appears that 

it does make some difference with regard to Michigan v. 

Bryant, and it's new to all of us.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  If it were an 

interrogation, the factors mentioned in Michigan v. 

Bryant would be relevant, presumably, but since this 

wasn't an interrogation, I don't see how that has any -­

any relevance whatever.

 MR. KING:  Well, the relevance, Your Honor, 

I think, is since it's not an interrogation, then -­

then you have to look at, and I think the Court has set 

this out, you have to look at the nature of the evidence 

and to make a determination as to whether the evidence 

that's being presented is merely a substitute for live, 

in-court testimony.

 And there, back to the difference between 

the affidavit in Melendez-Diaz and the report in this 

case is, in our report, even if Mr. Caylor had been at 

the trial and on the stand, it would have been necessary 

to have the report as well.  I think Justice Ginsburg 

raised this point, is that six months after the 

examination was done, to cross-examine the analyst and 

ask him, do you remember what the result was six months 

ago from this one test out of a hundred that he ran, he 

will not remember without looking at the report.  The 

report is the best evidence in this case to prove the 

point that is being made here, and -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, he'd look at the 

report and say, gee, I don't remember; you know, I do a 

lot of these reports.  But then the prosecution in 

direct would say, well, how do you do them?  And he 

would say, I always do this, I always do that, I always

do the other thing.  Did you do it in this case?  Well, 

I don't specifically remember this case, but I always do 

it.  And that's the testimony that would go to the jury. 

It would be pretty persuasive.  Not as good as if he did 

remember.

 MR. KING:  That's correct, Your Honor, and 

so that's why the analysis of whether this is 

testimonial or not is such an important analysis, 

because if the -- the reasoning that the Court has had 

for all of the hearsay exceptions, for excited 

utterances or, in this case, for a public record, would 

look at whether or not that evidence was the best 

evidence to support the truth-finding purpose of the 

trial.  That's our -- that's our analysis, at least, 

Your Honor.

 And what we are arguing in this case is that 

there is no difference between Mr. Caylor transferring 

the .21 data from the machine to the piece of paper than 

there would be if you took a photograph, for instance, 

of the machine data and -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why did you give the 

data to the analyst at trial?  If there wasn't a more 

persuasive power in the lab certification, why didn't 

you just have the new expert look at the printout from 

the graph and say, this is what it says?

MR. KING:  Procedurally, in this case, Your 

Honor, this -- the trial at the District Court level 

occurred before the Court's opinion in Melendez-Diaz. 

And so I think that at this point in time, that it would 

be more normal behavior for the -- for the State to 

present the raw data as well.

 In this case, Mr. Razatos -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's that as well. 

Don't you introduce the lab report because it -- it 

gives more credence to the reliability of the result? 

Because he's certifying that he followed certain 

procedures, that he did certain things, that the sample 

wasn't tampered with?

 MR. KING:  Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is it -- you're looking 

for that testimony, correct?  You're looking, at trial, 

to that testimony to bolster the test?

 MR. KING:  Not using testimony in the sense 

that we're talking about testimony here.  I mean, you 

might want that -- very well want that evidence in, not 

different from other cases where if you had a -- it was 

necessary to submit the judgment of a felony, for 

instance, to show that a person in a later trial was a 

felon with -- a felon in possession of a firearm, you 

would have a certification from the court clerk that

would say, I certify that the copy of this document that 

I'm submitting to the court is a true copy of -- that's 

also not testimonial from -- for the purposes of the 

Confrontation Clause I don't believe.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You might want that in 

order to show the machine says X, Y, Z, but that's only 

as good as the stuff that was put into it.  So you're 

going to have to show that this was his blood put into 

it.  And many, many people might have handled it, and 

there might be a routine so that they all check a box 

when it's sealed and they get it.

 Is it your understanding if you lose these 

cases -- this case that you then have to take into court 

all those people?

 MR. KING:  That's certainly a concern, Your 

Honor.  I -- if you look at this document, there are six 

or seven people who have certifications on the -- on the 

dire -- different statements on the document.  There are 

three certifications; there's one from the -- from the 

woman who takes the samples into the lab that says she 

received the samples; there's this one from Mr. Caylor; 

there's one from -- from the reviewing analyst who 

reviews it; and I gather that the -- that the Petitioner 

is only challenging the -- that one certification 

from -- from -- from Mr. Caylor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The chain of custody wasn't

 MR. KING:  It was not.  And this document -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it often contested?  My 

impression is it's not very often contested.

 MR. KING:  I'm not aware of it being 

contested often, Your Honor, I -- and this form I think 

is one of the things in New Mexico that really helps 

with that.  The reason that the court submitted the form 

is that you have everything relating to the chain of 

evidence on -- on one document, and -- and so indeed a 

lot of those statements really help -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but the reason I asked 

the question is because I don't think it is normally 

contested.  It's normally a business record of some 

kind.

 However, what I was looking for is a 

distinction, because in the future I don't see why it 

wouldn't be contested, unless there's a distinction.

 MR. KING:  Yes, Your Honor, and I think that 

the distinction is that in this case the -- the analyst 

is not essentially a party to the action.  The analyst 

works arm's-length transaction from -- from the -- from 

the police and from the prosecutors, and so he's not 

part of the prosecution team, is -- is how I've been

thinking about it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  General, I know your State 

takes a different view of it or you wouldn't be here, 

but aren't there are a number of States that -- that do 

provide the testimony of the technician, who do require 

the technician to come in and -- and testify?

 MR. KING:  Your Honor, I believe that there 

are other States that have statutes that -- that have 

different ways of presenting evidence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And have they had, to your 

knowledge, serious problems about defendants contesting 

chain of custody simply because this other thing is 

required?  Again, I'm -- I'm not aware that that's been 

a problem.  I think it's a boogeyman.

 MR. KING:  Your Honor, we -- we understand 

that -- that the -- that the burden on the State is -­

is not an issue that comes directly into the analysis 

relating to the Confrontation Clause.  I -- in New 

Mexico, for instance, one of the problems that we have 

is that -- is that the lab's centrally located in 

Albuquerque and the -- and in this case the trial was in 

San Juan County, so -- so the witness has to drive for 

about 3 hours to get to where the courthouse is.  So 

that's sort of different in New Mexico than, say, in 

Massachusetts or something like that.  And -- and even

for 10 minutes worth of testimony, they might have to 

drive 6 hours and take a whole day out of the lab.

 So it -- it is a problem that -- that is 

there, but I don't think that it is the seminal issue 

that -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Are there States -- are 

there States that do require a -- a -- a prosecutor to 

produce everyone who has handled something in a chain of 

custody at a -- at a laboratory, a criminal -- you know, 

normal business?  Are there States that do require that? 

If so, could you tell me a couple, because I -­

MR. KING:  Your Honor, I'm not aware of any 

State that requires that everyone in the chain of 

custody appear in -- in trial.  It is indeed normally up 

to the prosecutor with regard to chain of custody to 

determine who --who is going to be appearing.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What about medical reports 

that are aimed at a particular known victim of a crime 

and thus will end up in trial?  For example, a graph, a 

graph which the nurse keeps, which is a statement by the 

nurse that the patient's temperature on such and such a 

day was 98.6 or whatever, and normally that graph would 

be introduced; but are there any States that wouldn't 

require -- would say, oh, no, you have to produce the 

nurse?  You have to produce the doctor for all medical

records?  Which of course, are known by the keeper that 

they will be used at the criminal trial.

 Are there any States that require that?

 MR. KING:  There are none that I'm aware of, 

Your Honor.  I -- I don't -- I haven't -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Are there any States that 

require ordinary business records perhaps of the most 

ordinary kind, which always are statements that somebody 

did something on a particular day?  When those business 

records happen to be kept before with the knowledge that 

they'll probably be introduced at the trial, are there 

States that require the man or woman who made the 

business record to come into court?

 MR. KING:  No, Your Honor, and I think 

that's the point of all of those.  State law has their 

-- their hearsay law that -- that analyzed whether those 

statements are admissible.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I -- I don't think 

that's an accurate response, at least if you include the 

qualification that Justice Breyer put in the question, 

which is that the records were kept with the knowledge 

that they would be introduced in -- in criminal trials.

 I mean, you can say that all the records of 

labs -- let's assume there's a -- there's a police lab 

which -- which only does police testing of blood.  Those

would be business records of the lab, but they certainly 

would not be introducible just because they're business 

records.  If the record is made for the use in 

prosecution, surely it's -- it doesn't come under the 

business records exception, or else we wouldn't be here 

today.

 MR. KING:  Your Honor, I think the 

hypothetical that -- that you say really shows where the 

line is.  If -- if the lab is a police lab and only 

doing the analysis for the police, then they -- they 

look a lot more like a party to the -- to the lawsuit, 

and certainly the hearsay exceptions have made it clear 

that even though observations are -- are generally -­

that are public records are generally allowed, that 

observations by police officers are not.

 And -- and so -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's an independent lab and 

police always send it to this independent lab, but in 

fact it's an independent business, it makes a profit; 

but all the stuff it does it knows is going to be used 

at trial.  That wouldn't be admissible, would it?  Even 

though it's a perfectly normal business record.

 MR. KING:  Your Honor, I think that that 

depends on -- on how you look at the purpose and whose 

purpose it is that -- that you're analyzing.  Now first

off that, would assume that the purpose test applies in 

this case, and it seems to me since Michigan v. Bryant 

that the purpose test may not apply to these kinds of 

cases where -- where there's not a police interrogation.

 But if -- if that is the case and the 

purpose test applies, then it -- it also appears to me 

that the -- that the test now requires that -- that you 

look not just at the purpose of the policeman who -­

who's asking the question, but that you look at the 

purpose of the declarant, and in this case the purpose 

of the labs clearly is -- is a purpose just to -- to get 

the sample, do a good analysis, and -- and report that 

analysis to, in New Mexico's case, both parties.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel -­

MR. KING:  The analysis that comes from our 

State lab goes not only to the prosecution but also to 

the defendant.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  General -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General, we seem to be 

describing -- this case seemed rather particular, that 

is, there was no objection by New Mexico to having an 

analyst show up, Razatos; so -- so he had to travel 

however long he said.  It's just a question of one 

employee's time rather than the other.

 But -- and then you described how simple

this thing was, you just put it in a machine, you would 

get out a piece of paper.  Why didn't New Mexico have 

this -- there was an additional sample that could have 

been -- it would have been si simple to just retest it. 

Having the witness come to the court, why don't you arm 

him with the additional test, and then there would be no 

controversy?

 MR. KING:  Your Honor, one of the problems 

in New Mexico would be since -- since the court believed 

that -- that that report was -- was admissible, if they 

did a second sample and --- and tried to submit that it 

would be cumulative evidence, and probably would be kept 

out by -- by the rule in New Mexico in that case.

 So Mr. Razatos did have an important purpose 

at this trial.  In New Mexico you still I believe have 

to have a witness who -- who can authenticate the 

document to bring the document in.  It might not have 

had to have been Mr. Razatos in this case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, let's say that this 

Court holds that the Confrontation Clause requires the 

presence of the actual analyst to testify about the 

sample.  Is there anything in the law that says that 

that testimony is suddenly excused, and you do not need 

the analyst if there's another sample available for the 

defendant to test?  That's not the rule, is it?

MR. KING:  It's not the rule, Your Honor, 

although one of the things that we pointed out is that 

-- is that the State always keeps two samples, that the 

defendant has the right statutorily in New Mexico to -­

to have a sample retested at a lab -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I'm saying that 

analytically that does not bear on the question whether 

or not the sample that's introduced by the State 

requires the -- the analyst to be present.  They're just 

unrelated.

 MR. KING:  Correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That may -- that may show 

that the confrontation rule is a silly rule.  But it 

doesn't -- but it -- there's -- assuming confrontation 

is required, it's not excused -­

MR. KING:  Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- by the presence of 

another sample.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I -- I don't follow that 

because we have a substitute now.  Caylor is out of the 

picture; we know that it is the defendant's blood 

because everything else is the same, and there's this 

vial that has a certain amount of blood and there's a 

certain amount left over, so it's not cumulative, 

because Caylor's out of the picture.  It is the

defendant's blood that has been lab tested by another 

analyst.

 MR. KING:  I'm sorry, Your Honor, in -- in 

your hypothetical, if -- if the State knew far enough 

ahead of time that they -- they would not be able to 

submit the -- the -- that analyst's results, they could 

always -- because the blood sample continues to exist, 

they could always retest that and -- and have another 

witness who could do that.  Depending on how the Court 

rules in this case, it might be that States will be 

required to do that.

 But at this point in time under -- under the 

current jurisprudence, it -- it didn't appear to the 

State that they needed to retest the sample, and I think 

you have to worry a little bit about -- about how many 

people you might indeed have to have come into court and 

testify if -- if the State -- if the burden on the State 

is that you have to -- you have to sample twice just in 

case you're going to lose one of your analysts, I -- I 

think that that does indeed put a great burden on the 

State to do that.  And so -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  General, I -- I don't want 

to eat up your -- your little remaining time, I think 

you can answer yes or no.  Does New Mexico assert the 

same rule as applicable to ballistics testing?

MR. KING:  No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?

 MR. KING:  I think that you have to do the 

analysis in each kind of statement that you're looking 

at, Your Honor, to determine whether or not the 

statement that's -- that's being made and that's being 

proposed for trial is a substitute for live in-court 

testimony.  And so, with regard to ballistics, you know, 

you would be looking at a little bit different set of 

facts.

 But in this case the facts are that -- that 

the gas chromatograph gave us a printout that said that 

the -- that the level of alcohol in the blood is .21 

grams per 100 milliliters, Mr. Caylor transferred that 

to a form, and that's what we are putting in.

 I -- I think that -- that it proves the 

point that I'm talking about, in a ballistics analysis, 

you would have to have some analysis and someone to 

reach a conclusion.  And it's that that sets 

Melendez-Diaz apart from this case, is -- is that there 

was -- that there was some analysis by -- by -- by 

the -- the declarant in that case.  And in the 

ballistics cases I think, most often, you would find 

that.

 Now, if the -- if in the ballistics case you

just took a photograph of the bullet and wanted to bring 

that into the court and say here's what the bullet looks 

like, the jury then could make a determination whether 

they think that that bullet appears to be the same as 

the other.  That wouldn't be covered by the 

Confrontation Clause.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Certainly not.

 MR. KING:  And -- and -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you -- you -- you think 

the result would be a -- the same if we could develop a 

machine that you put the bullet in and -- and -- and -­

that's been fired from this gun, and the murder bullet, 

and the machine goes, blah, blah, blah, and it spits 

out, you know, 99 percent, 99.9 percent match, that 

would be okay?

 MR. KING:  May I answer the question, Your 

Honor?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure.

 MR. KING:  In -- in that case, if -- if the 

machine were able to do all of that, the machine 

essentially is giving you the best evidence, yes, I 

believe that that would be the case.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FISHER:  Thank you.  Let me try to make 

four quick points.

 First, Justice Alito, I said the first 

objection was at JA 40, it's actually 44-45 in the Joint 

Appendix.

 With regard to the State's argument about 

whether this document is testimonial, I would simply 

urge the Court to take a very close look at the lab 

report itself.  It's at JA 62.  At the top it says, 

Mr. Chief Justice, in response to your question, 

arresting officer identification, and the officer 

writes, check for blood alcohol concentration.  That's 

the order to the lab.

 If you look at the bottom in the 

certification of analyst, he certifies that the 

following is true and correct, signs his name, and 

perhaps the most critical thing is at the very bottom, 

the actual rules of the New Mexico evidence law and 

criminal procedure law are referenced.  So, it's exactly 

like Melendez-Diaz.  This is a document that is 

expressly prepared for substitute live testimony.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not under oath, though, 

that's the only difference?

 MR. FISHER:  Not under oath if a

certification is actually different than an oath, that 

just makes this worse, as in Crawford this Court said 

that it would be implausible that trial by affidavit 

would be prohibited but trial by unsworn affidavit would 

be okay.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do the rules of 

criminal -- do the rules of criminal procedure in New 

Mexico say it should be prima facie evidence?

 MR. FISHER:  They say much the same thing. 

There are -- there are several rules referenced at the 

bottom that all make this automatically admissible, 

notwithstanding the hearsay rule to prove the truth of 

the matter asserted.

 With respect to Justice Ginsburg's question 

about retesting, you are exactly right.  The State had 

many choices in the case -- in this case about how to 

proceed.  But if it wanted Mr. Razatos to be its 

witness, all it had to do was have him do a -- retest it 

and write a new report and have him be the witness. 

There is no reason it would have to introduce 

Mr. Caylor's report then and come up against any State 

law issue.  Mr. Razatos could have been the live 

witness.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it depends on 

when they do it, of course.  I mean, you have the right

to look at their evidence presumably so -- so far in 

advance of trial, whatever, and if they had to get a 

new -- new technician, that would have to put off the 

trial -­

MR. FISHER:  And I think that -- I'm sorry. 

I think that goes to my last point, which is, Justice 

Breyer, you're talking about States that do this -- I'll 

combine my answer to these two things.  A continuance 

would have been perfectly -- perfectly appropriate if 

that scenario had arisen, Mr. Chief Justice, and that's 

what -- one thing the public -- Public Defender Service 

brief it talks about 23 -- 26 jurisdictions encompassing 

23 different States that follow the rule that we're 

advocating today.  And it -- we're not asking for more 

witnesses.  It's important that we're -- this isn't a 

multiple witness problem, we're just asking for a 

different witness.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 MR. FISHER:  In other words, the State just 

brought the wrong witness.  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted.
