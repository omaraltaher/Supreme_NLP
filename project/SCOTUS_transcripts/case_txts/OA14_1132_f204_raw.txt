CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  14­1132,  Merrill  Lynch, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pierce,  Fenner  &  Smith  v.  Manning. 

   

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Hacker. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  JONATHAN  D.  HACKER 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

In  language  that  differs  distinctly  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"arising  under"  language  of  Section  1331,  Exchange  Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  27  confers  on  the  Federal  courts  exclusive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  over  all  suits  brought  to  enforce  any  duty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

created  by  the  Exchange  Act  and  its  regulations.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  establishes  a  straightforward  test. 

   

 

 

            

The  Federal  court  has  exclusive  jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  suit  is  brought  to  enforce  Exchange  Act  duties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  if  the  suit  is  also  brought  to  enforce  State  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duties. 

            

In  particular,  the  words  "brought  to 

 

 

 

 

 

enforce"  focus  on  what  the  plaintiff  itself  wants  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  to  decide,  not  on  what  the  court  would  necessarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  decide,  as  1331  has  been  read  to  require. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

By  applying  the  1331  test,  the  Third  Circuit

not  only  ignored  Section  27's  distinct  language  but  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  distinct  policies,  which  strongly  disfavor  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  adjudication  of  Exchange  Act  duties  and  thus  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  the  opposite  of  the  policies  favoring  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  adjudication  that  underlie  the  Jackson  Pollock 

 

 

 

 

 

 

canvas  this  Court  has  painted  over  Section  1331. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Respondents,  however,  begin  not  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

necessity  rule  derived  from  1331  but  with  a  much  more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggressive  position  that  Section  27  only  creates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  over  causes  of  action  created  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exchange  Act  itself  and  thus  categorically  bars 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  over  State­based  causes  of  action  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  asserted  here. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Now,  does  your  ­­ does  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

test  depend  solely  on  what  is  alleged  in  the  complaint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  what  might  be  proven  under  a  ­­ a  more  generally 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

worded  complaint? 

 

            

Suppose  the  complaint  in  this  case  made  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reference  to  any  Federal  regulations  but  ­­ I'm  not  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

familiar  with  the  pleading  rules  in  New  Jersey,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppose  they  would  ­­ it  was,  you  know,  notice  pleading 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  so  there's  no  reference  to  the  regulations  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  ­­ they  sought  to  prove  their  case  by  arguing  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  New  Jersey  ­­ the  New  ­­ the  rule  in  New  Jersey

that  fall  within  your  test? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  The  way  you  put  it  at  the  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end,  the  answer  is  no.  If  the  rule  in  New  Jersey  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  because  it's  the  rule  in  New  Jersey,  then  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  not  be  seeking  to  enforce  an  Exchange  Act  duty. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  answer  to  the  first  part  of  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  is  yes,  which  is  our  test  does  look  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegations  on  the  face  of  the  complaint:  Is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  as  pleaded  seeking  to  enforce  a  duty  created 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  Exchange  Act? 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  they  could  amend  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

complaint,  and  then  we  wouldn't  be  here,  because  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  amend  the  complaint  to  say  that  we're  suing  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

New  Jersey  law  and  New  Jersey  law  mirrors  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  It's  a  matter  of  New  Jersey's  choice. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  The  way  I  would  put  it  is  we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  have  been  here  if  they  had  written  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  to  start  with,  but  because  removal  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  is  tested  at  the  time  of  removal,  if  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amended  their  complaint  now,  it  wouldn't  change  the  fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there's  Federal  jurisdiction  based  on  the  face  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  complaint  at  the  time  of  the  ­­ of  removal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  is  the  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

obligated  to  do  a  search  of  all  Federal  laws  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  to  know  if  this  complaint  might  have  a

Federal  cause  of  action? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  No.  That's  why  it's  important 

  

  

 

 

 

 

to  look  at  the  face  of  the  complaint.  This  complaint 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exemplifies  the  kind  of  complaint  that  triggers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  27  jurisdiction  because  it's  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  But  what  you  said  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Let  ­­ let  me  ask  you: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  ­­ this  ­­ this  ­­ let's  assume,  as  Justice  Alito 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assumed,  that  New  Jersey  is  the  same  as  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system,  notice  pleading.  Can  you  just  tell  me  as  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  practice,  do  most  complaints  set  forth  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  statute  under  which  ­­ not  1331  but  the  specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  statute  that  creates  the  duty,  or  do  they  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allege  the  duty? 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  Most  complaints  ­­ sure.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

depends  on  the  jurisdiction.  But  certainly  in  my  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Let's  say  just  under 

  

 

 

 

 

notice  pleading  under  Federal  standards. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  They  would  almost  certainly  set 

  

 

 

 

 

 

forth  the  ­­ the  statute  under  which  they're  pleading. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They're  identifying  the  duty  so  that  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understands  what  the  nature  of  the  claim  is.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  common  precisely  because  you  don't  want  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  go  looking  around  for  the  cause  of  action,  especially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  Twombly  and  Iqbal.

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  But  they  ­­ but  they  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  do  that.  As  ­­ as  I  understand  your  case,  they 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  have  to  explicitly  refer  to  the  Federal  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  That's  ­­ that's  right  in  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited  sense  that  ­­ I  think  this  Court  would  recognize 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  has  recognized  inartful  pleading  doctrine  where,  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example  ­­ if  you  use  this  complaint  as  an  example,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  had  just  literally  whited  out,  deleted  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

references  to  Reg  SHO  as  such  but  were  clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unambiguously  pleading  violations  of  its  requirements 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  same  capital  L,  Locate,  capital  C,  Close­Out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements,  you  would  unmistakably  understand  the 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  to  be  based  on  violations  of  the  Act  ­­ of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exchange  Act  regulation  seeking  to  enforce  those  duties. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Then  sure,  the  fact  you  didn't  cite  it  wouldn't  change 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fact. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  that  imposes  quite 

  

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ quite  an  onerous  task  upon  ­­ upon  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court,  it  seems  to  me.  You  ­­ you  have  to  sift 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  the  complaint  and  see  if  any  of  the  claimed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causes  of  action  under  State  law  mirror  a  cause  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  that  happens  to  exist  under  Federal  law,  without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  the  hint  that  they  mention  the  Federal  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  Well,  but  that  ­­ that  only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

goes  to  the  question  in  an  artful  pleading  situation,

the  court  the  defendant's  theory  as  to  why  the  complaint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeks  to  enforce  Federal  duty.  So  it's  not  like  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge  has  to  do  it  him  or  herself. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  all  of  these  are  hypothetical  questions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're  talking  about  a  complaint  here  that  unambiguously 

   

 

 

 

 

 

seeks  to  enforce  duties  prescribed  ­­

remedies  were  sought  to  determine  whether  you  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  to  enforce  the  law.  Each  of  the  causes  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  here  are  under  State  law.  How  is  that  seeking

MR.  HACKER:  A  ­­ a  couple  of  points.  First 

    

   

  

 

 

 

of  all,  Pan  Am  was  a  well­pleaded  complaint­rule  case.

about  what  the  complaint  ­­ the  Respondents  describe  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illegal  short­selling.  That's  what  causes  ­­ that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  makes  unjustment  enrich.  That's  what  makes  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

interference  of  contract  tortious.  That's  what  makes  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  negligent.  That's  the  breach  of  the  duty,  is  to  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  to  ­­ is  to  do  ­­ find  a  Locate. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  where  in  the  complaint  you  find  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Without  the  Federal  law, 

  

 

 

 

 

would  there  be  a  duty  under  State  law  not  to  short  sell?

MR.  HACKER:  Not  under  this  complaint.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

complaint  identifies  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Please  go  back  to  answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

my  direct  question:  If  there  were  no  Federal  law. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  There  is  ­­ the  answer  is  no. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Third  Circuit  itself  said  there  is  no  analogue  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

New  Jersey  law  to  Regulation  SHO.  Nothing.  Zero  in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

New  Jersey  law.  Not  a  statute,  not  a  regulation,  not  an 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  guidance,  and  not  a  common  law  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  New  Jersey  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

New  Jersey  law  certainly  prohibits  fraud.  So  is  ­­ are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  doing  anything  more  than  saying,  we  think  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutes  fraud? 

 

            

            

MR.  HACKER:  They  ­­ they're  saying  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  "This"  being  what 

  

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  violation  ­­ what  you  say  is  the  violation  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  law. 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  Right.  What  they're  saying  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

fraud  or  is  tortious  interference  or  is  negligence  or  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unjust  enrichment  is  the  failure  to  get  a  Locate. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  complaint  isn't  ambiguous  about  this. 

 

 

 

 

 

The  complaint  explains  what  a  Locate  is.  It's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

prescribed  by  Regulation  SHO. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  do  they  just  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  expand  their  allegation  and  say,  okay,  we're  not

going  to  call  it  "a  Locate,"  but  we  think  it's  fraud

the  only  difference? 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  Well,  they're  ­­ they're 

  

 

 

 

 

definitely  not  just  using  a  ­­ a  shorthand.  They're 

   

   

  

 

 

 

very  explicit  about  it  in  defining  "Locate,"  capital  L. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  is  the  gravamen.  To  use  the  phrase  from  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

morning's  decision,  that  is  the  ­­ no  matter  how

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Then  why  isn't  this  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  HACKER:  But  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  There  are  ­­ there  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

many,  many  instances  in  which  there  is  a  State  claim, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  a  State  claim  for  negligence,  and  the  negligent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  is  alleged  to  be  violation  of  a  Federal  safety 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard.  So  it's  all  about  whether  the  Federal  safety 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  was  violated,  but  the  claim  is  a  State  claim

for  negligence.  You  wouldn't  say  that  that  is  a  claim 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  has  to  be  brought  in  Federal  court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  Well  ­­ but  the  language  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  statute  is  different.  That's  the  key.  In  this 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  Moore  decision  addressing  "arising  under,"  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1331,  the  Court  addressed  exactly  that  situation.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  precisely  that  situation.  The  State  of  Kentucky 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  it  negligence  per  se  to  violate  the  Safety 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appliances  Act,  and  this  Court  says  ­­ and  it  used  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exact  phrasing  that  became  Section  27  when  it  said,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  negligence  per  se  statute  incorporated  the  duty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prescribed  by  the  State.  We're  seeking  to  enforce  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duty  prescribed  in  the  Act. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  in  your  ­­ in  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

view,  you  have  to  ­­ if  ­­ if  ­­ if  this  Court  finds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  section  here,  Section  27,  is  the  same  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"arising  under,"  you  lose? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  Well,  no,  but  for  a  different 

   

  

 

 

 

 

reason.  We  do  think  it's  actually  necessary  and  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Third  Circuit  erred  in  that  respect,  but  that's  not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  here.  The  question  here  ­­ and  we  think  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perfectly  clear  that  the  complaint  actually  ­­ they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  prevail  under  State  law  unless  they  establish  that

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  I'm  sorry.  Can  we  go 

  

  

 

 

 

 

back?  Because  I'm  not  sure  I  understood  your  answer  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  question.  Are  you  saying  that  if  a  State  adopts  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  of  a  Federal  safety  standard  as  constituting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

negligence,  that  that  claim  arises  under  Federal  law? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  Not  that  it  arises  under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law,  but  that  a  suit  under  that  State's  standard 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  it  is  a  violation  of  State  law  to  violate  Reg 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SHO  ­­ for  example,  if  New  Jersey  law  said  it  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation,  it  is  a  ­­ you  know,  the  statutory  tort  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violate  Reg  SHO,  if  that  was  the  statute,  and  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  a  suit  under  that  statute,  you  were  ­­ and  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  seeking  to  enforce  the  duties  created  by  Reg  SHO. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  why  this  language  is  different  from  "arising 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under,"  because  the  suit  was  clearly  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  what's  the  answer  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg's  question? 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  It  would  not  necessarily  be  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  would  be  ­­ only  be  a  suit  "arising  under"  if  it  was

Federal  court  action  because  that  suit  would  be  a  suit

MR.  HACKER:  I'm  sorry? 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  You  said  that  it  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

only  a  suit  if  it  were  ­­ Federal  suit  if  it  were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary. 

            

MR.  HACKER:  I'm  sorry.  It  would  only  be  an 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

arising  under  action  under  1331.  That  would  be  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  a  different  statute,  a  different  jurisdictional 

   

   

 

 

statute.  Under  that  statute  ­­ to  be  clear,  that's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  one  we're  talking  about.  Under  1331,  this  Court  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held,  since  at  least  the  Smith  case,  that  a  State  ­­ an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  brought  under  State  law  can  be  in  State  court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  if  it's  a  State  cause  of  action,  if  resolving  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  issue  is  necessary  to  resolve  the  State  cause  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action.  That's  1331. 

  

 

            

This  statute  is  markedly  and  meaningfully 

 

 

 

 

 

different  because  it  doesn't  turn  on  whether  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arising  under  what  the  cause  of  action  is.  What  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

turns  on  is  what  was  the  suit  brought  to  enforce.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  brought  to  enforce  a  duty  brought  by  the  Exchange 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Hacker,  just  looking  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  language,  I  mean,  I  understand  your  interpretation 

   

   

 

 

 

of  it,  but  it  seems  to  me  that  there's,  you  know,  a  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  as  good  interpretation  which  says  the  opposite.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  words,  you  know,  what  does  it  mean  for  a  suit  to

circumstance  you're  talking  about?  In  the  circumstance 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you're  talking  about,  the  suit  is  brought  to  enforce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law. 

 

            

Now,  it's  true  that  State  law  might  look  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law;  State  law  might  incorporate  Federal  law  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  ways;  State  law  might  have  some  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship  to  Federal  law.  But  what's  the  suit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  to  enforce?  The  suit  is  brought  to  enforce 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law. 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  A  couple  of  points,  though. 

    

 

 

 

 

Remember,  the  statute  doesn't  say  is  the  suit  brought  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforce  State  law. 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  State  liabilities. 

  

 

 

 

MR.  HACKER:  It's  also  not  said  ­­ said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  to  enforce  State  liabilities.  It  says  brought 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  enforce  State  liability  or  ­­ excuse  me,  brought  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforce  liabilities  or  duties  created  by  the  Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  it  were  liabilities  alone,  this  might  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  different  case,  because  the  Exchange  Act  creates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liabilities  by  its  own  terms,  and  an  action  brought  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforce  Exchange  Act  liabilities,  basically  remedies  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be,  as  I  say,  that  might  well  be  a  case  that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  ­­ would  only  be  brought  under  the  Exchange  Act.

clearly  they're  addressing  the  same  kind  of  problem  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  addressed  in  Moore  when  the  States  ­­ it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  emerging  issue  at  the  time  ­­ when  States  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporating  explicitly,  not  just  generally  looking  to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  explicitly  incorporating  Federal  duties  into  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law,  and  plaintiffs  were  bringing  State  causes  of  action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  negligence,  saying  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  you  would  say  that's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

duty  created  under  this  chapter. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  Right,  created  ­­ the  Reg  SHO 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  situation  is  a  duty  created  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  why  isn't  it  created 

  

 

 

 

 

 

under  State  law  as  well? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  Because  the  ­­ the  cause  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  is  created  in  State  law.  State  law  says  it  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  of  State  law  to  violate  a  duty  created  by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law.  State  law  doesn't,  itself,  care  about  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

content.  It's  incorporating.  It's  saying  we  leave  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Congress,  we  leave  to  the  SEC,  whatever  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulatory  body  is,  the  content  of  the  law,  and  we  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  you  can  have  a  cause  of  action  under  our  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures  if  you  violate  duties  created  by  Federal  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  the  situation. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  think  that's  sort  of 

    

 

 

 

 

ambiguous  in  the  statute.

statute;  does  not  ­­ does  not  even  mention  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute. 

            

As  I  understand  your  case,  you  would  say 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  person  is  suing  to  enforce  a  duty  under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law.  I  would  not  say  that.  I  would  say  that 

    

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  is  seeking  to  enforce  the  duty  that  State  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creates,  not  the  one  that  Federal  law  creates. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  And  I  agree  with  you.  Our 

   

  

  

 

 

 

argument  is  not  ­­ if  there  are  literally  parallel  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duties,  the  State  says  if  New  Jersey  tomorrow,  or  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

importantly,  years  ago,  had  promulgated  its  own  Reg  SHO 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  had  its  own  Locate  requirements,  its  own  Close­out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements,  and  there  was  a  State  cause  of  action 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  you  violated  the  New  Jersey  Reg  SHO  and  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

caused  us  injury,  we  wouldn't  be  here.  There  might  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption  argument  that  the  State  can't  do  that,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  not  trigger  Section  27  jurisdiction,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  clearly  seeking  ­­

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  you  would  have  no

case  if  New  Jersey  passed  a  law  saying,  as  a  matter  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

New  Jersey  law,  we  hereby  adopt,  you  know,  everything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act,  including,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular,  Regulation  SHO.  That  is  State  law.  We're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

following  the  Federal  law  because,  you  know,  we  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  easier  to  do  that  than  write  up  our  own  securities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

code. 

            

            

That's  fine  with  you? 

 

 

 

MR.  HACKER:  No.  That's  a  different  case, 

   

  

  

 

 

because  there,  the  New  ­­ New  Jersey  isn't  making  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own  politically  accountable  decision  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Yes,  it  is.  It's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

saying  ­­ it's  saying  wherever  it  says  Federal  law  as  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  just  strike  that  and  put  in  New  Jersey  law.  They  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  that.  They  can  adopt  whatever  law  ­­ source  of  law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  want. 

 

            

            

MR.  HACKER:  Sure. 

  

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Even  though  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

precisely  the  same  at  the  same  level  of  detail,  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  say  under  your  theory  that  if  you  sue  just  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

New  Jersey  law,  that's  okay. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  I  don't  think  so,  Your  Honor, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

because  there  New  Jersey  is  leaving  to  Congress  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SEC  to  decide  what  the  law  is.  The  duties  are  always  ­­

Federal  law,  and  then  incorporated  by  the  law  that  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we'll  do  whatever  the  Federal  law  says. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Right. 

  

 

 

MR.  HACKER:  The  duty  is  created  by  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  Exchange  Act  and  its  regulations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No,  the  duty  under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

New  Jersey  law  is  passed  by  whatever  statute  they  enact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  we  ­­ us  too,  we  want  to  do  it  as  well,  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  New  Jersey  law. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  But  they  can  do  it  separate. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  can  establish  their  own  independent  duties. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Yeah. 

  

 

 

MR.  HACKER:  But  when  they  consciously 

  

 

 

 

 

choose  not  to  create  an  independent  duty,  but  to  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we're  going  to  ­­ literally,  in  the  hypothetical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  adopting,  they're  literally  saying  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporating  the  Federal  duty.  And  in  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

situation  ­­

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  as  New  Jersey  ­­

seeking  to  enforce  a  duty  created  by  the  Exchange  Act 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  its  regulations,  you  know,  albeit  incorporated  into

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  then  you're  going  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  situation  where  the  judge  is  going  to  have  to  try 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  figure  out  whether  State  law  exactly  mimics  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law,  or  whether  there  are  minor  deviations  from  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  And  that  can't  be  a  good  jurisdictional  test,  can 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it? 

            

MR.  HACKER:  Well,  all  jurisdictional  tests 

  

 

 

 

 

will  have,  you  know,  challenges  at  the  margin. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  don't  think  this  is  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

marginal  question.  I  think  this  is  kind  of  a,  you  know, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty  ordinary  question  of  like,  well,  what  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law  doing?  Is  it  exactly  ­­ lots  of  State  laws 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  mimic  Federal  law,  and  lots  of  them  don't. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  I  think,  in  practice,  there  is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

quite  a  clear  margin  because  States  make  different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

choices  in  this.  If  a  State  wants  to  say,  as  plenty  do, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  are  just  in  haec  verba  incorporating  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard,  then  you  ­­ the  ­­ the  duty  is  created  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  standard,  and  becomes  enforceable  under  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law. 

            

But  the  duty  still  is  created  by  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  States  make  other  clear,  distinct  choices  where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  say  we're  going  to  have  a  fraud  law;  we're  going  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  our  own  securities  laws.  New  Jersey  has  its  own 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

securities  laws.  It  could,  if  it  wanted  to,  adopt  a  Reg

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Why  couldn't  the  New  Jersey 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme  Court  ­­ why  couldn't  the  New  Jersey  Supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  say  this  is  our  interpretation  of  a  provision  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  New  Jersey  Uniform  Securities  Act,  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  short  selling,  this  is  what  it  means,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  ever  referring  to  Reg  SHO,  adopt  basically  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  or  exactly  the  same  rule  that  is  incorporated  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  regulation?  Would  you  say  that  then  an  ­­ that  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  under  that  provision  of  the  New  Jersey  Securities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act  would  be  one  seeking  to  enforce  a  Federal  duty? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  No.  I  think  that  would  be  a 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

different  case  where  the  State  is  saying,  you  know,  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  like  a  pretty  good  rule;  we're  going  to  adopt  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  we  like  it,  adopt  it  independently  as  our  own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule.  And  in  any  future  case,  they  might  do  something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different.  As  happened  in  the  very  New  Jersey  case,  the

say  they  can't  say,  we  adopt  Regulation  SHO  as

New  Jersey.  And  all  of  the  competing  interest  parties 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  come  and  ­­ and  talk  to  New  Jersey  about  whether  it

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  of  that. 

  

 

 

 

MR.  HACKER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Now,  that  might  be 

  

 

 

 

 

something  you  could  object  to  at  trial  if  they  try  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  State  law  is  the  same  as  Federal  law  and  can't  prove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  You  then  appeal  that  decision  if  it's  wrong.  If

"violates  securities  laws  and  regulations."  That's  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they're  complaining  about.  Short  selling  defined  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

something  that  violates  securities  laws  and  regulations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Surely  they  mean  the 

  

 

 

 

 

current  regulations,  right?  And  you've  just  told  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  if  the  State  law  applies  only  to  the  current 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation,  it  is  not  adopting  Federal  law,  right?  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  complaint  is  referring  to  the  current  regulation.

How  do  you  know  it's  referring  to  that  regulation  as  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  change  in  the  future? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  Well,  it's  ­­ well,  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

referring  to  past  conduct.  So  it's  saying  what  you  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injured  us  ­­

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Right. 

  

 

MR.  HACKER:  ­­ because  you  violated  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  as  it  exists  today.  You  committed  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

illegal  short  selling.  You  didn't  get  Locates  as  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  ­­

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Fine. 

  

 

MR.  HACKER:  ­­ the  SEC  would  require. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Because  that  regulation  is 

  

 

 

 

 

a  good  regulation,  and  it  ought  to  be  New  Jersey  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  if  that  regulation  changes,  we  ­­ we  don't  say  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ought  to  be  New  Jersey  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  Let  me  try  an  exercise.  If  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

eliminated  ­­ all  of  this  suggests  that  you  could  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  easily  eliminate  all  of  the  references  to  Reg  SHO, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  the  references  to  capital  L,  Locate,  capital  C, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Close­Out,  and  their  complaint  would  just  proceed  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  way  it  would.  And  we  know  that  that's  not  true 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they've  got  no  source  ­­ if  they  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  like  that  that  just  says,  this  is  fraud,  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  tortious  interference,  we're  unhappy  about  it  because

Federal  issue,  Federal  issue  is  whether  what  they've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  violates  Regulation  SHO.  They  don't  say  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

anywhere  in  the  complaint,  not  even  in  paragraph  24,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  cite  it,  I  read.  This  is  background.  They  don't

it  isn't  necessary.  Okay? 

  

 

 

            

            

MR.  HACKER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  if  it  is  necessary  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  right,  then  this  case  should  have  been  brought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  1331. 

 

            

            

MR.  HACKER:  That  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  wasn't,  and  we're  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

deciding  that.  So  since  we're  not  deciding  it,  we  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  assume  that  it  is  not  necessary. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  HACKER:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay?  If  we  assume  it  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

not  necessary,  if  we  assume  that  the  conditions  for  1331 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  met,  and  therefore  it  doesn't  get  into  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  for  that  reason,  why  would  anyone  want  a  case  like 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  in  Federal  court  when  the  States  want  to  adjudicate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it? 

            

MR.  HACKER:  Because  Congress  wanted  it  in

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  what  is  the  evidence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  wanted  that? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  The  language  of  the  statute. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  all  you're  left  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is,  you  say,  read  the  language  of  the  statute,  don't

MR.  HACKER:  I'm  sorry,  but  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You  have  the  language.  I'm

disagree  with  you  more. 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  Go  ahead. 

  

  

 

 

MR.  HACKER:  The  language,  first  of  all,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  is  unambiguous  in  our  favor.  But  we  absolutely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe  the  objectives  and  purpose  are  uniformly  in  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favor  because  what  you  know,  if  nothing  else,  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  27  is  that  Congress,  unlike  ­­ unlike  all  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  jurisdictional  statutes  that  use  decidedly

SEC  hasn't  said. 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Curious. 

  

 

MR.  HACKER:  Right.  That's  for  the  SEC,  but 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  we  would  not,  I  think,  construe  a  statute 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

based  on  the  absence  of  the  SEC  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You  are  relying  on  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

different  language.  This  is  not  arising  under,  but  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special  language  in  Section  27.  And  we  have  a  brief; 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  public  citizen  brief  that  says,  well,  this  is  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Section  27  is  not  unusual.  It  lists  about,  what  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  some  ten  other  statutes  that  are  phrased  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way. 

            

            

MR.  HACKER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  with  respect  to  every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  those  statutes,  Public  Utilities  Holding  Company, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  Power  Act,  Connally  Hot  Oil,  the  same  argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  apply  to  those  statutes. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  Those  are  all  similarly 

  

 

 

 

 

narrowly  prescribed  statutes.  And  as  the  public  citizen 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself  indicates,  those  were  enacted  mostly  in  the  New 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Deal  era  when  we  know,  if  anything,  Congress  was  looking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  expand  opportunities  for  plaintiffs  to  get  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  court.  And  it  wouldn't  be  surprising  at  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  New  Deal  statutes  would  favor  Federal  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudication  of  Federal  duties.

that  interpretation,  even  as  to  the  Natural  Gas  Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  Pan  American? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  Yes.  Pan  American  was  purely  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

well­pleaded  complaint  rule  case.  And  the  footnote  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  side  relies  on,  referring  to  arising  under,

doesn't  change  the  fact  the  well­pleaded  complaint  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies  as  it  does  on  its  face,  "brought  to  enforce" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires  the  court  to  look  at  the  face  of  the  complaint.

jurisdiction,  to  decide  State  law­created  claims  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  claims  have  already  failed  the  Grable  test.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  no  indication  that  Congress  clearly  intended  such  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unprecedented  intrusion  on  State  court  authority. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Why  do  you  think,  Mr.  Stris, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  different  language  was  used  in  these  ten  statutes? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  So  my  ­­ my  best  answer  is  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mirror,  essentially,  what  our  amici  public  citizen  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  securities  regulators  have  said,  which  is  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  time  that  certainly  the  '33  Act  and  the  '34  Act  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passed,  the  Federal  question  statute  had  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount­in­controversy  requirement. 

 

            

Now,  I  understand  that  my  friend,  Mr. 

   

 

 

 

 

Hacker,  points  out  in  his  reply  that  there's  a  current 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  28  U.S.C.  1337,  that  was  enacted  in  1948.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  a  predecessor  statute,  28  U.S.C.  41(8)  that  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacted  in  1911  that  removed  the  amount­in­controversy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  for  cases  involving  interstate  commerce. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  one  would  think,  because  it's  the  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

today,  that  that  would  apply  to  securities.  But  as  best 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  can  understand  from  our  research,  in  the  years  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  relevant,  1911  to  the  time  of  the  '33  Act  and  '34 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act,  it  was  not  interpreted  that  way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  there  was  essentially  an 

 

 

 

 

amount­in­controversy  requirement  for  securities  cases.

So  I  think,  if  I  were  to  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  amount  in  controversy 

  

 

 

 

 

wasn't  very  high.  And  wouldn't  most  cases  of  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

character  easily  meet  it? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  I  don't  know  that  that's  true, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg.  But  more  importantly  to  ­­ to  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  If  it  was  $3,000, 

  

 

 

 

 

something  like  that? 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  STRIS:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Or  even  less? 

  

 

 

 

MR.  STRIS:  If  we're  attempting  to  ascertain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

why  Congress  would  choose  to  use  this  language  instead 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  other  language,  I  would  submit  that  any

didn't  want  that  for  purposes  of  Federally­created 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  ­­ so  this  is  going  to  segue  into  my  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  ­­ we  think  the  most  natural  reading  of  Section  27 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  as  a  creation  test. 

   

 

 

            

            

And  so  if  that's  what  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  $3,000  is  probably  a  lot  of

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  That's  a  yes­or­no 

   

  

 

 

question,  counsel. 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  STRIS:  I  would  like  any  money  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

anyone  on  the  Court  or  in  the  courthouse  would  like  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  me,  and  I'll  be  taking  collections  after  ­­ after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  argument. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  If  ­­ if  ­­ if  your  answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  correct,  why  do  they  need  to  use  the  term 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"exclusive"?  Why  don't  they  just  ­­ just  ­­ just  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  STRIS:  So  let  me  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ there  is  jurisdiction 

  

 

 

 

 

in  Federal  court.  That  ­­ why  ­­ that  doesn't  explain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  use  of  the  word  "exclusive." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  No,  no.  But  I  think  it  does. 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

So  ­­ so  this  particular  statutory  language  is  found  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eleven  statutes.  In  some  of  them,  they  used  the  term 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"exclusive  jurisdiction";  in  ­­ in  others,  they  did  not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  follows  exclusive  jurisdiction  is 

 

 

 

 

essentially  a  creation  test  that  ­­ which  I'll  explain

in  a  moment.  The  fact  that  they  chose  to  confer 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusive  jurisdiction  here  just  means  that,  when  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  cause  of  action  that  was  created  by  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exchange  Act,  they  wanted  it  to  be  in  Federal  court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  ­­ so  let  me  ­­ let  me  get  to  the  spirit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  ­­ of  the  answer,  which  is  why  I  think  that  there's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good  reason  to  believe  that  exclusive  jurisdiction  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  is  limited  to  causes  of  action  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

created  by  the  Act  itself. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  my  friend  Mr.  Hacker  concedes,  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

reasonably,  that  if  someone  sues  under  a  parallel  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

duty,  that  that  is  only  a  duty  under  ­­ that's  a  lawsuit 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  brought  to  enforce  only  a  duty  under  State  law. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  was  pleased  to  hear  that,  because  I  think  that  is  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most  natural  reading  of  ­­ of  the  language. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Our  position  is  that  the  result  is  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  if  a  State  accomplishes  the  same  thing  through 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  expedience  of  incorporating  or  referencing  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law. 

            

And  I  want  to  be  clear  on  this  point.  Our 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  is  not  that  the  plain  meaning  of  the  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compels  that  interpretation.  I'll  be  the  first  to  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  one  could  theoretically  read  the  ­­ the  language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  to  enforce  a  liability  or  duty  created  by  the

suggests.  One  could.  But  I  think  it  starts  to  break 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

down  and  not  really  make  much  sense  if  we  look  at  what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

missing  from  Section  27. 

 

 

 

            

Here's  what's  missing:  There  is  no  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  over  Exchange  Act  counterclaims,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

means  that  State  court  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Over  ­­

  

 

 

MR.  STRIS:  I'm  sorry.  Over  Exchange  Act 

  

  

 

 

 

 

counterclaims.  So  that  means  that  Congress  was  willing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  have  State  courts  adjudicate  claims  that  were  created 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  Act  itself. 

 

 

 

            

There  is  no  exclusive  jurisdiction  over 

 

 

 

 

 

Exchange  Act  defenses.  And  most  notably,  that  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

include  preemption.  And  in  the  mine­run  of  preemption 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  ­­ and  I'm  going  to  get  to  this  in  a  little  bit  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  only  is  the  State  court  determining  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exchange  Act  says,  but  it's  doing  it  for  the  purpose  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assessing  whether  there  is  a  conflict  between  State  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law. 

 

            

It's  really  important  that  those  two  things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  missing  from  the  statute,  because  I  find  it  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficult  to  believe  that  a  Congress  that  was  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned  about  State  courts  adjudicating  those  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somehow  would  be  very  concerned  about  a  State  court

happened  to  implicate  a  Federal  duty  or  a  liability. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

When  we  look  at  the  language  and  we  take  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  context,  I  think  it  just  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  Congress  must  have  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  ­­ go  ahead,  please. 

    

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Congress  must  have  had  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

mind  a  certain  category  of  claims  that  it  did  not  want 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudicated  in  State  court,  correct? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  STRIS:  I  agree. 

    

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  All  right.  So  you  seem  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

be  saying  that  the  category  of  claims  they  did  not  want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudicated  in  State  court  are  only  these:  Those  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  the  plaintiff  is  asking  for  the  enforcement  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  duty,  and  there  is  no  comparable  State  duty  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  time,  and  the  State  court  is  unwilling  to  recognize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  comparable  State  duty  in  the  context  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation. 

            

So  these  are  essentially  cases  in  which  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  is  basically  hostile  to  the  Federal  duty.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  are  the  only  cases  that  Congress  did  not  want  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  adjudicated  in  State  court. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Am  I  ­­ have  you  gone  wrong  in  that? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  STRIS:  I  ­­ I  don't  think  you've  gone 

    

   

 

 

 

 

wrong,  but  I  think  that  that  position  is  firmly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

supported  by  history,  if  we  look  at  the  context.

And  let  me  explain  what  I  mean. 

   

 

 

 

 

So  at  the  time  the  Exchange  Act  was  passed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

there  were  only  three  express  rights  of  action,  and  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  very  minor.  There  was  no  private  right  of  action 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  10(b);  there  was  a  market  manipulation  of  a  9(a), 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

short­swing  profits;  and  a  third  one  that  I  don't 

   

   

 

 

 

 

recall. 

            

So  if  we  look  at  the  context,  we  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history  of  States  regulating  securities.  We  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

parallel  provision  in  the  Exchange  Act,  Section  28,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  in  Matsushita  acknowledged,  expressly 

 

 

 

 

 

endorsed  the  fact  that  States  were  going  to  continue  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulate. 

            

So  I  think  the  Congress  that  passed  the  '34 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act  was  thinking  the  following:  They  were  thinking  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  very  narrow  window  of  claims  that  are  created  by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Act.  And  for  those,  a  9(a)  straightforward  market 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

manipulation  claim,  for  ­­ for  ­­ for  wash  sales.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  want  State  courts  adjudicating  those,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  are  very  technical.  We  want  exclusive 

  

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  over  those  claims. 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  that's  the  extent  of  what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  intended  in  passing  this  provision. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now  ­­

brought  this  claim  specifically  to  enjoin  violations  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  SHO  regulation.  So  that's  your  complaint.  Court, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

please  enjoin  the  defendant  from  violating  SHO. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  Well,  I  think  as  a  factual 

   

   

  

 

 

matter,  Justice  Ginsburg,  that  couldn't  happen  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  conduct  would  have  already  occurred.  But  I  won't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

resist  the  hypothetical. 

 

 

              

I  think  ­­ I  think  the  hypothetical  you're 

   

 

 

 

 

asking  reveals  the  most  difficult  part  of  our  plain­text 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation,  which  is  assume  a  State  statute  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

seeks  to  enjoin  what  is  only  a  federally­created  duty. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  don't  know  that  that  would  come  up,  but  it  could, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theoretically. 

            

Our  position  would  be  that  that  is  still 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

best  interpreted  as  a  lawsuit  brought  to  enforce  a  duty 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

or  a  liability  created  by  State  law,  because  the  ­­ the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  has  decided  by  reference  to  have  the  duty  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  violate  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  Federal  standard  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  would  get  the  injunction  for. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think,  in  the  real  world,  what  we're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeing  are,  at  best,  States  that  are  creating  parallel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  that  incorporate  duties  and  liabilities 

 

 

 

 

 

merely  because  it's  an  expedient.  And  so  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ I  guess  before  I  move  on  ­­ you  know, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  simplicity  is  a  ­­ is  a  major  virtue  in

any  jurisdictional  statute.  I  know  the  Court  has  said 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  before.  Without  any  strong  evidence  to  interpret 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  27  as  anything  other  than  a  creation  test,  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that's  the  best  result. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Can  I  ask  you  to  describe 

   

  

 

 

 

 

your  complaint?  In  other  words,  Mr.  Hacker  has  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  characterization  or  description  of  your 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint,  and  the  ­­ and  the  ­­ the  role  played  in  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  by  the  regulation.  So  if  you  had  to  describe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  complaint,  and  particularly,  what  role  does  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  play  in  your  claims  under  State  law? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  I  understand,  Justice  Kagan. 

    

 

 

 

            

So  I  think  there's  been  some 

   

 

 

 

misunderstanding  of  what  we're  alleging.  We  are  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

relying  on  Reg  SHO  for  any  theory  of  liability,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here's  why:  We're  bringing  a  straight­up 

   

  

 

 

market­manipulation  claim.  And  what  that  means  is  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting  that  the  naked  short­selling  that  happened 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  not  just  a  technical  infraction,  not  just  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

technical  violation  of  Reg  SHO,  but  was  done  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  of  depressing  sales  prices  ­­ or  prices  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

security.  That's  an  analogue  to  a  10b­5  action. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  if  we  look  at  paragraph  30  of  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  ­­ this  is  on  pages  53­A  to  ­­ to  54­A  ­­ we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  clear  that  the  relevant  provision  of  New  Jersey  law

is  substantially  similar  to  the  Federal  securities  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

We're  referring  to  10(b).  When  ­­ when  the 

  

 

 

 

 

Uniform  Securities  Act  was  promulgated  in  1956, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  101,  which  New  Jersey  adopted,  mirrors  10(b). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  you're  going  to  bring  a  claim  under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law,  you're  not  suing  under  Reg  SHO. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Manipulative  short­selling  existed  well  before  Reg  SHO. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  a  standard.  You're  basically  saying  someone  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

taking  a  short  position.  They're  injecting  inaccurate 

   

  

 

 

 

information  into  the  market  because  they  have  taken  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  that's  larger  than  normal  supply  and  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demand  would  ­­ would  bear,  given  the  size  of  the  public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

float.  They've  chosen  to  do  that  because  they  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  going  to  drive  prices  down  and  they're  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  more  money. 

 

 

            

You  don't  need  to  prove  all  of  that  to  get  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  of  Reg  SHO.  Reg  SHO  was  enacted  by  the  SEC 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  this  was  a  problem.  What  Reg  SHO  does  is  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allows  the  SEC  to  take  enforcement  action  and  to  fine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  that  engage  in  conduct  that  is  likely  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitute  market  manipulation. 

 

 

            

The  point  of  it  is  not  to  punish  market 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manipulation.  The  point  is  to  try  and  stop  people  from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  it  in  the  first  place.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I  just  ­­ yes. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  but  there  are  parts  of  your  complaint  that  go  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  greater  detail  and  focus  on  the  Federal  Rules. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  think  Paragraph  33  says,  you  know,  as  set  forth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  detail  herein,  the  defendants  violated  the  trading 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules  and  regulations  requiring  that  they  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deliver  shares  they  owed  to  the  DTCC  to  settle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

short­sale  transactions. 

 

            

            

That's  a  duty  imposed  by  Federal  law. 

   

 

 

 

 

MR.  STRIS:  This  is  a  very  important  point, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Chief  Justice.  We  mention  this  in  detail  for  a  very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific  reason.  It  has  nothing  to  do  with  our  theory 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  liability.  It  was  us  attempting  to  get  in  front  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  inevitable  preemption  defense,  which  happens.  These 

  

 

 

 

 

 

short­selling  cases  get  litigated  ­­ get  litigated  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  court.  A  very  significant  one  is  on  page  25  of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  blue  brief,  note  8.  It's  in  California  State  court, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overstock. 

            

In  these  cases,  the  ­­ the  largest  defense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  asserted  in  State  court  is,  we  complied  with  Reg 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SHO.  We  complied  with  the  Federal  Rules.  So  if  State 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  gives  you  a  remedy,  it  must  be  conflict  preempted. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  along  these  lines, 

  

 

 

 

 

look  ­­ look  at  Count  9,  100a  of  Appendix  to  the

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  What  page  is  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  100a. 

  

 

"Each  defendant  enterprise  owed  plaintiffs  a 

 

 

 

 

 

duty  of  care  in  their  capacity  as  gatekeepers  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market.  Each  depend  ­­ each  defendant  enterprise 

  

 

 

 

 

 

breached  the  duty  of  care  that  they  owed  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  to  report  suspicious  transactions  and  naked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

short  sales." 

 

            

Where  does  that  ­­ doesn't  that  come  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  Reg  SHO? 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  Look,  I'm  not  going  to  suggest, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Alito,  that  Reg  SHO  isn't  relevant  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

background  proposition.  We're  in  a  regulated  market,  so 

   

  

 

 

 

 

of  course,  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  landscape  that  exists  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  implicate  Federal  rules.  The  relevant  question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is:  Jurisdiction  can't  be  sustained  on  a  theory  that  we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't  advanced,  right? 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  that  doesn't  seem  to  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  doesn't  seem  to  be  relying  on  Reg  SHO  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

background  proposition.  You  say  that  they  breached  a  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  a  claim  for  negligence,  requires  a  breach  of  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

duty,  and  you  say  the  duty  that  they  breached  is  a  duty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  created  by  Reg  SHO.

it  a  little  bit  differently.  Here  ­­ here's  what  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  say.  I  would  say  that  if  market  manipulation 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires  that  someone  do  something  that  injects 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inaccurate  or  artificial  information  into  the  market, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  the  theory  of  a  market  manipulation  claim. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

You're  messing  with  natural  supply  and  demand  forces. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Of  course,  any  theory  of  market 

 

 

 

 

 

manipulation,  including  under  State  law,  would  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reference  and  talk  about  the  ground  rules,  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ground  rules  that  are  set  up  by  the  SEC  are  what  set  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  market's  normal  expectations  of  traditional  supply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  demand  forces.  So  it  would  really  tie  our  hands  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  any  time  you  talk  about  someone  doing  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  inconsistent  with  the  regulatory  scheme,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  bring  a  State  law  claim  that  is  truly  a  State  law 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim,  because  if  you're  trying  to  allege  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That  isn't  what  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

saying.  It's  saying  they  breached  the  duty  of  care  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  owed  to  the  plaintiffs  to  report  suspicious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transactions  of  naked  short  sales.  That's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

allegation  under  negligence. 

 

 

            

What  duty  of  care?  A  duty  of  care  imposed 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  New  Jersey  law?  What  New  Jersey  law?

MR.  STRIS:  It's  a  duty  of  care,  Justice 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Breyer,  imposed  by  New  Jersey  State  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Which  State  law? 

  

 

 

 

MR.  STRIS:  New  Jersey  Statute  49:3­49. 

  

 

 

 

 

It's  found  on  pages  84a  to  87a  of  the  ­­ the  Petition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix,  and  what  it  does  is  it's  the  section  of  101  of

Why  isn't  that  good  enough  on  that  matter  to

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'm  doing  it  for  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  STRIS:  Yes.

about  I  can't  clarify  in  my  mind  the  difference  between 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  being  thrown  out  in  an  arising  under  case,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yet  getting  back  in  under  Section  27.  That's  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  make  too  much  sense  to  me.  If  this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary  ­­ the  Federal  issue  is  necessary  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  to  win,  there's  arising  under  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Then  I  don't  know  what  to  do  with  the  word  "exclusive."

my  conclusion,  but  you  see,  it's  ­­ it's  ­­ I  ­­ I  need 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clarification,  because  I'm  not  sure  I've  thought  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  correctly. 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  So  here  ­­ here's  my  best 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

attempt  to  clarify.  I  think  ­­ let  me  throw  away  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts  for  a  minute.  In  other  words,  I  think  there's  no 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

theory  that  we've  pled  that  satisfies  even  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard,  but  let  me  throw  that  away.  Let  me  assume  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

best  case  for  them,  that  we've  relied  on  Federal  duties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  try  and  put  it  through  those  ­­ the  ­­ the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal  question  that  you've  asked. 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  one  way  to  resolve  this  is  to  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  simple  approach,  which  is  what  I  advocated  first, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  to  say,  look,  if  it's  just  enforcing  a  State  law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause  of  action,  even  if  it  incorporates  Federal  law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  all  27  does,  and  you're  done.  I  understand  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

premise  of  your  question  is  let's  say  you've  rejected 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  and  we're  thinking,  you  know  what,  maybe  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State­law  claims  fall  within  the  sweep  of  Section  27; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  do  we  think  about  this? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Here's  what  I  would  say.  I  would  say  that 

    

   

 

 

 

 

whether  this  is  an  arising  under  statute  or  not,  it  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  incorporate  what  I'll  call  a  Federal  necessity 

   

 

 

 

 

 

requirement,  because  that's  a  longstanding  rule  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

part  and  parcel  of  the  well­pleaded  complaint  rule.  And

if  you  look  at  Pan  American,  for  example.  Let's  say  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accept  what  my  friend  Mr.  Hacker  says  that  it's  dicta, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  weren't  saying  it's  an  arising  under  statute,  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied  ­­ this  Court  applied  the  well­pleaded  complaint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  without  looking  at  the  text  of  the  statute  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  a  sensible  thing  to  say  that  when  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  over  State­law  claims  is  predicated  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  character,  there  being  a  Federal  issue,  that  we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  the  well­pleaded  complaint  rule. 

 

 

 

 

            

It's  also  similarly  sensible  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

well­pleaded  complaint  rule  would  have  an  adjunct  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  Federal  necessity,  and  that's  precisely  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  said  in  Christianson.  And  I'll  quote  the  Court: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"The  well­pleaded  complaint  rule  focuses  on  claims,  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theories,  and  just  because  an  element  that's  essential 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  a  particular  theory  might  be  governed  by  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent  law  does  not  mean  the  entire  monopolization  claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arises  under  patent  law." 

 

 

 

            

Now,  to  the  second  half  of  your  question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is,  well,  how  does  that  ­­ how  do  they  map 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

together?  Well,  then  the  question  becomes  how  did  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegedly  use  this  Federally?  Do  we  use  it  in  our  RICO 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  as  one  of  several  predicate  acts?  That's  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  ever  been  alleged  until  today.  I  was  surprised 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  hear  a  suggestion  that  ­­ well,  I  shouldn't  say  until

today;  until  the  briefing  in  this  Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  the  lower  court,  the  suggestion  was  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  relied  on  a  Federal  duty  because  it  was  somehow  being 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

snuck  in  as  a  ­­ an  additional  predicate  of  our  RICO 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  I  resist  that  cause  ­­ that  claim.  If  you  go 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  look  at  the  pages,  we  allege  three  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Right,  something.  And  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

and  don't  tell  me  I'm  right  if  you  think  it  favors  you, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  maybe  it  does  favor  you,  but  I've  got  ­­ there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  be  other  cases,  you  know,  so  sympathize  a  little 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  my  problem. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  STRIS:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'm  looking  for  a  way  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

see  if  we  really  have  to  answer  all  these  difficult 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions  that  have  been  raised,  which  are  pretty  tough. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  I  was  thinking,  look,  here's  what  you  look  to. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Judge,  see  if  it  is  a  necessary  thing,  and  if  so, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it  falls  under  1331.  Okay?  If  it's  an  arising 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  claim  under  1331,  kick  it  out  of  State  court  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

send  it  to  Federal  court. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  if  it  isn't  an  arising  under  claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  isn't  necessary  to  winning  for  the  plaintiff, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forget  about  it.  Keep  it  in  State  court.  I  don't  care 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it's  ­­ don't  ­­ don't  worry  about  whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  passed  it  this  way,  or  the  State  legislature

worry  about  all  that  stuff.  Just  decide  one  question. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  STRIS:  So  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Does  it  meet  the  four 

  

 

 

 

 

 

criteria  for  arising  under?  If  so,  kick  it  out.  If 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not,  keep  it. 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  So,  Justice  Breyer,  here  are  my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ here  are  my  thoughts  on  this.  I  think  that  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Grable  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  May  I  just  clarify?  I 

   

  

  

 

 

thought  it  was  conceded  there  was  no  arising  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  true.  I'm  not 

  

  

 

 

 

looking  in  this  case.  I'm  looking  for  the  general  rule. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  That  ­­ that's  how  ­­ that's  how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  understood  ­­ that's  how  I  understood  the  question. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  as  to  the  general  rule,  here  are  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thoughts.  The  ­­ 1331  still  exists.  1331  is  powerful, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  we  can  call  it  Jackson  Pollock  all  we  want,  but  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  adopted,  it  exists,  and  it's  applied  by  courts.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  that  there  is  a  very  small  distinction  between 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporating  it  here  or  not.  There  is  a  distinction, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

exclusivity  versus  ­­ versus  nonexclusivity,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  that;  but  my  point  is  the  simplest  way  of  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  morass,  I  think,  is  to  say  we  want  a  simple,

administratable  rule  and  we  only  look  to  27  to  confer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  over  Exchange  Act­created  claims,  and  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have,  as  a  backdrop,  1331. 

   

 

 

            

Now,  if  you  resist  that,  Justice  Breyer,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  don't  like  that  and  you  say,  okay,  well,  what's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second­best  option?  There  ­­ there's  ­­ there's  two, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I  don't  really  need  to  advocate  one  as  opposed  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  because  we  win  under  both,  but  I'll  throw  them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  there. 

 

            

One  is  to  say  we  don't  have  to  call  this  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arising  under  statute.  We  don't  have  to  reach  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficult  question  of,  well,  was  ­­ was  that  what  Pan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

American  was  holding;  did  they  ­­ did  Congress  intend  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporate  1331  wholesale  in  all  of  its  elements? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  ­­ there's  a  simple  way  out,  which  is  to  say  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notion  of  Federal  necessity  ­­ this  is  the  one  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  were  saying  ­­ does  not  inhere  in  the  words 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"arising  under."  It  inheres  in  the  well­pleaded 

  

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  rule,  which  is  a  backdrop  presumption  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

should  apply  to  any  type  of  congressional  grant  of  ­­ of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  jurisdiction  over  State  law  claims  unless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  says  otherwise. 

 

 

            

So  I  think  that's  the  second­best  option. 

   

 

 

 

 

You  say,  okay,  it's  not  only  a  creation  test.  Section 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

27  can  reach  some  State  law­created  claims,  but  they

must  be  necessary. 

 

 

            

And  there's  a  long  jurisprudence  of  this 

   

 

 

 

 

Court.  It's  in  the  arising  under  context  of  what  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means  to  be  necessary.  And  then  you  don't  have  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficulty  of  trying  to  look  to  whether  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial,  doing  a  Federalism  balance.  You  would 

   

  

 

 

 

essentially  assume  if  it's  something  that  trigger  ­­ is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

triggered  by  an  exclusive  jurisdiction  provision  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exchange  Act,  it  must  be  substantial;  it  must  fit  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federalism  balance. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Stris,  I  guess  I  don't 

   

   

  

 

 

understand  why  you're  resisting  just  say  saying  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  ought  to  be  interpreted  in  the  same  way  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arising  under  jurisdiction  is  interpreted.  And  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

true  they're  different  words,  but  it's  at  least  as  good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  interpretation  of  these  words  that  they  essentially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refer  to  what  the  arising  under  test  refers  to,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  all  ­­ I  mean,  the  arising  under  test  doesn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  have  a  whole  lot  to  do  with  the  language  arising 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  anymore. 

 

            

            

MR.  STRIS:  No,  that's  true. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  ­­ so  why  isn't  that  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort  of  the  simplest  thing  to  do  is,  we  have  a  test, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  four­part  test,  and  this  language  seems  to  fit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  test  pretty  well,  and  that's  what  we  should  do,  we

should  just  have  one  test. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  Well,  so  Justice  Kagan,  I  won't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

resist  too  hard  because  obviously  we  win  under  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  that  outcome.  I  resist  a  ­­ I  resist  a  little 

    

   

   

   

 

 

bit,  and  I'll  tell  you  why. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Certainly  I  can  defend  that  proposition,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

we  did  in  our  ­­ in  our  briefing.  There  ­­ there  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solid  basis  to  do  that.  The  Court  interpreted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

materially  identical  language  that  way  in  Pan  American, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  we  pointed  out  in  our  brief  Section  22  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Securities  Act,  which  uses  materially  identical 

 

 

 

 

 

language.  Then  in  the  removal  bar  equates  that  language 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  arising  under.  I  could  defend  that  proposition.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

just  don't  think  it's  the  most  natural  reading  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language. 

            

If  you're  asking  me  honestly,  like  what  do  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  Congress  intended?  I  ­­ I  believe  that  they 

    

   

 

 

 

 

intended  "brought  to  enforce"  duties  or  liabilities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

created  under  ­­ under  the  Act  to  mean  the  three  narrow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categories  of  Federally  created  causes  of  action  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1934.  I  think  that's  what  the  statute  meant.  I  don't 

    

    

 

 

 

 

 

think  Congress  has  done  anything  since  then  to  change 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

If  you  look  to  SLUSA  in  1998  where  there  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  serious  concern  on  the  part  of  Congress  of  what  was

happening  in  terms  of  State  law­created  causes  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action,  the  initial  bill  that  was  proposed  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempted  all  State  law­created  causes  of  action.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  go  very  far.  Instead,  Congress  said,  no,  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  restrict  this  to  covered  class  actions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

 

So  if  ­­ if  you're  ­­ if  we're  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

find  what  I  think  is  the  most  intellectually  honest 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading  of  the  language,  and  consistent  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history,  I  actually  don't  think  it's  adopting  arising 

   

 

 

 

 

 

under,  but  I  certainly  could  defend  it  as  a  reasonable 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  of  the  language  in  the  context. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  in  light  of  SLUSA,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  that's  before  us  would  apply  only  in  individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions  and  small  class  actions? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  That's  ­­ that's  exactly  right. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  think  maybe  I'll  ­­ maybe  I'll  close  with  this.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that's  very  important  from  the  perspective  of  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sensibility  and  policy,  which  is  the  following. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

One  of  the  things  that  ­­ that  animated  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act  was  the  concern 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  lawyers  were  driving  litigation  and  not  clients. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that's  why,  for  example,  one  of  the  things  that  went 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  the  PSLRA  was  a  requirement  of  who  the  most 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  plaintiff  is.  That  doesn't  happen  when  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  cases  like  this,  when  you  have  the  CEO  of  a  company

who  holds  2.1  million  shares  who's  bringing  a  claim. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

And  so  not  only  was  it  not  the  point  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  in  1933  and  1934  to  invade  the  province  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  courts,  if  we  look  at  the  entire  history  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes  and  ­­ and  Congress  trying  to  say,  well,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  some  concerns  about  what  State  courts  are  doing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  has  never  been  an  express  concern  about  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  enforcing  State  law  in  individual  actions  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  one. 

 

            

For  the  Court  to  hold  otherwise  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unprecedented  because  you  would  be  stripping  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  of  the  type  of  jurisdiction  that  they've  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

since  the  time  of  the  Exchange  Act.  10(b)  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exchange  Act  itself  was  predicated  on  common  law  deceit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  fraud  and  a  whole  history  of  what  was  occurring  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  courts.  And  I  just  don't  think  there's  any  way  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read  Section  27  that's  workable  from  the  Court's

terms  of  what  the  dual  system  of  securities  regulation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  trying  to  do. 

 

 

 

            

            

And  so  if  there  are  no  further  questions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  just  out  of  curiosity, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

why  is  it  so  important  for  your  client  not  to  be  in

reasons.  The  first  is  his  lawyer's  practice  in  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  They're  familiar  with  the  procedures;  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

where  they  want  to  be. 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

The  second  is  the  ­­ the  procedures  are 

 

 

 

 

 

better.  I  mean,  it's  not  a  surprise  that  a  lot  of 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

securities  plaintiffs  want  to  be  in  State  court.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  instances  they  want  to  be  there  because  the  law  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  robust.  There's  no  scienter  requirement.  You  can 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

bring  a  Holder  claim.  That's  actually  not  the  case  here 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  New  Jersey  law  happens  to  parallel  so  we  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  those  benefits.  But  we  want  to  be  able  to  take  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

RICO  claim  where  we're  trying  to  take  a  new  area. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

These  naked  short  selling  cases,  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

new.  You  know,  the  Overstock  case  that's  happened,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  prefer  a  State  forum  for  our  State  law­created 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  to  convince  a  State  court  that  this  is  actionable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and,  you  know,  it  should  warrant  punitive  damages.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  we  have  every  right  to  do  that  as  ­­ as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

master  of  our  complaint. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You  said  that  you  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

prevail  in  this  case  without  showing  any  violation  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  SHO  regulation.  So  could  you  explain  how  you  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevail  even  if  you  don't  show  a  violation. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  Right.  So  I  ­­ I  would  put  it 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

slightly  differently.  If  I  said  that,  you  know,  I  think

that's  ­­ it's  imprecise. 

 

 

 

            

Any  act  of  market  manipulation  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  of  naked  short  selling  will  necessarily  violate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Regulation  SHO,  but  every  violation  of  Regulation  SHO  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  market  manipulation. 

 

 

            

What  Regulation  SHO  does  is  it  sets  a  floor. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  if  you  engage  in  certain  conduct,  you  ­­ you  short  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stock,  you  haven't  borrowed  it,  you  have  no  reason  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe  you've  borrowed  it,  the  SEC  can  fine  you  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes  where  there's  no  prior  right  of  action.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  make  out  a  market  manipulation  came  ­­ claim, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg.  To  prove  market  manipulation,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  go  a  step  further.  You  have  to  show  that  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  done  intentionally  to  try  and  depress  the  value  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  stock. 

 

            

So  the  point  I  was  trying  to  make  is  if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  were  an  analogue  to  our  State  law  claim,  it's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reg  SHO,  it's  10b­5.  And  ­­ and  the  idea  that  you  can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring  a  parallel  10b­5  action  in  State  court  and  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  court  adjudicate  it,  that's  never  been  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  But  they're  ­­ they're  essentially  trying  to  do  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end  run  around  that  analysis  by  suggesting  that  somehow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reg  SHO  is  what  we  are  trying  to  enforce. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Reg  SHO  is  not  relevant  for  that  purpose. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reg  SHO  doesn't  help  us.  Even  under  Federal  law  we

Three  minutes,  Mr.  Hacker. 

 

 

 

         

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  JONATHAN  D.  HACKER 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  Respondents'  argument  has  a  problem  with 

   

 

 

 

 

the  language,  both  of  their  own  complaint  and  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  of  the  statute. 

 

 

 

            

The  complaint  could  not  be  clearer  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while  it's  true  there  are  references  to  market 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manipulation,  what  they're  trying  to  establish  is  market 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manipulation  by  the  mere  fact  that  there  were  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Locates  that  complied  with  a  Reg  SHO.  That's  what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

created  what  they  call  counterfeit  shares.  That,  in  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  itself,  forgetting  intent,  is  also  what  diluted  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shares  and  caused  their  problems.  That's  clear  from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

paragraph  33.  It's  clear  in  paragraph  86  and  87.  What 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  talk  about  are  violations  of  the  rules  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  that  caused  them  harm.

They  would  also  like  to  establish  a  market 

   

 

 

 

 

 

manipulation,  I'm  sure,  if  they  could  prove  intent  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  that.  But  the  whole  point  of  ­­ of  the  complaint 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  is  to  say  ­­ is  to  hope  they  can  get  in  front  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  and  judge  who  will  agree  with  them  that  those  mere 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  of  Reg  SHO  in  and  of  themselves  establishes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  torts  that  they  are  pursuing.  It's  perfectly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  in  those  paragraphs,  and  through  the  rest  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint.  I  don't  think  there's  any  ambiguity 

    

 

 

 

 

whatsoever. 

            

Nor  is  there  ambiguity  in  the  plain  text  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute.  The  first  argument  they  make  is  that  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effectively  incorporates  the  Holmesian  view  that  it  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  a  cause  of  action  created  by  the  Act  itself. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  ­­ Section  27  answers  that  question.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  say  that  jurisdiction  is  established  for  ­­ over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causes  of  action  established  by  the  Exchange  Act.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  been  the  way  that  Congress  would  have  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  If  they  meant  to  say  there  is  jurisdiction  over 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causes  of  action  established  by  the  Act,  Congress  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  said  that.  It  didn't  say  anything  like  that.  What 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  said  was  very  much  essentially  the  opposite  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  very  different,  which  is  suits  brought  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforce  duties  prescribed  by  ­­ created  by  the  Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  about  the  substantive  source  of  the  ­­ the  source

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  I  always 

    

  

 

 

thought  violations  had  to  do  with  criminal  law.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole  structure  of  this  provision  talks  first  ­­ in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  half  of  the  first  sentence  it  talks  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violations  of  the  law.  The  second  sentence  parallels 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  says  criminal.  The  second  half  of  the  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  talks  about  all  suits  in  equity  at  actions  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law,  or  actions  at  law. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  But  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  don't  know  that  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HACKER:  ­­ those  are  all  civil  actions. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  clearly  talking  about  civil  actions.  The  reference 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  "violation"  itself  talks  about  suits  in  civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions  for  violations  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It  talks  about  criminal 

  

 

 

 

 

proceedings. 

            

MR.  HACKER:  Right.  It  ­­ it  ­­ it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

encompasses  ­­ the  language  also  encompasses  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings,  but  the  references  to  suits  brought  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforce  liabilities  or  duties  is  unambiguously  about  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil  proceeding,  and  the  other  side  doesn't  disagree 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  that. 

 

            

But  let  me  turn  to  the  last  point, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer's  argument  and  I  think  Justice  Kagan's,

that,  well,  maybe  it's  just  the  same  thing  as  1331. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  too  is  contrary  to  the  text  of  the  statute  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1331  has  been  construed  ­­ it  also  doesn't  have  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

textual  requirement  ­­ as  having  this  necessity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

component  precisely  because  if  you  don't  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessity  component,  then  you're  taking  away  from  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  cases  that  State  courts  are  competent  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudicate. 

            

We  know  that  Congress  had  literally  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposite  premise  here,  that  they  didn't  want  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  adjudicating,  as  Respondents'  counsel's  conceded, 

 

 

 

 

 

a  certain  class  of  cases. 

 

 

 

 

            

What  class  of  cases  is  that?  The  statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

tells  us  the  answer.  It's  those  that  are  suits  brought 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  enforce  duties.  For  example,  a  RICO  case  with  two 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicate  acts:  One  is  a  violation  of  Reg  SHO;  one  is  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  of  State  law.  It  is  unambiguously  clear  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  brought  to  enforce  the  duty  prescribed  by  Reg 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SHO,  and  in  that  circumstance,  that  kind  of  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  wanted  to  proceed  solely  in  Federal  court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The  case  is  submitted. 

 

 

 

(Whereupon,  at  11:08  a.m.,  the  case  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above­entitled  matter  was  submitted.)
