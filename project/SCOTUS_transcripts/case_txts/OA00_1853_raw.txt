CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 00-1853, Akos Swierkiewicz v. Sorema.


Mr. Goodman.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD I. GOODMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. GOODMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This c case brings up for review a fairly


straightforward but nonetheless essential question as it


applies to Federal practice and procedure, namely, whether


or not notice pleading is sufficient with compliance with


Rule 8(a)(2), or whether or not the rule requires some


element of fact pleading to overcome a Rule 12(b)(6)


motion to dismiss.  It arises in the context of a title


VII national origin and an age discrimination case under


the ADEA.  Mr. Swierkiewicz was fired from his job by


Sorema, his former employer.  He brought suit in the


district court claiming that that firing was based upon


his national origin -- he's Hungarian -- and his age.  He


was about 51 at the time.


He pled that there was no valid reason for his


discharge.  He pointed to the fact that he himself had


incurred a history over 2 years of discrimination based on

his national origin and his age, coming from 1995, when he


was demoted from his position as chief underwriting


officer, through and including two successive years where


he was the victim of continuous discrimination by being


excluded from meetings, business decisions, and isolated


and denied any career growth.


The Second Circuit, affirming the Southern


District of New York, concluded that conclusory


allegations of discrimination, what it referred to as


naked allegations, were insufficient.  Some facts had to


be proved, proved via a complaint, because it adopted as a


pleading standard this Court's elements of a prima facie


case in McDonnell Douglas v. Green.


QUESTION:  You don't deny that some facts have


to be stated, do you?


MR. GOODMAN:  I do not.


QUESTION:  I mean, can I come in just with a


complaint that says, I have been unlawfully discriminated


against by my employer, who is -- and I name the employer.


MR. GOODMAN:  I think if you did not identify


the adverse action, there would not be sufficient


information alleged to be able to sustain a motion for


dismissal.  However, even in that --


QUESTION:  That was contained here?  They --


MR. GOODMAN:  Absolutely.

 QUESTION:  You would have to also allege,


wouldn't you, that you were discriminated against because


of your race, or because of your nationality?


MR. GOODMAN:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  And you again say that was done here.


MR. GOODMAN:  Five times in the complaint.  Five


times, so that while I absolutely agree that sufficient


information must be pled, a) to put a defendant on notice,


what is this claim all about, so I can begin the


investigative work of defending it and responding via a


responsive pleading, and ultimately so that the case can


have res judicata effect so that we know what the claim is


that normally, as this Court's precedents unanimously and


consistently have said, notice pleading, and more


particularly, simplified notice pleading is more than


enough.


So we contrast what the Second Circuit did with


three critical barometers.  The first and most critical


are these Court's precedents, starting, of course, with


Conley in 1957, a case brought under the Railway Labor Act


claiming that the union did not fairly represent the


interests of African American conductors and porters.  As


Justice Black, writing for the Court, said, the


allegations were entirely general, but in response to the


union's argument that more specificity, some specificity

had to be alleged, the Court wrote, the law requires


unions to represent minorities on the same basis as


nonminorities.  That --


QUESTION:  Mr. Goodman, why do you start with


Conley v. Gibson rather than Dioguardi v. Durning.  I


thought that was always the classic.


MR. GOODMAN:  Dioguardi is my favorite case,


simply because it has been authored by then Judge and


later Chief Judge Clark, who was the reporter for this


Court's advisory committee.  It was decided in 1944, and


the argument the Government made in opposition to the


complaint, which was a pro se complaint, was simply that


some facts had to be alleged to support the plaintiff's


claims that the Government a) had undersold his medicinal


tonic, and b) had lost two cases of his medicinal tonic,


to which Judge Clark said, no, the time for ascertaining


the facts under the new Federal system, then 6 years old,


was through discovery, and if the case was nonmeritorious,


through summary judgment, but it's enough that this pro se


litigant simply said, you deprived me of my goods, you


undersold my property.  That is the leading case and,


indeed, in Conley --


QUESTION:  That's the leading case?  I would


think you might say a case from this Court were a leading


case --

 MR. GOODMAN:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- as opposed to one from the Second


Circuit.


(Laughter.)


MR. GOODMAN:  I do, indeed.  I do, indeed, and


that's why I started with Conley, but it is interesting


and, I think, prophetic, that footnote 5 of Conley cites


Dioguardi with approval.


Now, in Conley the Court rebuffed unanimously


the claim that some specificity had to be embossed upon


the complaint.  17 years later, in Scheuer, again a


unanimous court then through Chief Justice Burger rebuffed


claims by Ohio that the National Guard and the Governor of


Ohio, who were defendants, were sued on a 1983 damage


claim with only the bare allegation that the National


Guard had done wrong and was responsible for the deaths of


the plaintiffs in that case, rebuffing unanimously the


argument that some facts had be pled.  The Court turned


aside that holding and that case of the Sixth Circuit and,


indeed, said, you do not need to do it in a complaint. 


Notice pleading, as we pointed out in Conley, is more than


sufficient.  You will have sufficient time to flesh out


issues, to learn facts in discovery.


Had that been the end of the trilogy, it would


have been enough, but, as this Court knows, just 9 years

ago, 8 years ago, in 1993 in Leatherman, again confronted


with a similar issue in a 1983 municipal liability case,


the Court had to decide whether or not some facts were


essential to a 1983 failure-to-train case under Canton. 


The decision of the Sixth Circuit, which was accepted on


review, had said in no uncertain terms the complaint here


alleges no facts, none, to support the failure-to-train


case.  In response, the Court, through the Chief Justice,


unanimously said no.  We meant what we said in Conley. 


Rule 8(a)(2) is sufficient if a plaintiff provides


information that puts a defendant on notice of the claims. 


That's all that's required.


If, today, we had to revise the rules there is a


process for doing that and that might result, for 1983


purposes, in a revision to Rule 8(a)(2) such as that


9(a)(2), which now only requires particularity in cases of


fraud and mistake, might have a third entry for


particularity purposes, a 1983 action, for example, or


here.  If, upon proper review and the process of this


Court's committee and its adoption of rules and those by


Congress, it was felt that a title VII case or an age case


ought to also require particularity, that would be the


time and that would be the place to do it.


But I submit that there are two substantial


other reasons for reversal here, and they are bedded in

the Federal rules and have not changed in six decades, and


they emanate from Rule 84, the rule, scarcely utilized,


but is important in this case, which simply says the


forms, the official forms that are attached to the rules,


are sufficient for Federal pleading.  In particular, Rule,


or a Form 5 deals with goods sold and delivered.  It's one


sentence.  Between June of 1936 and December of 1936 the


plaintiff had goods for which the defendant was


responsible, wherefore clause, prayer for relief. That was


deemed sufficient.

alleging negligence.  A defendant, driving a vehicle on


Boylston Street in Boston, committed negligence.  Injuries

drove.


QUESTION:  Negligently drove.  Negligently


MR. GOODMAN:  Negligently drove, doesn't deal


with what the standard of care was, whether it was


breached, whether there was or was not causation.


QUESTION:  Mr. Goodman, if --


QUESTION:  It gave a date.  It gave a date, too,


didn't it?


MR. GOODMAN:  It did.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. GOODMAN:  As we did here.

 QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  If the judge said, okay, this


complaint measures up to Conley v. Goodman, but I don't


want to allow extensive discovery fishing expeditions,


what can the judge do to curtail the pretrial proceeding?


MR. GOODMAN:  Rule 16 gives the district court


considerable discretion to isolate issues, to isolate


discovery.  If, for example, a Rix-type defense was


raised, which isn't true in this case, on statute of


limitations ground -- a professor denied tenure.  The


complaint doesn't mention anything about the date the


tenure was denied, but does say the date employment ended. 


The University of Pennsylvania determines that we know


when the tenure decision was made.  It's not pled in the


complaint.


At a Rule 16 conference it requests the trial


court to isolate that issue, allow discovery to be taken


on that issue, and allow summary judgment to follow on


that issue.  If it's granted, the case is over.  If it's


denied, the case proceeds on full merits.  There are


numerous arsenal of remedies that district courts have to


both curtail --


QUESTION:  Mr. Goodman, may I ask you this


question:  Is one of the things the district judge can do,


is -- you refer on page -- in paragraph 31 of the

complaint to a particular memorandum which your client


sent to the other side, and the other side filed an


affidavit saying, here's the memorandum.  They put the


whole memorandum in.  May the judge review that memorandum


and take it into account in ruling on the motion?


MR. GOODMAN:  Uh -- excuse me.  Not in the


context, I think, of this case, for two reasons.  One, it


was an ex parte submission.  The affidavit of defense


counsel says, I received a request from the district


court.  Plaintiff was never notified of it.  I thought it


was odd that it was made of defense counsel, so there was


no --


QUESTION:  Supposing you did give notice and you


didn't challenge the genuineness of the -- of that paper,.


could the judge look at it in deciding the case?


MR. GOODMAN:  I think in some instances, yes,


but not --


QUESTION:  In this instance.


MR. GOODMAN:  Not in this, because it raises all


sorts of questions of credibility and inference.


Mr. Swierkiewicz, for example, referred to a


hostile work environment.  He work -- he indicated --


QUESTION:  Well, I'm assuming the judge would


resolve all instances in favor of the plaintiff.  If the


judge did that, could the judge look at the affidavit in

ruling on the motion to -- I mean, look at the paper


that's referred to in the complaint and ruling on the


sufficiency of the complaint?


MR. GOODMAN:  I think so.  I think so.  I think


it depends, though, on the substance of the document.  I'm


assuming that authenticity, for example, is not in


dispute.  I'm assuming that all inferences in the document


on a motion to dismiss are going to be accorded to the


plaintiff and not to the defendant.  Assuming that, and


also assuming that the underlying document is essential to


the case, then, I think, under the case law it may be


considered by the district court.


QUESTION:  Well, it must be essential, if you


refer to it in your complaint.


MR. GOODMAN:  Yes.  That's why I answered the


question yes.


QUESTION:  In the Rule 16 conference can the


judge say, I've looked at this pleading, and it passes


under the Federal rule, but I think discovery would be


expedited if you made it much, much more complete.  I want


to file an amended complaint setting forth the allegations


and the reasons for your injury in much more detail.  Can


he do that?


MR. GOODMAN:  I think it is permissible, but


largely an abuse of discretion if the court has stated,

which was implicit or explicit, Justice Kennedy, in your


question, that the complaint satisfies Rule 8(a)(2).  If


the complaint were deemed so vague and ambiguous, to quote


precisely rule 12(e), a defendant could make that motion


to flush out much more factual, or more information, or


regarding either liability or damages, but I would say


except in the most egregious case a sua sponte direction


by a district court who has said, it is my view that your


complaint satisfies 8(a)(2), it would be precisely what


Rule 8(a)(2) and the simplified notice pleading


requirements were intended to avoid, which was a lot of


litigation up front to avoid a disposition on the merits.


QUESTION:  So then the other option is for the


judge to allow discovery to go forward but on a limited


basis and keep control of it that way?


MR. GOODMAN:  Absolutely and, of course, the


revisions to the rules, both in terms, for example, of the


number of interrogatories, the number of depositions, have


gone a considerable way towards that effect in any event,


but the district court has considerable latitude to add to


that.


QUESTION:  Mr. Goodman, I think this case in a


way puts notice pleading to the test.  In the form


complaint that you referred to involving an automobile


accident, you know, ordinarily automobile accidents don't

happen unless there's been some negligence on the part of


one party or the other, but you get hit with a car, and


you know, have reason to suspect there was some


negligence.


But people are fired, people are not promoted


all the time, without any necessary implication of


wrongdoing, and something seems wrong that when you're


dismissed you can say, I was dismissed because I'm a


Hungarian, without having any evidence whatever, and can


bring a complaint and then use the courts essentially as


an investigatory arm to find out whether you indeed do


have any basis for complaining.  I think it just seems --


MR. GOODMAN:  I think there are two responses to


that.  First of all, if the complaint is frivolous or


bought in bad faith, as an officer of the court the


plaintiff's law him or herself would be exposed to


damages, so there's got to be some sort of good faith at


the outset in making that kind of allegation.


QUESTION:  So the lawyer must know something


more than the mere fact that I was fired, and I think I


was fired because I was a Hungarian.  Presumably the


lawyer has to ask the client, why do you think you were


fired because you were a Hungarian?  What makes you think


that was the reason?


MR. GOODMAN:  I think you're --

 QUESTION:  And if you can tell that to the


lawyer, why can't you put it in the complaint?


MR. GOODMAN:  The question is whether or not you


must put it in the complaint, and for purposes of this


Court's precedents, and again I come back to Conley and


Scheuer and Leatherman, the only way that they must be put


in the case, with all due respect, is if Rule 8(a)(2) were


amended, or Rule 9(b) were amended, and if --


QUESTION:  You're certainly not required to


plead the evidence in support of your charge.


MR. GOODMAN:  Exactly, and that was my last


point, and I'll end with it, and that is that the decision


of the district court here in effect conflated elements of


evidence with elements of pleading.


McDonnell Douglas v. Green was a recognition of


what we all know to be true.  Employers do not look you in


the eye and say you're too old, I'm firing you, you're


Hungarian, you are black, you are a woman, you are


disabled.  It doesn't work that way.  That's what


McDonnell Douglas did.  It said, we can find an indirect


way, circumstantially, to come to the same result.  This


is what a plaintiff needs do to overcome summary judgment


or to prevail at trial.


The Second Circuit, unlike every circuit that


has considered the issue, namely,  The D.C., the Third,

the Sixth, the Seventh, the Eighth, and the Ninth, made


you put the evidence at the outset of the case and if I


might, Justice Scalia, much of that evidence is not known


to the plaintiff at the outset.


As this Court has held just last term in Reeves,


the key to the evidence frequently is in the hands of the


defendant:  Who replaced Mr. Swierkiewicz?  Why was he


fired instantly, on the spot?  Who made that decision? 


You need discovery for that.


QUESTION:  You say some of it must be known to


the plaintiff.  It's just not enough that I'm Hungarian,


I'm fired.  I just can't come into a lawyer and say, sue


this guy because I'm Hungarian and he fired me.


MR. GOODMAN:  I agree with that.


QUESTION:  And I think he fired me because I'm


Hungarian.  You have to find something else.


MR. GOODMAN:  And this complaint pleads far more


than that.  This complaint pleads 2 years of ongoing


continuous discrimination based on national origin and


based on age.


Now, I would say that if it said I was fired


because I'm Hungarian, because I'm 51, gives the date in


April 1997, identifies the individual who fired him,


Francois Chavel, identifies five other people who were


fired for cause and got substantial severance benefits,

that that satisfied any kind of notice pleading ever set


up by this Court.  We did more than we had to.


For those reasons --

That to the last was not --


MR. GOODMAN:  Correct.  For those reasons we


respectfully request the Court to reverse.  Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. MINEAR:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The court of appeals in this case clearly erred


in ruling that the pleadings, in this case the complaint,


were insufficient.  The Court's -- this Court's ruling in


Conley v. Gibson makes clear that notice is what's


essential in the complaint.  In this case, the complaint


set forth a short and plain statement of the claim, and it


indicated a request for relief.


QUESTION:  It was nine pages long, wasn't it?


MR. MINEAR:  Yes, it was.


QUESTION:  Can you necessarily say that's a


short statement?

 MR. MINEAR:  Well, obviously the length of the


complaint will vary on the degree of complexity of the


case, but I think that simply underscores the fact that


this complaint was more than ample in setting forth the


necessary elements of a complaint.


What's important about the complaint in this


case is, it did identify both the adverse action that was


involved and also allege that the adverse action was the


product of a prohibited discrimination.  That was


sufficient to put the employer on notice of the basis for


the complaint, and provided a basis for relief if proved


at trial.


The Federal rules do not require that a party


include additional facts that go beyond this, including


what the employer calls here an inference of


discrimination.  Rule 9 makes clear that elements of


conditions of mind, for instance, can be averred


generally, and that includes matters such as intent and


motive, and the Federal rules certainly do not require


that the parties set forth all the elements of a prima


facie case under McDonnell Douglas v. Green.


As petitioner's counsel has pointed out, that


ruling of the Second Circuit basically confuses the


requirements for pleading a complaint, and the evidentiary


burdens that a plaintiff would bear at trial in proving a

disparate treatment case in a situation where


circumstantial evidence was being used.


QUESTION:  Suppose a person simply feels -- he's


been fired, and he thinks his work was good, and the


employer said it was bad, so he thinks, they couldn't have


fired me because my work was bad.  It's good.  What reason


could there have been?  Well, I sense an anti-Hungarian


atmosphere in this office.  That's it.  All right, so they


write that into the complaint right there.


Now, you see, I did good work, he said it was


bad work, he fired me, and I think it's because I'm a


Hungarian, all right.  Good faith.  He believes it.


Now --

automatically get discovery and costs,


quite a lot of money?


MR. MINEAR:  You certainly do not


automatically --


QUESTION:  How could a judge refuse discovery on


that -- on these --


MR. MINEAR:  Very simply, the complaint in this


situation presents an issue of fact.  Was there, or was


there not discrimination, and the Federal rules


contemplated the mechanism for resolving that issue was


summary judgment.  In this case, the defendant's counsel


is free to bring a motion --


QUESTION:  But we're talking about discovery.

How does the judge refuse discovery in my case?


MR. MINEAR:  It may be that a complete refusal


of discovery is not appropriate, but what's important here


is that Rule 16, which deals with pretrial conference,


coupled with Rule 26, regulating discovery, and Rule 56,


dealing with --


QUESTION:  So then, what the Second Circuit is


actually saying is, since the judge can't refuse discovery


in my case, let's go back and look and see what the cause


of action is, and the cause of action is such that my case


doesn't really fall within it.  I mean, I'm trying to


figure out what they're driving at.  It must be something


like that.


MR. MINEAR:  Well, I think that the problem the


Second Circuit discerned is, as Justice Scalia pointed


out, it's very easy to allege discrimination and, in fact,


it can sometimes be very difficult to prove it as well. 


The Federal rules deal with the situation by providing a


mechanism, by providing a procedure.  The complaint is


needed to put the parties on notice of what the --


QUESTION:  Does the complaint, Mr. Minear,


require you under the Federal rules to put in all the


elements of a cause of action in order to survive a


12(b)(6) motion?


MR. MINEAR:  Your Honor, no, it does not, and in

fact this was one of the aims of the advisory committee in


1938, when we revised the rule, to get away from the code


practice of requiring the facts of the cause of action all


be pleaded.  That led itself --


QUESTION:  That's why these rules religiously


avoid determining cause of action.  You do not have to


plead the elements of a cause of action.


MR. MINEAR:  That is exactly right, and I think


that principle is clearly enough established to be


Hornbook law.  We cite a selection of the cases that deal


with this on page 13 of our brief.


QUESTION:  May I ask you one question?  In


paragraph 31 of the complaint, they refer to this


memorandum as outlining the plaintiff's grievances and


requesting -- outlining grievances, then the memorandum


was put into the record by the defendant and the judge


reviewed the memorandum and thought it didn't really show


any discrimination.  He said at oral argument plaintiff's


counsel concedes that there's nothing in the memorandum


from which an inference of age or national origin


discrimination can be made, and if that were true, would


that provide any basis for a 12(b)(6) motion?


MR. MINEAR:  Well, if I can break down this


question and answer it in several parts, first of all we


agree it may well have been abuse of discretion for the

district court to have considered this memorandum rather


than converting the motion to summary judgment where


questions of fact and -- rather than having to take all


the inferences, giving all of the inferences to the


plaintiff, the facts could be waived with regard to the


meaning of that memorandum.


We think that if the memorandum in fact provided


no basis for this suit whatsoever and it was the only


basis on which the plaintiff had premised is claim, then


that might, in fact, be fatal to the complaint, but that's


not the situation here and, in fact, there are inferences


that can be drawn from that memorandum, such as the


reference to a glass ceiling, that could be read favorably


to the plaintiff to support his cause of action.


QUESTION:  You'd have to allow discovery anyway


before you could rule under 12(b)(6), right?


MR. MINEAR:  Under the circumstances of


considering this memorandum, I think it makes it very


difficult not being included in discovery, and I that


means that it should be converted to a summary judgment


motion under Rule 12(b)(6).


QUESTION:  Yes.  That's the difference,


basically, between a 12(b)(6) motion and a motion for


summary judgment, is that the 12(b)(6) is just on the


basis of the pleadings, and the summary judgment is,

presumably you can consider affidavits and depositions


that are taken outside the pleadings.


MR. MINEAR:  That's exactly right, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  That's exactly what I meant, that you


couldn't get rid of the case on the basis of summary


judgment without allowing discovery, so there's basically


no way to prevent being subjected to discovery on the


basis of a claim by somebody who just suspects, with no


reason to suspect, that he has been fired because he's


Hungarian.


MR. MINEAR:  I think that's not, strictly


speaking, true in this sense, that the way Rule 56 is


structured is that if the defendant makes the motion for


summary judgment the plaintiff is under an obligation to


come forward with the facts sufficient to indicate there's


a triable issue.  If the plaintiff does not have those


facts, it can request discovery at that point.


QUESTION:  Well, what is it that -- how would


you describe the standard that's binding on the plaintiff


and his attorney for firing the complaint, going back to


Justice Breyer's question?  You say, you know, I think


there could be something wrong here.  I'd like to


discover.  Is that enough?


MR. MINEAR:  No, I don't think it's enough.


QUESTION:  It has to be well-founded suspicion.

Is there some verbal formulation that floats around the


legal world, in the legal world that helps me?


MR. MINEAR:  I think the benchmark for the


complaint is whether it provides the employer fair notice


of the action.  That's how the complaint --


QUESTION:  What is the standard of confidence,


the standard of belief that the plaintiff and the attorney


must have before starting the action?


MR. MINEAR:  I think that's set forth in Rule


11, and that requires a good faith belief --


QUESTION:  A good faith belief?


MR. MINEAR:  Yes, a good faith belief that there


are facts to support the action.


Now, it may often be the case that the facts are


not --


QUESTION:  Well, you could have a good faith


belief that is entirely erroneous.  I mean, I am sure that


I was fired because I'm Hungarian.  I don't know a single


fact, but by God, I really believe that there are some


facts.  Is that enough -- and he conveys that to his


lawyer.


MR. MINEAR:  Well, this is the important role


that the lawyer and the officer of the court plays in


policing these efforts.  The lawyer himself must make an


investigation.

 QUESTION:  Well, doesn't he have to investigate


the state of mind of the plaintiff to determine is bona

implicit in the good faith, there have to be some


objective basis for the good faith belief?


MR. MINEAR:  Well, I'm not sure if we can fine-


tune the standard here to that degree.  I think the


important point is that these facts, these issues can be


promptly tested through summary judgment, and summary


judgment is designed to deal summarily with those cases


which are not substantial, that are not substantial.


There may be a requirement of some level of


discovery, but the district court, who is -- has the tools


available to structure discovery, can limit discovery to


those issues that are in fact -- provide the --


QUESTION:  Your client says, you know, I can


tell by looking at people whether they're lying or not,


and I think the employer lied to me.  I just can tell.


MR. MINEAR:  For a lawyer, I think that would be


an insufficient basis on which to go forward.


QUESTION:  Mr. Minear, what is the status in


today's trial where -- it's a long time ago, but we used


to make -- see a lot of complaints where facts were


alleged on information and belief, and therefore they


would set them out very particularly but not necessarily

conclusively, but I don't see any information and belief


allegations in this complaint.  Is that approach used

Honor.

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Minear.


Ms. Brody, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAUREN R. BRODY


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. BRODY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


This case presents the question of whether a


plaintiff must allege an inference of discrimination in


order to stay the claim under title VII in the Age


Discrimination and Employment Act.  The petitioner here


alleged that his employment was terminated on account of


his national origin and age.  The district court and the


court of appeals both found that this allegation was


insufficient to sustain a claim, and that petitioner


had --


QUESTION:  May I ask you right at the outset,


because I want to get to -- if the complaint itself,


without illumination from the memorandum that you put in,


was sufficient, would he lose because you create a

different atmosphere from looking at the memorandum?


MS. BRODY:  Your Honor, no.  The memorandum --


QUESTION:  So we can look at the case without


looking at the memorandum?


MS. BRODY:  You can look at the case without


looking at the memorandum, because the complaint alleges


that the memorandum outlined the petitioner's grievances


with the company and requested a severance package.  There


is nothing from that allegation which suggests that there


was any kind of discrimination, and that is sufficient in


order for the court --


QUESTION:  31 is not enough by itself, but there


are other allegations in there to at least raise an


inference, I think.


MS. BRODY:  There are no other allegations in


this complaint that raise an inference.  What the


petitioner has alleged here is generally that he was


Hungarian, that he was a Hungarian -- that he was of


Hungarian heritage --


QUESTION:  No, paragraph 37 alleges plaintiff's


age and national origin were motivating factors in


Sorema's decision to terminate his employment.  That's


pretty direct.


MS. BRODY:  Justice Stevens, that's conclusion. 


That is not permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil

Procedure or by this Court's decisions, including Conley


v. Gibson, which said that in order to provide fair notice


the plaintiff must provide in the complaint a statement of


the claims that gives fair notice of what the claims is,


as well as the grounds on which 


-- 

QUESTION:  Well, why isn't that fair notice, Ms.


Brody?  He claimed the employer discriminated against him


because of his nationality and because of his age.


MS. BRODY:  Yes, he does, Your Honor, but


that's -- Mr. Chief Justice, but that's a conclusion, and


that is not sufficient under Federal rules.


QUESTION:  What do you mean by saying it's a


conclusion?


MS. BRODY:  It's a conclusion that does not set


forth what Rule 8 requires, and Rule 8 says that you have


to indicate what the grounds on which the claim is


based --


QUESTION:  Ms. Brody, why is it any more or less


of a conclusion, any different from negligently drove? 


Form 9 says that's enough, just say negligent -- tell the


time and place and say, defendant negligently drove.  You


don't have to say whether he was speeding, or went out of


his line, or anything like that.  You just say negligent. 


Isn't that a conclusion, that he drove in a manner that


was negligent?  What facts -- flush that out.

 MS. BRODY:  Your Honor, if you look at that


complaint, that Form 9 complaint, which alleges


negligence, it sets forth all the elements of the claim. 


It alleges a duty.  The defendant was driving on a highway


and had an obligation to do so with care.  It alleges a


breach of that duty, which is that he drove --


QUESTION:  I don't see that -- what you added


maybe so, but the form doesn't say that.  It says, gives


the place, and it says, negligently drove.


MS. BRODY:  Those are reasonably inferences that


can be drawn from a very simple negligence action.


QUESTION:  Well, surely the same inferences


could be drawn here, couldn't they?  It seems to me this


is more precise, these allegations, than the allegations


Justice Ginsburg just described about the simple word


negligently.


MS. BRODY:  Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe


that's the case, because in the negligence action when an


individual drives a car into another individual, it can be


inferred that negligence was involved in that.


QUESTION:  You don't have to infer it.  It says


it.


MS. BRODY:  It does say it, Your Honor, but in


an employment situation, when an individual is terminated,


individuals are terminated every day.

 QUESTION:  Yes, but here he alleged that he was


terminated because of his nationality and because of his


age.


MS. BRODY:  There is nothing that connects his


nationality and his age with the termination of his


employment.


QUESTION:  Well, he -- but he says that he was


terminated for that reason.  I think if you want to have


him spell it out in more detail, you're asking that he


plead evidence, which I don't think is required.


MS. BRODY:  Mr. Chief Justice, we are not asking


that a plaintiff plead evidence.  We agree that that is


not appropriate at the pleading stage, and a complaint


does not have to contain any evidence.  All that a


complaint has to contain are allegations based on the


plaintiff's good faith belief that he was terminated


because the circumstances indicated that there was


discrimination.


All that the plaintiff has to allege is some


inference of discrimination, and that inference is not the


employer's reason for the termination.  There are


surrounding circumstances that occur when an employee is


terminated.  It does not occur in a vacuum, and this Court


has identified various circumstances under which the


inference arises.  It arises when one employee is treated

differently than another employee because of their


protected class.  It arises when --


QUESTION:  I thought there was a statement here


that other people who had been -- were not let go, people


for whom there was cause.  wasn't there something to that


effect?


MS. BRODY:  Justice Ginsburg, there is nothing


in connection with the termination of employment that


indicates that the petitioner was treated differently from


other employees.  There were allegations that were made


relating to an act that occurred 2 years later -- excuse


me, 2 years earlier, in 1995, when the petitioner claims


that he was demoted, and he makes various allegations


about other individuals who were of different


nationalities, different citizenships, and different ages,


but he does not connect any of those allegations to his


situation, which is being a United States citizen of


Hungarian heritage.


The problem is that those prior allegations


relating to an act which occurred prior to his termination


and which are time-barred do not have any reference --


QUESTION:  But he can still use them to show


that is the mind set of the employer.


It seems to me that you are asking to have facts


alleged in this complaint which, like it or not, the

Federal rules don't require.


MS. BRODY:  Justice Ginsburg, I respectfully


disagree.  We were not asking the petitioner to allege


facts.  We were only asking him to make good faith


allegations which would give rise to some inference of


discrimination.


QUESTION:  Sorry, then I'm confused, because


I -- you don't -- an inference isn't the kind of thing


that you allege.  An inference is the kind of thing that


you make, so you must be saying he has to allege facts


that would give rise to an inference, or if you -- are you


saying that?


MS. BRODY:  That -- facts, factual allegations.


QUESTION:  That would -- you have -- he has to


allege certain facts that would give rise to an inference,


all right.


MS. BRODY:  That is correct.


QUESTION:  What he did allege was, he alleged as


a matter of fact over 2 years people who he alleges were


factually less qualified and were either younger or not


Hungarian obtained all kinds of advantages that he did


not, and then he was fired because of his grievances, and


a fair reading is that is both a factual allegation, and


grievance refers to what he called -- said earlier in the


complaint, so why don't those facts give rise to an

inference that his -- what he said was the conclusion?


MS. BRODY:  Those allegations import into this


case a concept which has never been asserted, and that is


this continuing violation theory.  The petitioner -- there


are two separate acts here.  There is a demotion and a


termination, and the petitioner is trying to link those by


making the conclusory allegation that there was ongoing


discrimination during this 2-year period, but this Court


has already held in Rix that a conclusory allegation like


that cannot link two separate acts.


What we need to do is look at the circumstances


at the time of the termination of employment.


QUESTION:  Which case are you mentioning now?


MS. BRODY:  Rix v. Delaware State College.


QUESTION:  Was that a 12(b)(6) case?


MS. BRODY:  That was a 12(b)(6) case, Your


Honor.


QUESTION:  And the complaint was held


insufficient?


MS. BRODY:  The complaint was held insufficient,


and this Court refused --


QUESTION:  Well, it was held to be time-barred


because the relevant time was when he lost his seniority,


rather than when he was terminated, and here you're


arguing that the only evidence of discrimination is that

during the 2 or 3 years before they treated the French


employees better than the Hungarian employees, and it's


unreasonable to infer from that that the discharge was


similarly motivated.


MS. BRODY:  That is correct.


QUESTION:  And they say it was, and so there's


an issue of fact.


MS. BRODY:  But it's not a matte of


unreasonableness.  It's a matter of, there's one act which


is time-barred, and there's a second act, and you could


not link them, especially in this particular case, where


the allegations relating to the so-called demotion are


totally directed to the demotion and don't carry over into


the termination of an employment.


QUESTION:  But if even one of them was a good


claim, it shouldn't have been dismissed.  Are you saying


that neither the demotion nor the termination is


sufficiently pleaded?


MS. BRODY:  The demotion claim cannot be


considered because it's time-barred.  The petitioner did


not file an EEOC charge issue within 300 days of that act,


so that is something that is an unfortunate event in


history, as has been stated by the Court in Rix, and it


cannot be used to bolster a claim that occurred, or that


might have arisen 2 years later.  The fact that an

employer, and we don't think he did, may have taken an act


that was discriminated, was discriminatory 2 years prior


to the act that is the subject matter of the complaint,


doesn't mean that the second act is also discriminatory,


and they cannot be combined and put together --


QUESTION:  Well, why not?  I mean, it doesn't


mean, of course, that it is, but it is evidence that it


is.


MS. BRODY:  Your Honor, in certain situations


such as a harassment case where there is -- are continuing


acts of discrimination that occur, that might be


appropriate, but in a case like this, where separate and


discrete acts are being alleged, and the first act was


completed in 1995 -- nothing more happened after that --


there is no reasonable basis for linking these two acts


together and basing the termination on the demotion


allegations.  In fact, to do so would really circumvent


the statute of limitations, because it would permit a


plaintiff to base a present claim on a time-barred claim,


and that --


QUESTION:  Well, does he nowhere allege that his


firing was because he was Hungarian, or because he was --


because of his age?


MS. BRODY:  He makes the conclusory allegations


that I was terminated because of my national origin and

age, but that does not -- that alone is not sufficient to


sustain the claim, a claim, and that is what this Court


has stated in Conley, in which it emphasized that the


plaintiff had to set forth the grounds on which the claim


rests.


I believe that this Court also has endorsed that


view in the other 12(b)(6) cases that it has considered,


such as Rix, such as Sutton, which Justice O'Connor went


through and analyzed the statutory elements of the claims


to determine whether or not the claims had met them.


QUESTION:  What was lacking in Conley?  What was


lacking?


MS. BRODY:  There was nothing lacking in the


complaint in Conley.  In fact, if you look at it, it


alleges all the elements of the claim, and it does so on a


rather specific basis.  It states in Conley that there


were 45 positions that were purportedly abolished that


were held by African Americans.  The complaint then goes


on to allege that Caucasians were hired to fill those 45


positions.  It then goes on to allege that the union did


not represent the plaintiffs in that case and did not try


to protect their jobs, and then it says there's a


violation of the statute.


What the defendant was trying to do in Conley


was to get specific and particular information about what

provisions of the collective bargaining agreement were


violated and other specific information which is not


required, so that if you look at all of the complaints


that have been considered by this Court and even by the


circuit courts, you see that each of those complaints are


sufficient on their face and they contain more than enough


allegations to state the elements of the claims.


QUESTION:  But unfortunately you don't have any


in which we find a complaint insufficient because it does


not contain that detail.  I mean, that's what you need.  I


mean, you might well say all these cases in which we've


approved going forward with the litigation stated a lot


more, but what you need is a case where we approved


granting the 12(b)(6) motion because there was not enough


detail.


MS. BRODY:  I --


QUESTION:  That's hard to find.


MS. BRODY:  I think the case that we have, the


best case that we have to refer to is the Sutton case,


where the Court looked at each of the allegations of the


complaint, determined whether or not the plaintiff was


disabled, and refused to accept the conclusory allegation


that the plaintiff made that she was disabled.


QUESTION:  It wasn't because the allegations


weren't sufficiently detailed.  It was because accepting

the truth of all the details set forth in the complaint,


it didn't state what the Court regarded as a violation of


the statutes.


MS. BRODY:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  I mean, that would be like saying in


this case, well, even if he were -- his age and national


origin were motivating factors in the decision, that


doesn't violate the statute, you have to do something


more, and I suppose maybe you could argue that, that


motivation isn't enough, it's got to be the sole cause, or


something like that.


MS. BRODY:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  There was plenty -- it isn't -- the


Sutton case was not an absence of detail in the complaint.


MS. BRODY:  And Your Honor, this is not a case


about the absence of detail or specificity.  This is a


case about allegations being made giving rise to some sort


of inference, some sort of suggestion, some hint of


discrimination, and there is nothing here --


QUESTION:  That sounds like evidence again. 


There is notice that the complaint is that I was fired


because of my age and my national origin.  Now, it's --


this case comes to us from the Second Circuit, and that's


why I mentioned Dioguardi v. Durning, because even if it


doesn't come from this Court, I assumed that what Judge

Clark wrote way back then is still law of the circuits,


for the Second Circuit, which is why I find it very


puzzling this Court reached the result it did.


MS. BRODY:  Your Honor, if you look at the


Dioguardi complaint you will see that all of the elements


of the claim are alleged in that complaint.


QUESTION:  What do you mean by elements?  I


thought it was, indeed, Hornbook law that you are not


required under the Federal rules to plead the elements


that constitute a, quote, cause of action?


MS. BRODY:  That is correct, Your Honor, but


there has to be something in the complaint that goes to


the heart of the claim and, in a discrimination case, the


heart of the claim is the discrimination.  In a breach of 


contract case, the heart of the claim is the breach, and


if you identify the contract, you identify the breach, you


identify the injury, you have satisfied the elements, or


the essence of that claim, and that is required in a


discrimination case.


QUESTION:  Well, wait --


QUESTION:  And what he did was not equivalent to


defendant owes plaintiff X dollars for goods sold and


delivered on a certain date.


MS. BRODY:  No, Your Honor.  No, Your -- he's


not made the showing that Rule 8 requires, and there's a

reason that the word showing is used in Rule 8.  It


doesn't say, all you have to do is identify the claim --


this is a title VII claim -- and it doesn't say that then


you can follow that by conclusion I was discharged because


of my national origin --


QUESTION:  There's a lot more than that in this


complaint.  It does run on for several pages doesn't it?


MS. BRODY:  It goes on for several pages, but


the facts do not support the conclusion, that is, the


factual allegations, and there are factual allegations in


this complaint, and interestingly, petitioner doesn't


claim that he doesn't have to allege that he was a member


of a protected class, he doesn't claim that he doesn't


have to allege that he was qualified, and he doesn't claim


that he did not have to allege that there was an adverse


employment action.  All he claims is that he doesn't have


to set forth any allegations that would give rise to this


inference of discrimination, and it doesn't necessarily 


have to be the inference.  It just has to be --


QUESTION:  Those elements are not necessary


for -- to win, are they?  They're necessary to establish a


prima facie case that would insulate you against a


preliminary dismissal, but you can win a case without


establishing the prima facie elements.


I mean, suppose I can't show that I'm a member

of a protected class, but -- and I can't show that other


people were fired, but what happened in this case is that


this employer just had a thing against white male Anglo


Saxons, clearly not a protected class, but it was


because -- and I have evidence that will prove that, that


I was fired because I was a white male Anglo Saxon, and


this employer just hated white male Anglo Saxons.  That's


a valid complaint, isn't it?


MS. BRODY:  Your Honor, you would have to look


at the four corners of the complaint and determine whether


there were any other allegations in it.


QUESTION:  No, but you're arguing this case as


though it is an essential -- it is essential to win a


title VII claim that you establish a prima facie case, and


I don't think it is.


MS. BRODY:  Your Honor, I believe under


McDonnell Douglas if you're going to base your claim on an


inferential case that you do need to allege and prove the


elements of the prima facie case.


QUESTION:  Unless you have other manners of


establishing liability.


MS. BRODY:  That is correct.


QUESTION:  And those are questions of fact which


need not be pleaded.  Those are the evidentiary proof.


MS. BRODY:  Your Honor, the word evidence has

been used frequently, and neither the court of appeals,


the district court, or the respondent here is suggesting


that a petitioner or plaintiff must allege facts or set


forth evidence.  All he has to do is have a good faith


basis for making allegations, and if you look at all the


discrimination cases that have come before this case,


going back to McDonnell Douglas, there has always been an


allegation of some inference of discrimination, and


that --


QUESTION:  I've never seen an allegation of an


inference.  I've only seen an allegation of facts, and I


bring this up again because now you say he doesn't have to


allege facts, but I thought your whole case was he did


have to allege facts.


MS. BRODY:  The case is that he has to make


factual allegations.


QUESTION:  Okay.  Then you're saying he has to


allege facts.


MS. BRODY:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And so -- all right.  I don't want to


go in circles, but I want to be sure that you agree about


that.  You're talking about a failure to allege certain


facts.


MS. BRODY:  Yes.  Allegations are based on


facts, and I think that you have to make allegations which

have some factual basis in order to go forward with the


case.


QUESTION:  Well, in addition to what he said, he


also said that everybody else, and he names about 10


people, who were dismissed were dismissed for cause and


given severance benefits, but he was dismissed without


cause and wasn't given severance benefits.  Well, that


seems directly related to the dismissal and, moreover,


reading it in light of what he said before, he alleges as


a conclusion that this shows I was dismissed without


severance because of my nationality or because of my age. 


Why aren't those facts that give rise to an inference, at


least as much as, I was in an accident and therefore he's


negligent?


MS. BRODY:  Because those allegations alone are


insufficient in that he does not allege the national


origin of any of those individuals, some of whom could be


Hungarian.  He doesn't state.  He doesn't allege the age


of those individuals who were terminated and allegedly


received severance packages.  For all we know, they could


be over 50.  There's nothing that indicates that those


people received the treatment that they did because of


their national origin.


QUESTION:  But is that really essential to


pleading a claim for relief here?  I mean, supposing he

had left out what happened to these six people and simply


said that he was dismissed from his employment because he


was Hungarian and because of his age, what more than what


I've just said ought he to have alleged to have complied


with the bare minimum?


MS. BRODY:  What he ought to have alleged is the


kind of allegation that is alleged in McDonnell Douglas,


that is alleged in McDonald v. Santa Fe, that is alleged


in Rix.  All these allegations in all these cases raise --


QUESTION:  But McDonnell Douglas I don't think


was ever meant to be a pleading requirement.  It was a


way, as Justice Scalia said, to survive summary judgment


and get to the jury.


MS. BRODY:  McDonnell Douglas can be used as a


pleading requirement, and it is sensible for it to be so


used --


QUESTION:  Well --


MS. BRODY:  -- because at the pleading stage --


QUESTION:  I think many of us would agree with


you that it would be sensible for it to be so used, but


the rules just don't provide for it.


MS. BRODY:  McDonnell Douglas reflects title


VII.  It incorporates the provisions of title VII, and in


order to eventually prove a title VII case, which is an

inferential case, you're going to have to plead the


elements --


QUESTION:  There's a huge difference between


pleading a case and proving a case, and pleading a case


does not require you to put forward your evidence.  You


could ask pinpointed questions.  You say what was wrong


with this is they didn't identify the national origin,


whatever.  You send a set of interrogatories, get the


answers to those questions, and if they show that


everybody else is Hungarian, he's out of court.


You could have asked for a more definite


statement, I suppose, if you said this is so vague I can't


answer it.


MS. BRODY:  Your Honor, the idea that a


complaint need only allege a conclusion in order to


proceed with discovery and summary judgment and trial --


QUESTION:  This count, Rule 11 -- this person


was represented before the district court, right?


MS. BRODY:  Correct.


QUESTION:  In fact, the same counsel, and there


was a representation to the court made by the attorney


under Rule 11 that says there's a good basis in law and


fact for this charge.  Does that count for nothing?


MS. BRODY:  That does count for something, but


the problem which we're addressing here is that there are

not sufficient allegations in this complaint which


indicate that discrimination has anything to do with --


QUESTION:  And the best case you have for that


is the statute of limitations case, which is an


affirmative defense that, if the time is up, that's it. 


There's nothing -- you could have all the beautiful facts 


in the world, so that statute of limitations, you can


answer the complaint with that and get summary judgment on


this spot, or even, arguably, 12(b)(6), but you have given


the statute of limitations as the only pleading case.  The


others were all cases that plaintiffs won, and you're


searching for language that you can pull out of them to


say, ah, but in other circumstances they would have lost.


MS. BRODY:  I think that if you look at McDonald


v. Santa Fe Trail you will see that the Court there


utilized McDonnell Douglas on a 12(b)(6) motion, and it


examined the allegations in the complaint there to


determine whether or not the plaintiff had alleged facts


which could give rise to an inference of discrimination. 


That was one of the issues in McDonnell Douglas, and that


is a case where this Court applied McDonnell Douglas and


required an inference of discrimination.


QUESTION:  What case are you referring to now?


MS. BRODY:  That is the case, McDonald v. Santa


Fe Trail Transportation.

 QUESTION:  That was a dismissal under 12(b)(6)?


MS. BRODY:  That was a dismissal on a 12(b)(6).


The other case that I would refer the Court to


is Baldwin County Welcome Center v. Brown, which is a case


where this Court held that a right-to-sue letter issued by


the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission did not


constitute a complaint because it did not comply with Rule


8 notice and did not set forth the factual basis for a


claim.


A right-to-sue letter has all the information


that the plaintiff put in his --


QUESTION:  You have to file a paper that's


called the complaint, and a right-to-sue letter is not


that.  You can't go into court and say, here's a nice


letter, court, and I'd like you to proceed.  You have to


have a complaint.  The rules say that.  The right-to-sue


letter isn't a complaint, so I don't think that takes you


very far.


MS. BRODY:  Well, I don't believe that you have


to have a document that's entitled, Complaint, in order to


file it as a complaint with the court.


This Court did not hold that the right-to-sue


letter was not appropriate as a complaint because of its


title.  This Court held that there were no factual


allegations contained in that complaint for which a basis

of the claim could be stated.


QUESTION:  I'm confused.  The right-to-sue


letter would have come from the EEOC.


MS. BRODY:  That's correct, and the plaintiff in


that case took the right-to-sue letter, went to court, and


filed it.


QUESTION:  But that was not the plaintiff's


pleading.  That was a notice from the EEOC.


MS. BRODY:  Well, the plaintiff called that his


pleading, and he proceeded on that as his pleading.


QUESTION:  May I ask you just one question, as


having studied the complaint as carefully as you have?  Do


you interpret the charge that your client was


discriminating against this person because he was


Hungarian, or because he was not French?


MS. BRODY:  Your Honor, that's an excellent


question, and I think there has been a use of these terms


very loosely.  I believe that what he petitioner is


arguing is the latter point, that he was discriminated


against because he was not French, and I believe it was


because he was not a French citizen.  He alleges that


these other individuals in the company were French


national.


In his EEOC charge he makes clear that he


regards them as French citizens and, in fact, one of them,

one of these French nationals is actually of Greek


heritage, so the discrimination that we re talking about


here is really not based on national origin at all.  It's


based on citizenship and, as this Court knows from


Espinoza, that is not covered by title VII.  It isn't a


proper basis for a discrimination claim.


QUESTION:  The case that you cited, Santa Fe,


that was a case that the plaintiff -- where the plaintiff


prevailed against the 12(b)(6).


MS. BRODY:  Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.


QUESTION:  Well, I thought you gave that to us


as an example of where McDonnell Douglas had been applied


at the pleading stage to dismiss the case on 12(b)(6)


grounds.


MS. BRODY:  Oh, Your Honor, I may have misspoke


on that, but the Court --


QUESTION:  So all of your cases, then, are cases


in which the plaintiff surmounted the 12(b)(6) hurdle, and


there's language in that -- you -- for this mythical case


that hasn't yet occurred.


MS. BRODY:  Your Honor, I think that Rix, I


think that Evans, and I think that Sutton area 11 cases


where the claims were dismissed, which assist us in this


case and indicate the kind of notice that is required,


because even though --

 QUESTION:  If I allege that the defendant gave


me a dirty look, I'm going to be tossed out on 12(b)(6),


and I could describe all the grimaces and everything else,


and it won't do me any good because the law doesn't


recognize such a claim.


MS. BRODY:  That is correct.  That is correct.


QUESTION:  That's --


MS. BRODY:  However, that's in effect what this


plaintiff did.  He wrote this memorandum in which he


complained about his treatment by the company.


QUESTION:  I thought when you -- there is


evidence outside the four corners of the complaint, then


you can bring it as a Rule 56 summary judgment motion, not


a 12(b)(6) motion, so technically that, if you're supposed


to look only to the complaint on a 12(b)(6) motion that


should not have been considered.


MS. BRODY:  Your Honor, I think that it is


universally recognized that if a document is referred to


and relied on in the complaint, it is regarded as being


incorporated into the complaint, and it's proper for the


Court to look at it on a 12(b)(6) motion.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Brody.


MS. BRODY:  Thank you.


QUESTION:  Mr. Goodman, you have 1 minute


remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD I. GOODMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. GOODMAN:  Just to follow up on Justice


Ginsburg's comment about McDonald, on the very point


raised, the complaint was sustained and not denied.  At


427 U.S. 283, footnote 11, the Court held that there was


no requirement for particularity as defendant had


requested, and thus sustained the complaint.


Second, and last, in 1953 the Ninth Circuit


recommended to the advisory committee that Rule 8, too, be


amended to add this phrase at the end, namely the


statement in the complaint shall contain facts


constituting a cause of action.  In 1955, the court's


advisory committee rejected it.  It said that it only


requires a general statement.


Thank you.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Goodman.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 12:17 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
