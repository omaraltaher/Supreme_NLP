 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. GILLEY 

 APPOINTED BY THIS COURT

4  this morning in Case 11-9307, Henderson v. United 
5
6

10
11
 There are three primary points I would like 
12  to focus on this morning during my argument.  First, the 
13  question presented by Mr. Henderson involves a very 
14  small subset of cases which are -- which come before the 
15
16
17  the special case in the Olano decision.  They have 
18  errors which, at the time of trial, were unsettled or 
19  unclear; but, by the time they made it to the appellate 
court, they had become clear by a clarifying rule or a 
20
21  decision. 
22
23
24  they come up here?  52(b) applies to every court, does

it not?

Can -- can counsel argue that this Court should 

 MS. GILLEY:  Yes, Your Honor. 
1
2
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So suppose there's been --
3  been no objection to a uncertain question of -- on an 
4  uncertain question of law until the case gets here. 
5
6  nonetheless review the case because, if we agree with 
7  counsel, thereupon, the law would be clear?  When we 
8  issued our decision, the law would be clear. 
 MS. GILLEY:  I believe that the Court would 
9
have the authority to do that because it says if it is 
10
11  on direct appeal or not yet final.  So it would not yet 
12  be final unless the time had expired for the petitioner 
13  to get to the Supreme Court. 
14
15
16  not.  We'd take all -- all those cases where counsel 
17  says, I didn't -- we didn't raise any of these 
18  objections, neither in the court of appeals nor in the 
19  district court; but, if you agree -- if you agree with 
me, Your Honors, that the law is thus and so, once you 
20
21  say that, that will make the decisions below clear 
22  error, and, therefore, you should be able to reverse it. 
23
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I wonder how we would 
go about deciding whether we would take such a case or 

 Makes sense, right? 
 MS. GILLEY:  Well, I believe the Supreme 

Court has, under its own special rules, the -- the

cases, wouldn't it? 

 MS. GILLEY:  I don't believe so, Your Honor. 

still in that window of time, that transition period 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But then what your --

your first answer was that this is a very small set of 

1  ability to take an argument in -- a petition that has 
2  not been raised before, but on its own could accept it 
3  if it is clear at the time --
4
5
6  cases that you're dealing with.  If your answer to 
7  Justice Scalia is yes, this Court could take a case 
8  that's unsettled and, by settling it, make the error 
9  plain.  That would open the door to a huge number of 
10
11
12  I believe that the provisions to get to the Supreme 
13  Court -- frankly, I don't know the answer as to if you 
14  had skipped the -- the appellate court, and -- and we're 
15
16  after the appellate court had ruled, and only then the 
17  clarifying error came, I think you could still come to 
18  the Supreme Court. 
19
20
21 
22 
 But I think, consequent on Justice Scalia's 
23
24  question is, that itself would be another issue in every

in the sense that substantial rights would have to be

case.  Is this one of those cases:  Number one, it was

 MS. GILLEY:  Well, I think there would be 

very few that would come directly to the Supreme Court. 

1  wrong; number two, it's new; number three, is it clear 
2  under all the Olano criteria.  And that would have to be 
3  decided in every case. 
4
 MS. GILLEY:  Well, Your Honor, I think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So at the end of the day, 
5
6  it could be a small subset of cases, but the number that 
7  would be presented, both to this Court and the court of 
8  appeals, would be quite substantial. 
9
10
11  The vast majority of the cases obviously would come 
12  through the circuits. 
13
 And what I was referring to as a very small 
14  subset would be those cases where there is actually an 
15
16  trial. 
17
 There are very few cases that would come out 
18  of the Supreme Court during the period of time of appeal 
19  that would allow for the petitioner to -- to say, well, 
20

unsettled error -- an unsettled claimed error at the

 MS. GILLEY:  It's -- well, this case started 

in 2009.  My client pled guilty in June of 2010.

 MS. GILLEY:  I think that my -- this case, 
Mr. Henderson's case, is unusually long.  In fact, it 

1

3  happens, you've got 2 years of cases, right?

for over a year before Tapia was even decided, and then 
10
11 
several months after that before the Fifth Circuit ruled 
12 
on the issue. 
13
14  I don't think that that's common.  I think the vast 
15
16  transitional period.  As -- as the Fifth Circuit noticed 
17  after Mr. Henderson's case in Escalante-Reyes, they sua 
18  sponte had their own -- they called for an en banc in

8  of that has evolved considerably since I started 
9  researching this issue. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  serve?  Why should the rule not be that if -- if some --
18  if there was an error, and it was a really -- it was an 
19  error that really badly hurt the defendant, then it can 
be considered, even though it wasn't raised at whatever 
20
21  time it has to have been -- it wasn't raised, there 
22  wasn't an objection?  What purpose does that serve? 
 MS. GILLEY:  The purpose of -- of 52(b) 
23
24  is -- is a safety belt for the very extreme measures of 
25

certainly is helpful to -- to the practitioner because 
when you come to the appellate court, and you say, now, 
I have a -- a decision, it is now plain, or I have a 
rule -- a statute, that now makes this plain, it -- it 
is a very important prong in the Olano --

Rule 51, which says if you -- if you fail to raise

 Let me suggest two purposes it serves.  It 

 MS. GILLEY:  I absolutely would.  Yes.  Yes, 

1  contemporaneously --
2
3  why we have -- why we permit plain errors to be raised. 
4  I'm asking why do we require that the error be plain in 
5
6
7  follows from the adversary system, and it serves 
8  judicial efficiency. 
9
10
11
12  Your Honor. 
13
14  those purposes better as applied at the time of trial or 
15
16
17  plain error; is that the question you're --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes. 
18
 MS. GILLEY:  I think that it very much helps 
19
to assess and evaluate the plainness of the error at the 
20
21  time of appeal.  That -- that is where it can really be 
22  helpful.  And that, in fact, is what the Court did in 
23  both Olano and --
24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Does it serve -- does it 
serve judicial efficiency better to say that we apply 

at the time of appeal? 

 MS. GILLEY:  The finding, the assessment of 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

clearly --

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if you apply it at the 

1  the Plain-Error Rule at the time of trial or at the time 
2  of appeal? 
 MS. GILLEY:  I think that it serves judicial 
3
4  efficiency very much better, as amicus very well stated 
in his brief, the example of the Ninth Circuit, where, 
5
6  if you don't have plain error, and then the appellate 
7  court must go back to the trial level, the trial stage, 
8  and determine was this, was this clear at the time of 
9  trial?  Was it clearly against the defendant?  Was it 
10
11
12  time of trial, it may -- eliminate the need for an 
13  appellate court, under some circumstances, to get to the 
14  ultimate question of whether there was error; or, it 
15
16  it's not plain to us, I suppose.  So you have that 
17  efficiency. 
 But if you apply it at the time of trial, 
18
19  you avoid retrials.  So which is -- which of those two 
is more consistent with the purpose of serving judicial 
20
21  efficiency? 
22
23  would be a correct assessment.  I think that the 
24  judicial efficiency would be more at the time of appeal 
25

could say, there might have been error, but it wasn't --

because, as many of the circuits have noticed, that's 

 MS. GILLEY:  Well, I'm not sure that that 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 He has a 50 percent chance of getting it 

right.  And if he gets it right, then the case is done. 

1  what they are going -- they agree.  I think it's -- you 
2  know, 8 to -- 8 to 2 that they find --
3
4  situation in this case, the law is uncertain at the time 
of trial, and there are some circuits that have gone one 
5
6  way, some circuits that have gone the other way, surely 
7  it greatly serves efficiency to bring that situation to 
8  the attention of the judge. 
9
10
11  Instead, your -- your client did not raise any 
12  objection, and the judge just went ahead. 
13
 Now, if -- if the error was plain, you can 
14  say, well, he didn't need an objection, any -- any dumb 
15
16  you make that kind of an exception.  But I don't see the 
17  reason for making that exception, where you could have 
18  brought this to the judge's attention, and he could have 
19  solved the problem; or, if he didn't solve it, maybe the 
prosecutor could have, by making some alteration in what 
20
21  he was demanding as a -- as a punishment or whatever. 
22
 That -- that seems to me such a -- such a 
23  clear efficiency in the system.  I don't know what the 
24  efficiency is when you do it at the court of appeals 
25

judge would have -- would have known this.  Okay?  So

have been affected, don't you? 

 MS. GILLEY:  Well, I think, Your Honor, 

 First of all, I think there -- I think that 

Respondents have conflated the idea of why we have 
52(b).  It's not primarily for the efficiency of the 
judicial system.  It's to -- it's to correct a very 
serious wrong, an injustice that was incurred by the 
defendant.  That's the primary purpose of 52(b). 

1  trouble of going back and figuring out what -- what the 
2  situation was at the trial -- at the time of trial, 
3  right?  But you've got to go back to the time of trial 
4  anyway to decide whether -- whether substantial rights

7  multiple parts to that question.

9  the cases -- the solicitors, the responders --
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19
brings you back to Justice Alito's question.  There's 
20
21  always an injustice when the district court has gotten 
22  it wrong.  The district court got it wrong, applied the 
23  wrong rule.  Justice has not been served. 
24
25

say, we're only going to do justice if it was clear. 

And then, if you look at it the way the 
Court would -- the solicitors would have -- have the 
Court decide at time of trial, there would be no remedy 
for --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But -- but there's -- this 

 But we don't say, we want to do justice.  We 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 Now, why -- why would you -- why would you 

 But if the whole purpose of it is just to do 

MS. GILLEY:  Well, we have the rules going 
back to the Atkinson case.  And the question was what 
happens when we have the very serious Rule 51, if you 
don't have contemporaneous objection, you're out of 
luck? 

1
2  have that limitation on it?  The only -- the only reason 
3  that limitation makes sense to me is -- is because when 
4  it is clear, it doesn't have to be raised below.  The 
judge ought to know better, anyway, and so you're not 
5
6  sacrificing any efficiency. 
7
8  justice, I don't understand the reason for the clear 
9  limitation.  Why should it only be when it's clear? 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17
 And then this Court, looking at the --
18  what -- what was codified from Atkinson, has the 
19  four-prong test.  First, we have an error.  It must be 
clear.  The -- the reason for having it clear, first of 
20
21  all, it -- it creates efficiency in the -- in the 
22  appellate level court.  The practitioner can now come 
23  and say, my client has a clear error.  Tapia has now 
24  been decided, and it is clear.  It was only unclear and 
25

unsettled at the time we were in court. 

Fortunately, we have the safety belt of 

52(b).

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I suppose one answer to 

in turn, is, if -- if you use that rationale, then we're 

 MS. GILLEY:  Well --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It would seem to me the 

1
2  Justice Scalia's question is that, well, if you require 
3  an objection, and you have to have a laundry list of 
4  everything that might change, but the answer to that, 
5
6  just asking the attorney to conceal from the judge 
7  every -- everything that's important. 
8
9
laundry list, even though that's perhaps an initial 
10
11  objection to Justice Scalia's concern, is, frankly, 
12  preferable to a system where we just don't -- don't talk 
13  about what might be clear error. 
14
about clear error.  And -- and I think that in my -- my 
15
16  briefing, in my -- in my beginning to the closing brief, 
17  and certainly in the amicus brief, which is an excellent 
18  source on this point.  When the Court looked at both --
19  52(b) in both Olano and Johnson, they looked to the 
20
21  the clear error that they looked at was they decided 
22  those cases on the basis that the error was clear at the 
23  time of trial. 
24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where in Johnson did 

they -- I'm looking at the para -- two paragraphs the

efficiency. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  I'm looking at 

her opinion, where the Justice did, in a unanimous 
opinion, state in -- let's see, I think footnote 5 --

1  Court spent on this in Johnson.  Where did they look at 
2  the text? 
 I mean, obviously, they quoted the text, but 
3
4  the analysis seems to me to be based solely on judicial 
5
6
 MS. GILLEY:  I think -- and -- and I would 
7  like to refer to Judge Owens' concurring and dissenting 
8  opinion in Escalante-Reyes in the Fifth Circuit.  She 
9  addressed this quite well in three pages of her -- of 
10
11 
12
13  where they talked about this particular question, the 
14  second prong, as they -- they put it.

4  brief, which the errata shows, and so I'm -- I'm not 
5
6
 But the -- Justice Rehnquist looked -- and 
7  he talked specifically about looking at -- at 52(b) and 
8  saying, "We're not going to expand on it.  We're not 
9  going to cut it out of new cloth.  We're not going to

 And I think that was just a couple of lines 
13  after acknowledging the fact that the petitioner said, 
14  well, it would have been a laundry list, and that's 
15
16  But that, I think, was more of an argument that went 
17  along with what the Chief Justice wrote, that we're 
18  looking at the text, and it just doesn't make any sense. 
19
20
21
22  Justice Alito's question for a moment because I 
23  thought -- and Justice Scalia.  I thought, in your 
24  brief, you -- you said that their point's a good point. 
25

inconvenient, and it's futile, and it's a waste of time. 

 We've got Olano that says, at the very 

minimum, the error must be clear at the time of appeal. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I want to go back to 

Their point is that the system works in a way that 

16

But, you said, that's theoretically always 

Supreme Court, and I'll be able to get a plain error 
thing on appeal.  The lawyer who thought that is like 
the unicorn, he doesn't really exist. 

1  requires the lawyer to object at the trial.  Alright. 
2  And that is an efficiency because the trial judge has to 
3  -- has to correct -- he has to -- has an opportunity to 
4  correct mistakes.  He can't be sandbagged. 
5
6  true, but, in your case, as a practical matter, it's 
7  really never true because no lawyer is ever going to 
8  think, oh, I would object, but I'm not going to object 
9  because maybe the law will become clarified by the 
10
11 
12 
13
14
15
16  on the other side is if you don't take your rule, when 
17  you get to the court of appeals, you're going to have to 
18  decide in real cases whether the law was so clear that 
19  the plain error doctrine still does apply at the trial 
level before.  Either it was clear that the judge was 
20
21  wrong, or it was clear the judge was right, and there is 
22  no point to objecting. 
 So now we have to decide, was he clearly 
23
24  wrong, was he clearly right, or was it a middle case. 
And when you get to real legal cases that have tough 
25

 (Laughter.) 
 Okay.  And you then said, on the other hand, 
there’s an efficiency on the other side.  The efficiency

objection.  It goes up on appeal.  And the -- the 
appellate court, there is an argument about whether it's 
a plain error or not. 

1  issues, you discover that that's a hard question to ask 
2  -- answer case by case, court by court.  Now, didn't you 
3  say all that?

 And the appellate court says, first of all, 
14  we think it was an error, but it's a -- it was a close 
15
16  plain, and, therefore, this defendant is out of luck. 
17  What's the justification for that? 
 MS. GILLEY:  I think that the four prongs of 
18
19  Olano are the justification.  That's where I would have 
20
21
22  terms.  What -- what purpose is served by that? 
 If the court has concluded that there was an 
23
24  error, and it affected substantial rights, but it wasn't

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Then why should it have to 

 MS. GILLEY:  But the appellate court has the 

responsibility of applying the law as it is current. 

1  that's too bad?  You know, you really got hurt, but it 
2  wasn't clear until -- you know, it wasn't plain until we 
3  decided this case, so go back to prison. 
 What's the purpose for that? 
4
MS. GILLEY:  Well, there -- there is no 
5
6  purpose for that.  And -- and the --
7
8  be plain at the time of appeal? 
9
10
11  That's what the appellate court is directed to do. 
12  That's what Atkinson -- that's what -- even what 
13  Atkinson said.  You apply the law at -- as it is 
14  current. 
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21 
 People like Armarcion Henderson would never 
22
23  have an opportunity to -- to have plain error because it 
24  would never be clear.  We have to have --
25

And so what you're doing by interpreting 
time of trial as a point of determining the clarity 
of -- of the error, you are completely eliminating the 
ability for the appellate court to even rule on that 
question because there will never, ever be a plain error 
if you apply the time of trial as the point of 
determining whether it was clear or not. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  You could promote efficiency

argument.  You could -- that's -- you can serve 

rights, but we can't say it was plain to us until we 
decided this case, and, therefore, you get no relief. 
And -- and maybe there's a reason for that.  I'm waiting 
for you to tell me what the reason for it is. 

1  at the appellate stage by having a rule like the rule 
2  that we have in qualified immunity cases, which gives a 
3  court the discretion to decide whether something was 
4  clear or go to the -- to the merits of the -- of the 
5
6  efficiency by having that. 
7
 But the Plain-Error Rule doesn't do that. 
8  In the situation I gave you, the court would say there 
9  was an error, it really affected your substantial 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  three-judge panel.  The -- the judge -- the panel said 
17  that the error was -- was clear, as far as they -- they 
18  know it happened.  Tapia said it happened, and -- and 
19  there was no question about that; but, the fact that it 
20
21  Mr. Henderson's ability to get relief. 
22
23  shouldn't put these people in jail for the purpose of 
24  rehabilitation, it was clear -- everybody agreed it was 
wrong, but my client, instead of having the recommended

7  didn't bring this up when the judge imposed that

9
but, before that, there was a statute that says, judge, 
10
11  don't lengthen sentences for purposes of rehabilitation. 
12  And you didn't call that statute to the attention of 
13  the -- of the judge, did you? 
14
that was a -- I knew that there was -- certainly, I was

And so I did file a Rule 35(a) motion 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And let me ask you, I 

don't wish to sidetrack the discussion on the 

1  35(a) motion eight days later.  After I went and did my 
2  research, I realized there was only one case that I 
3  could find, In re Sealed out of the District of Columbia 
4  circuit, which had addressed that particular statute. 
5
6  timely, eight days after, and asked the trial court, 
7  based on 35(82)(a) to please correct that error in the 
8  sentencing.

10
11  metaphysics of the Plain-Error Rule, because it's 
12  important and it's the -- part of the case, but in this 
13  case, there wasn't going to be a new trial.  There 
14  wasn't going to be a new jury.  It's just the sentence. 
15
16 
17 
18
19  Petitioner has not made that; but, there are so many law 
review articles out there right now on ways of changing

So if all that's at stake is a resentencing, 
not much harm is done, and you're more likely to satisfy 
the fourth. 

1  that if it's a sentencing error, that the amount of 
2  substantial rights and the integrity of fairness of the 
3  preceding question is a different balance. 
 MS. GILLEY:  That is correct. 
4
JUSTICE BREYER:  So you can -- if you lose, 
5
6  you can't get through the door.  If you win, you then 
7  have to go on to the next part of it, which says, did 
8  the error affect the fairness, integrity or public 
9  reputation of judicial proceedings.

7  there's a recent case out of the Eleventh Circuit that I

9  Gorsuch.  And his -- his comment was, "This is such a 
serious, serious situation when we sentence a man or a 
10

woman to a time in prison when Congress says he should 
not be there.  That is one of the ultimate injustices 
12

14
15
16  sentencing certainly might be helpful.  It could 
17  certainly be more speedy, although, frankly, in my case 
18  it would not have helped Mr. Henderson because it took 
19  Tapia a year after my client was sentenced before Tapia

 In Johnson, the Court said there was, in

that the error is plain at the time of appeal. 

1  very clear in that it was -- it was certainly -- when 
2  the Court eventually did look at Tapia, they used the 
3  straightforward -- you used the straightforward language 
4  of it. 
But I think that, that the main, the main 
5
6  point -- another point that I did want to make is that 
7  by deciding that plainness should be determined at the 
8  time of appeal, this Court would be consistent with its 
9  holdings in Olano and in Johnson, because in Olano, the 
10
11 
12
13  fact, no error at the time of trial, but it is clear at 
14  the time of appeal.  And so in both of those cases, the 
text of 52(b), which is on page 1 in my brief, the text 
15
16  of the brief is what the Court relied on and the Court, 
17  the Court said that based on that test, it's adequate

view.  I think it's a question for another day how much 
20
21  work the fourth prong is doing in the lower courts, but 
22  I would say in all of these cases, the defendant is 
23  claiming that his sentence was lengthened.  I think in 
24  all of them he will be able to meet the third prong and 
25

issue?  I mean, I've been looking for a case in this 
Court in which more substantial errors than the one that 
occurred here -- we are going to put aside the fact that 
I don't see how this Defendant on the third or fourth 
could ever win, given that he was begging for drug 
treatment during his sentencing, so how a resentence 
would affect the fairness or integrity of this 
proceeding is beyond my understanding. 

 But isn't Justice Breyer right? 
 MR. WALL:  No.  Not in the government's 

show that his substantial rights were affected.  It

 And in the Escalante-Reyes case, one of the 

met and had found plain error satisfied.  But I would 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I would say to you 

circuit courts believe the fourth prong is more easily 
met in sentencing than in trial cases.  Whether they are 
right about that, that's not an issue we are facing 
today. 

1  becomes a fourth prong question then. 
2
3  dissenting opinions attached an appendix in which the 
4  Fifth Circuit, in 181 cases, had found that fourth prong 
5
6  think it --
7
8  that that's more in keeping with the attitude that 
9  Justice Kennedy asked about, which is I think most 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
that rule.  I don't know that other courts have but it's 
15
16  really -- the prongs of the plain-error review test are 
17  meant to serve different purposes.  The third and fourth 
18  prongs are looking at harms to the defendant and to the 
19  judicial -- the integrity of the judicial proceedings. 
20
21  different.  It's designed to enforce the contemporaneous 
22  objection requirement by isolating errors --
23
24  essence of 52(b) is when you don't make an objection.  I 
mean, it's treating two -- it's addressing two different 
25

The second prong is really designed to do something 

 MR. WALL:  The Second Circuit has adopted 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But why?  The very 

28
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  situations; A says when you've made an objection, you 
2  just have to prove prejudice; and B says you have to 
3  prove that substantial rights are affected. 
4
 MR. WALL:  Oh, no question.  The purpose of 
that prong is to isolate out one set of errors, obvious 
5
6  errors, from all of the other trial errors that happen 
7  every day that are not correctable under Rule 52, 
8  debatable errors that even reasonably experienced 
9  district court judges and prosecutors might have 
overlooked in the hustle and bustle of a trial. 
10
11
 That second prong is designed to say, "We 
12  want," as the Court said in Frady, "obvious egregious 
13  errors that the trial court and the prosecutor were 
14  derelict in countenancing."  Because there we are not as 
15
16  contemporaneous objection, because every party in the 
17  courtroom should have known and applied the law. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Wall, why doesn't 
18
19  that describe this case?  In here is a statute, never 
20
21  lengthen the defendant's sentences for purposes of some 
22  cure.  And if the judge was not aware of that statute, 
23  he surely should have been, the prosecutor shouldn't --
24  wasn't it incumbent on the prosecutor to tell the judge, 
25

worried about incentivizing the defendant to make a 

mind Tapia, the statute says to the judge, don't 

Judge, sorry, you can't do that?

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. WALL:  Justice Ginsburg, I think it cuts 

this.  And if the Defendant here had said, look, 

have permitted it, I think a fair reading of the 
sentencing transcript is that the district court was 
genuinely on the fence here about what to do with this 
particular defendant and whether to lengthen his 
sentence. 

1
2  actually exactly the opposite way.  There was a 
3  long-standing circuit split that the Court resolved in 
4  Tapia.  Courts have reached different conclusions on 
5
6  district court, you shouldn't lengthen my sentence based 
7  on rehabilitative purposes.

will be treated according to the new law. 

 And indeed, you're complicating it even 

Chief Justice Marshall and back to the history of 

1  refers by and large to an error that the lower court 
2  judge should have caught, so you should have objected. 
3  But why limit it exclusively to that; that is, you 
4  have -- you know, they quote the Schooner, Peggy and 
5
6  Hammurabi, as far as we know, that sometimes there is a 
7  case where just simple fairness, plus the fact that the 
8  law is now plain, means that the appellate court should 
9  treat this person the same as a thousand others who now 
10
11
12  further for the reason that I really meant my question 
13  to be aimed at you -- you know.  I mean, in fact, the 
14  reason that I said that you're going to create 
distinctions, there will be a case, the fellow is going 
15
16  to go to jail for 50 extra years, the law is plain that 
17  he shouldn't, that didn't come about until the appeal. 
 And here we have six identical people in the 
18
19  circuit where the law was clear one way and they get the 
20
21  another circuit where the law was clear the other way 
22  and they get the advantage.  But in the one circuit

1  at least make up some cases where it's just a horror.

3  wiggle room so that where it's fair, the judge on the

11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  argument about judicial efficiency is an incentives 
18  argument, and it depends upon the notion that a lawyer 
19  is going to change their behavior, a lawyer is going to 
make an objection that he otherwise wouldn't have made 
20
21  if the rule that Ms. Gilley proposes is accepted.  And 
22  this goes back to what Justice Breyer said earlier. 
23
24  following to himself:  I'm not going to make this 
25

same thing the Court has said in Puckett, Dominguez, 
Benitez, Young, the Rule 52 has an interest in error 
correction, egregious error correction, no question. 
But it is balanced against a very important systemic 
interest in judicial efficiency.  And far from being a 
horror, that's a necessary corollary of our system --

 Now, who is going to say that? 
 MR. WALL:  Justice Kagan, it's not just 

1  between now and my direct appeal the law is going to 
2  change, and it's going to change in my favor, and when 
3  it changes, I'm going to be able to make this objection 
4  and get over not only prong two but prong three and four 
5
6
7
8  about incentives.  Even if I granted that the incentives 
9  of defendants would be entirely unchanged no matter what

4  that they should bring to the court's attention, perhaps 
be unaware of a statute that they should have been aware

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Here, that's -- it's the 


saying, look, if you're in a circuit where the law turns 
out to be absolutely clearly wrong, then you don't have

consider whether the matter was clear at the time of

 MR. WALL:  I think Johnson -- as the Chief 
Justice pointed out earlier, the analysis in Johnson, 
5
6  is fairly brief.  The Court did not discuss the text, 
7  history of the rule or this Court's previous cases. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, more than that, 
8
9  Johnson stood on its head, did it not, not to decide the 
case the easy way, which was simply to say if it's clear

the argument presented by the Petitioner here were

that Johnson supports Petitioner's case, I think Johnson 
tends to undermine it. 

Well, it wouldn't be a special case if -- if 

MR. WALL:  Well, in danger of running afoul 

of Justice Kagan, I'm going to agree again.  That's 
exactly the government's argument.  If Johnson had 
resolved the broader question, it could not have set 
aside the -- the question here. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the government had a

 In Johnson, the government called this

studiously avoided placing its decision on the text --

3  distinction an amorphous one.  And it says, "Nothing in 
4  the text of Rule 52(b) contemplates or permits any such 
5
6  It is more faithful to the text of Rule 52(b) and simpler 
7  for the courts of appeals to obviate that distinction 
8  altogether," said the government.

11
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  This Court did not disagree. 
12  This Court took a half step.  And the question before us 
13  is still the question that was before you when you wrote 
14  this passage, you being the government, which is should 
15
16  And you very clearly stated, both as to a matter of text 
17  and to a matter of what's simpler for the courts of 
18  appeals, that there should be no such distinction. 
 MR. WALL:  Justice Kagan, there is no 
19
question that in the briefs and in argument, the 
20
21  government in Johnson asked this Court not to draw a 
22  futility exception to Rule 52 for cases in which an 
23  objection would have been pointless at trial in light of 
24  governing precedent, and the Court disagreed with us on

that.

Alderson Reporting Company

 And the question here is, is the Johnson 

1
2  tail going to wag the plain-error dog?  Johnson rested 
3  on a policy consideration.  They're just flatly 
4  inapplicable here.  This is the heartland of cases in 
which a contemporaneous objection could have been quite 
5
6  helpful.  This is not, as the Court said in Johnson, a 
7  case in which the defendant was being asked to make an 
8  objection that the District Court was powerless to 
9  grant. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17
18  that would help Petitioner is to say it resolved the 
19  broader question of what the text of the rule requires 
regardless of context.  And that's the one reading of 
20
21  Johnson that's just not persuasive on the face of the 
22  opinion. 
23
24  this -- I mean, the trouble is you've run into, like, 
four different interpretations of what Johnson really 
25

genuinely on the fence about what to do, and an 
objection could have been quite helpful.  So to take --
I mean, either the holding in Johnson, which was limited 
and could not have been if the Court had decided on a 
broader ground, or the rationale.  Even taking just the 
rationale, that doesn't apply here. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but the -- the – well, 

The District Court here, I think, was 

 I think the only way you could read Johnson

 So there, we seem to be -- and Johnson 

seemed to me to bear this out; but, sometimes, you do 

Now, that -- reading Johnson that way, I'd

1  means.  And mine, which is, perhaps, no better or worse 
2  than the competing ones, is -- is you go back to the 
3  Schooner Peggy, and you see the Chief Justice, and he says, 
4  in a case the law has changed, the Court must decide, 
5
6  be necessary to set aside a judgment rightful when rendered, 
7  but which cannot be affirmed, but in violation of the law, 
8  that judgment must be set aside. 
9
10
11  forgive the need to object because the overriding 
12  principle is the principle of deciding the law as it is 
13  at the time of appeal, and to do the contrary is just 
14  too unfair.

say, well, that rule applies here too. 
16 
 MR. WALL:  Justice Breyer --
17
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Sometimes.

 MR. WALL:  -- there is no question that that 
19
concern animated this Court's decision -- retroactivity 
20
21  decision in Griffith, and there is no question that that 
22  is one of the concerns underneath the rule.  But if it 
23  were the only concern --
24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it's not. 
MR. WALL:  The rule wouldn't say plain.  As

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Absolutely.  I mean, 

the problem of it doesn't really make that much 
difference to the basic policy of objecting. 

1  Justice Alito pointed out --
2
3  that -- that argument applies to whether the error was 
4  plain or not.  Apply the law as it is. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Yes.  And that's why 
5
6  you make a balance.  And the balance goes -- brings back 
7  the first question that I put.  Because, in this kind of 
8  a case where the law is unsettled, we have what we'll 
9  call the uniform or the hippogriff problem, and that's 
10
11 
12
13  administrative potential mess of having to figure out 
14  how clear was the law in the court -- the district 
court.  Is it a circuit where you'd say the law was 
15
16  absolutely -- is pretty clear that they were right?  Or 
17  was it a circuit where it's pretty clear that the law 
18  was the opposite, in which case we waive the need?  Or 
19  is it actually mixed up and you don't know, in that 
20
21  need.  So I see the unicorn on one side versus an 
22  administrative problem on the other. 
 MR. WALL:  So I -- I want to suggest that

24  the administerability problem is very small because it

3  significant cost on the other side, which is you're 
4  putting on the table an entire set of errors that Rule

it's got to be there to catch something.  And what it is

18  might have missed and catch errors that everyone in the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, it 

highlighted for me in your brief when you said, well, 
Johnson, there was a special circumstance, so they read 
this rule, then, this way.  This is not a special 
circumstance, so we are going to read the rule a 
different way.  Is it because these are rules as opposed 
to statutes? 

1  a discussion if we were dealing with a statute.  I think 
2  there would be a different focus.  Obviously, the policy 
3  concerns would be raised but in a different context. 
 Do you have authority for the proposition

to it.  And then, in our view, that is what the Court 
20
21  did without discussing the tax. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And what about what the 
22
23  rules -- what the rules advisory committee?  I mean, is 
24  it -- when 52(b) was put in the statute, they – they 
cited a case you cite in your brief, the Wiborg – or

And nonetheless, the -- the advisory 


1  Wiborg case.  That wasn't, at the time, error.  It was a 
2  sufficiency-of-the-evidence error, the kind of thing you 
3  would expect the counsel to bring to the attention of 
4  the Court. 
5
6  committee put it in as an example of how 52(b) should 

7  operate.  And why?  They said they put it in there 

8  because it was a matter vital to the defendant. 

9
 So the objection wasn't made, so the 

contemporaneous objection rule was -- was not observed 
10
11  and nonetheless, the Court said, We are going to take --
12  we are going to consider it on appeal because the matter 
13  is vital to the defendant. 
14
15
16
17  squarely within what we all believe is the core of the 
18  rule.  There wasn't sufficient evidence at trial.  That 
19  would have been obvious to everyone in the courtroom 
that the prosecution hadn't satisfied some element of 
20
21  the offense.  There is no change in intervening law like 
22  what we are dealing with here. 
23
24  We think that we've got by far the most natural reading

1  Sotomayor.  I -- it's possible to imagine a case in 
2  which a district court judge was not foreclosed from 
3  reaching some legal conclusion that nevertheless no 
4  reasonable judge would reach.  I just think it's 
impossible to say that that's what Tapia was.  You had 
5
6  courts that had reached different conclusions, and you 
7  had a sentencing practice that had been in existence for 
8  decades.  Now, this Court ultimately found and agreed,

15
16  law.  I think a district court would look at you like,

beyond the statutory maximum, that whatever that

could also get relief for that under Rule 52.  That --
that those cases could -- those exceptions could trap 
each other.

that it should all be at one time, and having said which 
time it should be at in Johnson, and having suggested

things back, where it's some technical matter, where 
he's trying to sandbag the judge, where, in fact -- now 
we have all the Rule 4, the fourth prong consideration. 

 MR. WALL:  Justice Breyer --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  The words mean what they 

say.

 I mean, if we're deciding about that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't understand how 

1  court, the one that committed the egregious error, and 
2  neither Petitioner nor Amicus has advanced any other 
3  textual interpretation. 
4
5
6  you get that from the rule.  The rule says any plain 
7  error that affects substantial rights, even if it wasn't 
8  brought to the judge's attention. 
9
that's the first clause.  And the second clause is, even 
10
11  if not brought to the court's attention, which suggests 
12  that that plain error, that egregious, obvious error, 
13  could have been brought to the district court's 
14  attention; not that it was debatable at the time, and it 
became clearer later because an appellate judge opined. 
15
16
17  excellent argument. 
18
19  contrary. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24

MR. WALL:  Again, Justice Breyer, Johnson 
did nothing, either as a matter of its holding or its 
rationale, to say what the rule requires more generally 
in cases like this one, where a contemporaneous 
objection could have been quite helpful to the district 
court. 

 MR. WALL:  That's right.  Even -- so that 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That is Mr. Dreeben's 

 And then Olano -- rather, Johnson says the

 MR. WALL:  Justice Scalia, you did not join 

the relevant portion of Johnson. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, I didn't?  Oh, thank 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I joined Johnson, and maybe 

believe in the slippery slope.  And we're proving that 
today, aren't we? 

 MR. WALL:  It's fully open to you to agree 

 (Laughter.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It didn't sound like me.  I

2  I have to repudiate it if it leads -- leads to that 
3  conclusion.

 Is our rule -- in your view, must the error 
22  be plain at the trial court stage, or is it enough that 
23  the error was plain at the court of appeals stage for us 
24  to apply our rule? 
25

up, but we have a rule -- the Supreme Court has a 
rule -- and I would like to know how the government 
reads it.  It's our Rule 24, that says we, this Court, 
may consider plain error not covered in the questions 
presented, but evident from the record. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Wall, your time is
