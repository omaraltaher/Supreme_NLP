CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 00-1471, The Kentucky Association of Health


Plans versus Janie A. Miller.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. ECCLES


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. ECCLES:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


When Congress enacted ERISA, it created a


Federal regulatory structure for employers and unions to


sponsor plans that provide health care benefits for


employees and their families.  The vast majority of ERISA


plans throughout the country have chosen to provide these


benefits through HMO's or other managed care entities that


use limited provider networks in order to deliver quality


health care at a reasonable cost.


The Kentucky laws before the Court today


preclude that use of limited provider networks and require


an HMO, and by using that term I mean to encompass a


variety of managed care arrangements, require those


arrangements to allow into the network any provider


willing to accept the network terms.  Because ERISA saves


from preemption State laws which regulate insurance, the


question here is whether these any willing provider, or

AWP laws, regulate insurance.


QUESTION:  Now, I take it these laws have become


fairly common --


MR. ECCLES:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  -- around the country, so Kentucky's


not alone in having such a law.


MR. ECCLES:  Kentucky has a relatively broad


law, Your Honor.  Many of the laws are pharmacy solely,


but they -- Kentucky is not alone, that's correct.


QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Can -- can Kentucky exclude certain


specialties, like they say, we will not have


chiropractors?  In -- in Kentucky, can the plans do that?


MR. ECCLES:  No.


QUESTION:  In other words, they have to be open


to various subspecialties?


MR. ECCLES:  There are -- there are different


laws about that.  The Kentucky law by itself, in the


definition of provider, includes a variety of specialties,


including chiropractor, and there's a separate


chiropractor any willing provider law also, but the


question here is whether that law regulates insurance, and


last term, in Rush Prudential versus Moran, the Court said


that a law regulates insurance when insurers are regulated


with respect to insurance practices.

 AWP laws do not regulate insurance practices. 


They do not affect the risk of financial loss that's


transferred by the HMO policy, they do not change the


terms of the policy at all, and they do not change the


bargain between the insurer and the insured.


QUESTION:  But they -- they do have something to


say about who's going to be available as a doctor on the


plan.


MR. ECCLES:  They -- they change the network,


that's correct, Your Honor.  They -- through a -- they


potentially change the network.  The law itself creates no


change.  If the provider elects to join the network, and


is willing to accept the terms --


QUESTION:  But isn't that a change in the


policy?  Doesn't it give the patient a right he otherwise


would not have?


MR. ECCLES:  No, Your Honor.  It -- it gives the


patient no right he would otherwise not have.  If you look


at the exemplar policy that's in Exhibit C to the joint


appendix, you will see nothing that's changed in the


policy terms.


QUESTION:  Well, there's nothing in the policy


term that is changed in -- in the literal sense of a


change in language, but it seems to me that it does mean


that under a policy subject to a law like Kentucky's, the

person who joins the HMO, in effect the person who obtains


the insurance, has a far greater choice, in -- in effect,


in -- in the expenditure of benefits under that policy


than he otherwise has.  He's getting something under a


policy subject to the Connecticut law -- the Kentucky law,


that he does not get under a policy without that law, and


that is a breadth of choice about who is going to treat


him.


MR. ECCLES:  Not necessarily, Your Honor.  The


choice, you know, exists if the provider elects to join


the network, and it's entirely --


QUESTION:  Well -- well, sure, but I mean, the


point of the statute and the point of the case is that


providers do elect, and to the extent that they elect,


the -- the person subject to the policy has a choice that


is a -- a breadth of options that otherwise are not going


to be available.


MR. ECCLES:  Potentially.  In a --


QUESTION:  Even -- not potentially.  I mean,


even -- even if nobody elected -- even if nobody elected


to join, what has happened by reason of this law, is it


not the case that the term of the policy is changed, that


originally the policy said, we will pay for your treatment


by a limited number of individuals whom -- whom we -- whom


we approve, and that policy is now changed to, by reason

of this law, we will pay for your treatment by any


individuals who want to join our plan.  Isn't -- isn't


that a different policy?


MR. ECCLES:  Not -- the policy does not change


in that way, Justice Scalia.  What -- what the policy


says --


QUESTION:  It's not rewritten, but doesn't the


law have that effect, to -- to effectively change the term


of the policy?


MR. ECCLES:  No -- no, it does not, and the


reason is, what the policy provides is, we will pay for


care from participating physicians, from network


providers, and that is still the policy.  The -- before,


with or without the AWP law.


QUESTION:  Well, to use your term, physicians,


before the law, is defined as those physicians whom we are


willing to accept as part of the plan, and after the law,


the definition of participating physician is any physician


who wants to join the plan.


MR. ECCLES:  It -- it has taken away the HMO's


ability to select, that's correct --


QUESTION:  It's --


MR. ECCLES:  -- but the definition of who -- it


is still limited to participating physicians who meet its


own --

 QUESTION:  In -- in your opening remarks, you


said it doesn't change the bargain.  It seems to me the


thrust of Justice Scalia and Justice Souter's questions


is, it does exactly that.


MR. ECCLES:  But the -- before or after the AWP


law, the participant has no right to choose any particular


provider.  The participant has the right to use the


network physicians under the terms in the policy.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. ECCLES:  After the AWP law, if a provider


joins the network, the participant still has exactly the


same right.  The network has a different composition.


QUESTION:  But -- but that -- that really does


not seem to make sense to me.  The purchaser has the same


right, in theory, certainly to go to any physician in the


network, but the HMO has been required to expand the


network.


MR. ECCLES:  Under that hypothetical, that's


correct, Your Honor, you know, if that's --


QUESTION:  What's hypothetical about it?


MR. ECCLES:  Well, we don't know the effect of


the law on the networks --


QUESTION:  Well, for instance, here, if it's


chiropractic services, and let's assume the HMO did not


previously include chiropractic physicians as providers,

after this law, if a chiropractic physician in good


standing were willing to come in under the HMO, then the


HMO would have to take that physician, and then the -- the


patient would have a possibility, at least, of having paid


services seeing a chiropractor that formerly would not


have been available.


MR. ECCLES:  That -- that would be a


significantly different law, Justice O'Connor, and for


this reason.  In that case, which is generally referred to


as a mandatory provider law, it's very much like the


mandatory benefit laws that this Court has held to be


saved.  That changes the legal rights to get -- of the


insured to get that type of care, and it changes the risk


under the policy.


QUESTION:  No, well, why -- why is what I said


different from what happens here?


MR. ECCLES:  Because the terms of the -- the


network would already provide for chiropractors.  The only


question is how many would come in.  This law would not


regulate that.  That's regulated through other aspects of


Kentucky law.


QUESTION:  Well, it -- it's -- maybe I'm under a


misapprehension as to how the bill -- I -- I thought that


the -- one of the examples given in the brief was, a woman


is being treated during the term of her pregnancy, she

changes her employer, she wants the same doctor to --


to treat her, and she is the one that can initiate the


request to the HMO, please allow this doctor to treat me,


and the doctor then says yes, I'm willing to be bound by


the terms of the HMO, and -- and she has that doctor. 


That seems to me to significantly increase the bargain


that she made.


MR. ECCLES:  But the -- the bargain in that


circumstance, if it -- if it works out that way, she --


she is able to stay with the doctor, but under -- only if


the doctor can get into the network, and is willing to


meet the terms of the network.  It's entirely up to the


doctor to come in.


QUESTION:  Yes, but before the law, the network


could have refused him categorically, even though he were


willing to meet the terms.


MR. ECCLES:  That -- that's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  I -- is --


QUESTION:  I hear you, I just don't see that --


that you -- you make much headway in saying that isn't a


change.


MR. ECCLES:  Because the -- the change is the


legal right of the insured, which was never to any


particular provider, and that's still true after the --


the law.

 QUESTION:  I don't -- you -- you're really


asserting that -- that two insurance policies are exactly


the same, their terms haven't changed, or their terms


aren't different, where one says you can get your


automobile fixed, we will pay to get your automobile fixed


by these companies, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and the


other one says, we will pay to get your automobile fixed


by any company that is willing to do the job up to our


standards, and -- and you think those two insurance


policies are saying exactly the same thing, that there's


only a hypothetical difference between the two.


MR. ECCLES:  I -- I think the difference between


that hypothetical and -- and mine is, the -- the standard


with or without the law is still, if the provider comes


into the network, and you have the right to the network


provider, and that's all.


QUESTION:  The thing I don't understand is, if


your view is correct, why are you objecting to the law?


MR. ECCLES:  We believe that the law


interferes --


QUESTION:  Doesn't have any impact on your


business.


MR. ECCLES:  Yes, it couldn't, Your Honor, it


precludes the plans from limited networks, and what that


does, and this is the point made by the FTC staff, which

has been writing States objecting to these laws, is it


creates an uncertainty in the network, because the bargain


that's been made, the noninsurance bargain between the HMO


and the providers is, it's altered, although the policy is


not, and -- and suddenly, the providers who are in the


network already, they -- they signed up for a different


deal, which was a limited network.  They may not want the


deal they've got, because they'll have less patient volume


than they thought they were getting.


It also adds significantly just administrative


costs to deal with more providers, and it's also more


difficult to monitor quality with a larger network, so it


does have -- it's the uncertainty of what the law's effect


will be that --


QUESTION:  But you're complaining about the --


the increase in the number of providers, and it's that


increase that is what might be desirable from the


patient's standpoint.


MR. ECCLES:  Well, we're really complaining


about the uncertainty that's created, that the networks


can no longer be selective, which has quality and cost


implications, including fee implications.


QUESTION:  The -- the any willing provider


statutes have been around now for sometime.  I understand


the case that you're making in its most dramatic is, this

spells the end of HMO's, because the whole thing works


only if they have few doctors and lots of patients, so the


doctors have a guaranteed patient flow.  Has that happened


in States with any willing provider laws, that there are


so many doctors who are coming in that the doctors who


were in in the beginning now say, the rates have to go


way, way up, because we don't have any guaranteed patient


flow any more?


MR. ECCLES:  I -- I can't tell you about the


number of doctors, Justice Ginsburg.  The studies that are


in -- cited in, particularly in the amicus briefs, suggest


that there's been about a 15 percent increase in cost


arising out of --


QUESTION:  If that's so, I mean, since -- I'm


not sure of the relevance of this, but I mean, if it


turned out that this law or others like it drove up costs


for no advantages, couldn't the Federal Government stop


them by -- under Medicare and Medicaid, wouldn't they have


enough power, or would they, to simply write regulations


such that they won't reimburse States for -- if these


circumstances were quite bad?


MR. ECCLES:  I -- I'm not sure they could do it


in -- in that avenue, through Medicare or Medicaid.  The


Federal Government could obviously do it directly with its


own law on the books, which would --

 QUESTION:  That would require an act of

MR. ECCLES:  Yes, that's correct.


QUESTION:  I want to -- you think they don't


have the authority?


MR. ECCLES:  I -- I don't think it would do


the --


QUESTION:  But anyway, as far as the harm is


concerned, a) we don't know that there's any harm.


MR. ECCLES:  Right.


QUESTION:  b) We don't know that the Government


could deal with it in some other way, and so it's pretty


much irrelevant to our decision, is that right?


MR. ECCLES:  Right.  Right.  What is relevant is


whether, as the Court said in Moran last term, these are


insurance practices, and the Court's --


QUESTION:  Then we're back at Justice Scalia's


question.


MR. ECCLES:  The --


QUESTION:  Is the whole distinction that here


the direct beneficiary is the provider?  That is, the


effect of the any willing provider law has opened the door


to the provider, whereas in Rush and in Ward, it was the


insured himself or herself?


MR. ECCLES:  That -- that's certainly a major

part of our distinction, Justice Ginsberg.


QUESTION:  Is -- is there anything more than


that that -- here, the patient is the indirect beneficiary


of opening the door to the provider.  In those two cases,


it was the insured.  There -- there was no third party


involved.  It was just the insurer and the insured.


MR. ECCLES:  The -- the patient, I would say, is


a potential beneficiary, but without rehashing that, those


two cases, a legal right was created for the insured.  In


Ward, the Court said that was a mandatory contract term


that had been added by using the notice-prejudice rule,


and Rush added the option of seeking external review and


those -- and described it as a legal right enforceable


against the HMO.  Here, there is no such legal right, and


we believe that in order to be an insurance practice under


this Court's precedents, the practice must either affect


the spreading of risk, which any willing provider laws do


not do --


QUESTION:  But that was not true, that was not


true in either --


MR. ECCLES:  That's right.


QUESTION:  -- Ward or --


MR. ECCLES:  Or, as in Ward and Rush Prudential,


must affect the legal rights of the insured.  The -- the


Court has used a formulation of that phrase in -- in many

of its Savings Clause decisions, including those two.


We -- we also think the Court has approached


this through a common sense inquiry.  That's how it begins


the Savings Clause inquiry, and on a common sense basis,


nobody contends that the provider contracts themselves are


insurance contracts, and nobody contends that the


providers are part of the business of insurance. 


Instead --


QUESTION:  Yes, but nobody -- nobody can


seriously deny, on the common sense criterion, that a


person who gets HMO coverage -- whether it's subject to a


law like Kentucky's, is getting a far greater choice,


potentially and, I presume, actually, since you're here,


than a person who signs up for an HMO without the choice


guaranteed.


MR. ECCLES:  But --


QUESTION:  In a common sense way, someone is


getting a different kind of coverage, i.e., a breadth of


choice under the medical coverage, that otherwise wouldn't


be available.


MR. ECCLES:  I -- I think the common sense


approach can be viewed by looking at this Court's decision


in Royal Drug, and particularly if you look at the factual


parallels with this case.


If the Kentucky statute, the general any willing

provider statute can be disaggregated into a bunch of


separate statutes, each about a different provider, that


the term, provider, includes podiatrists, physicians,


optometrists, and pharmacists, so we have here effectively


one part of the statute is an any willing pharmacy


statute, that's functionally indistinguishable from the


statute that was before the case in Royal Drug.


QUESTION:  Well, considered by itself, if -- if


you simply narrow to the provider subcategory of


pharmacists, I -- I assume you're right, but if you look


at the -- at the broad category that is covered by this


statute, there is one, I think, significant difference


between this and the -- and the limited pharmacy coverage


in Royal Drug.  I think the difference is this.  Pharmacy


coverage basically is -- is coverage for -- for benefits


that are fungible regardless of where you get them.


The super-aspirin, the industrial strength


Motrin is going to be the same no matter what drug store


you get it from.  Medical coverage, however, is not.  It


is really important to patients to -- to choose a doctor


because of the personal relationship, and therefore, I


don't see the -- the precedential force of Royal Drug


in -- in a physician coverage; a -- a physician option


kind of case like this.


MR. ECCLES:  But under the Kentucky law, the

patient has no right to choose the family doctor.


QUESTION:  Well, the -- the patient, in fact,


is -- is given in practical terms a breadth of option. 


It's true the patient can't force a doctor to sign up with


the HMO or force the HMO to take on a particular doctor,


but in practical terms, there are going to be more doctors


available under a Kentucky kind of regime, and in that


sense, the patient is given a breadth of options that


otherwise wouldn't be available.  That seems to me to be


important when one is selecting physician coverage in a


way that is not important when one is selecting drug store


coverage.


MR. ECCLES:  I -- I understand the point,


Justice Souter, although the -- the option and the -- the


preference don't match up perfectly.  Even if there is a


broader range of options, they don't necessarily include a


doctor with whom the patient has a prior relationship.


QUESTION:  Absolutely -- absolutely right.


MR. ECCLES:  But returning to the pharmacy, it's


true that the aspirin is all the same wherever you go, but


the -- the agreements at issue in Royal Drug, besides


giving the benefits of pure convenience, the ability to


get the drug at the corner drug store, which is not


nothing, also gave a very important financial advantage if


you -- if your pharmacy were participating, and --

 QUESTION:  Yes, but another difference is,


there -- there is an any willing provider law here. 


There's no any willing provider law in Royal Drug.  There


was a private arrangement among the --


MR. ECCLES:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  -- with the -- the Blue Cross.


MR. ECCLES:  That's correct, Your Honor, but the


effect that the agreements that were being regulated in


Blue -- with Blue Shield and Royal Drug, the Court held


were not part of insurance.


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. ECCLES:  And we have functionally the same


type of agreements here, an agreement between the HMO and


the pharmacy or other provider, and they also should not


be part of insurance.  They're -- they're outside the


insurance relationship, and -- but it was important --


I want to make this point, important potentially to the


patients, the insureds in Royal Drug, that -- that their


pharmacy became a -- a participating pharmacy.  It was not


inconsequential.


QUESTION:  You mean just as a matter of


convenience?


MR. ECCLES:  Besides convenience, Mr. Chief


Justice.  The example in the Court's opinion was taken


from the brief of the United States as amicus.  They

posited a 10-dollar drug at retail, and if you got it at a


participating pharmacy it cost $2, if you got it at a


nonparticipating pharmacy it cost 100 percent more, or $4.


Presumably those numbers are indexed since 1979


now, and -- and greater, but it was of great interest to


the insured whether the pharmacy was participating or not. 


It made a large cost difference, and yet the Court said it


is not insurance in part because it was not affecting, was


not integral to, was not changing the legal rights of the


insured-insurer relationship.


QUESTION:  It's an antitrust case, then.


MR. ECCLES:  That's correct, Justice Breyer.


QUESTION:  I would think maybe that makes a


difference.


MR. ECCLES:  That's argued in the briefs that


it -- that it makes a difference, and we understand it's


an antitrust case.  We -- we still think besides the


direct, factual parallel with the fact that Kentucky has


an any willing pharmacy statute, that Royal Drug is still


the correct analysis for -- it gives the correct analysis


as to the McCarran-Ferguson factors really for two


reasons.  One is, that's what this Court has applied


consistently in its Savings Clause case -- cases.


It -- it -- this Court said in the first Savings


Clause case, Metropolitan Life versus Massachusetts, that

the Royal Drug analysis was directly relevant to the ERISA


Savings Clause, so it has the virtue of familiarity and


precedent, and the -- the standards, the McCarran factors


make sense here.  They're objective factors that give some


content to the subjective test, the common sense test.


But the -- the second piece of -- of the many


attacks that have been made on the -- the relevance of


Royal Drugs in the brief is, it -- it's argued in the


brief that this Court in Fabe took a broader view, looked


to a different clause of McCarran-Ferguson and said it's


broader, that insurance regulation can be a little


broader, and it's geared to protect the performance of the


contract, and we don't shy away from that.  The any


willing provider laws have nothing to do with the


performance of the HMO policy here.  They just do not add


to that policy at all.


It's argued in the briefs through hypothetical


examples that they are effectively Kentucky's regulation


of HMO's, the adequacy of the networks and so on, and we


are accused of wanting to undo all regulation of HMO's. 


That's not our position here.  The line we would draw


would preserve most of the State's regulation of HMO's,


but these laws are not laws that are substantive


regulation of insurance, the AWP laws.  They are not


adequacy laws.  They are not continuity of care laws.

Kentucky has laws like that on its books.


QUESTION:  How would you characterize them?


MR. ECCLES:  I would characterize them as a law


that gives a right to a provider and makes it difficult


for HMO's and ERISA plans, but gives nothing of


enforceable right to the insurers.


QUESTION:  Well, you -- you don't like the


label, insurance.  Would you call it a health care law? 


You said it's not an -- an insurance law --


MR. ECCLES:  It -- it might be considered a


health care law, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct, and in


that case, it would not come within the Savings Clause,


but it's a law that regulates the contracts between the


providers and the HMO's.


Now, just to go back slightly over what I just


said, we are not here challenging the basic concept of


State regulation of HMO's.  Where we think the Court has


drawn the line, and where we would urge that it continue


to draw the line, is to say that a law regulates insurance


if it affects risk-spreading, which this does not.


The risk here is the risk of financial loss from


needing medical care.  ERISA actually has a helpful


definition that makes that clear.  The definition of an


employee welfare benefit plan, which is the kind of plan


we're dealing with here, is a plan that provides benefits

for medical, surgical, or hospital care, or benefits in


the event of sickness.  That's the risk.


QUESTION:  I -- I recognize that we have the


risk-spreading and the factors, and then we have the


common sense test -- we can all have tests floating around


here.  It -- it seems to me that this just does regulate


insurance.


MR. ECCLES:  But it regulates only the


noninsurance relationships, Justice Kennedy.  It -- it's


exactly what the Court held was not insurance in Royal


Drug.  They're external to the insurance relationship, and


they don't change the insurance relationship at all.


QUESTION:  How do you -- what about Metropolitan


Life?  What about -- you have a -- you have a contract the


State says -- I would have thought the harder thing, which


I don't think any more, is, is -- is an HMO an insurer. 


We went over that in that other case, Rush, and it's quite


clear that 40 States regulate them as insurers, so we know


they're insurers.


Now, if any State tells an insurer,


Mr. Insurance Company, when you write that contract, you


have to put in it mental health benefits, isn't that --


that's part of the business of insurance, or not?


MR. ECCLES:  That's absolutely regulation of the


business of insurance, and that's --

 QUESTION:  All right.  Now, here what they're


saying is, you have to put in, use any physician benefits. 


I mean, it's the same question.


MR. ECCLES:  Well, what --


QUESTION:  How do we -- how do you get out of


that?


MR. ECCLES:  Sure.  The distinction is, our test


is, effect the transfer of the risk, and in that case,


there is suddenly a new covered risk, the risk of needing


mental health care is covered by the policy and, if that's


not at issue, and the Court has had recent decisions where


it has not analyzed risk-spreading, found it unnecessary,


it's always looked at the second McCarran factor.  It's


always considered, you know, whether the legal rights of


the insured are being regulated here, are being protected


by the State regulation in the insurer-insured


relationship, and in that mandated benefit case, they're


clearly getting a new legal right which they do not have


under any willing provider.


QUESTION:  But you would not consider the -- the


benefit of having the selection among physicians as a


benefit?


MR. ECCLES:  That's -- in a colloquial sense, of


course, if all these things fall into play.


QUESTION:  So you say it's purely financial.  As

long as you pay the bills, that's the only thing the


insurance was intended to cover.


MR. ECCLES:  If all these eventualities fall


into place and you do have a broader choice, that's


obviously, in a colloquial sense, of some benefit, but


it's not what benefit means under, and insurance means


under the Court's Savings Clause process.


QUESTION:  Well, of course, the -- the criteria,


the way we refer to that criterion under the McCarran-


Walter trio is -- is not in terms strictly of legal right,


though that will satisfy it.  We ask whether it's integral


to the policy relationship, and I suppose something can be


integral -- integral to the policy relationship even


though it is not expressed literally in terms of policy


language which grounds a conventional right.


MR. ECCLES:  That -- that's correct, Justice


Souter, it is phrased in terms of, integral to the


relationship.  However, when the Court has described that


factor in Pilot Life, in UNUM versus Ward, and Rush


Prudential, it's used terms, Rush Prudential, a legal


right to the insured enforceable against the HMO.


QUESTION:  No -- no question that that certainly


is a -- an example of something that is integral.


MR. ECCLES:  Right.


QUESTION:  But I would suppose that the

difference in -- in the kind of policy choices that we've


been talking about would be regarded as a -- by a


potential HMO subscriber as -- as integral to what he is


purchasing when he signs up with -- with one HMO rather


than another.


MR. ECCLES:  Our point -- in Pilot Life, the


Court described the second factor as not satisfied because


the, you know, the cause of action does not define the


terms of the relationship, and we would say, you know,


that has not -- does not occur, either, under any willing


provider.


If there are no further questions, I'd reserve


the balance of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Eccles.  Mr. --


Ms. Johnson, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH A. JOHNSON


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. JOHNSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


As a matter of common sense, Kentucky's any


willing provider statutes regulate insurance because they


are solely directed at the insurance industry.  These


statutes apply only to Kentucky insurers issuing Kentucky


health benefit plans.  Petitioners are insurers regulated


by the Commissioner of Insurance.  The health benefit

plans that they offer are exclusively regulated by the


Commissioner of Insurance.


These statutes are located in subtitle 17A of


the Kentucky Insurance Code.


QUESTION:  But that's -- they could just as well


have been in something labeled, Health Code.  This is not


like -- I mean, things that regulate risk, you'd say, oh


yeah, I'm going to find that in the Insurance Code --


MS. JOHNSON:  That's --


QUESTION:  -- but here, wouldn't it have been --


suppose the law had been written to say that no doctor can


join a closed plan.  It would be the same thing, wouldn't


it?


MS. JOHNSON:  If that law was not in the


Insurance Code, first of all it would not be enforceable


by Commissioner Miller.  Second of all, insurers are the


only entity that builds networks for the benefit of their


insured.  When an insurer decides to offer a managed care


plan, they tie in the network of providers to the benefit. 


Thus, the terms in-network benefit, out-of-network


benefit.  Therefore, if that law was on the books and was


not enforceable against the insurer, the insurer would


create closed panels, and they wouldn't be able to have


any doctors --


QUESTION:  Well, there would be the equivalent

of disbarment.  A doctor, a rule, a regulation of the


medical profession is, doctor, you cannot join a closed


plan.  It seems to me that would accomplish the very same


thing, but it would be in their Health Code.  Unlike some


things -- it can't be that everything that the Insurance


Commissioner does is therefore regulating insurance within


the meaning of this legislation.


MS. JOHNSON:  That's correct, Justice Ginsburg,


but this Court has found that relevant to the inquiry, and


the fact that this is a insurance law that is only


directed toward those insurers regulated by the


Commissioner of Insurance is very important, and it is


relevant, and the fact that these statutes are in subtitle


17A of the Kentucky Insurance Code, which dictates the


benefits to be included in a Kentucky health benefit, and


the requirements for those insurers offering those plans.


The common sense test is also met because these


statutes regulate an insurance practice, and that practice


is the practice of insurers offering managed care plans to


contract with providers for the benefit of their insureds.


QUESTION:  I -- I would -- I would be


sympathetic to your case -- I -- I keep bumping up against


the Royal Drug case, where it seems to me all of the


practical things you say about this case could have been


said there.  The -- the contract really is -- is altered,

the contract of the insured.  Under one situation, he has


to go to a certain drugstore, under another situation he


has his choice of drugstores which may provide lower cost. 


Even if it doesn't provide lower cost, it's a great


convenience to be able to go around the -- around the


corner, and yet we said that, you know, limiting the


number of drugstores with whom the insured could deal did


not affect the business of insurance.


MS. JOHNSON:  Your Honor, Royal --


QUESTION:  How do you distinguish that from this


case?


MS. JOHNSON:  Your Honor, Royal Drug is both


factually and legally distinguishable from the present


case.  First of all --


QUESTION:  I know it is factually.  I don't care


about factually.  Tell me why it's legally


distinguishable.


MS. JOHNSON:  Well, legally distinguishable is


that you're -- in Royal Drug you were looking at one


Federal statute.  In the present case, you're looking at


another.  In Royal Drug --


QUESTION:  Well, now, wait.  You -- you want us


to abandon the -- the proposition that what constitutes


the business of insurance is the same under -- under the


antitrust laws as it is --

QUESTION:  Unless you want us to abandon that,


then -- then what you've just said doesn't make any sense.


MS. JOHNSON:  No, Your Honor.  I believe the


analysis in Royal Drug was -- was appropriate and -- and


accurate for an antitrust analysis as opposed to analysis


under the Savings Clause, which this Court has said --


QUESTION:  So you say the same analysis does not


apply.  You're saying that the McCarran-Ferguson criteria


do not necessarily apply to ERISA.  I mean, maybe they


shouldn't, but that's certainly new for --


MS. JOHNSON:  No, Your Honor, they are relevant,


as this Court has said, but they are not required, and in


this Court --


QUESTION:  They are relevant but not required?


MS. JOHNSON:  In this, in Metropolitan Life this


Court came up with a -- a broader test than the common


sense test, and that test is tested by the McCarran-


Ferguson factors that were developed in Royal Drug --


QUESTION:  I see.


MS. JOHNSON:  -- but they are not required. 


They are relevant.  They're guideposts.


QUESTION:  So the very -- the very factor that

qualifies as -- the very same factor.  Let's assume that


they were factually the same.  The very same factor that


qualifies as part of the business of insurance in our


antitrust analysis could nonetheless qualify as not


business of insurance under ERISA, is that -- is that


right?


QUESTION:  Vice versa.


MS. JOHNSON:  In an ERISA case, this Court


starts with --


QUESTION:  Vice versa means the same.


MS. JOHNSON:  -- the common sense test, and


under the common sense test this Court looks at whether or


not --


QUESTION:  No, but just answer yes or no to what


I just said.  I think you got -- I think you -- I think


you want to say yes.


MS. JOHNSON:  Would you please restate your


question?  Thank you.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  Let's take the very same factor, like


the exclusion of certain pharmacies, which -- which was


the case in Royal Drug.  That very same factor could


constitute the business of insurance under ERISA, and yet


not constitute the business of insurance under the


antitrust laws, because we're applying a different test, a

common sense test.  Is that your position?


MS. JOHNSON:  The common sense test controls in


ERISA preemption analysis.


QUESTION:  So your answer to my question is yes


or no?


MS. JOHNSON:  In your analysis is there a State


law that requires, or is it the Royal Drug --


QUESTION:  Well, in the ERISA case there is, in


the antitrust case there isn't.  I mean, that's what makes


antitrust different from ERISA, I think.


MS. JOHNSON:  Right.


QUESTION:  But -- but they both focus on the


very same factor, the provision of -- the ability of the


insured to select pharmacists.  Now, you say that that


could be the business of insurance for ERISA, and yet


could not be the business of insurance in antitrust cases. 


Yes or no?


MS. JOHNSON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Okay.  I think that's the right --


MS. JOHNSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.


QUESTION:  That's the right answer.  I mean,


for --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  For you it's the right answer.

(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  These -- these are rational judges on


both sides, they both made good arguments, and they both


conformed to some sense of what goes on in the real world,


so what is the common sense test?


(Laughter.)


MS. JOHNSON:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's a


very broad test, and I -- I think it -- it's looking at


the whole picture, and the fact that this law is focused


on regulated insurers, risk-bearing entities that are


under the control of Commissioner Miller, and it regulates


their insurance practices.

 20 years ago you might not have had the issue


where providers -- that insurers were contracting with


providers for the benefit of insurers, but that is a -- a


very prevalent practice in the insurance industry today,


and the State Departments of Insurance regulate that


practice, and in Kentucky it's heavily regulated.


On page 15 of my brief, I -- I set forth many


Kentucky statutes that regulate the insurer's relationship


with the health care provider for the benefit of the


insured.  These statutes were also set forth on page 2 of


the Solicitor General's brief.  That is a common practice


in -- in the insurance industry today, and it's a heavily


regulated practice.


The --


QUESTION:  Also, I guess if you were taking the


view that the language business of insurance could mean


different things for purposes of section 2(B) of McCarran-


Ferguson in here, you'd find support for that in Royal


Drug itself, isn't it, which said that maybe the meaning


of those words in 2(A) and 2(B), although they're the same


words, is different.


MS. JOHNSON:  It is different, and -- Your


Honor, and in Royal Drug was -- this Court made it clear


that they were trying to decide whether an insurer's


practice of entering into provider agreements was --

constituted the, quote, business of insurance for the


purpose of meeting a very narrow exemption from the


antitrust liability.


QUESTION:  Well, it isn't only that.  I think


the statutory language refers to the regulation of the


business of insurance, and in the insurance case in Royal


Drug there was no official regulation, only private


regulation of the agreement, whereas in this case you have


public regulation, so it's conceivable that here you have


regulation of insurance, and there you don't count a


private agreement as the kind of regulation that the


statute's speaking about.


MS. JOHNSON:  That's true, Justice Stevens, and


in --


QUESTION:  That isn't what the Court said


though, is it?


QUESTION:  Yes, it is.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  You can continue with your argument.


(Laughter.)


MS. JOHNSON:  The McCarran-Ferguson factors are


also met.  As the Sixth Circuit noted, the second factor


is clearly met.  These statutes regulate an integral part


of the policy relationship between the insurer and the


insured.

 In managed care plans, provider agreements are


essential.  In managed care plans, and under Kentucky law,


certificates of coverage cannot exist independently from


the provider directory.  These statutes simply prohibit


insurers from arbitrarily limiting the number of providers


that they contract with for the benefit of their insureds.


These statutes allow insureds greater access to


the health care provider of their choice, and I think this


is -- is clearly seen in KRS 304-17A-505(1)(k), which


requires the insurer to disclose that they are willing to


contract with any willing provider.  This simply puts more


control to the insured in their relationship with their


health care provider, which is a very personal and unique


relationship.


QUESTION:  Royal Drug says that the spreading of


risk is an indispensable characteristic of insurance.  It


then holds that the pharmacy agreements do not involve any


underwriting or spreading of risk.  Now, why aren't those


two propositions as -- as true here as they were in Royal


Drug, that the spreading of risk is the essence of -- of


insurance, and that an agreement between the provider of


the goods or services and the insurance company is not


part of the spreading of risk?


I mean, maybe Royal Drug is wrong, but I -- I


don't see -- I don't see how you -- how you get out of

that box.


MS. JOHNSON:  Well, again, Justice Scalia --


QUESTION:  And I don't like the, you know,


common sense test, I know it when I see it.  What I worry


about, the -- the common sense test is that we will


approve those things that we like, and disapprove those


things that we don't like.  I mean, who likes a private


antitrust arrangement that -- that limits choice, so you


just say, common sense, that's not the business of


insurance, and who doesn't like something that enables --


enables the insureds to -- to have a greater selection


in -- in doctors, so we say, common sense says, that is


the business of insurance.


I -- I don't trust common sense.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  I -- I want some rule of law that --


that I can adhere to.  I thought we had one in Royal Drug,


and I -- I'm just not persuaded about why insurance is one


thing there, and it's something else here.  I mean, if --


if, indeed, the spreading of risk is what insurance is


about, then --


MS. JOHNSON:  Your Honor, the Sixth Circuit did


find that Kentucky's any willing providers transfer or


spread policyholder risk.  As the Sixth Circuit noted,


these statutes open --

 QUESTION:  But how does it spread the risk,


actually?  It's hard for me to see that it does that.


MS. JOHNSON:  Justice O'Connor, when a -- when


an insurer sets up a managed care plan and structures


their benefits to be in a managed care plan, they have


tied in the network of providers to that benefit, and when


you have a statute on the books that allows the insured


and the health care provider greater control to continue a


relationship, and common sense tells us that an -- an


insured will seek an out-of-network provider in order to


ensure continuity of care and that unique relationship,


what these statutes do is, they --


QUESTION:  I -- I don't see how that spreads the


risk.  I understand you think there's a practical benefit


to the insureds --


MS. JOHNSON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- but how does it spread the risk,


please?


MS. JOHNSON:  It -- Your Honor, it increases the


risk for the insurer that the insured will not have to


seek treatment from the out-of-network provider.  However,


as this Court has noted, all three McCarran-Ferguson


factors are not required to be met.  This Court reiterated


that last term in Rush Prudential versus Moran.


Unless there's any more questions, I will

conclude by saying that Kentucky's any willing provider

QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Johnson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT


MR. FELDMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


QUESTION:  Mr. Feldman, what would be an example


of a measure which did spread the risk, as that term was


referred to in Royal Drug?


MR. FELDMAN:  Well, I think one example would in


Metropolitan Life against Massachusetts, certainly I think


everybody -- I understand everybody here to agree that a


law that required an insurance policy to include insurance


against a particular risk would spread the risk, but I


think what -- in this case also comes right -- it spreads


the risk at least for purposes of -- of ERISA for this


reason.  What this law is, is a condition on the spreading


of risk, the insurer is saying, we are going to spread the


risk so long as you go to an in-network provider, and the


State here is regulating that condition, and really it's

analogous -- it has to do with the performance of the


risk-spreading.


QUESTION:  So, you're -- you're saying the first


McCarran-Ferguson factor includes a provision that


determines the way the insurer manages the risk, even


though it may not affect the risk as between the insurer


and the insured.


MR. FELDMAN:  I think it does -- not quite. 


I think it actually does -- it does affect that risk,


but I think it's a condition --


QUESTION:  No, but I thought that was the


argument you were making right then and there.


MR. FELDMAN:  It's a condition on the spreading


of risk, or a condition on the performance of the


insurance contract, and in the Fabe case, which was a


McCarran-Ferguson Act case, but involved a different


provision of the McCarran-Ferguson Act than at issue in


Royal Drug and the Pireno case that followed it --


QUESTION:  Well, how, as a practical matter,


does it affect the risk here?  Is the -- is the risk


increased for the insurance company under this law because


it -- under -- under the Kentucky law it has to pay for


chiropractic services, where otherwise it would not, so


that's an increase in the risk?  Is that -- is that your


point?

 MR. FELDMAN:  It would -- I guess -- for you --


it certainly could be -- I think semantically it could be


said to just increase the risk in just that way.  I think


for me, I'm more -- it's more comfortable to talk about


a -- it removes a condition on the spreading of risk.  The


risk would be spread under -- without this law so long as


you go to a provider who the HMO has said we're going to


let into our network, whereas here --


QUESTION:  That's what -- that was going to be


my second question.  It seems to me that's the risk-


spreading.


MR. FELDMAN:  Right, and here the risk-spreading


is so long -- we're going to spread this -- such-and-such


a risk, but so long as you go to any willing provider, and


that's a different condition.


QUESTION:  But it doesn't spread the risk.


QUESTION:  It doesn't.


QUESTION:  I mean, it just doesn't, does it? 


I mean, it's simply an ordinary -- it's -- what it's a


regulation of is, if the risk eventuates, the insurer has


to carry out his side of the bargain in this particular


way.


MR. FELDMAN:  Right.


QUESTION:  It's a regulation of the goods or


services that an insurer provides.

 MR. FELDMAN:  That -- that's correct.


QUESTION:  Now, if you're going to --


QUESTION:  And the risk is a condition, is a


health condition of the patient that will be covered.


MR. FELDMAN:  Yes, but -- but it's really


exactly the same as what this Court faced in Fabe,


where --


QUESTION:  What's the name of the case?


MR. FELDMAN:  Department of Treasury against


Fabe.  In that case, what was at issue was a priority


statute about how to distribute the assets of an insurance


company after it has become insolvent, and it had nothing


to do with the contract as to what -- what risks the


insurer was going to insure, but what the Court said is,


it does have to do with the performance of that contract,


because if the assets are spread in a certain way, the


insurer will actually get paid -- the insured will


actually get paid if that risk results, and otherwise not.


QUESTION:  What -- what if the risk were tied --


the risk is that the patient becomes ill and needs --


MR. FELDMAN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- medical care, isn't it?


MR. FELDMAN:  Yes, and this is a condition on


that, but I don't --


QUESTION:  So -- so how -- how does this measure

spread the risk, or why does it not spread the risk?


MR. FELDMAN:  It -- it operates as a condition


on the spreading of risk, because without this law,


there --


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. FELDMAN:  -- the risk will -- it's -- the


insurance policy says we -- you -- we will spread this


risk among all our insurers.  If you get ill, we're going


to pay for it so long as you satisfy a certain condition,


and what this law does is, it alters what that condition


is.


QUESTION:  Which is to say, it doesn't spread


the risk, so if the other case means you have to have a


risk, then you lose.


MR. FELDMAN:  Right, but the Court --


QUESTION:  But it doesn't -- I thought that that


other case has -- since it involves the provision by an


insurer of goods and services, and a regulation of how,


when the risk eventuates, it is pretty similar, and so the


difference is, what they say in footnote 18, I guess,


which is probably what was going on here, which is that


we're interpreting not the McCarran Act's effort to allow


States to regulate insurance.  We are interpreting what


they call the secondary purpose, and that purpose was to


impose a narrow -- narrower limitation on the reach of the

antitrust laws.


MR. FELDMAN:  Right, and -- that is true, and


the Court repeated that in Royal Drug, and in Pireno, and


in Fabe, in all of those McCarran-Ferguson Act cases it


made exactly that point, and it --


QUESTION:  But is that the key distinction, or


is there another one, too?


MR. FELDMAN:  Well, I think that's the most


important one, but there's a number that are related.  In


the ERISA context, for example, the Court has added -- the


Court said, well, we first look as a matter of common


sense at the insurance policies.  It didn't just say, we


are going to apply the McCarran-Ferguson Act to ERISA, and


it shouldn't be surprising that there are therefore some


differences between the two, or otherwise it would have


been unnecessary for the Court, as the primary test, to


look at the policy as a whole.


Second, in the ERISA context, the Court has


specifically said that not all three factors are necessary


to be found in order to find that something regulates


insurance.


QUESTION:  This is all very sophisticated, but


I -- it just seems to me that what constitutes the --


insurance in one -- in one situation ought to constitute


insurance in another, and it --

QUESTION:  -- it's just common sense.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  And -- and what -- and what we're


doing when we -- when we deny it is -- is exercising


policy judgments about whether we think the -- the


particular thing that's been done is desirable or not


desirable.


MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I don't -- I don't think


that's correct, and I -- I don't think it should be


surprising that there are some differences between ERISA


and the McCarran-Ferguson Act, not only because of the


policy differences, but there's a noted difference in


language between what -- the statute that the Court was


construing in Royal Drug and in Pireno, and with the one


it's construing here.


QUESTION:  So you don't think that the -- that


under ERISA it's important that what is regulated is the


business of insurance?


MR. FELDMAN:  Well, ERISA just says, regulate


insurance.


QUESTION:  I understand that, so you think it


doesn't have to be the business of insurance.  It -- it


could be other aspects of the insurance -- of the


insurance company?

 MR. FELDMAN:  I think the Court recognized that


there can be a difference --


QUESTION:  Right.  Like what buildings the


insurance companies have to be in, and other things?


MR. FELDMAN:  No, but I --


QUESTION:  I mean, once you depart from the


business of -- the business of insurance concept in the


McCarran-Ferguson line of cases, it seems to me, was


essential to make sense of it, and it's just as essential


to make sense of the ERISA prescription, it seems to me.


MR. FELDMAN:  I think it's because of the


difference in language that the Court from Metropolitan


Life on has adopted a different analysis in ERISA, and


there's actually two differences.  One is that in Royal


Drug and in Pireno, which involved the antitrust exemption


that has to be narrowly construed, you were just talking


about a -- a law that is -- that is in -- that is -- the


business of insurance.


In the Fabe case, which involved the other part


of McCarran-Ferguson, which saved State laws in the areas


of traditional, in the area of traditional State


regulation, it talks about regulating the business of


insurance.


In ERISA, you're now one step farther away,


because now it just says, regulate insurance, and I think

those laws are differently worded, and there's every


reason to give them a somewhat different scope.


QUESTION:  Have we ever --


QUESTION:  Have you --


QUESTION:  -- analyzed a case that way in


solving these problems?  Have we ever relied on that


difference in language, Mr. Feldman?


MR. FELDMAN:  Well, in the  -- I think the Court


in the Pireno case, for -- oh, the difference in language?


QUESTION:  Of regulation of insurance versus


regulating the business of insurance?


MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I don't think the Court has


relied on that specific --


QUESTION:  No.


MR. FELDMAN:  -- language in any of its cases so


far, because in most of the cases everything has lined up


and it hasn't had to, but I will say that in the ERISA


cases, there's now a couple of them where the Court has


made clear that all three of the McCarran-Ferguson


actors -- factors don't have to be applied in ERISA, and


the Court has never reached that conclusion under the


antitrust exemption in the McCarran-Ferguson Act.


QUESTION:  Well, that would be ridiculous to


reach it, since the three factors are what the McCarran-


Ferguson Act is.

 MR. FELDMAN:  Right, but by recognizing that


they -- that they're not all -- specifically holding that


they're not all necessary in ERISA, I think the Court


again recognized that there can be a divergence in --


between the two areas.


QUESTION:  And one reason, I suppose, is the


presumption against preemption which we are trying to


maintain in ERISA.


MR. FELDMAN:  That's right.  That's right.


And I -- I would like to add one other thing


about the -- what's been called the common sense test,


which is, I do think the Court has given substantial


content to it in its cases.  It talks about a regulation


that homes in on the insurance industry, or is aimed at


the insurance industry.  It is relevant how the State


codified it because, as the Court said in -- as recently


as Rush, I think, the term insurance acquires its


coloration and meaning from State law, State practice, and


State usage, because what Congress was trying to do was


preserve State law in an area of traditional State


authority, and therefore, the codification in the


Insurance Code is of relevance.


And finally, at the very least, a State law that


affects the contract between the insured and the insurer,


which this one does, has a necessary effect on that

contract and, in fact, a substantial one.  That, although


what is insurance may be broader than that, something that


does satisfy that I think clearly is insurance under


the -- the common sense --


QUESTION:  Mr. Feldman, can I ask you a


question?  Do you suppose, if, in the Royal Drug


situation, there had been an insurance regulation that


required the insurance company to give the patient an


option between generic and nongeneric drugs, that that


would have been the regulation of the business of


insurance?


MR. FELDMAN:  I think it probably would have


been, and I -- I think that would, of course, have been


analyzed under the other half of the McCarran-Ferguson Act


if it was a State regulation of that sort.


That concludes my -- Thank you.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Feldman.


Mr. Eccles, you have 2 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. ECCLES


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. ECCLES:  I'll address four points, if I may.


First, as to the argument that a condition is


removed in the policy by operation of Kentucky law, that's


not true.  Before and after the Kentucky law, the


condition on getting payment from a -- from a


49

participating physician is identical.  All that's changed


is that outside network.  The law, just so I'm clear, does


not, by itself, require a network to admit a chiropractor


when it has no chiropractic coverage.  That's a different


law.  If it did that, we would say that definitely affects


the legal rights of the insured and would be a mandated


benefit law such as the Court sustained.


Second point, we are not -- a comment was made


by counsel for the Commissioner about regulations of


providers providing benefits to the insurers.  Some do,


and those -- the line we would draw, say, if it's a


regulation of a provider such as a continuity of care,


such as a hold harmless provision that prevents the


provider from billing for the balance above the network


rate, that clearly affects the legal rights of the


insured, and would be saved under our test.


Third, Royal Drug, it's this Court's precedents


that have said the Royal Drug analysis is directly


relevant to the ERISA Savings Clause.  It was the dissent


in Royal Drug who said that pharmacy agreement is integral


to the relationship.  You can't have it without -- you


can't have the insurance without the pharmacy agreement,


but that was said in the dissent.  The Court rejected that


view, and who is in the participating network is not part


of the benefit of the insured.  The insured just has no
