CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument

Mr.  Shelley. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ANTHONY  F.  SHELLEY 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

There  are  at  least  three  reasons  why  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  should  adopt  what  the  courts  of  appeals  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

called  the  per­prisoner  approach  under  PLRA 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  1915(b)(2). 

 

            

One,  the  per­prisoner  approach  best  comports 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  statutory  text. 

 

 

 

            

Two,  the  per­prisoner  approach  is  the  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  consistent  with  the  careful  balance  Congress  struck 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  deterring  frivolous  prisoner  lawsuits  and 

 

 

 

 

 

preserving  their  right  to  bring  meritorious  ones. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  three,  the  per­prisoner  approach  avoids 

 

 

 

 

 

anomalies  and  disincentives  that  Congress  could  never 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  intended,  disincentives  such  as  discouraging 

 

 

 

 

 

prisoner  work  by  taking  one  hundred  percent  of  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

income  month  after  month. 

 

 

 

              

I  would  like  to,  of  course,  start  with  the

text.  The  key  sentence  is  in  ­­ the  key  sentence  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second  sentence  of  Subsection  (b)(2).  It  says  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

following:  "The  agency  having  custody  of  the  prisoner 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall  forward  payments  from  the  prisoner's  account  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  clerk  of  the  court"  ­­ singular  ­­ "each  time  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount  in  the  account  exceeds  $10  until  the  filing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees"  ­­ plural  ­­ "are  paid." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  combination  of  that  singular,  clerk  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court,  and  filing  fees,  plural,  indicates  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

per­prisoner  approach  because  it  means  one  clerk  is  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receive  payments,  even  when  there  are  numerous  filing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees. 

            

            

            

twice. 

            

Filing  fees,  the  plural,  appears  in  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  There  ­­ there  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  SHELLEY:  ­­ in  the  statute  exactly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Can't  there  be  more  than 

  

 

 

 

 

 

one  filing  fee  for  a  single  court? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  No,  there  cannot,  not  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  Congress  understood  the  term  in  the  PLRA.  If  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  to  (b)(1)  and  (b)(3),  Congress  creates  it  almost  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  term  of  art.  A  filing  fee  includes  ­­ a  filing  fee, 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  word  "filing"  in  front  of  "fee,"  a  filing  fee 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

includes  all  of  the  subsidiary  costs  to  start  up  a  case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  a  court  of  appeals,  for  instance,  has  a

$500  docketing  fee  and  a  $5  statutory  fee,  and  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referred  to  as  a  ­­

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  what  happens  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  ­­ the  district  court  makes  an  order,  there  has  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  filing  fee? 

   

 

            

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  In  the  district  court? 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Yes,  and  then  that  fee  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  totally  paid.  In  fact,  the  prisoner  loses,  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  cost  award  in  addition.  And  then  it  goes  up 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  court  of  appeals,  where  there's  another  filing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fee. 

            

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Does  ­­ does  ­­ on  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading,  does  the  court  of  appeals  filing  fee  also  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  wait  until  the  district  court  filing  fee  is  fully 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paid? 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  Yes.  There  would  be  an 

  

  

 

 

 

 

initial  partial  filing  fee  that's  paid  upon  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filing  of  the  appeal.  Under  Subsection  (b)(1)  there's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  percent  initial  partial  filing  fee  that  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assessed  against  the  prisoner. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  that  would  be  across 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  board  that  you  always  have  to  pay. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  Always  have  to  pay  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

But  the  second  filing  fee,  the  one  from  the

court  of  appeals,  would  line  up.  So  the  first  filing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fee  from  the  district  court  would  be  paid  off  first,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  sequentially  the  court  of  appeals  would  be  paid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

off,  but  only  20  percent  would  be  taken  every  month  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  prisoner.  You  wouldn't  take  40  percent. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  If  he  files  enough  cases, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

he's  never  going  to  have  to  pay  for  it,  right?  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  he  files  20  cases,  that  20  percent  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never  ­­ will  never  come  home  to  roost. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  ­­ what's  the  disincentive  for  him  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  his  continuing  to  file  cases? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  Well,  first  of  all,  it  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  to  roost  back  in  1995  when  Congress  enacted  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  because  the  filing  fee  for  a  district  court  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  only  $120,  and  a  court  of  appeals  was  105.  And  so  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prisoner  who  earned,  say,  55  or  100  ­­ 50  or  $100  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

month,  which  is  not  outlandish  given  the  small  wages, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  pay  off  a  filing  fee  in  a  ­­ in  a  matter  of  months 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  that.  It's  much  higher  now. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

But  to  get  to  the  rest  of  your  question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Scalia,  there  are  a  number  of  other  things  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  that  work  in  tandem  with  (b)(2)  to  stop  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  behavior.  So  there's  the  initial  partial  filing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fee.  He  or  she  is  always  going  to  have  to  pay  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's  the  three­strikes  rule,  which  comes  into  being.

There's  the  ability  of  the  district  court  or  court  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals  to  sui  sponte  dismiss  under  the  PLRA  those  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  frivolous. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  All  right.  So  ­­ so  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

say  there  are  disincentives,  but  this  was  intended  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  disincentive.  Was  this  not  intended  to  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disincentive? 

            

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  It  was  and  it  is. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I'm  pointing  out  that  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  very  ineffective  disincentive  if  the  person  keeps 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filing  a  lot  of  cases. 

   

 

 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  Well,  it's  not  an  ineffective 

  

 

 

 

 

 

disincentive  because  it  creates  months  and  months  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  additional  income  being  garnished.  So  it  lines  up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  others.  None  of  them  were  anticipated  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholly  barriers  to  filing  a  lawsuit.  And  this  one,  as 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  others,  creates  a  whole  scheme  where  there  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

added  disincentives. 

 

            

But  Congress  also  wanted  to  make  sure  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meritorious  cases  would  be  brought.  And  so  it  didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  be  overwhelming  and  put  ­­ and  put  the  thumb  too 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  on  the  scale  to  kill  all  of  those  cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Shelley,  can  we  go  back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  sentence  that  you're  relying  on,  because  I  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  admit  I  don't  understand  your  reading.  The  ­­ the

sentence  says  ­­ and  I'm  taking  out  some  unnecessary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words.  It  says,  the  agency  shall  forward  payments  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  clerk,  singular,  until  the  filing  fees  are  paid. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  that  makes  perfect  sense  if  the  filing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees  are  all  in  one  case,  going  to  a  single  clerk.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you're  right  and  what  they  mean  is  the  filing  fees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  in  multiple  cases,  then  it  doesn't  make  sense  to  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  agency  shall  forward  payments  to  the  clerk. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  only  way  to  make  that  sentence  makes  sense,  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filing  fees  are  in  multiple  cases,  is  for  Congress  ­­ is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  statute  to  have  read,  the  agency  shall  forward 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payments  to  many  clerks  or  to  several  clerks  seriatim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that  suggests  not  the  per­prisoner  approach,  but  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

per­case  approach. 

 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  I  think  that's  incorrect 

    

 

 

 

because  I  think  what  ­­ what  you  should  insert,  if  ­­ if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary,  in  front  of  the  clerk  of  the  court  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant  clerk  of  the  court.  So  the  prison  officials 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  going  to  distribute  to  the  relevant  clerk  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  then  ­­ so  that  ­­ that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  right,  to  make  the  sentence  work  the  way  you  want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  to  work  ­­ and  this  is  the  sentence  you  are  relying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on.  To  make  it  work  the  way  you  want  it  to  work,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  add  language  to  it.

shall  forward  payment  to  the  relevant  clerk  until 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

multiple  filing  fees  are  paid."  It's  just  ­­ it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  ­­ the  two  halves  of  the  sentence  don't  connect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there. 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  Well,  the  filing  fee's  plural. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

It  ­­ it  can't  allow  for  the  ­­ for  the  per­case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach,  the  opposite  approach,  because  filing  fees  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  means  more  than  one.  And  so  it  has  to  mean  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  one,  because  in  (b)(1)  and  (b)(3)  Congress  used 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  term  of  art  to  mean  filing  fee  encompasses.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  thing  that  comprises  all  of  the  other  fees. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  I  would  say  that  the  opposite  side  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  one  that  cannot  make  any  textual  sense  out  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence,  because  there's  never  more  than  one  filing  fee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  a  ­­ to  a  single  clerk. 

   

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  but  Congress  doesn't

know  that.  Congress  just  thinks  fees  in  a  case,  fees  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  case.  So  then  it  makes  perfect  sense.  Give  the  fees 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  case  to  the  clerk.  But  you're  saying  give  fees  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

multiple  cases  to  the  clerk,  when  it's  not.  It's  give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees  to  ­­ in  multiple  cases  to  multiple  clerks. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

MR.  SHELLEY:  It's  give  the  fee  to  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

clerk  that  that  clerk  is  owed  until  all  the  fees  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paid.  You  keep  going  back  to  a  clerk  until  all  the  fees 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  paid.  So  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Isn't  ­­ isn't  the 

  

 

 

 

 

statute  drafted,  though,  that  with  a  single­case  focus, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  is,  1915  throughout,  talks  about  an  action? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  Not  ­­ not  true.  First  of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

all,  the  whole  purpose  of  the  statute  was  to  deal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  ­­ with  multiple  filers.  So  the  whole  ­­ Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes  into  it  with  a  purpose  of  dealing  with  individuals 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  file  many  cases. 

 

 

 

            

But  second  of  all,  the  three­strikes  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assumes  numerous  cases.  And  I'd  also  point  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  1915(d),  which  has  the  statutory  language,  "The 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officers  of  the  court  shall  issue  and  serve  all  process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  perform  all  duties  in  such  cases." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  there  are  references  to  more  than  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  in  various  plays.  But  even  if  it  was  written  in  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

singular  way,  in  a  way  to  deal  only  with  one  case,  that

really  doesn't  prove  anything  against  us.  It  just  means 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  got  to  look  to  other  statutory  construction  tools, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  would  just  say  that  there's  going  to  be  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

initial  partial  filing  fee  in  every  case.  And  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needs  to  be  installment  payments  in  every  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  don't  disagree  with  that.  We  agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  are  installment  payments  in  every  case,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  just  a  matter  of  when.  And  the  statute  doesn't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer  when,  necessarily,  right  off  the  bat. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  why  is  the  initial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

fee  ­­ the  initial  partial  fee,  you  say  each  time  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

file  it,  you've  got  to  pay  that?  Why  shouldn't  that  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  way? 

 

 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  Well,  the  ­­ the  two  sections 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  written  differently.  (b)(1)  is  very  different  from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)(2).  It's  a  different  collector.  One  is  the  prison 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

official.  The  other  is  the  clerk  of  the  court.  One 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentions  filing  fees,  plural.  The  other  only  mentions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

filing  fee,  singular.  There's  a  $10  rule  in  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

second  ­­ in  the  second  ­­ in  (b)(2)  but  not  in  (b)(1). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  they  ­­ they  are  a  little  bit  different. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  even  if  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  If  you  don't  know  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  I  can't  get  anything  out  of  the  second  sentence, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  tell  you  the  truth,  because  I  think  that  a  prison  is

usually  within  a  single  district.  And  so  when  you're 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

worried  about  a  multiple  filer,  what  he  does  is  he  files 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  15  cases  in  the  same  court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  therefore,  it's  perfectly 

 

 

 

 

 

understandable  why  Congress  would  refer  to  multiple 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees,  because  they  are  going  to  be  like  ten  of  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  the  people  they  are  really  worried  about  are  ­­ are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's  at  issue.  So  I  can't  get  anything  out  of  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second  sentence. 

 

            

It's  the  first  sentence  that  ­­ that  is,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  to  me,  both  your  strength  and  your  weakness. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  it  talks  about  after  payments  of  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

initial  partial  filing  fee.  Okay.  It  sounds  as  if  it's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  a  case.  And  so  what  do  we  do  about  that? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  there  it  is.  "After  the  initial  partial  filing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fee,  the  prisoner  shall  be  required  to  make  monthly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payments  of  20  percent,"  et  cetera.  That's  where  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  the  word  "fee." 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  Well,  first  of  all,  I  don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think  Congress  necessarily  had  in  mind  a  prisoner  who  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filing  numerous  cases  in  the  same  court,  because  if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  up  to  (a)(2),  for  instance,  it  talks  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prisoner  having  to  file  a  statement  of  his  indigency. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  Congress  talked  about  it  needed  to  be  obtained  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  appropriate  official  of  each  prison  at  which  the

prisoner  is  or  was  confined. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  government  concedes  that  prisoners 

 

 

 

 

 

are  moved  around  all  the  time,  and  therefore,  there  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

numerous  districts  ­­

 

 

            

exclusive. 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  don't  mean  it's 

    

 

 

 

MR.  SHELLEY:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'm  just  giving  you  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

explanation  as  to  why  they  might  have  used  the  words 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"fees,"  even  though  they  previously  defined  a  filing  fee 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  $350. 

 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  So  then  let's  go  to  that  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  in  ­­ in  the  statutory  text  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsection  (b)(2).  We  don't  disagree  that  after  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

partial  filing  fee  is  assessed,  the  installment  payments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  also  start  to  kick  in.  It's  just  a  matter  of  do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  line  up  or  do  they  ­­ or  do  they  come  first. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  don't  think  under  that  ­­ I  don't  think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

(b)  ­­ (b)(2)  in  that  first  sentence  then  would  answer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question.  It  ­­ under  our  theory,  you  also  get  a  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  also  get  an  installment  payment  after  the  payment  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  initial  partial  filing  fee. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  In  terms  of  one  of  your

no  circumstance  can  a  fee  20  percent  be  taken  until  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless  it's  above  $10?  Why  doesn't  that  take  care  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  problem? 

 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  Because  I  don't  think  the 

   

  

 

 

 

government's  position  is  ­­ is  statutory  allowed.  So  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  take  a  situation  where,  let's  say  $11  was  earned  by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  prisoner  the  ­­ the  previous  month,  and  that's  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  in  the  account.  In  that  case  you'd  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  ­­ under  the  statute,  you  meet  the  statutory  terms. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's  $10  in  ­­ in  the  account,  and  you  have  to  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  percent.  "Shall"  is  the  word.  Shall  take  20  percent 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  there's  over  $10.  Well,  there's  $11  in  there.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  would  say,  we're  not  going  to  take  the  20 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent  because  it's  going  to  send  it  under  $10.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  can't  work  out. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  No,  what  the 

  

 

 

 

government  ­­ I  understand  ­­ and  they'll  correct  me  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  I  think  they  are  saying  that  if  you  pay  a  ­­ the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

initial  filing  fee,  and  you're  down  to  $8,  they  can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  another  10  ­­ another  20  percent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  Sure.  Well,  that's  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  how  I  understood 

   

  

 

 

their  concession. 

 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  So  that  was  their  alternative 

  

 

 

 

 

 

position.  But  even  that  one  won't  hurt  our  purposes

argument,  because  if  you  take  a  prisoner  who  now,  let's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  he  has  $55  in  income.  And  that's  not  outlandish 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  if  you  earn  35  cents  an  hour  and  you  work  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40­hour  week,  you  have  $55.  In  that  situation,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  four  encumbrances  will  take  $11  each,  $44,  leaving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  at  $11.  The  last  one  is  going  to  take  the  whole 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount,  cause  you  have  got  a  fifth  encumbrance  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  over  $10. 

 

 

            

So  under  even  this  alternative  approach,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  100  percent  of  the  income  every  time  the  income  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  than  $55.  Maybe  I  should  go  through  that  again. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Okay.  So  ­­

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  If  you're  clarifying  it, 

  

 

 

 

 

$11,  I  guess  you'd  take  a  dollar.  All  right.  I  mean, 

    

   

   

  

 

 

 

what's  unclear? 

 

            

take  10. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  If  you're  at  55,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  SHELLEY:  The  statute  says  20  percent  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  exceeds  $10.  So  if  you  have  $11  in  there  after 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ after  the  fourth  one,  you  have  to  take  the  fifth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  percent  increment  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  They  can't  administer  it 

  

 

 

 

 

that  way.  I  mean,  is  there  somebody  who  is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

administering  this  that  way?

MR.  SHELLEY:  As  far  as  I  know,  yes.  Well, 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

the  BOP  says  it  is  not.  I  understand  the  States,  where 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  of  the  prisoner  are,  are  doing  exactly  that.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  showed  two  ­­ we  cited  two  district  court  cases  where

MR.  SHELLEY:  Well,  but  the  ­­ you'd  be  out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  ­­ you  wouldn't  be  filing  baseless  suits  because  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got  the  three  strikes,  eventually.  But  Mr.  Bruce,  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance,  had  ­­ had  six  cases  before  he  incurred  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  strike,  even.  And  so  the  ­­ the  constitutional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dimension  that  the  Second,  Third,  and  Fourth  Circuits

100  percent  of  the  income  that  he  works  to  earn  as  ­­ as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Hobson's  choice  to  filing  what  may  be  a  meritorious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  They  haven't  said  it's  unconstitutional.  They've 

  

  

 

 

 

 

just  said  the  statute  leaves  you  scratching  your  head. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  it  ­­ it's  not  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hobson's  choice  if  he  forfeits  all  except  $10.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  the  difference,  whether  he  has  $10  in  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account  or  nothing. 

 

 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  Yes.  Yes.  And  as  this  Court 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

has  said,  and  as  Congress  said  in  1892  when  it  enacted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  in  forma  pauperis  statute,  a  man  who  has  very  little 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cares  about  each  penny.  And  in  prison  if  you  have  $6, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  makes  a  difference.  It  makes  a  difference  that  month

interpreting  the  statute,  which  I  think  would  make  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  would  guess,  not  in  every  case,  where  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

multiple  thing  is  likely  to  arise  is  where:  Files  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frivolous  case,  it's  dismissed  by  the  district  court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  then  he  takes  an  appeal.  Okay?  There  we  have  two. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  the  question  is  ­­ he  has  to  get  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filing  fee.  Then  the  next  slot  is  going  to  be,  like, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  percent  or  40  percent,  right?  But  you  should  leave 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him  with  $10. 

 

 

            

Given  the  purpose  of  the  statute,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  stop  these  frivolous  suits,  or  at  least  make  it  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little  tougher,  doesn't  it  make  sense,  say,  what  I  just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said:  Leave  him  with  the  $10,  but  you  can  take  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  percent:  20  percent  for  one  court,  20  percent  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other? 

 

            

Now,  maybe  what  I've  just  said  doesn't  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense.  To  me,  it  makes  sense  at  the  moment.  But  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  ­­ it  would  both  leave  him  with  the  $10,  but  allow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  clerks  to  collect  the  20  percent  for  the  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court,  20  percent  for  the  Court  of  Appeals. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Is  ­­ is  that  impossible  to  bring  about? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  SHELLEY:  I  think  it  is,  given  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  language.  I  think,  given  the  fact  that  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

prison  officials  shall  forward  payments  each  time  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount  in  the  account  is  greater  than  $10  doesn't  allow

And  while  that  might  have  been  the  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  could  have  written  it,  it  did  not.  And  given 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  way  Congress  did  write  it,  the  best  approach  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

per­prisoner  approach  that  leaves  some  money  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prisoner  for  things  like  phone  calls. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Actually,  I  ­­ I  didn't 

   

   

  

 

realize  the  back  end  of  this.  Forget  about  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prisoner.  I'm  thinking  about  the  courts. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Basically,  you're  saying  the  last  court  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brings  him  over  10  ­­ the  moment  he  has  over  $10,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  who  gives  ­­ no.  That  doesn't  happen.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  ­­ he  pays  a  filing  fee.  He  now  has  more  than  $10 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  account.  That  court  gets  more  money  than  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  courts? 

 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  No.  They  all  get  ­­ they  all 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  20  percent.  The  ­­ the  way  it  should  work  is,  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  $10  in  the  account?  If  there's  $10.01,  you  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  take  20  percent,  a  20  percent  installment.  Perhaps 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

another  20  percent  for  cost;  that's  a  different  issue. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  you  ­­ for  the  filing  fees  you  take  a  20  percent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

installment,  and  it  goes  down  to,  say,  $8  at  that  point. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  the  end  of  it  under  the  ­­ under  the  per­prisoner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach  that  we  espouse.

Under  the  per­case  approach,  the  way  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  of  appeals  at  least  have  understood  it,  if  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  $10.01  in  the  account  and  there  are  five  filing  fees, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  100  percent  of  the  $10.01  that  goes.  20  percent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  each. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  That  wouldn't  be  true  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  Federal  prisoner,  because  the  Bureau  of  Prisons  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  matter  what,  the  prisoner  has  to  be  left  with  $10. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  It's  a  matter  of  grace.  It's 

   

  

  

 

 

 

not  set  out  in  regulation.  It's  not  set  out  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidance.  It's  ­­

  

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Do  they  know  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

extent  to  which  the  States  are  following  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  Yes.  To  the  extent  we've  been 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

able  to  investigate  that,  we've  cited  two  ­­ two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  courts  in  our  reply  brief.  I  think  one  from 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Iowa  and  maybe  one  from  another  Midwest  state  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland  and  Iowa.  Those  two  cases,  the  ­­ the  way  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  decision  reads,  it  indicates  that  they  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  to  see  if  there's  $10.01,  and  then  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking  ­­ they're  going  down  20,  20,  20,  and  20. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  would  also  note,  if  you  look  at  Siluk, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Third  Circuit;  Torres,  the  Fourth  Circuit;  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Judge  Easterbrook's  decision  in  Newlin,  they  all  talk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  if  there's  more  than  the  $10,  you  take  100  percent

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  If  ­­ if  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Now,  I  don't  see  how 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  Bureau  of  Prisons  can  do  this  as  a  matter  of  grace. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  the  statute  says  what  it  says,  "shall."  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  ­­ I  don't  know  why  think  they  can  do  ­­ they  may 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  their  own  views  on  what's  good  policy,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress,  it  seems  to  me,  has  written  the  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  the  way  you  say. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  I  agree.  I  agree  with  that. 

    

    

 

 

 

The  only  possibility  is  that  alternative  approach  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  where  they  stop  after  the  first  one  goes  below  $10. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  that  one  takes  100  percent  of  the  income  and  helps 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us  in  proving  the  per­prisoner  approach,  because  in  most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  where  there's  any  ­­ any  ­­ any  job  or  wage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

income  being  earned  by  the  prisoner,  you're  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  100  percent  because  the  last  20  percent  increment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  be  above  the  $10  threshold. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You  can  interpret  it  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

other  way,  linguistically.  You  say,  you  forward  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  percent  each  time  the  amount  in  the  account  exceeds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$10.  Well,  the  instant  you  write  that  check,  you  say, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ it  does  not  exceed  $10,  and  therefore  you  can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward  it.  So  you  can't  write  that  kind  of  a  check. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  isn't  that  literally  ­­

MR.  SHELLEY:  I  would  agree  with  that. 

    

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  now  we're  getting 

  

 

 

 

 

into  the  technicalities  of  banking  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ which  ­­ so  ­­ so  I  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  think  you  can  read  it  the  way  I  suggested,  if 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  not  too  technical  about  it.  It  seems  consistent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  language. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Does  the  Fed  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

position  on  this  that  ­­ that  ­­ that  Chevron  requires 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us  to  defer  to? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  No.  No  Chevron  deference 

  

  

 

 

 

here.  There's  no  regulation.  There's  no  guidance. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

It's  a  statement  in  an  adversary  brief. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

But,  Justice  Breyer,  I  think  that  there 

   

 

 

 

 

are  ­­ there  are  a  number  of  machinations  that  can  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  ­­ that  can  be  gone  through  in  order  to  defend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  ­­ this  idea  or  that  idea,  and  the  government  comes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  with  alternative  ones  that  they're  not  even  using  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

try  to  deal  with  the  plural  filing  fees,  for  instance. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  our  approach  is  much  simpler.  Our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

approach  is  you  read  the  statute  the  way  it  ­­ the  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  states  a  "shall."  You  know,  "shall  the  prisoner."

You  don't  look  to  see  if  it's  ­­ the  payment's  going  to

a  trigger  and  then  pay. 

 

 

 

 

            

In  addition,  you  don't  have  a  lot  of  other

incur  ­­ the  last  seven  or  so  have  not  been  filed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially  because  he  had  had  three  strikes  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12th.  So  there's  really  only  12  lawsuits  we're  ­­ we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  that  could  have  filing  fees. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  answer  to  the  question,  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg,  of  whether  he's  never  going  to  pay  those, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again  I  would  go  back  to  1995  and  say  Congress  thought,

well,  they  could  be  paid  relatively  quickly  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filing  fees  were  lower. 

 

 

 

            

 

 

But  you  ­­ you  touch  on  a  question  that  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

unsettled  in  the  lower  courts,  which  is  does  the  amount 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  due  at  the  end  of  when  the  prisoner  ­­ when  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prisoner  sentence  ends?  And  the  courts  of  appeals  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divided  about  that,  with  the  Fifth  Circuit  saying,  yes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  does  come  due,  and  you  have  to  come  up  with  some  kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  plan  with  each  of  the  clerks  to  which  you  owe 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money,  and  you  shall  pay  it  off.  Other  circuits  say  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is.  It  does  come  due,  but  it  only  comes  due  and  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  pay  it  if  you're  not  in  forma  pauperis  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  the  government  seeks  to  collect  it  after  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  ­­ out  of  release. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  don't  think  it's  correct  to  say,  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

least  as  a  matter  of  law,  it's  settled  as  to  whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  filing  fees  forever  go  away  once  the  prisoner  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prisoner  leaves  prison. 

 

 

              

I  had  also  started  just  talking  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  ­­ the  different  problems  of  the  per­case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach  that  ours  avoids.  And  the,  as  I  mentioned, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  per­prisoner  approach  allows  you  to  line  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fees  one  after  another.  You  just  have  to  figure  out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  one  was  incurred  first,  second,  third,  fourth. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  under  their  approach,  what  happens  after  the  fifth

at  that  point,  well,  the  sixth  one  becomes  our  approach.

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  I  thought  the 

    

 

 

government's  position  was  you  can't  get  blood  out  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stone,  so  when  it's  100  percent,  that's  it.  Sixth,

MR.  SHELLEY:  They  stood  in  line.  What  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  says  that  ­­ page  30  of  their  brief  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  gets  deferred.  Deferred  until  one  of  them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gets  paid  off.  So  then  you  have  to  figure  out,  well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  them  got  paid  off,  so  which  one  do  you  switch  in, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  how  much  do  you  switch  in?  And  it  just  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problems  start  to  multiply. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Why  do  you  pick  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

earliest?  I  mean,  all  of  them  ­­ all  of  them  are  owed. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why  don't  you  pick  the  nearest  court? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  Well,  you  could.  You  could

looked  at  it,  they've  looked  at,  in  time,  the  first. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  don't  think  the  government  disagrees 

   

 

 

 

 

because,  at  least  when  you  get  to  the  sixth  one,  it's  ­­

their  approach,  with  the  first  five  being  paid. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Is  he  on  the  hook 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  filing  fees  here? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  He  is  not.  He  is  not. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Why  not? 

  

 

 

 

MR.  SHELLEY:  I  don't  understand  the  Court 

    

 

 

 

 

to  apply  the  PLRA  for  its  cert  petitions,  for  instance. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  in  any  event,  I  believe  his  filing  fee  was  paid 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  ­­ oh,  he  is  ­­ he  is  subject  to  a  filing  fee  in  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  and  he  did  pay  it.  But  I  don't  understand  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  to  apply  the  PLRA  to  cert  petitions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

One  last  point  I  wanted  to  make  is  that  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it  is  often  thought  that  a  prisoner  who  has  12 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filing  fees  or  10  filing  fees  is  a  recidivist  prisoner, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  that's  not  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

As  the  ­­ the  Second  Circuit  noted  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Whitfield  case,  that  single  case  produced  five 

 

 

 

 

 

 

encumbrances.  It  was  a  district  court  appeal,  it  was  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  case,  a  Second  Circuit  appeal.  There 

   

  

 

 

 

 

were  two  cost  awards  from  the  district  court  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  of  appeals,  and  there  was  a  second  appeal.  There

were  five  encumbrances  in  one  single  piece  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation.  So  these  encumbrances  can  add  up  quite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

quickly,  and  you  can  get  up  to  five,  seven,  eight. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that  case,  it  was  a  meritorious  case, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  Second  Circuit  said.  It  wasn't  a  frivolous  case. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

The  prisoner  didn't  win,  but  it  was  ­­ it  was  a  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  wasn't,  as  ­­ as  Justice  Kagan  used  in  the  last 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument,  it  wasn't  a  laughing­stock  case.  These 

   

  

 

 

 

were  ­­ it  was  a  meritorious  case  in  the  sense  that  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  one  that  could  be  brought  by  any  other  American  that

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

This  statute  is  written  from  the  perspective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  single  case.  And  what  I  mean  by  that  is  that  for 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each  action  or  appeal,  it  provides  a  list  of  things  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  to  do:  To  check  for  the  affidavit  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indigency,  to  check  for  three  strikes,  and  as  relevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  to  require  full  payment  of  filing  fees  on  an

installment  schedule. 

 

            

So  what  we're  talking  about  here  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsection  (b),  which  is  the  filing  fee  provision,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  says,  first,  that  an  IFP  prisoner  has  to  pay  the  full 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount  of  each  action  or  appeal,  talking  about  a  single 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  or  appeal,  and  then  it  sets  out  an  installment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan,  which  is  an  initial  payment  and  a  monthly  payment. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  we're  at  the  point  where  Petitioner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agrees  that  the  initial  payment  is  for  each  case,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ he  says  that  the  statute  somehow  shifts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perspective  to  all  of  an  inmate's  cases  when  it  starts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  the  monthly  payments. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  just  don't  think  there's  any  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  explanation  in  the  statute  that  does  that.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  burden  should  be  really  on  him  to  show  a  shift 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  a  single  case  to  all  of  the  cases,  and  it  wouldn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  sense  to  do  that. 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  Justice  Scalia  made  the  point  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  discussion  that  there  just  wouldn't  be  any  marginal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deterrence  if  an  inmate  could  file  as  many  lawsuits  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  wanted  and  not  make  any  additional  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You  say  the  word  "fees." 

  

 

 

 

 

 

What  about  the  word  "fees"?  Does  that  show? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Right.  What  petitioner  says 

  

  

 

 

 

is  that  the  word  "fees,"  plural,  always  means  more  than

one  case.  And  we  know  from  the  text  of  this  statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that's  not  true,  because  there  are  several  places 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  Congress  says  "fees"  and  it's  referring  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single  case. 

 

            

So  for  example,  in  Subsection  (b)(3), 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  talks  about  the  amount  of  fees  permitted  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  for  a  civil  action  or  an  appeal.  In  (b)(1)  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talks  about  any  court  fees  required  by  law  for  an  action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  appeal.  Similarly,  in  (a)(1)  and  (a)(2)  it  talks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  fees,  plural,  for  a  ­­ a  single  action  or  a  single 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

appeal. 

            

And  to  be  clear,  we  think  that  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  Congress  used  "fee"  and  "fees"  somewhat 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interchangeably  in  the  way  that  people  do  out  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world;  that  people  would  say  "attorney's  fees,"  "an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney  fee  award,"  "fee  shifting,"  "we're  shifting  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fees,"  that  sort  of  thing,  that  that's  just  common 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

usage,  and  that  the  single/plural  fees  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsection  (b)(2)  just  does  not  provide  the  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strong  indication  that  would  be  necessary  to  overcome 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  real  thrust  of  the  rest  of  the  statute,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it's  something  that  a  court  does  for  each  of  these 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  It  sets  out  this  payment  plan;  it  does  each  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  things  that  are  set  out  in  the  statute.

don't  ­­ I  can't  ­­ I'm  not  terribly  persuaded  by  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deterrence  argument.  I  mean,  no  statute  pursues  its 

    

 

 

 

 

 

purposes  at  every  cost.  And  maybe  Congress  decided  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  ­­ they  didn't  need  to  take  the  last  23  cents  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hour  the  prisoner  earned  to  promote  the  deterrence  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  have  all  these  other  anti­filing  provisions  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law. 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well,  this  is  the  only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

provision  that  provides  a  financial  deterrent.  There 

   

  

 

 

 

are  other  provisions,  like  the  three­strikes  provisions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

et  cetera.  But  this  is  the  one,  and  this  is  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record,  where  members  of  Congress  said  it  makes  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inmate  stop  and  think:  Is  this  lawsuit  worth  the  cost? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

And  in  the  amount  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Yes,  but  Congress  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about,  okay,  they  have  to  pay  the  filing  fee. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Certainly  Congress  didn't  focus,  I  wouldn't  think,  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it's  ­­ well,  I  assume  they  didn't  focus  on

different  than  one,  because  in  ­­ in  one  you're  talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about,  oh,  this  is  what  the  Court  should  do.  But  on  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  say  this  is  what's  required  of  the  prisoner,  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  says  up  to  20  percent. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now  I  know  one  says  required  two,  but  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

immediately  shifts  its  ­­ he's  required  to  pay  the  whole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing,  and  that's  the  important  point.  But  ­­ but  two, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  says  this  is  what's  required  of  the  prisoner,  monthly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payments  of  20  percent  of  the  preceding  month's  income. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Right.  Towards  ­­

  

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  To  me  that  seems  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  more  a  prisoner  focus  than  a  case­by­case. 

   

   

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  But  it's  ­­ it's  linked  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsection  (b)(1).  This  whole  thing  is  talking  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  happens  in  a  ­­ in  a  specific  case.  It  starts  by 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  the  ­­ "When  a  civil  action  or  an  appeal  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed,  you  shall  pay  the  full  amount  of  the  filing  fee, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  here's  the  way  to  do  it."  And  Subsection  (b)  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

triggers  ­­ Subsection  (b)(1)  then  triggers 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsection  (b)(2). 

 

            

We  think  Judge  Shreenavossen  got  this 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  right  in  the  opinion  for  the  D.C.  Circuit  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  said  that  when  you  start  reading  (b)(2),  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

triggered  from  (b)(1),  and  it  continues  the  per­case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focus  that  it's  talking  about,  first  we  have  an  initial

partial  payment  for  one  case,  and  then  we  have  monthly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payments  to  pay  off  the  balance  of  that  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

And  that's  ­­

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I'm  not  sure  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

responsive  to  my  point.  I  guess  what  I  was  saying  is  I 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  it  carries  forward  the  case­by­case  basis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  speaks  solely  of  what's  required  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prisoner  in  a  way  that  doesn't  address  case  by  case  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all.  I  mean,  that's  why  this  is  such  a  confusing 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

statute. 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well,  we  think  ­­ the  reason 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  think  it  does,  just  to  be  clear  as  possible,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  the  language  that  starts  Subsection  (b)(2), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is,  "After  payment  of  the  initial  partial  filing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fee"  ­­ which  is  for  one  case  ­­ "then  the  prisoner  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  to  make  monthly  payments,"  which  is  to  pay  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remaining  amount  because  we  know  he  has  to  pay  the  full 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount  for  one  case. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Of  20  percent  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

preceding  month's  income.  To  me,  I  ­­ well,  I  would 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

think  at  least  as  reasonable  as  you're  reading,  to  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  you  look  at  what  is  required  of  the  prisoner,  20 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent  of  his  income,  that  doesn't  have  anything  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  by  case,  because  what  you  would  require,  of  course, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  he  pay  40  percent  if  there  are  two  cases,  or  60

percent  if  there  are  three,  or  all  of  it,  if  it's  above 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$10.  And  I  think  he  ­­ anyone  ­­ someone  looking  at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  may  say,  no,  he's  only  supposed  to  pay  20  percent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  his  income. 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  But  this  ­­ this  part  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  and  all  the  parts  of  this  statute,  really,  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  the  perspective  of  a  single  case.  And  we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  20  percent  makes  sense  in  that  regard,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  one  member  of  Congress  said  ­­ and  this  was  quoted  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  D.C.  Circuit's  opinion  ­­ the  filing  fee  of  ­­ of  20 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent  is  small  enough  not  to  deter  a  prisoner  with  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meritorious  claim,  but  it's  large  enough  to  deter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frivolous  claims  or  multiple  filings. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  20  percent  essentially  leaves  room 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  multiple  filings  that  you  could  apply  at  more  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  time  when  a  prisoner  has  a  second  case,  a  third 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

case,  a  ­­

   

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  yes,  but  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  get  off  the  hook  for  the  other  ones.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  ­­ has  to  pay  it  further  down,  you  know,  it's  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  like  a  mortgage.  I  mean,  you  get  30  years,  you 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  pay  it  further  down.  If  you're  on  15  years,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  pay  it  less.

like  he's  getting  off  Scott­free. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Right.  I  understand  your 

    

  

 

 

question,  but  I  think  that  there  are  a  couple  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

problems  with  that.  One  is  that  there's  nothing  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  that  suggests  that  you  would  delay  the  payments. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  it  doesn't  make  sense  in  terms  of  the  statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  to  delay  them. 

 

 

 

            

As  Judge  Easterbrook's  opinion  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

Seventh  Circuit  said,  if  you  want  to  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay­as­you­go  system  where  there's  an  immediate  cost  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each  individual  case,  the  person  needs  to  have  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligation  to  start  paying  right  away,  not  five  years  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  future,  or  perhaps  never. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  he  pays  the  20 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent  in  every  case  right  away. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Right.  But  that's  a  one­time 

   

  

  

 

 

payment,  and  it  could  be  quite  small.  And  that's  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  from  having  an  ongoing  monthly  payment  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

starts  right  away  and  that  you  have  to  pay. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  do  want  to  address  another  ­­ another 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  that  I  think  your  question  raised,  which  is  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prisoners  ever  going  to  be  paying  these  amounts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly  where  they  have  filed  numerous  cases  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  individual  in  this  case.  And  I  think  the  answer  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no,  for  two  reasons.  The  first  is  a  practical  one.  The

second  one  is  a  legal  one. 

   

 

 

 

              

I  guess  I'll  start  with  the  legal  one  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

numerous  courts  that  have  considered  this  issue  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  that  once  a  prisoner  is  out  in  the  world  and  is  no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

longer  a  prisoner  but  wants  to  continue  his  case,  he  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

try  to  qualify  for  regular  IFP  status  and  no  longer  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  make  his  payments.  So  potentially,  he's  not  making 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  payments. 

 

            

And  regardless  of  how  you  would  decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  legal  ­­

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You  agree  with  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation? 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  It's  not  something  that  we've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

taken  a  position  on  in  this  case. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Then  I  don't  think 

   

  

 

 

 

it's  fair  to  rely  on  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well,  then  I  ­­ I  do  think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

it's  fair  to  rely  on  it  in  light  of  the  fact  that  no  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  collecting  ­­ no  one  is  ­­ there's  not  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

centralized  mechanism  to  collect  now. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that's  really  the  second  point  that  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted  to  make,  which  is  regardless  of  how  you  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolve  that  legal  question,  and  actually  the  reason 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  administrative  office  has  not,  so  far  as  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  taken  a  position  on  that,  is  because  there  are

serious  practical  problems  to  collecting. 

 

 

 

 

            

One  of  those  problems  ­­ when  you  ­­ when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  look  at  the  statute,  Subsection  (b)  allows  you  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  money  from  the  trust  accounts,  so  it's  fairly  easy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  collect  while  the  individual  is  in  prison.  But  once 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  person  is  out  in  the  world,  courts  ­­ each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  court  trying  to  collect  filing  fees  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  ­­ that  the  inmates  ­­ the  former  inmate's  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hook  for  is  quite  a  difficult  thing. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

We  have  spoken  with  folks  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  office  who  tell  us  that  there  is  not  now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  centralized  system  for  trying  to  refer  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligations  for  treasury,  and  I  think  you  could  imagine 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  cumbersome  that  would  be.  So  to  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potentially  paying  five  years  down  the  road,  or  never 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paying  is  any  kind  of  marginal  deterrent  I  think  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  wrong. 

 

            

We  think  that  Congress  knew  that  there  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

multiple  filers  out  there,  and  that  if  they  were  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  file  more  lawsuits,  they  should  pay  more.  And  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  clear  about  what  Congress  was  saying  here,  no  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  precluded  from  going  to  court.  All  Congress  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  is  something  very  reasonable,  which  is  if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  funds  available  and  you  continue  filing  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuits  and  appeals,  you  should  have  to  pay.  You

should  have  to  contribute.  And  we  think  that  that  makes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complete  sense. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Ms.  Saharsky,  can  I  get  back 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to  the  $10  rule  and  the  BOP  policy  with  respect  to  this? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  it  was  the  Chief  Justice  who  said  that  he  didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  understand.  And  I  share  his  lack  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

understanding  about  how  the  BOP  is  actually  doing  this, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  the  language  of  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  statute  says,  you  know,  "shall  forward 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payments  each  time  the  amount  in  the  account  exceeds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$10."  So  that  suggests  to  me  that  if  you're  looking  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  account  with  $10  and  1  cent,  you  make  the  next 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment.  And  I  understand  from  your  brief  that  that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

not  what  the  BOP  is  doing.  And  how  can  the  BOP  be  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  that? 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well,  a  ­­ a  couple  of 

   

   

  

 

 

answers.  First  of  all,  we  think  that  that  language  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ you  cited  can  be  read  multiple  ways,  as  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  discussion  with  Justice  Breyer  perhaps  suggested, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  could  mean  a  $10  floor  or  it  could  mean  that  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

start  making  payments  at  the  $10  and  then  go  below  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$10. 

            

The  BOP  has  long­standing  ­­ has  taken  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position,  long­standing  position,  that  you  have  a  $10 

   

 

 

 

 

 

floor  that  is  not  in  any  kind  of  regulation  or  published

guidance.  The  way  that  we  do  it  is  we  have  a  database 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  basically  for  inmate  trust  accounts.  It's  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  electronic  system  for  having  money  coming  in  and  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  accounts.  And  we  have  had  that  $10  floor  in

think  the  statute  could  be  read  both  ways,  and  we  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  more  consistent  with  Congress's  intention  to  leave 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  $10  in  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Yes,  that's  probably  right. 

  

 

 

 

 

But  how  can  it  be  read  that  way?  Tell  me  how  it  can  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read  that  way. 

 

 

            

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  You're  saying  you  can't 

  

 

 

 

 

touch  $10.  In  ­­ in  all  cases,  $10  will  always  remain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  account.  How  can  you  read  it  that  way? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well,  because  when  it  says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"exceeds  $10,"  I  think  you  could  ­­ you  could  read  it  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  can't  ­­ kind  of  the  flip  side,  that  you  can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  below  the  $10.  Or  you  could  say  that  you  could  start 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Just  read  the  language. 

  

 

 

 

 

Read  the  language.  What  ­­ what  language  produces  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

result? 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Right.  We  think  that  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ when  you  say  it  exceeds  $10  that  that  means  that

you  can't  ­­ there's  the  flip  side  of  it  that  you  can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  below  $10.  But  to  be  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That  doesn't  follow.  It  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

it  says  you  can  take  20  percent  if  the  account  exceeds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$10.  If  the  account  exceeds  $10,  you  take  20  percent  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  account. 

 

            

            

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well,  Justice  Scalia  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  what  it  says. 

  

 

 

 

 

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Right.  If  ­­ if  you  ­­ we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  it  can  read  both  ways,  but  this  is  ­­ if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagreed  about  that,  we  don't  think  that  that  issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolves  this  case  for  a  number  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Anyway,  why  can't  you  read 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  that  way?  You  forward  the  payment  each  time  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount  exceeds  $10.  Forwarding  it  consists  of  pressing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  electronic  button.  And  so  the  instant  you  press  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

button,  it  does  not  exceed  $10.  And  there  we  have  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  there  is  a  way  of  construing  the  language  which  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  the  obvious  purpose  to  me,  which  is  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leave  this  prisoner  with  at  least  $10. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well,  that's  what  we  think. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

We  think  it  can  be  read  multiple  ways.  And  so  far  as  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  about  the  experience,  it  has  been  read  multiple 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways.  There  are  cases  in  the  courts  of  appeals  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  read  it  one  way  versus  the  other.  To  be  clear

though,  these  cases  not  ones  that  have  gone  through  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detailed  statutory  analysis,  not  even  as  much  detail  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court's  discussion  at  argument  today,  but  have  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  in  an  offhand  line  either  you  can  go  below  the  $10 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  can't.  They've  kind  of  gone  both  ways  on  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  in  terms  of  experience,  we  know  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Second  Circuit's  case  that's  cited  in  the  briefs, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Whitfield,  that  New  York  did  not  go  below  the  $10.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked  counsel  of  record  for  the  States.  The  States 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed  a  brief  on  our  side  of  this  case,  and  ­­ and  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel  of  record  is  the  Solicitor  General  of  Michigan. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He  said  that  Michigan  does  not  go  below  the  $10.  My 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend  on  the  other  side  has  suggested  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  does  all  of  this  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  the  States,  all  of  the  prisons?  Because  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adversary  says  that  some  are  going  below  the  $10. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  I'm  not  sure  that  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

true.  He  cites  two  cases.  One  is  ­­ they're  from 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland  and  from  Iowa.  One  of  the  cases  said  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  ­­ that  it  went  below  the  $10  in  a  ­­ in  one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  But  it  didn't  say  that  was  the  State  policy. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ you  know,  I  don't  know  if  it  was. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  the  second  was  an  individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accounting  clerk  who  had  gone  below  the  $10  and  who  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  it  manually.  So  I  don't  know  that  that  represents

any  kind  of  policy  either. 

 

 

 

 

            

 

But  if  I  could  step  back,  I  think  it  is  not 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

necessary  for  this  Court  to  resolve  the  $10  issue  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolve  the  question  presented,  because  the  question  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  an  inmate  who  files  more  cases  have  to  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

monthly  payments? 

 

            

And  just  as  ­­ and  just  parenthetically  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

highlight  why  the  Court  doesn't  need  to  resolve  the  $10 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  to  resolve  this  case,  this  was  not  an  issue  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  briefed  before  the  D.C.  Circuit.  It's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  that  the  D.C.  Circuit's  opinion  addressed.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  not  something  that  was  in  the  certiorari  petition. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  why  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  that  issue  could  come 

  

 

 

 

 

 

up  in  the  very  first  payment,  couldn't  it?  If  the  guy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  $10  and  1  cent  in  his  account,  the  very  first 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment  could  raise  that  issue. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Yes,  that's  true. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  So  it's  not  an  issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

presented  by  the  ­­ by  the  question  of  whether  you  use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  per­case  or  per­prisoner  approach. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  I  completely  agree. 

    

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  It's  a  problem  either  way. 

   

  

 

 

 

MR.  SULLIVAN:  However  you  resolve  the 

  

 

 

 

 

question  presented,  that  would  still  be  a  separate

question,  one  that  the  courts  of  appeals  have  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered  in  any  level  of  detail. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

The  extent  ­­

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Ms.  Saharsky,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

find  ­­ I  ­­ I  think  others  may  too.  I  find  the  issue 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  before  us  very  difficult  to  resolve  based  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  language.  Is  there  any  doctrine  tantamount  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  rule  of  lenity  in  interpreting  a  criminal  statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  applies  here?  Because  the  thing  that  strikes  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most  is  the  extreme  harshness  of  your  position.  We're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  earning  23  cents  an  hour,  filing  fees  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$350,  $505.  And  the  money  is  used  to  ­­ for  what? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Phone  calls  to  family  and  friends,  stamps  for  letters, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  to  buy  books.  And  you're  going  to  take  the  last, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  whatever  so  that  someone  who's  in  there  for  20 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years  can't  even  buy  a  book?  That  seems  very,  very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

harsh. 

            

And  you  seem  to  be  willing  to  interpret  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguity  in  the  statute  to  save  the  last  $10,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  unwilling  to  interpret  what  I  think  at  least  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regard  as  the  ambiguity  in  the  statute  to  allow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prisoners  ­­ I  mean,  they  are  prisoners.  They're  not  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  perhaps  not  entitled  to  any  grace,  but  who  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  States  earn  10  cents  an  hour.  You're  not  willing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  interpret  that  ambiguity  in  a  way  that  allows  them  to

keep  that  so  they  can  pay  for  phone  calls  to  their
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

family. 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well,  a  couple  of  answers. 

   

  

 

 

 

First  of  all,  we  think  that  this  is  not  ­­ this  ­­ this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  a  person  having  so  little  in  their  money  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  in  their  the  account  only  arises  in  the  case  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  talking  about  someone  who  has  filed  five  or  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuits,  which  is  not  the  ordinary  case.  I  mean,  it  is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously  a  case  to  consider.  But  at  least  in  the  BOP's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experience,  the  vast  majority  of  people  who  have  orders 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owed  are  for  one  lawsuit,  two  lawsuits.  Most  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  of  appeals'  cases  below  are  like  that,  et  cetera. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Putting  that  to  the  side,  of  course,  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  never  prevents  a  prisoner  from  bringing  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

meritorious  case  because  of  the  safety­valve  provision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  also  interpret  the  $10  amount  to  leave  money  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account. 

            

There's  also,  of  course,  administrative 

 

 

 

 

remedies,  which  administrative  exhaustion  is  required. 

 

 

 

 

 

So  that  helps  resolve  any  questions  about  making  sure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  claims  are  heard. 

 

 

 

  

And,  in  fact,  the  BOP  does  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  discretion  to  allow 
 

 

 

 

phone  calls,  et  cetera,  to 

 

 

 

 

indigent  prisoner,  also 
 

 

 

stamps,  et  cetera,  et  cetera. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  in  terms 
 

 

 

of  what  you  potentially  perceive 

 

 

 

 

as  harshness,  this  only 
 

 

 

 

arises  in  cases  where  an  inmate

is  filing  so  many  cases,  that  potentially  a  large 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

portion  of  his  income  used  to  pay  filing  fees.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  that's  ­­

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Just  a  thought. 

   

  

 

 

Well,  if  you're  there  for  20  years,  maybe  you  should  let 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  buy  a  book. 

   

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Right.  And  this  ­­ again, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

this  situation  there  ­­ I  think  most  prisons  actually 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  libraries  that  books  are  available.  And  like  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  had  some  cases  about  what  libraries  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I'm  sure  they  are  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  sure  they  are  very  good  libraries,  too. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well,  just  ­­ just  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear,  you  know,  this  is  a  situation  that  only  arises  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fairly  atypical  situation.  We  ­­ it's  true  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  does  not  specifically  address  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation  of  a  prisoner  with  five  lawsuits  or  six 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuits  and  orders  et  cetera.  But  we  think  the  reason 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  is  and  that  the  Seventh  Circuit  suggested  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  the  early  opinions  after  PLRA  was  enacted  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  Congress  thought  that  the  three  ­­ three­strikes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  was  going  to  prevent  all  of  these  lawsuits, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  it  ­­

books?  I  mean,  does  Amazon  really  make  a  lot  of  money

off  these  people? 

 

 

            

            

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  I  can't  say,  you  know  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  don't  think  ­­

    

 

 

 

MS.  SAHARSKY:  ­­ the  experience  that  we  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case,  for  example,  might  be  good  to  highlight, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  Pinson,  the  individual  who  has  filed  more  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  hundred  cases  ­­ gets  regular  deposits  into  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account,  had  been  using  them  to  buy  books  and  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

materials.  Those  are  in  the  Joint  Appendix  starting  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pages  55,  56,  et  cetera.  So  it  shows  that  prisoners  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able  to  ­­ even  Pinson  who  has  filed  over  a  hundred 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  is  able  to  ­­ to  pay  those  amounts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  just  to  ­­ just  to  clarify,  I  think  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  is  thinking  of  a  situation  of,  you  know,  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prisoner  who  has  10  cents  of  income  or  $10  of  income. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  we  don't  think  that  that  is  the  typical  situation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pinson's  account  at  the  time  he  filed  shows  that  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

received  an  average  of  ­­ I  think  it  was  $48  a  month  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

income.  I  have  asked  the  BOP  for  statistics  just 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  I  was  curious  about  what  is  the  median  income 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  received,  what  is  the  median  deposit.  They  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  for  the  ­­ the  past  fiscal  year,  the  median  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

median  income  an  inmate  receives  is  approximately  $120  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

month.  So,  in  fact,  with  that,  if  an  inmate  has  20 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent  that  he's  paying  towards  filing  fees,  he  could

pay  them  off  at  a  reasonable  rate.  And  we  think  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  just  really  a  much  better  alternative  from  what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  intended. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  that  does  raise  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  as  Mr.  Shelley  says,  using  that  exact  $50  number. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  you  have  $50  and  you  have  five  lawsuits,  the  $50  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gone,  assuming  that  the  BOP's  policy  is  not  uniform  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe  is  not  statutorily  authorized. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Yes,  I  think  that  ­­ I  think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

that  that  is  the  implication  of  it,  and  we  think  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  what  Congress  intended. 

 

 

 

 

              

I  am  not  sure  if  the  Court  is  interested  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  information,  but  we  actually  did  go  ahead  and  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  in  our  database  to  see  how  many  inmates  have  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PLRA  order  that  they're  paying  as  opposed  to  five  orders 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we're  paying.  And  what  we  found,  just  checking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

last  week,  was  that  inmates  ­­ there  are  944  inmates  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  over  200,000  in  the  federal  system  who  are  paying  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  order,  and  only  60  inmates  of  the  over  200,000  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  paying  on  five  or  more  orders  or  who  had  six,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  42  inmates  who  have  six  or  more  orders. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  this  actually  is  a  ­­ a  very  small 

   

   

 

 

 

 

problem,  at  least  federally,  and  we  would  not  want  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  small  tail  to  wag  the  dog  of  this  statute  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly  ­­ clearly  intended  by  Congress  to  make  sure

that  inmates  who  are  filing  frivolous  lawsuits  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial  disincentive  to  do  so.  And  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Be  clear  about  your 

  

 

 

 

 

policy.  And  I  think  your  adversary  agrees.  Under  (a), 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

the  20  percent  has  to  be  paid  on  all  five  cases  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  amount  is  above  10  or  ­­ the  amount  in  the  account 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  above  10  or  below  10,  correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  those  five  cases 

  

 

 

 

 

would  always  wipe  out  the  $10. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  The  $10  is  not  an  impediment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  initial  partial  filing  fee.  It  is  only  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second  part  of  it.  That  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  ­­ and  so  the  $10 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

floor  starts  once  the  account  goes  up  ­­ you  have  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  bottom.  You  have  always  $10  in  your  account,  but  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollar  that  goes  into  your  account  after  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  percent  has  to  be  paid. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Right.  Be  we  think  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

assuming  that  it's  over  the  $10.  But  we  think  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there's  a  ­­ you  know,  that  there's  at  least  $10  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  account  or  would  wait  until  there  was  $10  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account.  So  if  I'm  understanding  your  question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

correctly,  we  would  wait  until  there  was  $10  in  the

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  you  would  take 

  

 

 

 

 

20  percent.  Let's  say  there's  $10  and  ­­ there's  $11. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  one  extra  dollar  is  paid  to  whom? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  To  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Let's  assume  there's 

  

 

 

 

five  cases  there. 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  We  would  ­­ if  we  can't  pay 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  the  five  cases,  as  we  believe  Congress  intended, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  would  pay  the  oldest  lawsuit.  The  oldest  ­­ and  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  I  don't  mean  that  by  filing  date.  I  mean  the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

oldest  order  that  was  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Would  take  that  entire 

  

 

 

 

 

$1? 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Yes.  Because  the  statute 

  

  

 

 

 

says  to  pay  20  percent  per  case,  so  we  would  try  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  closest  thing  that  we  ­­ we  could  to  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  as  Justice  Ginsburg  said,  you  can't  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blood  out  of  a  stone.  There  comes  a  point  at  which,  if 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  not  funds,  we  can't  pay.  But  as  we  understand 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute,  and  we  think  it  makes  perfect  sense  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms  of  what  Congress  wanted,  if  you  have  money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available  and  you  continue  to  file  more  lawsuits  and  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

orders  entered,  that  you  ­­ the  inmate  should  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay  for  them. 

 

 

            

So  at  the  end  of  the  day,  we  think  that  the

D.C.  Circuit  got  it  right,  that  both  when  you  look  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  specific  text  of  this  provision,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsection  (b)  about  filing  fees  but  really  the  entire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  written  from  the  perspective  of  a  single  case,  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

checklist  for  a  single  case,  that  Congress  wanted 

   

 

 

 

 

 

inmates  who  were  filing  more  lawsuits  to  pay  more. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  think  that  that  makes  sense  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  ­­ and  I  want  ­­ this  is,  I  think,  a  partial  answer 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  one  of  the  prior  questions  of  the  Chief  Justice  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms  of  interpretative  canons,  etc.,  that  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  what  this  Court  did  last  term  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Coleman  case. 

 

            

In  the  Coleman  case  the  Court  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considering  the  three­strikes  provision,  but  it 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  that  that  provision  is  written  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perspective  of  a  single  case,  a  single  action,  or 

   

   

 

 

 

 

appeal.  You  could  get  a  strike  for  the  action.  You 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

could  get  a  strike  for  the  appeal. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  same  thing  we  think  is  true  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filing  fees.  You  could  owe  the  filing  fees  for  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action.  You  could  owe  the  filing  fees  for  the  appeal. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  we  think  that  that  makes  complete  sense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  unless  there  are  further  questions,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  urge  the  Court  to  affirm  the  decision  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D.C.  Circuit.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Oh,  you  have  four  minutes  remaining. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ANTHONY  F.  SHELLEY 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SHELLEY:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

First  of  all,  with  respect  to  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical  that  Justice  Sotomayor  asked,  in  fact,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  if  the  account  had  $11  in  it,  the  government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  would  lead  to  none  of  the  clerks  of  the  courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  paid  because  the  first  payment  would  take  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  balance  under  $10.  So  that  seems,  again,  as  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  justices  have  mentioned,  other  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer,  a  perverse  reading  of  the  $10  rule. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  also  want  to  take  on  the  idea  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  the  only  provision  in  the  statute  that  provides 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  a  financial  effect  on  the  prisoner  when  filing  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuit.  No  ­­ as  the  Chief  Justice  mentioned,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

initial  partial  filing  fee  applies  in  every  case.  No 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$10  rule.  No  minimum. 

  

 

 

            

So  that  is  a  ­­ an  immediate  financial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

incentive  not  to  file  a  frivolous  lawsuit  because  money 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  going  to  go  immediately.  And  if  it  doesn't  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immediately,  it's  a  debt  that  gets  paid  sequentially, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

much  like  the  per­prisoner  approach  would  adopt  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)(2).  But  (b)(2)  then  takes  a  longer­term  point  of

view.  (b)(1)  is  an  immediate  financial  disincentive. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

(b)(2)  is  the  longer  financial  disincentive  month  after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

month  with  the  installment  payments. 

 

 

 

 

              

I  also  want  to  take  on  the  idea  that  "fees" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  "filing  fee"  appear  interchangeably  in  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  do  not.  Ms.  Saharsky  mentioned  the  word  "fees," 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  "fees"  unadorned  with  the  word  "filing"  in  front  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  appears  differently  than  does  the  word  "filing  fees." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  plural  "filing  fees"  appears  in  exactly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  spots:  (b)(2).  And  then  in  the  cross­reference  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  cost  section,  I  believe  it's  (f)  ­­ in  the  (f) 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

section  where  it  says  that  costs  shall  be  charged  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  way  as  filing  fees.  They  both  use  the  plural 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"filing  fees." 

 

            

So  this  was  purposeful.  Congress  used  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

plural  "filing  fees"  only  twice.  And  that's  because,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  they  were  talking  about  the  ­­ the  numerous  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  paid  to  a  single  clerk. 

   

 

 

 

            

And  finally,  I'd  like  to  say,  it  has  often 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  said  that  the  measure  of  a  society  is  not  how  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treats  it's  outstanding  citizens  but  how  it  treats 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weakest. 

            

Here  there's  no  ­­ it's  criminals.  Here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  real  reason  to  pile  on  to  prisoners  with  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional  onerous  financial  incentive  when  the  other
