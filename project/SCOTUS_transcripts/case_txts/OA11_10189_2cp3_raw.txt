CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear next 

this morning in Case 11-10189, Trevino v. Thaler. 

Mr. Wolf? 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN A. WOLF 
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. WOLF:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has 

said, repeatedly, "As a general rule, a defendant should 
not raise an issue of ineffective assistance of counsel 
on direct appeal," and has recognized that Texas 
procedure make it, "virtually impossible for appellate 
counsel to adequately present such a claim."  Those 
claims are the choices made by the sovereign State of 
Texas, and it renders this case just like Martinez. 

This case well illustrates the consequences 

of that choice.  The transcript in this case was not 
ready -- available for 7 months.  That's 4 1/2 months 
after the trial lost -- trial court lost jurisdiction on 
any new trial motion. 

The State itself argued, quote -- in 

Sprouse -- "Without access to that record, new counsel 
would have little basis for attacking the performance of

trial counsel." 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose the State's 
position were not as you accurately have stated the 
Texas Court of Criminal Appeal.  It didn't say 
collateral review is the preferred route.  It said 
either way will do.  You can bring it up on direct 
appeal, or you can bring it up on collateral. 

Would you say that Martinez applies in that 
situation?  Or does it depend on having the -- the State 
highest court in the matter saying, this is the 
preferred way to go? 

MR. WOLF:  Texas systemically channels 

ineffective assistance claims to collateral -- to State 
habeas. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And if it didn't, if it 

just said, you can bring it up on direct, but we realize 
these limitations because the transcript won't be ready, 
so you can wait and bring it up on habeas. 

I'm just asking how far -- the rule that you 

would like us to adopt -- you say this is just like 
Martinez.  Is that where you would draw the line, that 
the -- the State's highest court has to say, we prefer 
this matter to be brought up on collateral review? 

MR. WOLF:  It's not just them saying it in 

words, but it's also saying it in the legislation and in

the rules that the State of Texas has adopted. 

Page 5 

In order to expand the record in a Wiggins 

claim -- which is what's the basis of Mr. Trevino's 
claim, in order to expand that record, you have a 30-day 
window to file a motion for new trial, and 75 days --
75 days to have a hearing on it or else the court loses 
jurisdiction by operation of law. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The district court, 

the trial court? 

MR. WOLF:  That's correct.  And so you 

couldn't expand the record.  And, in order to present a 
Wiggins claim, especially, it takes a considerable 
amount of extra record investigation. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Has the Texas --

have the Texas appellate courts ever sent a -- a claim 
back for an evidentiary hearing? 

MR. WOLF:  After 75 days, the -- the 

district court loses jurisdiction, and I realize there 
are some jurisdictions around the country that have that 
opportunity.  But Texas has a finality where there is no 
provision to expand the record after that 75-day period. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So as far as you know, 

the court -- the appellate court's never done that? 

MR. WOLF:  That's correct. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Why does

Texas afford people in your client's position a new 
appellate counsel? 

Page 6 

MR. WOLF:  Well, there's two -- actually, 

Texas has a dual-track system.  It was developed in 
1995, a year before the Federal system was developed in 
AEDPA.  And the concept -- and the reason for it -- the 
rationale, was to expedite these type of claims, 
especially in death penalty claims, under 
Section 11.071. 

But the -- and the purpose is that there is 

two counsels that are appointed.  One counsel is 
appointed to handle the record-based claims, and that's 
done on direct appeal.  The other counsel is appointed 
in all cases -- there's no question -- on habeas. 
And that attorney -- that counsel is 

appointed with the understanding that he's going to have 
the time to do the extra-record-based claims.  In a case 
like this, the record wasn't even prepared for 7 months 
after the date of the judgment. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I don't know 

that you've answered Justice Ginsburg's question, and so 
I'm going to take it up because it interests me. 

Let's assume, as she did in her 

hypothetical, that a State says -- doesn't have any case 
law like Texas does, that says, we prefer you to go that

way, for non-record-based claims. 

Page 7 

Is the difference between that hypothetical 

State that says, you can do either, and the Texas 
situation, is that Texas, in your mind, puts up 
procedural impediments to using the direct appeal 
mechanism and so that, if the other State hasn't done 
that, has made the development of evidence, has provided 
a full opportunity for you to develop a record before 
the direct appeal is over with, that State wouldn't be 
subject to Martinez, and Texas is subject to it only 
because it has the procedural impediments? 

MR. WOLF:  That's correct because the -- the 

scheme that Texas has developed systemically channels 
the habeas claim, the IAC claim, the ineffective 
assistance claim, into habeas.  There is no -- to say 
that it could be done is really an illusion. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How -- how do you want us 

to formulate the rule if we write the opinion in your 
favor?  If a State does not give a realistic 
opportunity -- a feasible means for expanding the record 
on direct review, then Martinez applies because it is 
the collateral proceeding that is the meaningful one --
and then we go through 50 States to see if that rule 
applies? 

MR. WOLF:  Well, it wouldn't really affect

50 States because some States provide a mechanism for an 
abatement to go back on direct appeal and -- and expand 
the record.  Other States require that it go to direct 
appeal, and each -- and those States made -- have made a 
choice. 

And Texas has made a choice by developing 

this scheme.  And as far as the other States, they would 
have to compare themselves to the situation that -- that 
we would -- that would come out of this.  This --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I have the same 

questions that my colleagues have asked.  Could you give 
us, in a sentence or two, the test that you would like 
us to apply?  Where a State does not, like Arizona, 
prohibit the raising of this issue on direct appeal, 
Martinez, nevertheless, applies where the State does 
blank.  Fill in the blank. 

MR. WOLF:  When it makes it impracticable, 

in the vast majority of cases, to raise the claim on 
direct appeal. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Impracticable, in the vast 

majority of cases.  Now, that really would require a 
case-by-case determination in every other State that 
doesn't fall within the Martinez category, wouldn't it? 

MR. WOLF:  Well, not necessarily --

 MR. WOLF:  -- Justice Alito, because 

Page 9

there's -- some States require that their -- their cases 
are directed back to -- to direct appeal, and there's a 
mechanism to expand the record.  There is some -- there 
is -- some require it to go to direct appeal. 

But, in Texas, what we have is a limitation 

that's the rules that the Texas Supreme Court has 
devised, with the Texas --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I understand that. 

But -- so -- so if the State says, you have to raise this 
on direct appeal, but you have to comply with our time 
limits on direct appeal.  And they don't appoint -- you 
know, you don't get a new -- you don't get a new 
attorney on direct appeal.  It's the same attorney who 
represented you at trial.  So that attorney is in the 
position of arguing that he or she was ineffective at 
trial. 

And that would be okay? 
MR. WOLF:  If the -- let me make sure I 

understand the question. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  You have to raise it on 

direct appeal or it's lost.  You can't wait until 
collateral -- until the collateral proceeding, and, by 
the way, you don't get a new attorney.  You get the same 
attorney that represented you at trial.  Would that be

all right? 

MR. WOLF:  No, because the new -- the old 

attorney -- the trial attorney is in the worst, really, 
position to understand his ineffectiveness.  There is a 
disincentive for him --

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  So you have the 
same system where you get a new attorney, but you have 
to comply with the time limits. 

MR. WOLF:  And that --
JUSTICE ALITO:  And then you say, well, I 
can't do all of this social background research that 
Wiggins requires within the time limits, so that's 
impracticable.  Is that State okay? 

MR. WOLF:  No, because that's --
JUSTICE ALITO:  That's not okay, either. 
MR. WOLF:  Because that State is -- in the 
Texas scheme -- in the Texas scheme, the -- Texas gives 
us another attorney in this dual track -- this system, 
and it's understood that that attorney is the habeas 
attorney.  And he doesn't -- he doesn't have that time 
limitation that the direct appeal attorney has, 
that's -- that 75-day limitation. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But is your point that he 

has to have one full and fair opportunity to make the 
Wiggins claim, and it doesn't matter whether it's direct

or collateral?  I think you mentioned that at least one 
State requires you to do it on direct, but does provide 
for developing the record. 

Page 11 

MR. WOLF:  But the -- the bottom line in --
in our situation, in Texas, is that we have a scheme. 
We have a set of -- of laws and -- and rules that 
channel these type of claims. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What are the rules other 
than the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals having said, in 
several decisions, the preferred route is collateral 
review? 

MR. WOLF:  Well, first of all, the -- the 

Rule -- the Rules of Appellate Procedure 21.8 talk about 
the limitations of -- the number of days that you have 
to expand the record in a motion for new trial. 
75 days, the -- the district court loses jurisdiction, 
they cannot hear anything else on this case.  The record 
in this case wasn't even available for 7 months after 
the date of the trial. 

So, even with a new attorney that's 

appointed -- first of all, that new attorney is a 
stranger to the case.  He doesn't know anything about 
the case.  He's not in a position to talk to the client. 
The client is not the best person to understand the 
Rules of Appellate Procedure.

 So he's got to wait on that -- on that trial 

record, first of all, to see what's there.  And then --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm -- I'm not sure 

exactly what Justice Ginsburg's formulation was, but I 
didn't -- I don't understand why you didn't say, oh, 
yes, that's right, there has to be one full fair 
opportunity to raise the issue.  And that's what we are 
arguing here. 

MR. WOLF:  I'm sorry if -- if I missed that, 

but that's exactly the point.  And that's what --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then the next -- then my 

question is:  Does this apply just to capital cases? 

MR. WOLF:  No. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could we in a -- oh.  So 

this doesn't apply just to capital cases, in your 
opinion? 

MR. WOLF:  Not necessarily.  But the -- in 

the capital arena in Texas, we have the dual-track 
system, where you get an attorney appointed 
automatically in a habeas setting, where, in a non-death 
penalty setting, there is a possibility of getting an 
attorney in the interest of justice, but it's not always 
guaranteed.  And, in that case, the appeal is done in a 
successive way, not in this dual-track way. 

And in -- in the death penalty arena, it

manifests -- it makes it even more manifestly obvious 
that there is a systematic channeling by the State 
referring these type of claims into habeas, while the 
State attorney, the district appeals attorney, focuses 
on the record-based claim, and the habeas attorney is 
dealing with all of the case, not just the trial, but 
the -- the appeal, to make sure that there was no 
ineffectiveness on his part, that -- and also to do the 
investigation on the extra-record-based claims, which 
takes a substantial amount of time. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, you -- you 
started to answer this question, but it is something 
raised by many of the amici opposing your position, 
which is that, by adopting your position, we're 
essentially having to examine the 49-plus -- because we 
have territories that have collateral and direct review 
as well -- plus systems to see which apply -- to which 
Martinez applies and which -- to which Martinez 
doesn't apply. 

And so the question is:  How do we write 

this to sort of give enough guidance, so that we're not 
examining each of the 49 -- or 49 systems -- or maybe 
48, after we've decided Martinez? 

MR. WOLF:  Right.  Well, I would suggest --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And -- and why should we

not fear that outcome? 

Page 14 

MR. WOLF:  Okay.  I would suggest the rule 

to be that Martinez applies when a State channels 
ineffective assistance of counsel claims to State habeas 
and makes it impracticable in the vast majority of cases 
to raise the claim on direct appeal. 

And, in answer to your question about all of 

the States, many of the States do make it -- do make 
habeas available in the direct appeal arena.  So it's --

JUSTICE ALITO:  So the reason why -- the 

reason why there was a movement to channel ineffective 
assistance of counsel claims to collateral review is 
that it is often -- maybe in the great majority of 
cases -- impracticable to adjudicate them on direct 
appeal.  So, under your standard, it seems to me that 
covers every State. 

MR. WOLF:  Well, it wouldn't, Justice Alito, 

for this reason:  Many States have a mechanism, unlike 
the Texas scheme, which permits the expansion of the 
record.  Some States, like Utah, who authored the amicus 
brief, has a Rule 21.3, which permits the claimant to go 
back and expand the record.  We don't have the -- that 
ability in Texas. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, your friend 

says, page 18 of his brief, that you do.  He says,

"Under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 21, direct 
appeal counsel can supplement the record with evidence 
developed by investigators and experts, the ones that 
are appointed and paid for by the State on appeal." 

Page 15 

Now, is that just wrong? 
MR. WOLF:  Yes. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay. 
MR. WOLF:  And the reason I say that is, in 
order to obtain a record, one, you need to -- when you 
file your motion for new trial, you have to specifically 
set out the factual basis for the claim; and, two, the 
affidavit has to identify the evidence of any further 
investigation would have revealed. 

So you've got that 30-day window when you 
file that motion for new trial that you have to do all 
of those things, and that's not enough time. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So if everything -- if 

everything in Texas's system were the same, but you had 
a year, would that flip Texas into a different category? 

MR. WOLF:  If the --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is the problem -- is what 

makes this impracticable just the amount of time? 

MR. WOLF:  Yes, because the time -- the 

time -- especially in a Wiggins claim, is prohibitive in 
order to be able to prepare and -- not just the time

there, but the time that is imposed by the Rules of --
of Appellate Procedure. 

Page 16 

That 75-day window, in order to expand the 

record, is part of this whole system, that it's 
understood that habeas claim is the -- the IAC claim 
is channeled into habeas. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me try this one 

more time.  You -- you seem to say, in your brief, that 
the Kansas procedure and the -- the Michigan procedure 
take those States outside of the Martinez category; is 
that correct? 

MR. WOLF:  Yes. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Now, as I 
understand the procedure in those cases, it is the 
following:  On direct appeal, the attorney can make a 
motion for a new trial based on ineffective assistance 
of counsel, and, if some threshold is met, the appellate 
court can remand the case to the trial court for a 
hearing on ineffective assistance. 

Is that correct? 
MR. WOLF:  Yes. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  And that would -- in 

most of those cases, the attorney on direct appeal is 
going to be the attorney who represented the defendant 
at trial and is probably not going to be in a very good

position to argue that he or she was ineffective at 
trial, but that would still be okay? 

Page 17 

MR. WOLF:  Well, but it's a --
JUSTICE ALITO:  And if you don't do that, 

you've lost it. 

MR. WOLF:  Well, there's a problem with 

declaring yourself ineffective.  One, it's -- it's kind 
of counterintuitive.  In Texas, if you declare yourself 
ineffective, there's repercussions.  You're no longer 
available to -- you know, be taken off the list to get 
appointments on these type of claims. 

And -- and it's also against the Bar rules 

to -- to have that adverse interest against your client. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, if that is the 
system in Kansas and Michigan, then why -- why is it 
outside Martinez, if the point is you can't effectively 
present the ineffective assistance counsel when you've 
got the same counsel who was alleged to have been 
ineffective and is not going to condemn himself? 

MR. WOLF:  Well, that -- as far as their 
State -- you know, other States are concerned -- you 
know, those are problems within those States.  But as 
far as Texas is concerned -- you know, we are in a 
situation that we find ourselves in -- in a Martinez 
situation, where there was no ability to -- to raise --

the system that we have prevents you from raising this 
claim. 

Page 18 

And, as far as the other States are 

concerned, some of the States have a more liberal 
opportunity to -- to expand the record, but that's not 
the system that we have in Texas.  And this --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Explain why the time that 

you have on direct appeal isn't adequate.  So you say 
you need -- need to investigate.  Well, some of the 
things, like school records, his prison records, it 
doesn't take a long time to get those, does it? 

MR. WOLF:  Well, it -- it takes a while. 
I'm not going to say a long while, but releases are 
required.  Sometimes, there's opposition to releasing 
those records.  But the biggest part of -- of this whole 
problem is getting the record, is also, in our 
situation, to have Mr. Trevino evaluated regarding 
his -- there was never a psychological or sociological 
study done in his case, and to have a psychological eval 
done, that doesn't happen in 30 days. 

And one -- you've got to get the records, 
and, in some of these situations, one record leads to 
another record, finding one witness leads to another 
witness.  And, by the time you start developing all 
these other avenues and when you put all that together,

then you're in a position to present that to an expert, 
in order to make that sort of evaluation.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, surely --

surely, the trial court in Texas, when it gets a new 
trial motion within 30 days, and the new counsel on 
appeal says, well, I have reason to believe -- well, we 
can see that there wasn't an adequate investigation of 
mitigating circumstances or whatever made below, and I 
would like the time to conduct -- you know, the 
psychological evaluation or to contact these witnesses, 
is the trial court going to say no? 

MR. WOLF:  That's correct because the 

30 days is -- is a limit; it's a bar.  That's all he 
has.  And, in addition, the -- the direct appeal 
attorney has his own responsibilities.  There's a 
division of labor that's here, that the direct appeal 
attorney is supposed to review the entire record, to 
look for all of whatever errors that might be there. 

And while -- and that's why, in Texas, where 
you have this dual-track system in order to expedite the 
appeal, there is a new attorney that's appointed to do 
the habeas work. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And because of the rather 

sharp disagreements in the briefs on what the actual 
facts are here, I looked at the brief filed by the State

Bar of Texas in support of neither party. 

Can you tell me -- and that they are 

Page 20 

critical of having new counsel work simultaneously on a 
simultaneous timeframe concurrently with the -- with the 
new direct appeal counsel. 

Can you tell me how anything that's said in 

the Texas Bar briefs helps your case? 

MR. WOLF:  Well, it helps our case because 
it recognizes the dual-track system, and it recognizes 
that the extra record under Section 12.22 of the 
guide -- of the Texas guidelines that -- that were 
formulated that the State Bar was -- one of their 
committees on indigent defense helped develop. 

They recognize the fact that extra record 

investigation is the responsibility of the habeas 
counsel. 

I would like to reserve the balance of my 

time. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. OLDHAM

ineffectiveness claims are some of the most generous in 
the country.  Those procedures offered Petitioner two 
bites at the apple. 

Page 21 

The first bite came in a constitutionally 

protected direct appeal proceeding.  And any deficiency 
in that proceeding would have been the source of cause 
under existing cause and prejudice standards to excuse a 
subsequent default. 

Allowing the Petitioner to assert cause on 
the basis of a second bite at the apple -- that is, a 
State habeas proceeding -- would create an unwarranted 
and unworkable extension of Martinez. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why is it a second bite 

when the Texas Supreme Court -- court of criminal 
appeals, has said, again and again, as a general rule, 
defendants should not raise ineffective assistance of 
trial counsel on direct appeal, should raise it on 
collateral review? 

MR. OLDHAM:  Justice Ginsburg, the very next 
sentence of that opinion, Mata v. State, states that the 
lack of a clear record, usually, will prevent the 
appellant from meeting the first part of the Strickland 
test as the reasonableness of counsel's choices and 
motivations during trial can be proven deficient only 
through facts that don't normally appear in the

appellate record. 

So the only question presented by those 

instructions that are quoted over and over again in the 
Petitioner's briefs is whether and to what extent 
newly-appointed counsel -- as Justice Alito was pointing 
out, Texas provides newly-appointed counsel on direct 
appeal in capital cases -- can supplement the appellate 
record with an explanation from the trial -- trial 
counsel. 

And where the new counsel gets an 

explanation of the strategies of the trial counsel, the 
record is then complete --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I don't -- does the 
statement "defendants should not raise ineffective 
assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal" doesn't 
mean what it says? 

MR. OLDHAM:  Oh, yes, ma'am.  It does mean 

that.  It's just that what -- what the Court is 
saying -- the very next sentence following the ones that 
are quoted in the Petitioner's brief, says, "The reason 
that one should not raise an issue of ineffective 
assistance of counsel on direct appeal is because, in 
cases where there is no explanation from the trial 
counsel, it will be impossible to adjudicate the first 
prong of the Strickland test."

 It doesn't say that, as a general rule, you 

should just never do it.  It just says, if you are 
actually going to raise a claim of ineffective 
assistance, you should create the proper record before 
you do it.  And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But then -- but the 

comment is that the record has to be done within a very 
short period of time, and the -- and the trial record 
isn't even available for -- the transcript, for some 7 
months. 

MR. OLDHAM:  Yes, Justice Kennedy, and that 
is why Texas has a procedure for abating and remanding 
appeals that is material identical to the one that 
Kansas provides and the Petitioner concedes is 
sufficient to satisfy this Court's inquiry in Martinez. 
So the way that the procedure in Texas would 
work, as it does in Kansas, is that the newly appointed 
direct appeal lawyer -- who has no conflict and is, 
therefore, free to accuse trial counsel of being 
ineffective -- would file a motion to stay the appeal, 
abate it, and remand it to the trial court. 

The showing in both States is roughly the 

same; it's a facially plausible claim of 
ineffectiveness. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So the new counsel on

direct waits for 7 months, gets the transcript.  In the 
meantime, let's assume has made some investigation, and 
he said -- and he tells the appellate court, we have 
some very important material that we want to introduce 
and we need to supplement the record; please remand this 
case. 

MR. OLDHAM:  Yes, Your Honor.  And one 

point --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That -- that has never 

happened in the State of Texas in a capital case, I take 
it? 

MR. OLDHAM:  I'm not aware of a capital 
case, but it has been done in many, many noncapital 
cases.  And the Court of Criminal Appeals has 
specifically blessed it, especially -- particularly in a 
case involving a Wiggins type ineffective assistance of 
counsel at punishment phase. 

That is a case called Cooks v. State.  It's 

cited on pages 32 and 34 of our brief. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the Fifth Circuit was 

wrong, the circuit that ruled in favor of Texas, but 
said, in the Ibarra case, the Texas Court of Criminal 
Appeals has made it clear that State habeas petitions --
and the State habeas petition is the preferred vehicle 
for developing ineffective assistance claims?

 Was that wrong? 
MR. OLDHAM:  I believe it just needs to be 
taken in the context of -- it is the preferred vehicle 
if you have not developed the record to bring a claim --
or to bring a claim appropriately on direct appeal. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you just please --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Oldham, I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Sotomayor. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let me understand what 
you are suggesting.  Counsel doesn't have a record.  He 
or she is newly appointed.  Can they go into court and 
say, I don't know if there is an ineffective assistance 
of counsel claim, but I need to protect my client and 
abate this hearing now, until I get the trial record, 
whether it takes 6 months, 7 months, or a year. 

What will the court do with its rule that 

requires counsel to provide affidavits setting forth the 
good-faith basis for a claim? 

MR. OLDHAM:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, 

many -- many prisoners in Texas, in capital and 
noncapital contexts alike, have done that within the 
30 days, but I want to emphasize --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How many were given an 
indefinite stay until they got the trial record to set

forth the affidavits? 

Page 26 

MR. OLDHAM:  Well, if it's done within the 

first 30 days, you don't need a stay, indefinite or 
otherwise.  You can just file --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what do you do with 
the 75-day rule, which I think is absolute, which says, 
if the court hasn't ruled on the new trial within 
75 days, the matter ends? 

MR. OLDHAM:  I think the easiest way to 
think about it is there are basically three stages. 
There is the first 30-day window, and, as I say, many 
capital and noncapital prisoners have effectively 
brought their claims in that 30-day window. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Some of them have the 

information, and some don't. 

MR. OLDHAM:  That's correct. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So --
MR. OLDHAM:  So that's the first box, but 

it's certainly not the last. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The guys who do it, it's 

because they have the information, and so they've 
exhausted their claim.  But we are talking about the 
people who don't. 

MR. OLDHAM:  So to the second -- the second 
box.  After the new trial motion has been denied by an

operation of law, you can make, effectively, a factual 
proffer of -- so the -- the trial court no longer has 
jurisdiction to grant your motion, but you can make a 
factual proffer of what you would have shown and what 
you want to show to the court of appeals. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That assumes you get the 

transcript. 

MR. OLDHAM:  Well, we are still prior to the 

transcript because this is still -- this is still --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, the 75 days has 

passed. 

MR. OLDHAM:  And then, after that, there is 
no briefing that has been done in the appellate court at 
this point because the appellate briefing schedule and 
the transcript production are tied to one another, so it 
would never be a case where you're actually litigating a 
direct appeal without the transcript.  You -- the latter 
doesn't start until you get the former. 

And, at that point, you can make a motion to 

stay and abate to return to the district court and to 
supplement the record with evidence of your trial 
counsel's ineffectiveness. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Even beyond the 

75 days? 

MR. OLDHAM:  Yes, Your Honor.  It

effectively restarts the 30-day clock, so the -- the old 
75 days is obviously gone, and you get a new 35 days on 
the stay and abate motion.  So, in that sense, it's 
materially identical to the procedure that Kansas 
applies, although, as I mentioned earlier, in capital 
cases, the State of Texas guarantees its prisoners a new 
conflict-free lawyer, who can help with that proceeding. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So he can do this -- I 

didn't understand this.  I'm sorry. 

Joe Smith is convicted on day 1.  The 

transcript appears 9 months later.  Okay?  9 months 
later his new lawyer, who is supposed to proceed on 
appeal, reads the transcript.  He thinks, hmm, I think 
there was a problem with his lawyer at the trial, and I 
would like to raise this claim and get a new trial. 

And you are saying what he does is he goes 

back to the trial court, and he says, Judge, I just read 
this, it raises some factual matters; will you please 
give me an evidentiary hearing with the old lawyer there 
and me there, so we can develop this? 

Now, that is what -- how Texas works? 
MR. OLDHAM:  Your --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Because I did not get that 
impression from the State Bar brief, but you are saying 
that is how it works?

appeals, will you please direct the trial court to have 
an evidentiary hearing on the adequacy of trial counsel 
before you hear the appeal? 

MR. OLDHAM:  You ask for --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that yes or no? 
MR. OLDHAM:  Yes, although it's called a new 

trial motion. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even if you haven't made 

the new trial motion within the 30 days, initially? 

MR. OLDHAM:  That's right.  This is the --

saying that they are all wrong about how Texas works, so 
I guess you -- you could refer to a case where that 
happened. 

MR. OLDHAM:  Yes, Your Honor.

happen? 

MR. OLDHAM:  It's called Cooks vs. State.

the trial performance.  So we go to the Federal 
appeals -- the State appeals court, and we say, State 
appeals court, please direct an evidentiary hearing. 
And they directed an evidentiary hearing, 
and they had an evidentiary hearing before the trial 
judge -- really, what would have happened on State 
habeas? 

MR. OLDHAM:  Except that they didn't get 
actually get the evidentiary hearing in Cooks because 
there was no facially plausible showing of the claim 
that they would have raised.  But --

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, I am 

puzzled about what I'm supposed to do because I would 
have thought that the standard's fairly easy, that this 
individual must always have one full and fair 
opportunity to present his claim of inadequate 
assistance at trial. 

There are certain things that could deprive 
him of that.  One, his lawyer in the habeas State could 
be incompetent -- all these lawyers could be 
incompetent.  Or the State, at a certain stage, didn't 
give him enough proceeding.  All right? 

Well, what do I do, where people are 

disagreeing about how the State procedure works, as to 
whether it was full and fair?  What do I do?  What is

your suggestion? 

By the way, if he doesn't get the full and 
fair, he still has to show to the Federal habeas judge 
that he has a substantial claim, that that trial was 
not -- so what do you suggest? 

MR. OLDHAM:  Well, Your Honor, where he 

doesn't get a full and fair opportunity, whether it's 
because his new lawyer is ineffective, his old lawyer 
was ineffective, the transcript wasn't available, the 
very case that we're talking about, the Cooks case, 
recognizes that that is a violation of the United States 
Constitution. 

And you have -- that prisoner would have a 
constitutional claim to assert for the failure of his 
counsel, the failure of the circumstances --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Right now -- but I'm saying 

What do you -- I would like you to sympathize with my 
problem.  My problem is I have seen -- I have a bunch of 
briefs.  And they seem to me that what you have just 
described is a full and fair procedure to develop all these 
evidentiary matters before the appeal even takes place. 
It exists in Texas, and, therefore, unless 
he could say his lawyer there was incompetent, he's out 
of luck.  Okay?  The other side seems to say, no, it 
doesn't exist in Texas.  And, now, what am I supposed to

do, since I am not an expert on Texas procedure? 

Page 32 

MR. OLDHAM:  Well, Your Honor, I think you 
could do one of two things.  You could always certify 
the question with the Court of Criminal Appeals if you 
thought that the question -- that the answer turns on 
what the Texas procedures are and that the parties 
disagree with them. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I tried that once in a case 

involving Pennsylvania, and the result was such that I 
resolved never to do it again. 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE BREYER:  But -- but don't say never. 
All right.  So one thing we got --
JUSTICE ALITO:  That was a case in which --

that was the case in which the Court unwisely reversed a 
certain Third Circuit decision. 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Oldham, do we have a 

clue, Mr. Oldham, if the information is correct, that 
direct appeal counsel in the county involved here gets 
a very limited amount of money -- gets, they said it's 
$1,500 fixed fee. 

But, if counsel who's appointed as 

collateral review gets $25,000, doesn't that suggest 
that the -- that the counsel on direct appeal is

expected to deal with trial errors and the one that gets 
all this $25,000 can go out and find a psychologist, a 
sociologist, whoever is going to give us a profile on 
this person? 

MR. OLDHAM:  No, Your Honor.  And that is 
because the funding thresholds that are cited for the 
first time in the reply brief are wrong in two respects. 
One is those -- those only came into effect after the 
filing of the State habeas and after the filing of the 
direct appeal in this case. 

But the second -- and perhaps I think more 

relevant sense in which they're wrong, is that those 
apply to the amount of money that are given to the 
lawyers; whereas the subsection (l) provision that we've 
cited in our brief applies to the money for investigators 
and experts. 

It's reimbursement for investigators and 

experts.  It's not the amount of money they give to the 
lawyer. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it true that it's the 
county that reimburses the direct appeal counsel and the 
State reimburses the habeas counsel? 

MR. OLDHAM:  Yes, Your Honor, after 1999. 

But the State habeas application in this case was filed 
a month before that statute went into effect.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but you -- you say 
it's before, but this -- this indicates how Texas views 
its system.  And, as Justice Ginsburg indicates, Texas 
views this system as being one in which the collateral 
appeal -- or the collateral proceeding counsel is in the 
best position to raise IAC claims. 

That's -- that's just where it is.  And 

the -- the State Bar says -- agrees with the 
Respondent -- pardon me -- with the Petitioner on this 
point. 

MR. OLDHAM:  Justice Kennedy, the court of 

criminal appeals has said that the -- that claims of 
ineffective assistance of trial counsel properly can be 
brought on direct appeal. 

The Texas State legislature has said it by 
authorizing a new direct appeal attorney and stating, 
throughout the legislative history -- and I think in the 
text and structure of the statute -- that they intend 
for these claims to be able to be brought on direct 
appeal -- not that they are channeled on direct appeal; 
they're not channeled either way. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, able -- able to be 
brought, Mr. Oldham, but, as Justice Ginsburg started 
off by saying, many times, the court of criminal appeals 
has said the preferred mechanism is to bring it on

collateral appeal. 

And, more to the point even, when attorneys 
try to bring these kinds of claims on a motion for a new 
trial, the typical response is to say, no, this is not 
the proper venue for that, go back and do it again on 
collateral review. 

So we have -- you say that there's a formal 

mechanism that could be used.  But it seems as though 
the courts and the lawyers, both, in Texas, are being 
told continually, don't use that formal mechanism; 
instead, do this on collateral review. 

MR. OLDHAM:  Justice Kagan, I am aware of no 

case where someone's brought a new trial motion that --
in the procedurally proper way -- and been told not to 
do it that way.  I think what we --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, isn't the usual 

response just to dismiss it without prejudice and to 
say, we don't have time to deal with this, go away, come 
back again on collateral review? 

MR. OLDHAM:  No, Your Honor.  That's --

that's the usual response when the record is 
insufficient.  That is, when you haven't -- you haven't

somebody brings a Wiggins claim on this 30-day window, 
the Court says -- you know, there's only 30 days, the 
record is insufficient.  Go away, do it again. 

Page 36 

MR. OLDHAM:  Your Honor, that's not what 

happened in the Armstrong case, where someone brought a 
Wiggins -- it's not what happened in the --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's your one case, it 

seems to me.  You only have one case.  It's Armstrong. 
Armstrong seems to me sort of like proof as to why it is 
that the Texas courts don't do that generally because 
what they did in Armstrong was they ended up trying to 
adjudicate that on the merits and realizing that there 
was -- that the record wasn't sufficient. 

MR. OLDHAM:  Your Honor, it's -- it's not 

the only case -- a similar claim was raised in the 
Motley case, which was cited in our brief.  It was 
also raised in a Rosales case, also cited in our brief. 
Similar Wiggins kinds of cases. 

And then -- in the Motley case, they were 

able to have school teachers testify.  There was a 
neurological examination done.  I mean, it's certainly a 
practical way to do it, and it -- it is as generous or 
more generous than a lot of the States in the country, 
including States that Petitioner concedes are --

that, if you didn't have the mechanism for a new trial, 
then you would form under the Martinez rule? 

Page 37 

MR. OLDHAM:  With no new trial and no 

standing abatement? 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  In other words, no 

opportunity for factual development. 

MR. OLDHAM:  If there was no opportunity to 

develop -- to develop the facts and there was 
practically no opportunity to -- to raise the claim on 
direct appeal, I think the question would still turn on 
whether and to what extent there was a constitutional 
right to have an effective appeal of that issue. 

And the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has 

afforded constitutional protection to that new trial 
window and to the meaningfulness of the record necessary 
to raise these claims on direct appeal.  And I think 
that is what is sufficient to move this case out of the 
Martinez box and into the normal cause and prejudice 
standards that this Court applies --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I -- can I go back 

to what you are proposing, okay, and what you are saying 
this system stands for?  If an ineffective assistance of 
counsel claim is brought on direct appeal, with or 
without a record -- court says, we don't have a record, 
it throws it into collateral review, as I have seen it

do dozens of times -- are you saying, in that situation, 
that Martinez applies? 

Counsel raised it, but was told, we're not 
going to decide it.  Puts them into collateral review. 
Does Martinez apply there? 

MR. OLDHAM:  If it happened in every single 

case and there was no opportunity --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, forget it -- that --

when it happens? 

MR. OLDHAM:  Oh, no, Your Honor.  I don't 
think that Martinez would apply in that circumstance. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay.  So they haven't 

gotten a full and fair opportunity because they’ve 
presented their case, but Texas has said, we don't want 
to do it here, do it there.  You are still saying 
Martinez doesn't apply? 

MR. OLDHAM:  Precisely, because there is no 

default upon which to apply Martinez, so there's 
nothing -- there is no work for Martinez to do in that 
hypothetical, precisely because the claim can be met --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So because it can, but 
Texas chose not to, now there's no protection, there is 
no full and fair opportunity for the petitioner to have 
had that claim adjudicated?

saying. 

MR. OLDHAM:  Well, I'm certainly not 

suggesting that the rule needs to turn on the 
meaningfulness of the opportunity to raise it on direct 
appeal.  I think that Martinez was very clear when it 
said -- whether it's a complete --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You raised it, and the 

State said, well, go to collateral review.  You're 
saying, no -- no Martinez protection? 

MR. OLDHAM:  Well, I don't --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Your counsel was 

ineffective in habeas in that -- in State habeas, you --
you can do nothing about it. 

MR. OLDHAM:  Well, you don't -- there's 

nothing to do in the sense that, in that very 
hypothetical, that very claim could be raised in State 
habeas the first time, but it also could be --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  There's clearly no Martinez 
protection.  The question you are being asked, I think, 
boils down to whether we should develop a new case, 
Martinez plus, in which -- even though there is, 
technically, the ability to raise it, which is all that 
Martinez spoke about, the mere fact that the ability to 
raise it is not effective enough should produce the same 
result that Martinez produced.

 I don't think there is any -- I'm not even 

Page 40

sure the other side claims that Martinez said what --
what he is arguing here. 

MR. OLDHAM:  I think that's exactly right, 
Justice Scalia, and, in the hypothetical that Justice 
Sotomayor was asking, the court's ordinary cause and 
prejudice standards would accommodate for that.  There 
would be no inequity for the court -- for Martinez to do 
anything. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What happens -- imagine we 
have a State supreme court, and it says, okay, you could 
raise this claim on appeal, we don't advise it, we 
think -- it's so much easier to do it in State habeas. 
Please do it in State habeas.  It's not absolutely 
binding, but do it.  Okay?  That's what they are saying. 

Now, he raises nine of his ten ineffective 
assistance of counsel claims in State habeas.  And the 
State habeas court says, no, you are out on all nine, 
but he never raised the tenth. 

Now, we are in Federal court, and the 

prisoner says -- you know, that tenth claim is fabulous. 
And the judge says, it is substantial.  And he says, you 
know why it wasn't raised before?  Because my counsel 
was incompetent on State habeas, and they didn't raise 
it on appeal because that's just how people normally do

things in Texas, they don't raise it on appeal.  They 
wait until State habeas. 

Page 41 

Has that person had a full and fair 

opportunity to raise this tenth claim in the State 
court? 

MR. OLDHAM:  Well, if the -- if the Court by 
hypothesis is telling the Bar not to bring claims under 
any set of circumstances on direct appeal, I think 
that --

JUSTICE BREYER:  They are not saying never. 
They are just saying it works so much better.  What they 
say is we appoint State habeas counsel at the same time, 
it's easier to develop it.  Please.  We won't say never. 
We'll just say hardly ever. 

Now, what's -- what is the -- what is your 
view about whether that person has had a full and fair 
opportunity to develop his tenth ineffective assistance 
claim in the State courts. 

MR. OLDHAM:  Justice Breyer, Martinez should 

not apply, even to that hypothetical. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not even thinking about 
Martinez at the moment because I don't want to get into 
whether it is an extension or just an elaboration or 
just a situation covered, but they didn't think of it or 
just a lot of other things.

 I just want to know, given Martinez, what do 

you think? 

MR. OLDHAM:  I'm not sure how to answer the 

full and fair opportunity question because that --
that's certainly not the standard that we are advocating 
here. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What is the standard you 

are advocating? 

MR. OLDHAM:  We believe that Martinez 

applies where it said that it applies, and that is where 
a State makes a deliberate choice to disallow all claims 
on direct appeal.  We understand the necessity to having 
a Martinez clause to apply to an eventual default. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But if, in fact, they say, 
yes, there is a route, never used, but once, filled with 
minefields, very hard when compared with the other one, 
there you say, it isn't Martinez, it is a totally -- it 
is a new thing because Martinez, after all, had no 
rationale. 

MR. OLDHAM:  Your Honor, I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm being sarcastic there, 
but I don't mean to be.  I mean, you see what I'm trying 
to get to?

dissent said, actually. 
(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, the dissent said that. 
(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  This is -- this is very 

amusing in a capital case. 

Let me ask you this question:  Is there 

anything in the State Bar brief that substantially helps 
your position?  I'm -- I'm very interested in the State 
Bar brief.  It's a little hard for me to parse.  It did 
say there is a conflict of interest in -- between the 
habeas counsel and the -- and the counsel on direct. 
And it also -- it also indicates that the 

habeas counsel has to file the application in the 
convicting court not later than 180 days after -- or not 
later than 45 days after the State's original brief, 
which seems to help the Petitioner here because the 
original brief in -- in the direct appeal proceeding is 
deemed important for the habeas counsel. 

MR. OLDHAM:  Justice Kennedy, I don't think 

there is anything in the State Bar brief that helps 
either side in this sense because the State Bar agrees 
that there were no relevant guidelines of any kind at 
the time of any of the proceedings in this case. 

The only guideline that any Bar association

had promulgated at the time of the direct appeal 
proceeding or State habeas proceeding in this case was 
the 1989 American Bar Association guideline, 11.9.2, 
which specifically told the direct appeal lawyer in this 
case to raise every colorable claim he could, regardless 
of any State procedures to the contrary. 

And, if he had raised a substantial Wiggins 

claim or if he had even tried his best to raise a 
Wiggins claim that could be -- could be amplified and 
further developed on State habeas, we wouldn't be 
standing here today because it would have been properly 
exhausted and adjudicated on the merits in State court. 

So I don't think that the Bar association 
really has anything one way to say or the other, which 
is maybe why it filed on behalf of neither party. 

But to return to Justice Breyer's question, 
I don't think that what -- what we're talking about is 
to come up with anything new.  I think what we're 
talking about in this outside-of-Martinez world is 
actually very old.  We are just talking about the 
Carrier rule, the normal rule that applies to cause and 
prejudice for all defaults in States across the country. 
And I think that the best way to understand 

it is to imagine, in the very hypothetical that you 
offered, where there is just one person who could get

through, that person would have a constitutional claim 
in the State of -- I'm sorry, the other 900 or however 
many there were, those people would have constitutional 
claims in the State of Texas for the deprivation of a 
meaningful opportunity to press their claims on direct 
appeal. 

And as from the Federal -- and that would 

serve as cause, if the State courts denied it, that 
would serve as cause to overcome a default in Federal 
court and to get an adjudication of that claim. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Oldham, I had thought 
that Martinez was really an equitable rule.  It was an 
equitable rule about giving people an opportunity to 
raise a trial ineffectiveness claim. 

And if it's true that, although Texas has a 

technical possibility of doing that outside of 
collateral review, but, in fact, that the lawyers are 
told not to use that route, that the lawyers don't use 
that route, that, if they do use that route, the 
likelihood is that they will be thrown out for using 
that route, the question is why that -- the formal 
availability of a mechanism that nobody uses and that 
everybody is told not to use should matter with respect 
to the application of an equitable rule like Martinez?

for an equitable rule in Martinez to do if you can get 
there another way.  And it's not just that you can raise 
it on direct appeal, it's also that, if your direct 
appeal lawyer doesn't do it, you can, under certain 
circumstances, establish cause against your direct 
appeal -- direct appeal lawyer to overcome an ensuing 
default. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Has there ever been such 

a case, any case in which a direct appeal counsel has 
been held ineffective for failing to present a Wiggins 
claim? 

MR. OLDHAM:  I'm not sure about specifically 
Wiggins claims, but, yes, it is, in fact, established in 
the leading treatise on Texas practice cited by both 
sides that is ineffective assistance of appellate 
counsel to fail to develop the record to allow any claim 
to be adjudicated on direct appeal. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I asked, if there was 

any decisions that says, you should have raised it on 
appeal, appeals counsel didn't rely on the advice of the 
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, and, therefore, because 
counsel followed the advice of Texas Court of Criminal 
Appeals, she was ineffective? 

MR. OLDHAM:  No, Justice -- Justice 

Ginsburg, I am not aware of any particular case on

Wiggins in particular.  But -- but claims against 
appellate ineffectiveness for failure to raise a claim 
on direct appeal are -- are raised and adjudicated on 
the merits all the time in Texas courts. 

Page 47 

And there are specific ones that say that 
ineffective assistance of appellate counsel to fail to 
develop the record using the procedures which the State 
has allowed through the new trial window. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, the -- the Texas 
Court of Criminal Appeals, in addition to saying, as a 
general rule, bring it up on -- on collateral review, 
said -- and there's a reason.  The reason why is the 
undeveloped record on direct appeal would be 
insufficient to establish claims that must be supported 
by extra-record evidence. 

So that seems to be an expectation that 

extra-record evidence will be developed on collateral 
review, not direct appeal. 

MR. OLDHAM:  No, Justice Ginsburg, I think 
it's an expectation that the extra-record evidence will 
be developed, either through the new trial proceeding, 
through a factual proffer following it, or through a 
stay and abatement procedure, to make sure that, when 
the claim actually gets to the court -- the court of 
appeals, that it has a record upon which to adjudicate

the claim. 

That's all that -- and, to the extent that 

the appellate lawyer fails to do that, that can 
constitute cause under the ordinary rules of cause and 
prejudice without creating another Martinez exception, 
which we would submit is going to be highly, highly 
unworkable, given that the court is going to have to 
determine when is a little bit enough and when is not 
enough sufficient for Martinez. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  The Respondent says that the 

Kansas and the Michigan procedures are sufficient to 
take the case -- to take the States outside of Martinez. 
You say your stay and abate proceeding is the same, 
essentially, as those procedures. 

His response is that Texas has used this 

remedy in only one situation, and that is when a 
defendant is deprived of counsel during the new trial 
window and suffers prejudice from the deprivation. 

Now, is that correct. 
MR. OLDHAM:  It's when the counsel -- when 

the prisoner has suffered a deprivation of the 
opportunity to develop the record in the new trial 
window.  So, in the Cooks case, for example, that was --
there was only a lawyer for 10 of the 30 days, and 
the court said the new trial window is a critical stage

for the development of a particular record for raising 
a Wiggins-style claim on direct appeal, and because that 
is so --

Page 49 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Finish your 

sentence. 

MR. OLDHAM:  Thank you. 
And because that is so, where there has been 

a deprivation of counsel in that circumstance that 
prohibits the development of that meaningful record, we 
will allow you to go back, assuming you can show 
prejudice.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN A. WOLF 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. WOLF:  I want to be very clear about 

this abatement issue.  The abatement issue, as 
Justice Alito just said, is only available -- as 
referred in our brief on page 6, is only available when 
there is a denial of the constitutional right to an 
attorney. 

And those situations is when there's a delay 

in appointing the direct appeal attorney after the 
trial.  So, during the 30-day window to file the motion 
for new trial, that time limitation is -- is -- that

clock is running, and, if there's no attorney appointed, 
the constitutional violation is considered a critical 
stage of the trial. 

And since there's -- if there's no attorney 
appointed during those 30 days, that is the only time, 
as Justice Kennedy is correct in saying, that that is 
the time that the abatement procedure is permitted. 
That is the only time. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you are suggesting that 
if -- if an attorney is appointed within a few days or 
within a week, as happened here, that, in that case, 
there would not be that opportunity, it would be the 
30 days, that's it, stop? 

MR. WOLF:  And when that new -- that's 

correct.  And, if a new attorney is appointed because 
there was no attorney appointed, that new attorney, he, 
himself, also has only 30 days.  The clock starts --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But what about -- what 

about the 75-day --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kennedy. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I understood that, if the 
30-day rule had been complied with, within the 75 days, 
you can ask the appellate court to please remand because 
there is some additional evidence to be --
MR. WOLF:  That's not correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- to be determined. 
MR. WOLF:  That is not a correct statement 
of the law, and -- and I would refer the Court to our 
briefs, to the -- to the time that the -- the 
authorities that we cite and also the amicus brief from 
the State Bar of Texas. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what are --

what are these investigators, experts, they're available 
to the new appellate counsel, what -- what are they 
supposed to be doing? 

MR. WOLF:  To the direct appeal attorney? 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, the direct 

appeal attorney.  You say -- basically, you're saying 
there's no way they can do anything within these time 
limits, and, yet, the State procedure provides for 
investigators and experts.  It seems to me it would be 
odd for them to provide for people and to pay for people 
who can't do anything. 

MR. WOLF:  Well, they don't -- to do a 
Wiggins claim -- to do -- they're doing things that 
would -- investigates things that came out of the 
record because that's what is relegated to the direct 
appeal.  The habeas attorney has more money available 
and has more time available to do the things, and it 
becomes a function of time as well.

 But I want to direct the Court's attention 
also to the -- to the statement in Sprouse.  And -- and 
the statement --

Page 52

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The statement? 
MR. WOLF:  In the case of Sprouse, in our --

where am I? 

It's page 20 -- 20 of our reply brief, that 

the position in Sprouse is that there would be no 
constitutional defect if appellate counsel didn't have 
time or the record to raise the ineffective assistance 
claim, and that's because the habeas proceeding is 
available to direct -- to develop the claim and is the 
proper place to do so.  And that's the State's brief. 
It's on page 20 of our reply brief. 

The other thing that I wanted to -- to bring 
to the Court's attention is that the Respondent cites a 
couple of cases that are aberrant -- they're 
aberrations, and they really don't -- shouldn't -- since 
this Court has -- has brought out a sensible rule in 
Martinez and this Court has said this Court's rule 
sensibly speak to the ordinary case, not -- not the 
aberrational.  And that's exactly what we have here. 

The last thing that I wanted to say is -- is 

that the direct appeal, if -- if -- there's a choice 
here that the State has systemically developed a system

that has caused -- that has directed attorneys on appeal 
that the habeas attorney does the extra-record claims, 
the Wiggins-type claims, and that the -- the claims that 
are raised on the record go to the direct appeal 
attorney. 

That is the system that the State has 

developed.  Those are the rules that govern this system 
that have been promulgated by the court of criminal 
appeals and the Supreme Court, and that's the system --
the scheme that we are under. 

And because --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the position 
of the State that says Martinez is relatively new, if 
there is an extension of Martinez to cover this case, 
then at least give the Texas courts the first crack at 
deciding whether there was ineffective assistance of 
counsel, instead of having that done in the Federal 
court? 

MR. WOLF:  We're just looking for the --

because of the procedural default scenario that we find 
ourselves in, we tried to do that. 

And -- and because 11.071 also has -- when 
they -- when that was promulgated in 1995 in order to 
expedite these claims, it provided three things:  One, a 
new attorney; two, the money to fund those claims; and,

three, an abuse of the writ, which is Section 5a, which 
is what we met in -- in our case. 

Page 54 

The Texas scheme, because of that abuse of 

the writ, proceeds -- causes procedural default, and 
that puts us in this quandary, where a person like 
Mr. Trevino is unable to get relief because he has an 
ineffective trial lawyer.  And, now, he is -- that 
ineffective trial lawyer -- his ineffectiveness is being 
insulated by the ineffectiveness of his -- of his habeas 
lawyer. 

And that's not what should happen.  It's --

it's just not equitable, it's not fair.  And 
Mr. Trevino, someone in his situation, should have a 
right to complain about the ineffectiveness of his trial 
lawyer. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
The case is submitted. 
(Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
