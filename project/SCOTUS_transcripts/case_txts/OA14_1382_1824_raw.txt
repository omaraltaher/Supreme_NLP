CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next  in  Case  14­1382,  Americold  Realty  Trust  v.  ConAgra 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Foods. 

            

Mr.  Pospisil. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MICHAEL  D.  POSPISIL 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  issue  before  the  Court  today  is  whose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenship  ­­ citizenship  controls  for  purposes  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diversity  when  a  trust  is  a  named  party  to  a  lawsuit. 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

We  believe,  based  upon  over  200  years  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisprudence  from  this  Court,  the  answer  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trustees.  We  believe  a  bright­line  rule  is  appropriate 

   

  

 

 

 

 

in  this  case,  that  in  a  lawsuit  involving  a  trust,  just 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  with  a  trustee,  the  trustee  should  be  the  party  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest.  And  we  should  compare  it  to  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Why  should  we  get  to  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  if,  when  this  case  began,  even  if  you  looked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  to  the  citizenship  of  the  trustees,  there  was  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complete  diversity? 

 

MR.  POSPISIL:  Your  Honor,  that  ­­ that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

correct.

However,  we  do  argue  ­­ and  we  argued  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tenth  Circuit;  it  was  briefed  ­­ upon  whether  or  not  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  dismiss  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  spoiling  nondiverse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties.  That  issue  was  briefed  under  Evergreen  case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  was  briefed  before  the  Tenth  Circuit;  however, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Tenth  Circuit  did  not  address  that  issue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Respondents  bring  it  up  in  their  brief  now; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

however,  our  position  is  that  this  Court  should  address 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  issue  that's  taken,  that  it  granted  cert  on,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

send  that  issue  back  to  the  Tenth  Circuit  for  review. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  the  Tenth  Circuit  held  here,  the  issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  appealed  on,  was  to  look  at  the  beneficiaries  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposed  to  the  trustees.  And  we  would  submit  to  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that's  just  not  supportable  under  common  law,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  provides  results  in  an  unworkable  test  that  is  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  create  more  confusion  than  looking  at  the  trustees. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  At  common  law,  the  trustees 

  

 

 

 

 

 

could  sue,  couldn't  they? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  They  could,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  these  trustees  could 

  

 

 

 

 

not  sue,  could  ­­ can  they? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  They  cannot,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Because  of  a  new  creature 

   

  

 

 

 

created  by  Maryland  law. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  That's  correct,

Justice  Scalia.  Maryland  law  has  created  a  statutory 

   

  

 

 

 

 

trust,  a  real  estate  investment  trust. 

   

 

 

 

            

However,  our  position  is  that  just  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  trust  can  sue  and  be  sued  as  an  entity,  that  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  change  the  analysis.  There  still  has  to  be  somebody 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  look  to,  some  real  people  that  we  look  to  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine  whose  citizenship  controls. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  this  new  entity  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

called  a  trust,  but  why  is  it  more  like  a  traditional 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

trust  than  it  is  like  another  unincorporated,  artificial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entity,  like  an  L.L.C.? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Your  Honor,  it's  more  ­­ it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  a  trust  because  there  are  two  attributes  that  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trust  have,  that  have  historically  had.  There  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separation  between  legal  ownership,  and  beneficial  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable  ownership.  We  have  it  in  this  case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  you  look  at  Maryland  law,  they  define 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

REIT  as  an  unincorporated  business  trust  in  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  is  acquired,  held,  managed,  administered, 

 

 

 

 

 

controlled,  invested,  or  disposed  of  for  the  benefit  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

profit  of  any  person  who  may  become  a  shareholder.  That 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguishes  between  legal  ownership  and  equitable 

 

 

 

 

 

ownership. 

            

The  next  step  we  look  at  is  that  the  common 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law,  when  that's  the  situation,  when  you  have  a  trust,

you  look  and  see  did  the  trustees  have  the  customary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power  to  control,  to  manage,  and  to  oversee  the  assets. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Also  including  to  control  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  So  who  ­­ who  owns  ­­ who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owns  these  assets  under  Maryland  law?  Is  it  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trustees,  or  is  it  this  ­­ this  new  corporation­type 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entity? 

            

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  the  entity  that  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sue,  and  I  assume  that  that's  the  entity  that  owns  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property. 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  It  can  be  both,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Under  Maryland  law  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  ­­ and  the  trustees  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort  of  in  the  position  of  managers  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Your  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ just  ­­ just  as  though 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ you  hired  a  ­­ a  CEO. 

   

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  I  would  disagree,  Your  Honor. 

    

 

 

 

 

Under  Maryland  law,  the  assets  of  a  real  estate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

investment  trust  can  be  held  by  the  trustees,  or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trust  in  its  entity. 

 

 

 

            

Again,  I  don't  think  that  makes  the  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

changes  the  analysis  at  all.  It  ­­ it's  still  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenship  we  would  look  to.

MR.  POSPISIL:  It  can  be. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Or  ­­ or  the  trustees. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  POSPISIL:  That's  correct,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You  mean  in  ­­ in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  case,  or  you  can  have  a  different  type  of  trust? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  In  one  case. 

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  In  one  case. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  POSPISIL:  In  one  case,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  will  say  this,  Justice  Scalia,  that  no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  in  the  country  that  we  have  found  has  ever  held 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  legal  ownership  goes  in  the  name  of  a  trust 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiary.  The  ownership  is  always  in  the  name  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trust  or  the  trustees.  It  is  never  held  in  the  name  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  beneficiaries. 

 

            

And  we  think  that  is  controlling  here  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reason  that  ­­ Navarro  is  pretty  clear  on  this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

When  you  have  a  trustee  that  has  absolute  control,  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  look  at  the  beneficiaries.  If  the  ­­ if  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trustee  has  absolute  control  and  legal  ownership  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trust  assets,  that's  where  you  look  to.  That  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  what  happened  in  Navarro. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That  was  a  trustee  who  had

the  authority  to  sue,  right,  in  the  trustee's  own  name? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  That  is  correct,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

And  that  ­­ that  is  what  happened  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  that's  not  the  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  That  is  what  happened  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Navarro. 

            

However,  the  trust  in  Navarro  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts  trust,  and  it  could  have  sued  in  its  own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

name  as  well. 

 

 

            

And  the  way  that  Navarro  was  framed  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower  court  when  they  decided  the  opinion  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  held  that,  for  purposes  of  a  business 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

trust,  we  look  to  the  citizenship  of  the  beneficiaries. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  Court  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  didn't  ­­ didn't  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

Carden  treated  Navarro  as  a  case  where  the  suit  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  the  individual  members,  the  individual  trustees, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trustees  as  individuals,  not  the  trust. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  That's  correct,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  I  thought  Carden  was 

   

  

 

 

 

trying  ­­ was  set  up  ­­ if  you're  a  corporation,  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  thing.  If  you're  any  other  kind  of  association,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  to  the  members,  the  shareholders.  I  mean  the  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  limited  partners  as  well  as  the  partners.  Just

drawing  a  clear  line  between  corporations  on  one  side, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  other  associations,  and  ­­ with  the  ­­ with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

added  notion  that,  if  Congress  wants  to  make  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different,  Congress  can  do  that. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Your  Honor,  we  believe  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Carden  did  is  Carden  tells  us  if  you're  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporation,  if  you're  another  entity  but  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporation,  we  need  to  look  behind  the  curtain,  so  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speak,  and  look  to  somebody  else  to  see  whose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenship  controls. 

 

            

Carden  did  not  involve  a  trust,  didn't 

   

 

 

 

 

involve  ­­ did  not  involve  trustees,  and  did  not  involve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trust  assets  or  trust  beneficiaries.  That's  why  Navarro 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  not  control  in  Carden,  and  why  Carden  does  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

control  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

            

Carden  tells  us  the  first  step  we  have  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  we  have  to  look  through  the  trust.  We  have  to  look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  somebody.  Carden  dealt  with  a  partnership.  And  in 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

terms  of  a  partnership,  relying  on  a  long  line  of  cases, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Carden  said  that  for  partnerships,  we  look  at  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members. 

            

Well,  there  are  no  members  in  a  trust. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

There  are  no  members.  At  common  law,  a  partnership  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

owned  by  members.  They  had  a  legal  ownership  of  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

partnership  and  the  assets.

That  just  didn't  exist  at  ­­ at  common  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  trusts. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  this  is  not  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

traditional  trust,  because  this  is  shareholders  and  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiaries. 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It  ­­ it's  a  very 

   

  

 

 

 

different  sort  of  concept.  So  now  you're  asking  us  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  and  place  trustee  law  above  our  general  rule,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  either  a  corporation  or  you're  not. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Justice  Sotomayor  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  only  the  corporation 

  

 

 

 

 

can  have  a  place  of  business  or  an  ­­ a  place  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporation. 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Your  Honor,  we  ­­ we  admit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  nomenclature  is  "shareholder."  That's  what's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

used  in  the  Real  Estate  Investment  Trust  Act  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland. 

            

However,  that's  not  to  be  equated  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  business  entity.  It's  a  shareholder  is  what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

they  are  called,  but  still  they  are  the  beneficial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owners.  The  ­­ the  ­­ the  definition  I  read  to  you  of  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

REIT  under  Maryland  law  makes  clear  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shareholders  own  ­­ that  the  trustees  own  the  property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  benefit  ­­ or  the  trust,  for  the  benefit  of  the

shareholders. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  thought  the 

    

 

 

shareholders  owned  the  property.  They  had  the  legal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest  in  the  law. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  No,  Your  Honor.  No.  It's 

  

  

  

 

 

 

either  the  trust  or  the  trustees  under  Maryland  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  Carden  gets  us  halfway.  The  next  thing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  need  to  do  is  look  at  Navarro,  and  Navarro  tells  us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  it's  management  and  customary  to  control  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assets,  we  look  to  the  trustees. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  would  tell  the  Court  that  the  trustees  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  are  very  identical  to  the  power  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trustees  in  the  Navarro  case.  If  you  look  at  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petition  for  writ,  and  the  appeal,  on  the  page  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appendix,  page  60,  that's  the  amended  statement  of  trust 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  Americold  Realty  Trust. 

 

 

 

            

In  Section  5.1  on  page  60,  it  defines  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

board  of  trustees  and  what  their  powers  are.  "Under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Trust"  ­­ this  is  a  quote  ­­ "the  business  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affairs  of  the  Trust  shall  be  managed  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direction  of  the  board  of  trustees,  and  the  board  shall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  full,  exclusive,  and  absolute  power,  control,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  over  any  and  all  property  of  the  Trust.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

board  may  take  any  action  as,  in  its  sole  judgment  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion,  is  necessary  or  appropriate  to  conduct  the

business  and  affairs  of  the  Trust." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That  is  almost  identical  to  the  language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  to  describe  the  trustees  in  Navarro.  Importantly, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Navarro  ­­ this  is  a  quote  from  Navarro  as  well  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"The  Court  has  never  analogized  express  trust  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business  entities  for  purposes  of  diversity 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction."  Navarro  realized  that  they  were 

  

 

 

 

 

separate. 

            

And  Carden  realized  that  it  was  separate, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too.  In  Carden,  this  Court  specifically  held  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real  party  in  interest  test  that  was  adopted  and  used 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  Navarro  was  unique  because  it  was  the  common  law's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealings  with  trustees,  which  just  didn't  exist  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Carden. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  I  thought  that  the 

    

 

 

 

distinction  in  Carden  was  quite  plain,  that  Carden  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  against  the  individual  trustees,  not  against  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trust.  Carden  did  say  that. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Carden  distinguished  Navarro; 

  

 

 

 

that's  correct,  Your  Honor.  That  is  correct. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  On  the  ground  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

suit  there  was  against  the  individual  trustees,  not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trust. 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  That's  correct.  However, 

  

  

 

 

Carden  did  not  decide  that  issue  because,  again,  the

trust  was  not  at  ­­

 

 

 

 

  

there  was  not  a  trust  issue  in 

   

 

 

 

 

Carden.  However,  if  you  look  at  Navarro,  what  Navarro 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  is  even  though  the  trustees  were  the  named  parties, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Navarro  Court  went  ahead  and  looked,  and  said  let's  look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  not  only  the  trustees  and  what  their  power  is,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's  look  at  the  beneficiaries.  Shall  we  look  at  them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  well?  There's  9,500  of  those. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

 

And  the  Court  specifically  said  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

irrelevant.  We  do  not  look  at  the  9,500  beneficiaries 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  this  trust.  So  the  Court  didn't  have  a  trust  as  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party  in  front  of  it,  but  it  went  ahead  and  took  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

next  step  to  say,  look,  who  do  we  need  to  look  at?  Do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  need  to  look  at  the  beneficiary  owners,  or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trustees? 

            

And  that  same  analysis  applies  here.  And  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  matter  if  the  Trust  is  the  named  party  or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trustees.  The  decision  is  still  going  to  be  the  same. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A  decision  has  to  be  made  at  who  you  look  to. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

We  would  submit  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  thought  that  one  of  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

virtues  of  Carden  was  that  it  just  set  up  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorical,  bright­line  rule.  Everything  that's  an 

  

 

 

 

 

artificial  legal  entity  that's  not  a  corporation  ought 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  treated  in  the  same  way.  Doesn't  matter  what  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

call  yourself;  you  can  put  trust  in  the  title,  or  not

put  trust  in  the  title.  If  you're  an  artificial  legal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entity  that  is  not  a  corporation,  that's  subject  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  of  Carden. 

 

 

            

And  there's  something,  too,  just  doing  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  that  bright­line,  categorical  way,  so  that  we  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  look  at  the  thousands  of  different  variations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

among  legal  entities  and  decide  which  fits  in  which  box. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Your  Honor,  Carden  dealt  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  partnership  that  had  members.  Again,  there  are  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members  in  a  trust.  So  if  we  export  the  language  used 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Carden  to  say  you  have  to  go  ­­ look  at  the  members 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they're  who  you  really  look  at,  well,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closest  thing  to  a  member  of  a  trust  is  going  to  be  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trustees;  it's  not  going  to  be  the  beneficiary. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Let's  look  back  at  common  law.  When  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

partnership  ­­ before  they  could  sue  or  be  sued  in  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own  name,  a  partnership  always  had  to  have  ­­ the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members  of  that  partnership  had  to  bring  the  cause  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action. 

            

Now  let's  look  at  the  common  law  for  a  trust 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  a  trust  could  be  sued  or  sue  in  its  own  name.  In 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  circumstances,  the  trustees  were  in  charge  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation.  It  was  the  trustees  that  brought  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuit. 

            

So  to  the  extent  that  Carden  sheds  any  light

on  what  is  a  member  and  what  is  not  a  member  for  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trust,  we  submit  that  the  most  analogous  thing  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  trustee  is  the  equivalent  to  a  member  for  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partnership.  The  problem  with  the  Tenth  Circuit's  rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  at  all  the  beneficiaries,  that's  going  to  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  that  is  so  unworkable  that  in  certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  you're  not  even  going  to  be  able  to  tell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  is  a  beneficiary. 

   

 

            

For  example,  some  trusts,  like  a  charitable 

   

 

 

 

 

trust,  don't  even  have  beneficiaries  identified. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Why  should  it  matter  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

long  as  it's  not  a  corporation? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Because,  Your  Honor,  again, 

  

 

 

 

 

we  go  impact  to  how  trusts  have  been  treated  separately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  distinctly,  as  a  historical  matter,  for  hundreds  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

years.  A  trust  has  never  been  held  to  be  equal  to  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business  entity. 

 

            

There  are  basically  three  different 

 

 

 

 

categories:  There's  a  corporation;  there's  an 

   

  

 

 

unassociated  ­­ unincorporated  association,  excuse  me; 

 

 

 

 

 

and  there  are  trusts.  And  they  are  different. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  beneficiary  analysis  used  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tenth  Circuit,  again,  not  only  it  would  be  hard  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identify  who  some  beneficiaries  are,  but  we  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes  ­­ look  at  Navarro.  There  were  9,500

one? 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  How  many  are  there  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  POSPISIL:  There  are  between  100  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

200,  Your  Honor.

how  many  are  ­­ are  there  normally  in  these  special

MR.  POSPISIL:  To  be  a  Real  Estate

benefits,  it's  got  to  be  at  least  at  100. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  At  least  a  hundred. 

   

  

 

 

MR.  POSPISIL:  At  least  100. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Do  you  know  of  any  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  more  than  a  thousand? 

   

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Oh,  yes. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Really? 

  

 

MR.  POSPISIL:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  If  you  look 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  amicus  that  was  filed  by  NAREIT,  they  point  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  are  some  publicly  traded  REITs  that  have  tens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  millions  of  shareholders  or  beneficiaries.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they're  not  only  all  across  the  country;  they're  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

across  the  world.

identify  who  the  beneficiaries  are  at  any  given  time? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  Court  has  made  clear,  specifically  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  purposes,  that  we  need  a  simple  test  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  can  use  that  says  we  don't  need  to  look  behind  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dig  down  deep  in  the  weeds.  Let's  just  look  at  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  figure  out  who  do  we  look  to.  And  the  proper  way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  that  is  the  trustees.

very  easy  to  find  out  who  those  trustees  are.  All  you

Maryland  Secretary  of  State,  and  you  can  look  up  and

who  those  five  individuals  are.  There's  no  place,  ever, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  look,  prior  to  extensive  discovery,  which  is  going  to

are.  That's  just  ­­

mean,  it  ­­ it  is  the  person  who's  invoking  diversity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  has  to  show  the  diversity,  and  if  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't,  then  you  sue  in  State  court.

Your  Honor.  However,  the  purpose  of  a  diversity 

   

  

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  is  to  get  a  neutral  playing  ground  for  ­­

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  that's  true  of

MR.  POSPISIL:  That's  true,  Your  Honor.  And

Federal  jurisdiction?  I  mean,  this  is  standard, 

    

 

 

 

 

run­of­the­mill  commercial  dispute  about  a  commercial 

   

 

 

 

accident.  And  adopting  one  position  would  limit  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  times  that  such  disputes  would  be  brought  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  court.  The  other  one  will  expand  it.  Is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ I  mean,  does  Americold  really  feel  that  it's  not

MR.  POSPISIL:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  They  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

they  believe,  like  a  lot  of  businesses  do,  that  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  more  neutrality  in  a  level  playing  ground  in  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  court,  not  only  in  Kansas,  but  all  across  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country.  Wherever  ­­ Americold  has  175  different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

locations,  with  ­­ with  deep  ­­ cold  storage;  excuse  me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They're  all  across  the  country.  They  can  be  sued 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anywhere. 

            

And  under  the  rule  the  Tenth  Circuit  has  put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forth,  they're  never  going  to  be  able  to  go  to  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  It's  just  never  going  to  happen.  It's  almost

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  maybe  that's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

problem  for  ­­ for  Congress  as  ­­ as  the  problem  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporations  was.  You  know,  Congress  adopted  a  special 

   

  

 

 

 

 

rule  for  corporations,  and  maybe  it  ought  to  adopt  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special  rule  for  real  estate  investment  trusts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Congress  always  could,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

Honor.  However,  I  don't  think  they  have  to  in  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  because  I  think  this  Court's  opinion  in  Navarro, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

coupled  with  Carden,  provide  the  answer.

I  thought  in  a  common  law  trust,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

trustees  had  legal  title.  They  owned  the  assets.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  sued  individually,  and  ­­ and  they  could  sue  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  own  names. 

 

 

            

In  this  REIT,  as  I  understand  it,  the  assets 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  in  the  name  of  the  Trust,  not  in  the  name  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  trustees,  and  it  is  the  Trust  that  sues  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  be  sued,  not  the  individual  trustees. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Am  I  wrong  about  those  ­­

   

 

 

 

MR.  POSPISIL:  You  are  wrong  in  the  second 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

point,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right  ­­

  

 

 

 

MR.  POSPISIL:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ so  go  ­­ I'm  right  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  first  part. 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Yes.  The  ­­ the  ­­ the  point 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  you're  incorrect  is  under  Maryland  law  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  statute,  the  property  of  a  trust  can  be  held  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

name  of  the  trust  itself,  or  the  trustees. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Do  you  have  a  section 

   

  

 

 

 

for  that?  I'm  going  to  look  it  up,  so. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Okay. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Because  that's  not  how  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

originally  understood  things,  but  ­­ that's  all  right  ­­

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ you  can  give  it  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  rebuttal. 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Justice  Sotomayor,  it's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

Maryland  Code  of  Corporations  and  Associations  Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8­301(12).  And  that  provision  ­­ it's  also  on  page  14 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  our  reply  brief,  the  yellow  brief.  And  that  statute, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  provision  says:  "A  REIT  may  hold  and  dispose  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal  title  to  property  either,  quote,  in  the  name  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  trust  or  in  the  name  of  the  trustees." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Thank  you. 

  

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  So  we  ­­ we  believe  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper  test  is  ­­ is  a  combination  between  Navarro  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Carden  and  we  should  look  at  the  trustees  and  it  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  whether  or  not  the  real  estate  investment  trust 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  sue  on  its  own  behalf  or  has  to  sue  through  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trustees.  It's  all  clear  that  the  beneficiaries  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trust  never  have  legal  ownership;  so,  therefore,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  never  look  to  them. 

 

 

 

 

            

If  the  Court  has  any  other  questions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise  I'll  remain  my  time.

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

We  urge  the  Court  to  adopt  and  reaffirm  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bright­line  ruling  announced  in  Carden  that  artificial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entity  associations  sued  or  suing  in  their  own  names 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must  measure  their  diversity  citizenship  by  all  of  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members,  which  would  include  those  persons  who  own  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficial  interest  in  the  entity. 

 

 

 

 

            

In  this  case,  that  would  be  the  shareholder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members  of  a  REIT  who  are  in  perfect  accord  with  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited  partners'  ownership  interest  in  Carden. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Would  you  describe 

  

 

 

 

 

beneficiaries  as  a  member  ­­ member  of  a  trust?  I  mean, 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

as  you  articulate  it.  I  think  what's  different  than 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

this,  and  Carden  sort  of  gets  you  past  the  trust.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  then  have  to  still  make  a  choice:  Okay.  We're  not 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  look  at  the  trust.  Do  we  look  at  the  trustees 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  the  beneficiaries?  And  I  ­­ I  don't  know  if  I'd  call 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiaries  members  of  a  trust. 

   

 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  I  think  it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

important  to  understand  that  there  is  a  very  significant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction  between  a  shareholder  of  a  REIT  and  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

beneficiary  of  a  common  law  traditional  trust. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

As  set  forth  in  the  appendix  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petition,  page  79,  which  is  the  Declaration  of  Trust  for

property  interest  in  the  shares.  They  do  not  have  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest  in  the  property  of  the  trust  entity,  and  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  no  right  to  compel  any  partition,  division, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dividend,  or  distribution  of  the  trust  property. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that  makes  them  uniquely  different  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  common  law  beneficiary  who  actually  has  an  equitable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ownership  interest  in  the  trust  property. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Under  common  law  traditions,  the  trustee 

 

 

 

 

 

holds  the  legal  title  to  the  asset  but  only  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit  of  those  persons  who  are  named  as  beneficiaries. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  those  beneficiaries  have  equitable  rights  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  that's  legally  nominally  in  the  name  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trustee. 

            

Here  the  shareholder  members,  as  we  describe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them,  only  have  an  interest  in  the  personal  property  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  certificate  of  ownership,  very  much  like  the  limited 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partners  in  Carden. 

 

 

            

In  Carden  the  limited  partners  didn't  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  ownership  interest  in  the  assets  of  the  entity.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  a  certificate  of  ownership  as  a  limited  partner. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

In  those  two  instances,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  limited  partner  in  Carden  and  the  trustee  member, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  the  beneficiary  member  in  this  case,  are  virtually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identical.  They  do  two  things:  They  invest  money  in  an 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

artificial  entity  and  receive  a  certificate  of

ownership,  and  they  periodically  vote  on  important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matters  that  affect  the  entity. 

 

 

 

 

            

identical. 

            

They  are,  in  most  instances,  virtually 

 

 

 

 

 

So  in  my  view  ­­ and  I  think  this  case  rests 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon  defining  a  clear  rule,  a  clear  rule  that  says  when 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  an  artificial  entity,  we're  going  to  measure  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  persons  that  I  consider  to  be  the  beneficial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

owners. 

            

And  I'll  tell  you  why  that's  important: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because  that  is  consonant  with  the  rule  announced  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  in  Chapman,  Great  Southern,  Bouligny,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Carden. 

            

Chapman  v.  Barney,  the  doctrinal  wall  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  persons  that  were  deemed  to  be  members  were  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

persons  that  were  the  stock  owners  of  the  joint  stock 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

company  under  New  York  law. 

 

 

 

 

            

In  Great  Southern,  again  a  limited 

   

 

 

 

partnership  case,  were  those  persons  that  had  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

economic  interest  in  the  entity. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  same  rule  applied  in  Carden. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  we  are  to  adopt  Americold's  position  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  and  now  suggest  that  the  board  of  trustees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  do  not  have  an  economic  ownership  interest  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entity  itself  controls,  we're  going  to  open  the

courts. 

            

            

And  I'll  tell  you  why. 

 

 

 

 

The  Court  has  never  explicitly  addressed  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited  liability  company,  and  they're  common  throughout 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States.  Limited  liability  companies  can  call 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  boards  of  managers  boards  of  trustees.  And  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  instances  under  those  uniform  laws,  both  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  partnership  law  and  the  LLC  law,  managers  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hold  property  in  trust  for  the  entity  just  like  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trustees  in  this  case  can  hold  property  in  trust  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entity. 

            

At  the  end  of  the  day,  if  we're  going  to  now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  it's  the  board  of  managers  that  are  called  trustees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  look  to,  everyone's  going  to  analogize  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuits  that  haven't  decided  the  LLC  question:  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  more  like  the  board  of  managers  in  Americold  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  different  than  the  limited  partners  in  Carden.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  going  to  create  uncertainty. 

 

 

 

 

            

Our  rule,  the  bright­line  rule,  is  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear.  When  an  artificial  entity  is  sued  or  being  ­­ or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suing  in  its  own  name,  we  look  to  the  members,  which  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  constitutes  those  persons  that  own  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficial  interest  in  the  entity,  the  shareholder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members,  just  like  this  Court  did  in  Chapman,  Great

Southern,  Bouligny,  and  Carden. 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  it's  important  to  understand  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

our  view  Navarro  never  decided  the  question:  Did  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  a  trust  constitute  an  entity  and  who  the  members  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  entity  were? 

 

 

            

Navarro  stands  for  the  limited  proposition, 

 

 

 

 

 

as  suggested  by  Justice  Ginsburg,  that  in  fact  we  look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  those  persons  that  had  a  right  to  sue. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  in  this  case  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  sue  the  trustees  individually,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  That  is  correct.  In  this  case, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

under  Maryland  law,  the  trustees,  even  if  they  are  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owners  of  the  property  in  trust  for  the  entity,  still 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  no  authority  under  the  statute  to  bring  suit  nor  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  have  the  ability  to  be  sued. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  entity  itself,  Americold  Realty  Trust, 

 

 

 

 

 

has  admitted  in  this  Court  and  in  the  Tenth  Circuit  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  the  successor  in  interest  to  the  corporation  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  client's,  ConAgra  Foods,  entered  in  to  a  contract 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

with.  I  had  no  choice  but  to  sue  the  entity.  When  the 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entity  is  sued,  the  doctrinal  wall  of  Chapman  v.  Barney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  in  play:  Are  you  a  corporation  or  are  you  an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

artificial  association? 

 

            

In  this  case  they're  an  association.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

measure  by  those  persons  that  have  an  ownership  interest

the  board  of  managers. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Duggan,  do  you  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  possible  that  we  took  a  bit  of  a  wrong  turn  in  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Carden?  In  other  words,  that,  in  fact,  all  of  these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entities  should  be  treated  like  corporations  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  strongest  arguments  on  the  other  side,  you  know,  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  those  arguments.  And  those  arguments  fly  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

face  of  Carden  but  that  ­­ but  they're  really  arguments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  why  ­­ why  not  treat  these  just  like  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporation? 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  Well,  Justice  Kagan,  I  agree, 

   

  

 

 

 

and  I  think  the  Court  said  in  Carden  that  our  decision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  precedent  bound  and  perhaps  even  unresponsive  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy  considerations,  but  it  is  indeed  Congress's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prerogative  to  change  the  law. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  indeed,  Congress  has  spoken.  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

spoke  in  2005,  and  Congress  said,  we've  legislated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  this  backdrop  of  Chapman  v.  Barney,  Great 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Southern,  Bouligny,  Carden,  and  Navarro,  and  we  reached 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  decision  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  If  we  ­­ if  we  made  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  in  the  first  place,  why  should  we  say,  well,  we  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  but  we're  not  going  to  fix  it?  Let  Congress  fix  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  Well,  because  I  think  Congress

has  fixed  it,  and  Congress  has  recognized,  specifically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  class  action  lawsuits,  that  they  would  treat 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

associations  the  same  as  corporations  if  they  are  named 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  party  in  a  class  action  lawsuit  in  the  2005 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

amendments  to  Section  1332. 

 

 

 

            

 

 

And  they  specifically  said,  if  you  are  an 

 

 

 

 

 

unincorporated  association,  we're  going  to  look  to  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place  of  incorporation  and  your  principal  place  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business  for  purposes  of  diversity  jurisdiction  in  class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  lawsuits.  But  they  did  not  say  if  ­­ with  regard 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  every  other  garden  variety  commercial  dispute  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  one  we  have  here  today,  that  that  rule  would  apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  Congress  is  capable  of  speaking. 

 

 

 

 

 

They've  spoken  post  Carden  in  2005.  And  they've  made  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  that  those  doctrinal  walls  of  Chapman  v.  Barney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  remain  in  play  as  announced  by  this  Court  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  limited  exception  of  class  action  lawsuits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  the  court  took  a  wrong  turn  in  Carden, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  has  affirmed  it  only  to  the  extent  that  it  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

announced  a  rule  that  applies  to  associations  for  policy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons  in  class  action  cases. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  problem,  just  from  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

point  of  view  of  the  common  sense  of  it,  is  you  have  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

organization  that  has,  A,  the  organization;  B,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trustees;  and  C,  the  shareholders.

So  applying  Carden,  what  you  would  say  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  Navarro:  If  you  sue  the  trustees,  you  look  to  their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenship.  But  if  you  sue  the  trust  itself,  you  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  to  the  citizenship  of  the  trust;  you  don't  look  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  citizenship  of  the  trustees.  You  go  beyond  that  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  to  the  citizenship  of  the  members. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  that  seems  odd.  Why  do  you  look  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  members  or  the  shareholders,  or  the  ­­ or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiaries  where  you  sue  the  trust  itself  but  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  in  the  identical  situation  where  the  law  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  allows  you  to  sue  the  trustees?  I  mean,  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  such  a  sport,  such  a  ­­ a  fluke. 

   

   

   

 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  But  it  is  the  sport  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

played  even  with  regard  to  limited  partnerships, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer,  because  in  the  instance  where  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited  partnership  a  general  partner  who  is  managing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  affairs  of  the  entity  breaches  a  duty  to  a  third 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

party  and  the  entity  itself  also  is  responsible  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

breach  of  duty,  a  party  can  sue  both  the  general  partner 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  artificial  entity.  And  if  the  general  partner 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happens  to  be  an  individual,  you  measure  by  his  natural 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenship  and  you  measure  the  entity  by  virtue  of  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  members  are. 

 

 

            

And  people  make  tactical  reasons  every  day 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  United  States  about  who  to  sue  and  who  not  to

sue.  In  some  instances,  they  may  choose  to  sue  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  partner  because  they  want  to  get  into  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  and  they  don't  want  to  sue  the  entity,  but  they'll 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  their  risks  on  suing  only  one  of  the  parties  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liable,  or  they  may  sue  all  of  them.  But  they  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfy  the  rules  applicable  to  each  one  of  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  parties  that  may  be  responsible. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  the  other  thing  that's  important 

 

 

 

 

 

here  is  that  the  ­­ the  argument  suggested  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  is  that  we  look  to  the  control  test,  a  test 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  those  persons  that  are  in  control,  and  this  Court  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implicitly  and  expressly  rejected  that  test. 

 

 

 

 

 

Specifically,  the  Court  rejected  it  in  Carden.  But  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implicitly,  if  you  look  at  the  Chapman  v.  Barney  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Barney  was  a  plaintiff  in  the  case,  brought  the  suit  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

president  of  the  New  York  Stock  Company,  and  he  had  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolute  right  under  New  York  law  to  control  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  and  bring  the  claim. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  Court  never  looked  to  the  control  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  litigation  by  Barney  as  a  reason  why  it  should 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

measure  the  citizenship  of  the  entity.  It  looked  to  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  owner  members  of  the  company.  And  this  Court  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  it  the  Petitioner's 

  

 

 

 

 

position  that  the  Real  Estate  Investment  Trust  is  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  a  trust  than  an  LLC,  than  a  limited  partnership?

MR.  DUGGAN:  I  think  it's  made  that 

    

 

 

 

 

suggestion  to  the  Court,  but  in  our  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  ­­ and  if  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  position,  what  would  your  response  be? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  Our  response  would  be  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Why  ­­ why  is  an  REIT  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  a  limited  partner  than  it  is  a  common  law  trust? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  There's  two  primary  reasons, 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy.  The  first  one  is,  this  is  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

artificial  entity.  And  the  entity  can  hold  the  assets, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it's  managed  by  a  board  of  trustees,  some  of  whom 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  or  may  not  hold  the  assets  of  the  entity  in  trust. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  that's  no  different  than  a  ­­ a  general  partner  of  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited  partnership.  They  can  hold  assets  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  it  seems  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  a  wash  because  what  you  describe  is  a  common  law 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

trust  as  well,  so  I'm  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  Precisely. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That  sounds  like  a  wash. 

   

  

 

 

 

MR.  DUGGAN:  In  my  view,  the  one  market 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction  between  their  assertion  here  and  a  common 

   

 

 

 

 

 

law  trust  is  this  isn't  a  common  law  trust.  It  is  an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

artificial  entity.  And  if  in  fact  their  trustees  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hold  assets  for  the  entity,  then  maybe  they  are  acting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  trustees  and  maybe  they  can  bring  certain  claims.

But  our  bright­line  rule  is  this. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  What  ­­ a  common  law  trust 

   

  

 

 

 

 

exists  in  nature?  That's  the  common  law? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

entity. 

            

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  it's  not  an  artificial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  DUGGAN:  It's  not  an  artificial  entity. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Because  we  know  it  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

love  it  so  well  or  what? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  Well,  it's  been  around  since 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Middle  Ages,  as  I  understand  the  brief  of  Winston 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wong,  the  amicus  in  the  case.  And  from  that  vantage 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point,  common  law  trust  entities  have  never  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  as  entity  status  with  capacity  to  sue  and  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sued  as  an  entity.  The  trustees  who  are  the  legal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nominal  owners  of  the  assets  bring  the  claim.  That's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  distinction.  But  just  as  importantly,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiary  shareholders  of  a  REIT  have  no  equitable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

interest  in  the  assets  of  the  artificial  entity  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  very  Trust  declaration  itself  provides  it's  merely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal  property.  They  are  so  much  like  the  limited 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partners  in  Carden  that  it's  striking. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  just  as  importantly,  I  think,  back  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  point  I  was  making,  the  Court  expressly  rejected  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

control  test  in  Carden  and  said,  quote,  "real  persons  to

controversy  test"  and,  quote,  "which  parties  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

control  over  the  subject  of  the  litigation"  have  never 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guided  our  reasoning  with  regard  to  who  are  the  citizens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  an  artificial  entity.  And  in  fact  they  can't  point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  one  single  case  by  this  Court  where  this  Court  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ignored  the  citizenship  of  the  beneficial  owners  of  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entity  and  instead  substituted  in  a  board  of  managers. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  indeed,  if  that  were  the  holding  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  today,  the  Court  would  be  reversing  itself  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hundreds  of  years  of  precedent  where  it  ­­ it  chose  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapman,  Great  Southern,  Bouligny,  and  Carden  to  look  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ownership  of  the  members  and  the  artificial  entity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

One  final  point  with  regard  to  difficulty  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

measuring  these  entities. 

 

 

            

It  was  suggested  that  there  might  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thousands  of  members  of  a  REIT.  Well,  that  very  well 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  true.  But  there  also  could  be  thousands  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited  partners  in  these  sophisticated  limited 

 

 

 

 

 

partnerships  that  are  being  used  for  real  estate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transactions.  Just  because  there  are  a  lot  of  owners  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  artificial  entity  association  doesn't  seem  to  weigh 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

heavily  enough  to  create  the  ambiguity  that  you  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  ­­

odd  thing  in  writing  this  opinion  your  way.  You  say,

well,  this  isn't  really  like  a  trust.  I  mean,  it  is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort  of  a  trust,  but  there  are  important  differences. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  can  sue  and  be  sued.  The  trust  itself  can  hold  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property,  and  the  beneficiaries  do  not  have  an  equitable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest.  And  because  they  don't  have  an  equitable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest,  it's  more  like  a  private  association  or, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

et  cetera,  in  Carden. 

 

 

 

            

 

But,  of  course,  that  means  that  we  look  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  interest.  We  look  to  their  property.  We're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

basically  having  them  as  part  of  the  necessary  parties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  have  a  property  interest,  the  very  people 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  just  said  that  this  is  a  different  kind  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

organization  because  they  lack  an  equitable  interest  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  property. 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  But  that's  no  different  than 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  we  do  in  limited  partnerships  under  Carden.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply  look  at  the  limited  partners  for  purposes  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

measuring  diversity.  They're  only  important  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

extent  that  they're  required  for  measuring. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  final  point  is,  there  was  an  argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  said,  well,  you  know,  REITs  are  publicly  traded  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  true.  But  the  NAREIT  brief,  the  amicus  brief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

points  out  that  nearly  80  percent  of  all  REITs  ought  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  corporations.  And  most  publicly  traded  REITs  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporations.  And  indeed,  Maryland  REITs  can  choose  the

corporate  form  of  incorporation,  and  they  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

measured  simply  by  the  principal  place  of  business  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  state  of  incorporation. 

 

 

 

            

Just  because  a  few  REITs  choose  to  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

associations  doesn't  seem  to  justify  creating 

 

 

 

 

 

uncertainty  in  the  doctrinal  wall  framework  that's  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

announced  by  the  Court  and  now  have  people  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analogize  to  a  board  of  managers  instead  of  the  owner 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficial  members. 

 

              

 

 

I  have  nothing  further  unless  there's  more 

 

 

 

questions  from  the  Court. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  just  have  one 

    

 

 

 

 

question  on  the  Safeway  and  Kraft  business.  In  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tenth  Circuit,  you  can  ­­ you  advised  the  court  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  they  were  dispensable,  nondiverse  parties,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  hadn't  appealed.  And  before  this  Court,  you  agreed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  dismiss  another  dispensable,  nondiverse  party.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

then  your  brief  comes  in  and  you  say,  well,  I've  changed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  mind.  They're  not  dispensable.  It  ­­ I  wonder  why. 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

It  seems  a  bit  of  sharp  practice. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUGGAN:  Well,  I  think  ­­ I  think,  Mr. 

   

   

  

 

 

 

Chief  Justice,  that  if  in  fact  that's  a  question  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  remains  if  you  affirm  ­­ or  if  you  reverse  and  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  measure  by  the  trustees,  it  should  be  remanded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  Tenth  Circuit  for  them  to  make  a  determination.

In  the  first  instance,  it  was  raised  by  the  Petitioners 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  first  time,  as  I  understand  it,  in  their  merits 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief  that  Kraft  and  Safeway  were  properly  dismissed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  improvidently  took  the  wrong  position  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

front  of  the  Tenth  Circuit,  and  we  don't  think  Newman 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Green  supports  that  position.  And  I  think  the  Court  can 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

review  Newman  Green  and  look  at  it  and  say,  well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really,  are  they  dispensable  parties  or  not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think,  quite  frankly,  if  in  fact  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  adopts  a  ruling  here  that  says  we  measure  by  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

board  of  managers  instead  of  the  owner  members,  then  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  appropriate  to  remand  back  to  the  Tenth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit,  not  only  to  decide  the  case  on  the  merits, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  they  didn't  decide,  but  also  to  make  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  as  to  whether  Kraft  and  Safeway  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

truly  are  dispensable  or  not.

litigation  even  further  than  it's  ­­

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

I'd  like  to  start  off  by  addressing 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer's  comment  about  gamesmanship.  You're 

  

 

 

 

 

absolutely  right.  What  difference  does  it  make  if  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Trust  is  sued  or  the  Trustee  is  sued?  We're  still 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  at  Trust  assets.  It  doesn't  make  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  His  point  really  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  sort  of  like  a  trust  but  not  very  much.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indeed,  the  key  point,  to  me,  is  that  the  shareholders 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  have  no  beneficial  interest  in  the  property. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  And  that's  the  second 

  

 

 

 

 

argument  I  wanted  to  make,  Your  Honor.  There  are  two 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes,  two  statutory  cites  that  I  want  to  give  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court,  and  one  of  them  I  read  already.  Under  Maryland 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Code  of  Corporations  and  Associations  8­101(c),  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  REIT  is  as  follows:  "An  unincorporated 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

business  trust  in  which  property  is  acquired,  held, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

managed,  administered,  controlled,  invested,  or  disposed 

 

 

 

 

 

of  for  the  benefit  and  profit  of  any  person  who  may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

become  a  shareholder." 

   

            

Second  provision:  Missouri  ­­ or  Maryland 

  

 

 

 

 

Code  of  Corporations  and  Associations,  1­101(e):  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  a  business  trust  is  "a  REIT  engaged  in

business  in  which  property  is  acquired,  held,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

managed  for  the  benefit  of  shareholders." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  then  you  say  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

section  shareholders  shall  have  no  interest  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  of  the  trust. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Your  Honor,  if  ­­ if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

anything,  that  ­­ that  distinction  makes  this  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further  removed.  Why  ­­ why  would  those  shareholders, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  they  have  no  interest  whatsoever,  why  would  we  ever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  look  to  them?  That  makes  even  more  sense  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  don't  know.  I  didn't 

    

    

 

 

write  ­­ I  didn't  write  Section  6;  your  client  did. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  what  it  says,  so  how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  we  supposed  to  take  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Your  Honor,  I  ­­ I  would  say 

   

   

  

 

 

 

that  the  statute  obviously  is  ­­ is  what  controls  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  because  we  want  to  have  a  rule  that's  across  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

board  for  all  trusts.  And  if  you  look  at  the  statute  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland,  the  statute  language  I  just  said  definitely 

   

 

 

 

 

 

creates  an  equitable  interest  in  shareholders  ­­ bless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ for  a  Real  Estate  Investment  Trust. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

There  is  another  point  that  Respondents 

 

 

 

 

 

made;  I'd  like  to  point  out,  is  that  they  said  there  is

than  beneficiaries  when  you're  involved  in  a  case  with  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trust.  I  would  submit  there  ­­ there's  two  responses  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

Number  one,  there  is  a  case  that  we  cited  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  brief.  It's  called  Thomas  v.  The  Board  of  Trustees 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Ohio  State  University.  In  that  case,  the  Board 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself  was  sued  in  its  own  name.  It  was  the  party.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  allowed  to  be  sued  by  the  Ohio  laws.  It  was  a  case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  involved  adverse  possession  with  some  property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  the  ­­ the  students  and  the  university 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owned.  There  was  an  issue  of  jurisdiction,  whether  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  there  was  diversity. 

 

 

 

            

The  court  looked,  not  to  who  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiaries  of  that  board  of  trustees  were;  the  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked  to  the  trustees  that  sat  on  that  board.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  they  looked  to.  They  weren't  a  party  to  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

action.  The  court  nowhere  looked  at  the  beneficiaries. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

You're  not  going  to  see  that  ­­ that  language  at  all  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  case. 

 

            

            

And  the  second  case,  this  Court  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  ­­ I  don't  ­­ who  ­­

    

   

 

 

 

 

who  ­­ who  was  the  party?  Who  was  the  defendant  in  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case? 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  It  was  Board  of  Trustees  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Ohio  State  University.

And  what  the  court  did  in  that  case  is  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked  to  who  controlled  ­­ looked  to  the  members  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  board. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Is  ­­ is  that  standard  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ with  common  law  trusts?  Can  you  sue  either  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trustees  or  the  board  of  trustees? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Your  Honor,  when  I  say  "board 

   

  

 

 

 

 

of  trustees,"  I'm  talking  ­­ that  was  a  unit.  That  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  specific  entity.  It  was  called  the  board  of  trustees. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  was  an  entity  that  was  created  under  Ohio  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  When  you  have  a  bunch  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

trustees,  aren't  they  normally  referred  to  as  the  board 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  trustees? 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  That's  true,  Your  Honor.

However,  this  was  a  specific  provision  under  Ohio  law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  allowed  that  entity  itself  to  be  sued  or  sue  in  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own  name.  And  what  the  court  did  is  it  looked  behind 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  curtain  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  There's  a  special  statute 

   

  

 

 

that  ­­ that  allowed  the  board  of  trustees  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  That's  correct,  Your  Honor; 

  

 

 

 

 

that's  correct. 

 

            

Another  case,  more  recently,  where  the  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did,  in  fact,  look  to  something  beyond  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiaries,  is  Navarro,  of  course.  Navarro  did  look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  beneficiaries.  It  said  we're  going  to  look  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  beneficiaries,  but  that's  not  going  to  control. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  realize  that  a  trust  was  not  the  named 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

party  there,  but  the  court  ­­ it  would  ­­ it  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  superfluous  for  this  Court  to  even  look  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiaries  if  that  was  not  an  issue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  court  knew  that  it's  going  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trustees  or  the  beneficiaries.  And  they  specifically 

  

 

 

 

 

 

said,  the  9,500  beneficiaries,  we  don't  look  at. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

            

We  believe  the  same  rule  should  apply  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  the  Court  has  no  other  questions,  we  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yes.  I  do  have  one. 

    

  

 

 

 

MR.  POSPISIL:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Suppose  I  wanted  a  list.

I  ­­ I  wanted  a  list,  a  synthesis  of  which  Bogert  or  ­­

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  Scott  on  trusts  has  as  the  characteristic  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional  common  law  trusts.  And  then  I'd  like,  over 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  other  column,  the  characteristics  of  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

organization. 

            

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  now  what  do  I  read?  I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

­­ I  don't  think  you  can  list  them  now.  Is  there 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  I  can  read  just  to  get  an  idea  of  that? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Maybe  they  are  identical. 

  

 

 

 

 

Are  you  going  to  say  they're  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  POSPISIL:  They  are  ­­ they  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

identical.  And  I  can  lay  them  out  for  you. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

Let's  go  on  the  left  side.  The  left  side, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  going  to  have  traditional  trusts.  You're  going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  have  a  separation  between  legal  ownership  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

equitable  ownership. 

 

            

Let's  look  on  the  right  side.  Let's  look  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  real  estate  investment  trust  under  Maryland  law.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  legal  ownership,  which  is  either  in  the  name  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trustees  or  the  trust,  and  you  also  have  equitable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ownership,  and  then  shareholders. 

 

 

 

            

And  I'll  go  back  to  those  two  statutes  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ that  I  cited  to  you  earlier,  Your  Honor.

So  those  were  the  attributes  that  exist  in  a
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  law  trust,  and  they're  also  the  attributes  that
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exist  with  a  Maryland  real  estate  investment  trust.
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  the  Court  has  no  other  further  questions,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  would  request  that  the  Court  reverse  the  Tenth
