CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-1016, Lee Till v. SCS Credit Corporation.


Ms. Harper.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF REBECCA J. HARPER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MS. HARPER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Deferred payments under section


1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) must equal the present value of the


collateral.  Historically present value has been an


objective concept equalling the real interest rate and


inflation, which is the time value of money. 

The Seventh Circuit has redefined this concept


in a manner that seriously disrupts two fundamental


principles of chapter 13, that being the equal treatment


of creditors similarly situated and the debtor's


rehabilitation, the debtor's access to chapter 13.


QUESTION:  When you say traditionally it's been


understood to mean real interest rate plus time value of


money, it means real interest rate for the particular


lender.  Isn't -- I mean, the -- the interest rate that is


given to different lenders is not always the same.


MS. HARPER:  Under chapter 13, you're simply

trying to value the money.  It's not particular to a


specific creditor because you're just trying to equate the


amount of money over time to a particular amount of the


allowed secured claim.


QUESTION:  Well, that's right, but the interest


rate that I have to pay when I buy a house with a very


small down payment is much higher than the interest I have


to pay if I make a much larger down payment.


MS. HARPER:  That's --


QUESTION:  And the interest I have to pay, if I


make, you know, over $200,000 a year is less than I would


get if I have a lower income.  So you can't just speak of


a fair interest rate in the abstract as though it's a --


it -- it's a platonic number floating out there.  It


certainly depends upon the solvency and -- and the record


of payment of the person paying the interest.  Isn't that


right?  I --


MS. HARPER:  You're -- you're talking about


interest in the open market, though, which is not what


we're talking about here.  We're -- we're talking more


about --


QUESTION:  I'm surprised to hear you saying this


because I thought your brief acknowledged that even after


you begin with the -- with a discount rate, you know, the


-- the Fed's discount rate -- I thought your briefs

acknowledged that the bankruptcy court could add to that a


-- a surcharge depending upon the riskiness of the chapter


13 debtor.


MS. HARPER:  That --


QUESTION:  You didn't acknowledge that?  I


thought your brief acknowledged that.  I'm -- you -- you


really want to use the discount rate, period, and nothing


-- nothing tagged on top of it.


MS. HARPER:  I was going to get to that, but in


certain circumstances an additional risk factor may be


required, but it is our position that there are many other


statutory elements under -- provisions under chapter 13


that cover the types of risks that would normally be


included in a contract, for instance. 


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I think the same thing


that's bothering Justice Scalia, or that prompted his


question in any event, is -- is troubling me.  When I -- I


read the briefs, I -- I thought that the coerced loan


approach, which you object to, did have certain


deficiencies, because you had to have testimony what the


interest rate is, you have to conform it to the particular


transaction, it's hard to administer.  I frankly don't see


how yours is much different because you add a premium to


the prime rate.  What is that premium going to be?  Why


shouldn't it depend on the transaction?  Why shouldn't it

depend on the risk of default?  Why doesn't your approach


have all of the same problems as the coerced loan


approach?


MS. HARPER:  Because you need to limit the


purpose of that premium.  Most risk elements are


encompassed within other sections of chapter 13 because


your normal risk of deterioration of the collateral, for


instance -- that's adequate protection.  So you don't have


to add on for that.  You don't have -- the risk of default


is covered by the fact that there is a wage assignment in


effect. 


I'm saying that in certain instances --


QUESTION:  Well, but if that was true, you could


bring up the same thing when you're cross-examining the 

expert on the coerced loan approach and say, well, we


don't want 21 percent because there's a wage assignment. 


It's the same answer.


MS. HARPER:  No.  The 21 percent, such as the 21


percent that was in this record, there was no support for


at all.  The creditor did not show any basis for --


QUESTION:  It showed what the creditor had been


getting before, and that, I thought, was the argument,


that in -- out of chapter 17 -- 13, in chapter 13 our


contract rate was 21 percent, and that represents what it


would cost this borrower if he were today to take those

funds, get the same funds.  It would cost him 21 percent


because he's a high-risk borrower.  That's -- that's the


theory.  But you're saying that that is a wrong theory, as


Judge Rovner said in her opinion, but it's -- it's not


because it's more difficult to apply than some other


theory.


MS. HARPER:  Well --


QUESTION:  I think you're -- you're saying that


that's a wrong approach, and maybe you'll say why.


MS. HARPER:  Yes.  It's the wrong approach


because the only thing that the creditor is entitled to


protection for under 1325 is the value of the collateral. 


In that 21 percent contract rate, first of all, on the


record in this case the expert couldn't even say what it 

consisted of.  But in your typical contract rate of


interest, you're going to have transaction charges. 


You're going to have the risk of default, which has


already occurred here, the risk of bankruptcy default, for


instance.  That risk has already occurred here.  The


creditor has already been compensated for that.


QUESTION:  You think that makes this a better --


a better borrower?  It -- it makes it a safer loan when


you're -- when you're -- you're owed money by somebody who


has already been through bankruptcy once?  You think


you're in better shape?

 MS. HARPER:  In many --


QUESTION:  Gee, that's -- that's a novel


approach.


MS. HARPER:  In many respects, it is safer


because here you're talking about a subprime lender who


did enter into a contract where it assumed a great amount


of risk, but now the debtor's debt structure, his payment


obligations have been modified by the chapter 13.


QUESTION:  So you think a lender has two


different loan candidates in front of him, one he thinks


is going to go through bankruptcy and the other he thinks


is not, so he's going to give the loan to the first one?


MS. HARPER:  I think that --


QUESTION: 


That's -- that's very difficult for 

me to assume.


MS. HARPER:  -- a lender may charge additional


interest if -- under State law if the lender has


indication that the debtor may go through bankruptcy, but


normally in the subprime market, that's all factored in


because most subprime candidates are candidates for


possible bankruptcy in the future.


QUESTION:  Is it a fact that most chapter 13


bankrupts don't make it to the end of the program?


MS. HARPER:  Well --


QUESTION:  In fact, the vast majority fail.

 MS. HARPER:  That's not necessarily true when


you talk --


QUESTION:  I thought we had statistics on that.


MS. HARPER:  The problem is most of the


statistics focus on the default rate just from the filing,


the number of filings.  They don't focus on the default


rate after the chapter 13 has been confirmed because there


are many -- the case by that point has been reviewed by


the court and it's determined to have been feasible.  The


debtor by that point has been making payments for a


substantial period. 


QUESTION:  Are there statistics on that kind of


cases that you're describing now?


MS. HARPER:  There -- I have found limited


statistics.  One study that I found said that 63 percent


of the chapter 13's completed successfully after they


reached the point of confirmation.  So there is suggestion


that after the point of confirmation, the success rate


gets much higher, which only makes sense because a lot of


times --


QUESTION:  It's still not a very good risk.  I


mean, you --


MS. HARPER:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- you lend money to somebody.  Your


chances of getting it back are 2 out of 3?

 MS. HARPER:  The subprime lender's risk in the


open market is not good either.  So --


QUESTION:  Well, I think it's better than 2 out


of 3.


MS. HARPER:  It's five times higher than the


prime market.


QUESTION:  Let -- let me ask you a -- the -- the


way I see these two approaches.  I'm assuming that -- that


you're -- you're willing to allow over the prime rate some


addition which the -- the courts that -- that follow your


-- your favored approach do allow for risk factor.  So


under your theory, you take the prime rate, and then it is


up to the bankruptcy judge to assess what the risk is,


something that I think judges are probably not very well 

qualified to do.


You know when -- when you pick the prime rate,


that that's not the market rate.  It obviously isn't.  So


it's well below the market rate.  I mean, here you had a


21 percent loan and you're going to take what?  I don't


know.  A prime rate of 8 percent at most?  You know it's


wrong.  And then the bankruptcy judge has to make it


right.  Okay? 


Under the other approach, you take the market


rate, the rate that was actually adopted between these --


these two people operating in a free market.  Now, it --

it may be -- may be high, it may be low.  You don't know


for sure that it's either one.  It's -- it's -- it may be


accurate.  It is not surely inaccurate the way picking the


prime is.  And then the adjustment to be made by the


bankruptcy judge is much less.  If there are some special


factors that show a lesser risk now than there was when


the loan was originally made, he might take them into


account. 


Now, as I see it, the less discretion that is


left to the bankruptcy judge and the more weight that is


given to the -- to the real forces of the operating


market, the better off we are.  I -- I don't think that


bankruptcy judges are very good risk calculators.


MS. HARPER: 


That totally eliminates the fact 

that a chapter 13 has been filed and that there are


certain minimal requirements for chapter 13 confirmation. 


A -- and the problem is that market rate, the way these


courts have defined it -- has come to mean anything and


everything.  We're talking about two different market


rates here. 


QUESTION:  I'm talking about using the rate of


the loan that was actually made.


MS. HARPER:  But there is nothing in the statute


that requires the creditor to be compensated for all of


those items that were included in the pre-petition

contract.


QUESTION:  No, but he has to be given the


current value of his security and the current value of his


security, which is not going to be received 20 years from


now or 5 years from now, depends upon how much of a credit


risk there is that that money will actually be paid.


MS. HARPER:  How could the -- how could you


possibly contract in advance for the present value of this


particular allowed secured claim, $4,000?  That amount


wasn't even known when the contract rate was established. 


The contract rate was based upon particular


characteristics of the creditor and the debtor and many --


QUESTION:  In -- in an open market.  And if the


debtor could have gotten -- it's a very competitive 

market, as I understand it.  And if the debtor could have


gotten a lower rate elsewhere, he presumably would have.


MS. HARPER:  That's --


QUESTION:  I'm just saying that that's -- that


that's a reasonable starting point.  Now, if there has to


be an adjustment because market rates have gone down since


then, that minor adjustment can be made, but that's going


to be much less of an adjustment than you're going to have


to leave to the bankruptcy judge if you begin with the


prime rate which you know is wrong.  You know that nobody


would have made this -- this car loan at the prime rate.

 MS. HARPER:  That's not the question.  The


question is not what someone would make a new loan for


because an allowed secured claim in chapter 13 is a claim. 


It's not a loan.  Once the bankruptcy is filed --


QUESTION:  Let me ask you this -- this piece of


it.  The -- Justice Scalia said to give this kind of you-


pick-it discretion to the bankruptcy judge is a worrisome


thing, but all of the cases that take this approach, the


Treasury bill approach or the prime, seem to have a rather


narrow range for that risk factor.  They go from 1 percent


to 3 percent, and none of them go over 3 percent.  Where


did they -- where did that range -- who invented that


range that 3 percent would be the ceiling?


MS. HARPER:  That's a good question.  I believe


that it just results from the fact that in your typical


chapter 13, you don't have a lot of special risk that has


to be compensated for because you usually have the fixed


asset, there's no hazard -- hazardous use, you've got a


wage assignment.  You -- substantial risk might result,


for instance, in a chapter 13 if you had a balloon


payment. 


QUESTION:  A what payment? 


MS. HARPER:  A balloon payment instead of


periodic weekly payments, which is usually what you have


in a chapter 13.

 QUESTION:  As I understand it, your expert in


this case, your economist, testified that the prime rate


was 8 percent and that in his view a reasonable risk


premium would be 1.5.  But he conceded under cross-


examination that he was unfamiliar with the relevant rates


of default or costs of servicing loans in the subprime


market, which --


MS. HARPER:  That's --


QUESTION:  -- to my mind is conceding that he


has no basis for picking 1.5 percent. 


MS. HARPER:  That 1.5 in that case was actually


a local bankruptcy rule.  But that same expert also


testified that prime already includes 2 percent which


could not be accounted for except for risk and transaction 

fees.


QUESTION:  The risk -- the risk of a prime


borrower, of a fat cat borrower. 


MS. HARPER:  But, again, we're not talking about


borrowing on a new loan in a chapter 13.  The -- we're


talking about modification to an old loan, an existing


loan.  1322(b)(2) allows you to modify that contract.  So


we're not looking at what this debtor would have to pay in


the open market were it not for the chapter 13.  That's


not the proper inquiry.


If there are no further questions, I would

QUESTION:  Very well, Ms. Harper.


Mr. Salmons, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


MR. SALMONS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The court of appeals here held that the


bankruptcy courts are required to presume that the pre-


bankruptcy contract rate of interest, which varies from


creditor to creditor and could range anywhere from 0 to 40


percent or more in some jurisdictions, is the appropriate


discount rate to use in calculating the present value of 

plan payments under section 1325.  Now, that approach is


mistaken, we submit, for three principal reasons.


First, it violates the core bankruptcy principle


of equality of distribution for similarly situated


creditors.  Under the court of appeals' approach, two


creditors could make car loans to the same debtor that


resulted in allowed secured claims of equal value, and yet


one would receive thousands more in plan payments solely


because the other made its car loan at a time when the


debtor's financial troubles had not yet become obvious.


QUESTION:  Is that right?  I just want to be

sure I understand the -- the point.  I thought if you had


that differential before the bankruptcy judge, it's a --


the original is a presumptive risk, and the judge could


then resolve it by maybe compromising between the two.


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, this is an important


point because I think there is some misconception about


what the court of appeals held in this case, and I think


that's due in part to the fact that respondents, at least


as I read their position, are not really defending the


approach taken by the court of appeals.  The court of


appeals did not adopt a presumption in favor of the pre-


bankruptcy contract rate because it thought that that


represented accurately the relevant market, if you will,


for the risks of -- and benefits and protections that 

exist under the Bankruptcy Code.


In fact, under the court of appeals' approach,


the risk of nonpayment is really irrelevant.  What the


court of appeals says is that because the -- the creditor


is denied use of funds for the period of the payment plan,


that it therefore is entitled to whatever rate it would


have gone out and funded a new loan at if it had been


allowed to foreclose and reinvest the proceeds.  Now --


QUESTION:  I agree with you, and -- and the


respondent is not defending that approach, but rather the


approach that you use the rate of the -- of the original

loan as the starting point, and then adjust it as


necessary.


MR. SALMONS:  That's correct, and I just want to


emphasize, though, that -- that the adjustment that the


court of appeals would make is not one I think that


anybody before the Court now would defend because the


court of appeals would adjust only if you could prove that


the -- a particular secured creditor is now making loans


at some other rate and there's no reason to think why that


has anything to do with what the present value of plan


payments would be under 1325.  And -- and the problem --


QUESTION:  So, but you're saying -- but you're


saying that under the respondent's view, that -- that the


creditors would be treated differently? 


MR. SALMONS:  If respondent's view is that you


should have a presumption in favor of the pre-bankruptcy


contract rate, then that would be the result.  What's not


clear to me is whether it's actually respondent's view


that you should have a presumption in favor of the


subprime contract rate or the highest contract rate


allowed by State law because it's important to remember


that pre-bankruptcy contract rates are going to vary.  You


could have a 0 percent lender.  You could have a prime


lender, and you could have a subprime lender.  And there's


no reason to think that any one of those necessarily

captures the unique mix of risks and benefits and

QUESTION:  Where do you get the principle that


all secured creditors have to be treated equally?  Where


does -- where does that appear? 


MR. SALMONS:  Well, Your Honor, on -- I would


refer you to page 19 --


QUESTION:  I'm sure it's true of all unsecured


creditors.  I -- I don't know why --


QUESTION:  Page 19 of what? 


MR. SALMONS:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  I would


refer you to page 19 of the Government's brief where we


refer to two cases by this Court, Bigeur v. the IRS and --


and Union Bank v. Wolas, that stand for the principle that 

-- that embody the notion that equality of distribution


among creditors is a central policy of the Bankruptcy


Code.  That's this Court's language. 


QUESTION:  Similarly situated creditors.


MR. SALMONS:  To be sure, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Not secured versus unsecured.


MR. SALMONS:  That's why I gave the example that


I did of two creditors that extend car loans and the only


difference between them -- they have the exact same


allowed value under the code for their claim.  The only


difference between them is that one made its loan 2 years

prior to bankruptcy when the -- when the debtor's credit


history was not quite as bad and the other made it 2 weeks


before bankruptcy when the only rate the debtor could get


is --


QUESTION:  Well, why isn't that a valid


distinction? 


MR. SALMONS:  Because, Your Honor, from the


standpoint of section 1325(a)(5), the relevant inquiry is


what is the present value of the promised future payments


from the debtor.  All creditors are now facing the exact


same situation, and I think respondent concedes this.  And


those are the risks of inflation, the time value of money,


and the risk that particular payments may not be made


under a plan.  And there's no reason to think --


QUESTION:  Well, and the risk --


MR. SALMONS:  -- that those are different for


creditors --


QUESTION:  The risk of the security will just


disappear too, you know, be totally devalued.


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, I don't think that's


embodied in section 1325(a)(5).  If anything, that's


captured in the higher replacement value standard for the


valuing of the underlying claim that this Court adopted in


Rash.  And I would add that -- that one reason to think


why the discount rate here doesn't need to go too far in

taking risks of nonpayment into account is that this Court


in Rash adopted the underlying value here, replacement


value, that's typically significantly higher than what


the --


QUESTION:  What has that to do with it?  I don't


see what that has to do with it at all. 


MR. SALMONS:  Well, Your Honor, what --


QUESTION:  I mean, the reason I say that is I


thought we were following a statute, and what the statute


tells us is that the value of what they receive has to


equal $4,000.  They receive a set of promises to pay so


much a month and the right to repossess if those promises


are not kept.  Now, that's what the statute tells us to


do.  So let's do it. 


What do we care how they arrived at 

the $4,000?


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, my only point is that


this Court in Rash noted that the higher replacement --


QUESTION:  Whatever it said in Rash, reading the


statute, unless they actually contradicted that, doesn't


the statute say what I just said?  So the problem in the


case is how do we value the stream of payments plus the


repossession value?


MR. SALMONS:  I think --


QUESTION:  I would have thought that that kind


of thing is something bankruptcy judges are paid to make

judgments about all the time.


MR. SALMONS:  Well, I -- I generally agree with


-- with Your Honor's statement.  What -- what I would add,


though, is that the dispute in this case is not -- I mean,


it's undisputed that inflation and the time value of money


have to be taken into account under -- under the discount


rate.  The only question is whether you have to take into


account the risks of nonpayment.  We submit that there --


QUESTION:  Of course, you do.  Of course, you


do.  There is a risk of nonpayment and anything that


didn't take that into account would not be equating the


property with the $4,000. 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, if -- if this Court


believes that risks of nonpayment need to be taken into 

account, then we submit that the best way to do that is to


start with a market indicator such as the prime rate that


captures the time value of money and the risk of inflation


and then -- then allow -- and -- and some risk of


nonpayment, and then allow the bankruptcy court, which --


which, by the way, has just made a determination under


1325(a)(6) about the likelihood that -- that the payments


will be made.  And it has made --


QUESTION:  Start with a figure that you know for


sure is wrong.  You know for sure that this person who got


a 21 percent car loan because he was a bad credit risk was

never going to get the prime rate of 8 percent. 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  Why begin with -- with something --


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, the answer to your


question --


QUESTION:  -- that you know is going to be


abysmally low except for the fact that it will mean less


money for the secured creditors and more money for the


unsecured creditors, among whom is often numbered the


United States? 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor -- Your Honor, the


answer to your question --


(Laughter.) 


MR. SALMONS: 


The answer to your question is 

because there is no rate you can find that -- that


precisely reflects the unique mix of risks and benefits


and protections that are available under the Bankruptcy


Code.  And so by definition, everyone here is talking


about a proxy in some form or another. 


Now, what the prime rate does do is is it


accurately captures the time value of money and inflation. 


Now, we submit that the bankruptcy court, which has just


examined the plan -- it has made a determination.  In


fact, it has found that the payments -- that the debtor


will be able to make the payments under the plan -- that

bankruptcy court is in the best position to make a


determination about plan-specific risks of nonpayment if


those risks are going to be included.  And that's a much


more efficient system than forcing the bankruptcy court to


go out and try and find some -- some elusive market that


-- that would serve as a proxy for that determination.


QUESTION:  Well, you could ask them to just look


at the contract rate and, if need be, make some adjustment


to that because of the fact that they won't have to --


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  -- go through the collection process.


MR. SALMONS:  -- the difficulty with the


contract rate approach is that it varies from creditor to


creditor, and there really is no reason to think that --

that either secured creditors, or unsecured creditors for


that matter, for purposes of -- of this case, should be


treated differently.  They all face the exact same risks


of nonpayment, the exact same problems of inflation and


time value of money.  They are similarly situated. 


QUESTION:  In this case, as I understand it,


this lender always charged 21 percent.  It didn't differ


from -- from lender -- borrower to borrower.  Every one of


them was charged 21 percent.  That was the market.


MR. SALMONS:  And -- and another secured


creditor may have made a loan prior to that at a prime

rate to the same debtor, and it always charges the prime


rate, neither of which is particularly relevant to the


question of what's the value of the promised payments


under the plan. 


QUESTION:  But if the second one was so stupid


as to do that, why should he be protected? 


MR. SALMONS:  Well, Your Honor, it's not a


matter of stupidity.  It's a matter of the fact that a


debtor's position changes over time and that what may be a


good rate 2 years out from bankruptcy and that is still


owed would not be the rate you'd give immediately before


bankruptcy.  And it may not be the relevant risks of


nonpayment that exist under bankruptcy.


The point is that -- is that as -- as this Court 

understood in Rash, the -- the creditor is entitled to the


value of its allowed secured claim, and this Court noted


in Rash that already compensates significant risks of


nonpayment. 


Now, I would add, if I may --


QUESTION:  Because if this had been foreclosure


value, then if we were going through this exercise, well,


the creditor would -- would then sell the asset and -- and


charge a -- a new borrower with the same rate of interest. 


But the asset would be worth much less than the price --


MR. SALMONS:  That -- that's correct, and Your

Honor, I would add that in fact we think it's possible to


read the statute so there's no risk of nonpayment at all


because the statute refers to property to be distributed


under the plan, and it requires the bankruptcy court to


make a finding that the debtor will be able to make


payments.  And there's no guidance whatsoever that would


give bankruptcy courts a way to do anything more, and so


we think in fact that an appropriate rate could even be


the Treasury bill rate which --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Salmons. 


MR. SALMONS:  -- excludes that. 


Thank you. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Brunstad, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR. 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The formula approach is surely inaccurate.  It


systematically under-values the true risks and costs of a


chapter 13 promise of repayment.  We know at best


statistically that chapter 13 debtors at best have a 40


percent rate of -- of payment on the plans.


QUESTION:  How -- how many default? 


QUESTION:  Your -- your opponent says that the


-- that that's -- if you're taking after the thing is

confirmed, after -- that it's a 63 percent.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes, Your Honor.  There -- there


is one study that suggests that, but I must -- I must add


that -- that there are other studies that say that the


successful completion rate is as low as 3 percent in some


jurisdictions.  Some 97 percent of chapter 13 fail.


QUESTION:  After confirmation.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Those are -- that's a total


number, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  That's the difference between


your statistics --


QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- and hers.


QUESTION:  Since -- and since this is an after-


confirmation case, why -- why don't we take that


percentage? 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Well, Your Honor, giving them the


benefit of the doubt, we -- the best we can say, based


upon what we know, is approximately a 63 percent success


rate.


QUESTION:  After --


QUESTION:  What do you say to Mr. Salmons'


argument that in fact the -- the plan is not supposed to


be confirmed unless the judge makes a -- a determination


that it can be followed, and it therefore isn't legitimate

to take this kind of risk into consideration at all?


MR. BRUNSTAD:  It's what we call the feasibility


standard, Your Honor, and it applies in every single one


of the reorganization chapters.  The bankruptcy court must


merely determine that the bankruptcy judge feels that the


debtor will successfully complete the plan.  We know,


however, that given the extremely high rate of default in


chapter 13, which far exceeds chapter 11, for example,


that the feasibility standard doesn't even come close to


ensuring --


QUESTION:  Well, how do we know how -- how many


-- what's the percentage of people in this chapter that


default within a year on -- on a payment of about $128 a


month I guess, that was a small percentage of what they 

were paying into the court?  What's the figure?


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Well, there are two sources.  The


best statistics that I've been able to come up with is


that it's about a 60 percent failure rate.


QUESTION:  60 percent fail within a year?  You


said that 40 percent failed overall. 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  60 percent fail within the 3- to


5-year period.


QUESTION:  No.  I asked you how many -- this is


-- or let's take it then giving you the benefit of the


doubt.  The payment plan was for 17 months.  What is the

percentage of people who fail to make a -- I guess it was


about 10 percent or 20 percent of the amount he was paying


into court.  How many fail to make that kind of payment


within 17 months?


MR. BRUNSTAD:  The statistics are not


disaggregated on that basis, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Correct.  That's what I would think.


So what is wrong with us saying just by chance


what the statute says?  What the statute says is,


bankruptcy judge, here's what you do.  You create a stream


of payments such that that stream of payments plus the


value of the repossession equals $4,000.  Now, that's your


job.  Go do it.  So I would have thought, if I were the


bankruptcy judge, the way I'd do it would be by looking to 

the prime rate and then asking me -- asking you or others


to tell me how much riskier this is than the prime rate,


and I'd choose a number.  And I can't imagine how we're


going to come one whit closer than that general


instruction, but you'll tell me why it is possible to come


closer.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Your Honor, the contract rate is


the best evidence, the single best evidence of the market


rate. 


QUESTION:  Contract rate -- if there has to be a


number that's wrong, it has to be that one.

QUESTION:  The contract rate by definition was


entered into at some significant period of time prior to


the present, and the present, by chance in this instance,


is 2 years later, and we know that interest rates fell at


least 1 or 2 percent during that time.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  But not for subprime --


QUESTION:  So -- what?


MR. BRUNSTAD:  But not for subprime loans.


QUESTION:  That's impossible.  The prime rate --


MR. BRUNSTAD:  No, Your Honor.  This is why. 


QUESTION:  If that's so, then the risk went up.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  No, that's not correct, Your


Honor, and this is why. 


QUESTION:  No.  It isn't? 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Because State law caps the


maximum rate that can be paid. 


QUESTION:  Oh, okay.  Okay. 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  So it increases the pool --


QUESTION:  All right.  All right.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  -- of who can be lent to, but not

problem.

 QUESTION:  So -- so you would be free with your


experts to come in and say why it happens to be that the


bankruptcy judge is wrong to take the prime rate and add a


risk factor, but ordinarily a contract entered into in


advance would not be good evidence of what the interest


rate is today.  Now, where am I wrong in that?


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Because, again, the contract rate


is the best evidence of a market rate between this


borrower and this lender with this particular --


QUESTION:  At a prior time. 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  At a particular time --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  -- particularly if it's


contemporaneous to the filing.  It reflects it and --


QUESTION:  Oh, yes, of course.  I'm -- but I'm


-- I'm simply saying isn't it true by definition that a


contract entered into at an earlier period of time where


interest rates fluctuate is not going to be very good


interest -- evidence of what that interest rate is today.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Well, Your Honor, the contract


rate is not perfect, but it's far superior to the formula


approach, and what you see happening -- Justice Ginsburg,


the Second Circuit in the Valenti case came up with a 3-


point factor, just simply canvassing some lower court


decisions and decided prime rate plus 1, 2, or 3 points.

It's not based on any evidence.  It's just simply based


upon what the court felt was an appropriate range.


QUESTION:  Your --


QUESTION:  If you take Mr. Salmons' point that


now we're in bankruptcy, it's a different world, and we've


got one creditor -- let's say $4,000 is the principal for


both, but one lent at prime and one lent at subprime. 


Once we're in the universe of bankruptcy, why shouldn't


those two lenders, both with $4,000 principals, be treated


the same? 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  If their risks are different,


they should be treated differently, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  But once you're in the bankruptcy,


the risk of getting back the $4,000 is the same for both 

creditors, isn't it? 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Not necessarily so, Your Honor. 


You can take a situation.  Say you have a hotel, a common


asset in bankruptcy.  The hotel may have a senior secured


creditor and a junior secured creditor.  The number one


secured creditor's risks are materially less than the


junior secured creditor's.  They would be separately


classified.  Because their risks are different, the


interest rates are different. 


In this very case at page 12 of the joint


appendix, you can see how the debtor broke down its four

secured creditors into four separate categories, and they


have different rates.  Two secured creditors are offered


9.5 percent and two are offered 0 percent interest for the


payments the debtor is going to make. 


The concept of equality of distribution is


precisely equality of distribution among similarly


situated creditors.  Secured creditors are each unique by


their own definition of the risks that they take.  They


have collateral. 


QUESTION:  And your response to Justice Breyer's


question, as I understand it, is that 21 percent may not


be precisely what the rate is today for a loan made 3


years ago, but it's going to be a lot closer to it than 8


percent is.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  That, plus the fact that the 21


percent is often going to be actually too low to reflect


the actual risk being assumed.


QUESTION:  Well, that may be.  Well, that may


be, but what I didn't understand about your answer is when


you said that the contract rate must be more accurate than


the formula.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  It seems to be.


QUESTION:  Since the formula by definition is


perfect --


MR. BRUNSTAD:  No, Your Honor.

repossession with $4,000, the formula by definition is


perfect.  So --


MR. BRUNSTAD:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Well, why isn't it?


MR. BRUNSTAD:  The formula rate is essentially


standardless, and what we have seen how bankruptcy courts


apply the --


QUESTION:  You're saying I take -- you're saying


that --


QUESTION:  But yours is in theory perfect.


QUESTION:  Wait.  No, no.  Answer --


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Imperfect.  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  No, no.  Yours is in theory perfect


just as -- as the formula is in theory perfect.  In both


of them you -- you begin with a starting point, and then


you make whatever adjustments the reality of the risk


requires.  That brings you theoretically in both cases a


perfect answer.


The only question is, as a practical matter,


which of the two is likely to come closer to the correct


answer, starting with 8 percent that you know is way off


the mark and then letting the bankruptcy judge figure out


how much you add to that, or starting with 21 percent

which, you know, is -- is -- it could be high, it could be


low.  It's much fairer to both parties, but then let the


bankruptcy judge adjust that a little bit.  That's the


question:  what -- what the practical consequence is not


the -- the theoretical.  They're both perfect


theoretically. 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  In theory, Your Honor, yes, but


we must be faithful to is the statutory command.  And here


what we see happening is what happens in this case.  A


bankruptcy judge takes the formula approach, a --


basically a low rate, the prime rate, and is supposed to


adjust it.  And what do they do?  Well, there's no


evidence to support any adjustment in this particular


case. 


The debtors' expert did not testify that he knew 

anything about the risks of these particular debtors. 


There's no basis for the adjustment.  The bankruptcy court


did what bankruptcy courts do in these cases; it simply


picked a number.


QUESTION:  Well, couldn't the creditor have


brought in an expert?


MR. BRUNSTAD:  The creditor did bring in two


witnesses, and the witnesses testified that these


particular debtors with their particular credit histories


would be charged a 21 percent rate of interest. 


QUESTION:  Well, can you tell me why is it that

the petitioners tell us that their standard is so much


easier to administer?  Is it because the courts aren't


administering it in the right way?  As I listened to it,


it seems to me I have two choices.  I can begin with a low


rate and add or I can begin with a high rate and -- and


subtract.  Why -- why is one any more easy to administer


than -- than the other?


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Because --


QUESTION:  In fact, it -- it would seem to me --


and this I suppose helps you -- that if the courts which


are using the petitioners' formula are doing it the right


way, it might even be harder to administer.  They -- they


avoid that problem by just accepting some interest factor


of 1 to 3 percent out of the blue although I don't know 

how they do that. 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Well, Justice Kennedy, what we


have is we have three circuits which have adopted the


formula approach, and so we have the experience of the


courts in those circuits, and we have the balance of the


circuits, approximately seven, that have taken more of the


market rate approach.  And what we see happening is that


in those situations where the bankruptcy courts are


applying the formula approach, they are systematically


giving chapter 13 debtors a rate of interest pretty close


to prime.  Now, that can't be correct.  That gives the

debtors with the single highest default rate in bankruptcy


the lowest rates available in bankruptcy.


QUESTION:  Would it satisfy you if we said this? 


Suppose we said we see what we're after here.  The


objective is to equate the stream of payments plus


repossession with $4,000.  Now, on the one hand, we know


it can't be lower than the prime.  On the other hand, if


the creditor wants to come in and give a -- present his


evidence, the contract, of how risky this person is, then


in fact it is evidence absolutely.  And the bankruptcy


judge will look at it, and he'll try to figure out the


pluses and the minuses, what's happened to the interest


rate, whether this particular person is a good or bad


risk, and he'll choose a number. 


Don't judges do things 

like that all the time? 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  And apparently incorrectly


systematically in chapter 13 cases.


QUESTION:  But no.  But does what I say satisfy


you? 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  No, Your Honor.  And here's why.


QUESTION:  If not -- because? 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Because the true market rate of


interest is almost always going to be at least the


contract rate, presumptive contract rate, because the


costs in chapter 13 are so much more extraordinarily

higher than the costs of collection outside of chapter 13. 


The automatic stay stays in place for the duration of the


plan.  If you have a default, the secured party has to


come back to the bankruptcy court, hire an attorney, pay a


$75 filing fee, argue the case.  Bankruptcy judges


routinely give the debtor a second chance to cure the


default.  They have to come back.  The costs of collection


-- that's even before you get to foreclose on your


collateral.  The costs of --


QUESTION:  But don't you get certain advantages? 


I mean, you do have the wage order.  So there's a court


supervising that this wage -- every month that this


person, this borrower, is going to have to pay.


And in the -- in -- in that setting you also 

have -- going back to Rash, the one thing I don't


understand about it because it seems you want to take it


the high side both ways.  You've already been given the


replacement value rather than the foreclosure value.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  So if we're going to do it your way


and say, well, now, suppose the lender foreclosed on the


asset, made a new loan at the 21 percent rate -- but you


would have to use not the replacement value, the higher


value.  You could only use what you could get on


foreclosure if we follow your theory about we should make

it just like you sold the asset, got money, and made a new


loan.  But the -- but you -- but the amount that you got


would be much less than the replacement value which is


what you're getting inside the bankruptcy.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Your Honor, the secured creditor


in the chapter 13 cramdown context is not trying to make


any profit.  It's simply trying to mitigate against the


enormous losses that it suffers. 


QUESTION:  But isn't that one of the adjustments


that would have to be made?  You couldn't say adjust 20


percent against $4,000.  You'd have to say $4,000 minus


because your foreclosure price is going to be much lower


than the replacement costs that you've got in the


bankruptcy.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  But taking the extremely high


risks of default and the costs of actually having to


foreclose in the chapter 13 context, the relevant market


rate for the value of the stream of payments is always


going to be at least the -- the pre-bankruptcy contract


rate.  In fact, it should --


QUESTION:  Mr. Brunstad --


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- let me suggest a scary thought.


(Laughter.)

statute does not provide an answer to this question? 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  That since both of these schemes,


your proposal and the other side's proposal, are


theoretically perfect, if they are done correctly, the


bankruptcy court is free to use either one so long as he


comes up with the right answer.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  I mean, the only thing the statute


says is what -- what Justice Breyer keeps coming back to. 


You have to provide him $4,000 in value.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  No, Your Honor.  The -- the


bankruptcy statutes sometimes are obscure until we see


where they come from, which is why we often look at their 

history.  The master concept of cramdown is indubitable


equivalence.  It comes from Judge Hand's opinion in the


Murel Holdings case.  And the example in 1325(a)(5)(B)


that we're talking about is simply an example of


indubitable equivalence.  The secured party must be fully


compensated for the risk that it must assume.  The concept


of indubitable equivalence must be completely


compensatory.  The secured party is not supposed to take


uncompensated risk.


QUESTION:  Nobody is disagreeing with you about


that.  That -- what we're -- I think what we're trying to

get to -- it's a practical question.  I actually think my


approach is more perfect than Justice Scalia's perfect


approach. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  But the reason is it asks the right


question. 


Now, what you're telling me is that by asking


the right question, the bankruptcy judges systematically


have not done it right.  And -- and I see your point.  So


-- so what we're -- so we're trying to think of a form of


words we could say which would lead -- I can't say take


the contract rate because I know that must be wrong.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION: 


We could say take the contract rate 

and go down, and then they'll have the same problem.  I --


I mean -- all right.  But that's what we want them to do,


is to honestly equate the value of the payments with the


$4,000.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  I think everybody wants that, and


we're searching -- at least I am -- for a way of how to do


that.  You keep telling me you take contract rate.  I hate


to tell you I keep thinking no.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  As a presumptive rate, Your


Honor.  And it's important to understand just after this

Court's decision in Rash set the valuation standard for


setting the principal amount, what you see now is that


since we got the standard right, in 99 percent of the


cases, the parties come to an agreement as to what the


value of the collateral is.  Once we get the standard


right here, you should expect the same thing.  It won't be


litigated over and over again. 


The correct standard is I think to recognize,


which I think Your Honor does, that this concept of


present value is an economic concept, not an equitable


one, and that essentially what we're doing is we're saying


there is a stream of payments to be made here and we have


to figure out what it's worth.  The best test for what


it's worth would be what the market says. 


Now, the problem is, is that in chapter 11 there


is a market.  People do lend to chapter 11 debtors, and


the standard is the same in chapter 11 as 13:  value as of


the effective date of the plan under 1129.  So what we --


we have to be very careful about is in chapter 11, the


markets do value debtors' promises to pay and they lend


money and they charge very high interest rates.  Exit


lenders or finance lenders charge very high interest


rates, 18, 19, 20 percent.  It can't be true that in


bankruptcy, in chapter 13, who are the riskiest chapter --


riskiest debtors with the highest default rate, that we

systematically give them a rate which approaches prime. 


So I think what you need to do, recognizing it's an


economic concept, is say what's the best evidence of a


market rate.


QUESTION:  I understand.  Tell me an -- a


question I don't know the answer to.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  When -- when -- if you repossess --


if he defaults again -- I mean, the first time he got into


bankruptcy.  Now, we've got the plan.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And suppose he doesn't make the


payments on the truck.  Does it then cost you a lot of


money to go back even though you say to the judge, judge, 

this is the second time?  We'd like our truck now.  It's


only worth $2,000 now.  And you still have to pay the $75,


get your witnesses and everything the second time?


MR. BRUNSTAD:  What happens the second time,


Your Honor, is if the debtor defaults under the plan, the


automatic stay is still in effect.  Unlike chapter 11


cases, where the automatic stay terminates when the plan


is confirmed or becomes effective, here the automatic stay


stays in place until the end of the repayment period.  So


if the debtor defaults under the plan, someone has to go


back to court and say, I need relief.  I need relief from

the automatic stay to exercise my collection rights. 


A corporation like SCS can't go back to court


pro se.  It needs a lawyer.  You have to hire somebody to


go and represent them.  You have to pay a filing fee. 


Oftentimes the bankruptcy judge gives the debtor a second


chance to cure the default under the plan.  Then the


debtor says I'll cure, and then you come back a second


time, sometimes a third time, sometimes a fourth time,


sometimes a fifth time, incurring costs at each juncture. 


On loans that typically range between $5 to $15,000,


having to go to court even once --


QUESTION:  Is that compensated for to some


extent --


MR. BRUNSTAD:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  -- that factor by the fact they're


using Blue Book value to value the car rather than what


it'd actually be worth in your hands once you repossess


it?


MR. BRUNSTAD:  No, Your Honor.  I think that


covers the depreciation problem.  As we have delay and not


payment, we have a rapidly depreciating asset, which the


debtor is continuing to possess and drive around.  This


interest rate compensate for the risk of nonpayment of the


promises to pay after confirmation and the costs


associated with the debtor's default if the debtor does

default under the plan. 


QUESTION:  I -- I don't think it's certainly


conclusive of the point, but the initial 21 percent rate,


I take it, did take into account the risk of default.  So


in a sense, the creditor has received up front some


compensation for the risk that in fact has occurred.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes, but at the time the loan is


made, Your Honor, we don't know who in the pool of -- of


debtors is going to default.  Once the default happens --


QUESTION:  Well, but -- but overall, you account


for that.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Overall the risks are spread, but


if you force the secured party to systematically subsidize


interest rates to chapter 13 debtors, who have now 

demonstrated by their filing they are the riskiest of the


risky, what you will eventually have happen is a


contraction of the ability to lend.


QUESTION:  But -- but your original -- you


charge 21 percent, and a lot of people are going to


successfully pay that and that stream there takes into


consideration some account for those who don't pay and go


into bankruptcy, doesn't it? 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes, Your Honor, but we shouldn't


reward those who file bankruptcy with a rate that is less,


since they are the riskiest of the risky, than we would

charge the other members of the pool who avoid bankruptcy.


QUESTION:  Maybe they're not.


QUESTION:  The -- the Bankruptcy Code, I take


it, has solicitude for debtors.  Isn't that one of its


purposes?


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes, but --


QUESTION:  Or does that just drop out when we


come to the cramdown problem? 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  As this Court indicated in the


Johnson case, section 1325(a)(5)(B) is for the protection


of creditors.  It is a limit on the debtor's ability to


adjust or restructure the creditor's rights.  It is the


creditor's protection.  The debtor has options.  If the


debtor wants to surrender the collateral, it may and 

discharge the debt.  That is the protection for the


debtor.


QUESTION:  But what about then taking this idea? 


I'm trying to figure out how -- we say, okay, we really


mean it.  It has to equate those two things.  Now, that


put -- and -- and then stop and say, you can do it with --


I -- I think, you know, prime plus or whatever, maybe the


other.  But -- but then put the burden back on you to


produce some real evidence and statistics about what


happens to people we don't know about.


Now, who are those people?  We agree they've

gone into bankruptcy, so they're risky, but they're also


trying to get a second chance, and they also want to keep


things like the truck because it will help them in their


business.  And the bankruptcy judge has sat there and


looked them in the eye.  And you have all those things


about it which you don't have about the people you're


giving the 21 percent to which is a great mass of


undifferentiated people.


So then you have the burden of trying to bear it


out with statistics and so forth that these people really


are risky.  And the bankruptcy judge can't just sit there


and say, oh, I feel sorry for them.  All right?  What


about something like that?


MR. BRUNSTAD: 


Well, Your Honor, when we get to 

the chapter 13 confirmation stage, we're in a similar


position as when we are at the beginning of making loans


to a pool of applicants.  We don't know who's going to


default and who doesn't.  We do know that a large


percentage will.  We do know that the best evidence of a


market rate for these particular class of borrowers is the


contract rate.  And the question then becomes, do we want


to have a system which requires us in each bankruptcy case


then to take evidence complicatedly in 471,000 chapter 13


cases as to, gee, we need statistics and evidence as to


this individualized debtor?

 QUESTION:  No, I mean, you wouldn't have to go


that far.  Maybe you just have to do it in one or two. 


But at least we'd get to the stage of people who have


trucks and use them for a year and, you know, at least


we'd have somewhat better information than just knowing


about the default rate in bankruptcy cases in general. 


And we get a little finer than that.  You see, that's what


I'm trying to work with.  I don't have an answer. 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  I understand. 


QUESTION:  I'm asking.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  I understand, Your Honor, and I


wish I could give you a precise formula.  The problem is


that these things are normally left to the market to do. 


Congress has said -- Congress has said basically use an 

economic market concept here in a context in which the


default rate is so high that lenders are just not willing


to lend to chapter 13 debtors.  Again --


QUESTION:  But -- but I -- I thought the


difficulty of administration charge was the one that the


petitioners were making against you.  How -- how do I sort


that out?


MR. BRUNSTAD:  And I think -- I think it was


Your Honor who also mentioned that -- that our standard is


no less cumbersome than theirs.  We think it is superior


because it will yield the correct result more often.

 QUESTION:  No more cumbersome.  Surely, you mean


it's no more cumbersome than theirs. 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes, Your Honor.  I -- I


misspoke.  Excuse me.


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. -- Mr. -- it is to this


extent.  Most of these debtors are very small debtors. 


You say take the contract rate as the presumptive rate and


then we're going to knock down for all these other things. 


The high replacement cost that -- is one thing.  The


interest that they got before bankruptcy is another.  The


transaction cost that they're saved, another.  And so let


the debtor come in and show that.  But the debtor has no


money at all and certainly you don't want the debtor's


money eaten up hiring an attorney and further depleting 

the money that could go to the creditors.


So it seems to me wildly unrealistic to expect


that if you say the presumptive price is the contract


price, you're going to get a debtor who will be able to --


I mean, I was surprised, looking at this record, that this


debtor got an expert.  Who -- who paid the expert?  Maybe


because the union was involved? 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  I do not know the answer to that,


Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  But isn't it typical that these


chapter 13 debtors don't have lawyers and don't have

experts? 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  No.  They often have lawyers,


Your Honor. 


But let me suggest this.  If the Court were to


set the rate at the presumptive -- the contract rate as


the presumptive rate, this is what would happen and this


is what has happened in circuits where that is so.  The --


the contract rate becomes the presumptive rate, and in


most cases the debtor will offer that in its plan -- in


his or her plan as the appropriate rate.  If the debtor


doesn't like that, we'll offer less of a rate and then


what happens is a negotiation.  And the debtor and the


secured party get together and they negotiate based upon


the debtor's presentation of this is why I think it should 

be adjusted off of that because my circumstances have


improved or there's a lot of equity in this particular


collateral, so your risks are less, so you're more


protected.  And those various reasons can then be given,


and then the parties can negotiate. 


If, however, you set a standard where the


bankruptcy court is just simply going to decide based upon


the evidence that the parties put in, we're not going to


adopt the formula approach, then you'll be back to the


problem where we are before, lots of litigation.  Again,


because the contract rate is the best evidence of a -- of

a market rate between these parties, it should be the


presumptive rate and we should work from that.


QUESTION:  Is there any --


QUESTION:  May I ask you a question that's run


through my mind listening to this argument?  Going back to


the Rash case, was it, that we --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- we did not there -- the majority


did not there.  I was in dissent in that case. 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  -- did not take the case to try and


replicate what would have happened if there had been no


bankruptcy.  They said, we won't -- won't treat it as a --


now, you're in effect asking we do treat the case as close 

as possible to what you would have negotiated in a free


market.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Not quite, Your Honor.  I think


actually this is the same analysis as in Rash.  What the


Court said in Rash that the parties had to do was the


debtor had to go out -- the debtor already has the truck


-- had the truck in Rash -- is go out and see what it


would have cost the debtor to replace that truck.  It


didn't actually do it, but simply say what would it have


cost.


The same principle applies here.  The debtor

should actually go out and see what would someone pay. 


How much would someone charge to finance this debtor's


loan?


QUESTION:  Yes, but in doing that, they were


saying, we're going to do that instead of trying to


predict what would happen to -- in the normal course of


events between the contracting parties if bankruptcy had


not intervened. 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Well, that's true.  In this case,


though, that also applies.  What would happen if


bankruptcy had not intervened is the secured party would


have foreclosed, repossessed the collateral, and avoided


all the costs. 


QUESTION:  But not at replacement value.  You


would not have gotten replacement value. 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  That's true, Your Honor, but the


reason why you have replacement value is because the


debtor is going to keep the -- the collateral and prevents


the secured party from exercising its rights and forces


the secured party to incur costs that it otherwise would


avoid. 


Now, the whole purpose of the value requirement


and the indubitable equivalent concept and the whole


cramdown standard is to make sure the secured party


doesn't -- isn't shouldered with uncompensated risk.

 So the question becomes what's best method of


compensating the secured party for its risk.  And the


statute, because of what it requires, value as of the


effective date of the plan using an economic concept, says


we basically have to value the stream of payments.  Nobody


really is willing to say I would give this debtor $4,000


or take this debtor's promise of payment of $4,000 at --


at a prime rate or anything close to a prime rate.  Again,


the contract date is the best evidence of a market


valuation that we have.  And so that's what I think we


have to work with --


QUESTION:  Is there any --


MR. BRUNSTAD:  -- to be faithful to the statute.


QUESTION:  Is there any indication that if we


take that, that in fact it will increase the likelihood of


default under the plan simply because the higher contract


rate will tend to put more pressure on the -- the debtor


than the debtor in fact ultimately can -- can satisfy?


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Well, Your Honor, in the circuits


where that already is the standard, that the -- that the


presumptive rate is basically the rate that we use.


QUESTION:  Yes.  What is their experience? 


MR. BRUNSTAD:  There -- there is no information


to say it's higher default rate.  And certainly the fact

that most of the circuits have this standard has not


stopped chapter 13 from being filed.  They keep -- every


year the number goes up.  So we're now at about 470,000


chapter 13 cases a year.


QUESTION:  But it seems pretty obvious if it's a


higher rate, there are going to be more defaults.


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Well, not necessarily, Your


Honor, for this reason.  Because the debtor makes -- the


-- the debtor does not make payments directly to creditors


under the chapter 13 plan.  The debtor makes payments to


the chapter 13 trustee as a dispersing agent, and the


chapter 13 trustee then distributes the money.  What


you're doing here is you're reallocating in this case a


few hundred dollars away from unsecured creditors toward 

the secured creditor because, again, the statute says the


secured creditor is not required to take -- shoulder


uncompensated risk for the benefit of anybody else. 


That's --


QUESTION:  Why not take the credit card rate?


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Sorry, Your Honor? 


QUESTION:  Why not take the credit card rate? 


Why not take his mortgage rate?  I mean, you see, those


aren't the right rates, are they?


MR. BRUNSTAD:  Here we have a situation in which


the correct rate for auto loans is evidenced by -- I think

best evidenced by the auto loan contract.  It is a loan


between this lender and this debtor, decided in the


marketplace, with this particular collateral.  It is the


best evidence of a market rate that we have.  It's not


perfect, Your Honor.  I concede that, but it is the best


evidence. 


QUESTION:  It's evidence at a different time


before you had all the considerations.  I mean, we're


going in circles, and I mean, in some respects it's good,


in some respects it's bad.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Brunstad.


Ms. Harper, you have 2 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF REBECCA J. HARPER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MS. HARPER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 


First of all, we need to get back to the concept


of present value.  Present value is the time value of


money, which is the real rate of interest plus inflation. 


The record in this case shows that the real rate of


interest was 2-and-one-half percent, and inflation was 3-


and-one-half percent. 


Now, in this case, the debtors made all the


payments.  They actually paid the contract off early, but


we need to start with as pure a base as possible and then


if there are special circumstances, sure, the bankruptcy

court could have discretion to add on if there is


particular jeopardy to the property. 


But we're measuring two different things here. 


The -- the statute doesn't say contract.  The statute


doesn't say market rate.  This market rate concept has


been misabused.  And it -- right now under the bankruptcy


court's interpretation anything is okay as long as you put


this market rate label on it, and that's not a proper


standard for chapter 13 confirmation.


The other problem is with the respondent's


approach, the respondent uses words out of the Bankruptcy


Act, pre-Bankruptcy Act, that simply were never enacted


under chapter 13.  Full compensation, full value of their


rights.  That's nowhere in chapter 13. 


It's not a part of 

the chapter 13 requirements.  Indubitable equivalence. 


That's not a chapter 13 confirmation concept.  That's a --


that's a concept that was brought in to confuse this


issue, but it is not chapter 13.


Respondents -- their amicus said that under


their interpretation of the statute, basically anything


goes.  A rate from 100 percent to 300 percent would be


just fine with them.  Congress has not chosen to protect


subprime creditors.  This goes against --


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Ms. Harper.
