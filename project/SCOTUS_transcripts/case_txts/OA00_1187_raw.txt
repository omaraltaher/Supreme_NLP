CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 00-1187, David R. McKune v. Robert G. Lile.


Mr. McAllister.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. McALLISTER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Choices have consequences, but they nonetheless


remain choices.  The mere withdrawal of prison privileges


such as a personal television or how much an inmate may


spend at the canteen, privileges which are not part of an


inmate's sentence and to which an inmate has no legal


entitlement, does not amount to constitutional compulsion


in violation of the Fifth Amendment, certainly not when


the reason for the withdrawal of those privileges is the


inmate's failure to comply with an unquestionably


legitimate treatment requirement that he accept


responsibility for his offenses.


QUESTION:  The problem, though, is he's forced,


in effect, to confront the treatment possibility.  It's


not an option.  I mean, the tough part of the case for me,


I think, is the fact that this is not a scheme, as I


understand the Federal scheme, in which the inmate says, I

want to take advantage of this treatment program.  This is


a scheme in which the State says, you're going to take


advantage of it, and if you don't take advantage of it,


including the admissions in the reports of other offenses,


and so on, you're going to lose substantial privileges. 


That, to me, is the tough part of the case.


MR. McALLISTER:  That's true, Justice Souter,


and our program does differ from the Federal program in


that respect, but it is still a choice for Mr. Lile.  He


does not have to incriminate himself in any way.  His


refusal to participate is not at all incriminating, and


what we're talking about in terms of what he may lose here


are really relatively mild incentives within the prison --


QUESTION:  I thought that the participation


required the prisoner to describe previous offenses that


he may have been --


MR. McALLISTER:  If he participates.


QUESTION: 

--  

committed.


MR. McALLISTER:  If he participates.


QUESTION:  That he may have committed if he


participates.


MR. McALLISTER:  Right, but what I'm saying is,


if he simply refuses to participate, there's no


incrimination whatsoever, nothing drawn from that.  He


simply --

 QUESTION:  But what happens if he refuses?  Is


he put in a different type of confinement with different


terms and conditions?


MR. McALLISTER:  He can be, yes, and he will


certainly, with our privilege incentive level system, as


the inmates work their way through they have more


privileges, and they're in the nature of how much they can


spend at the canteen --


QUESTION:  Well, everybody goes in presumably at


the same level.


MR. McALLISTER:  They start at intake.


QUESTION:  You're screened, and you start at the


same level of control.


MR. McALLISTER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Now, the prisoner says no, I don't


want to participate in that program.  Does that mean that


he stays in that opening level, or  is he then potentially


put in something even more severe than that?


MR. McALLISTER:  The Kansas regulations say, if


an inmate is recommended for this treatment program and he


refuses, he goes from level 3 to level 1.  Mr. Lile is at


level 3 because when we adopted this incentive scheme


several years ago we grandfathered in all the inmates at


the highest level, so we started them out with the level 3


privileges, which is the highest they can achieve in

prison, and it was then theirs to lose by not complying


with rules and committing disciplinary infractions, and so


forth, so he was at level 3, and when he refused to


participate he then comes down to level 1.


QUESTION:  Is that where he is today?


MR. McALLISTER:  Well, he's actually not,


because he got an injunction against -- in this case


against actually carrying out this program.


QUESTION:  In the future --


QUESTION:  So is he still incarcerated?


MR. McALLISTER:  Yes, he is.


QUESTION:  And he's at level 3?


MR. McALLISTER:  Level 3, yes.


QUESTION:  In the future, what's at issue is not


being deprived a benefit you already have, but of not


giving you benefits that you don't have?


MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I --


QUESTION:  I mean, the reason he's being chopped


down from 3 to 1 was that he was grandfathered.


MR. McALLISTER:  He was grandfathered in.


QUESTION:  But in the future, he would simply


not make it from 1 to 2 and from 2 to 3, if he didn't go


into the program?


MR. McALLISTER:  Very possibly.  I mean, very


possibly.

 QUESTION:  Because there's been some dispute


between you and the other side as to whether this is


simply the denial of a benefit or a punishment, and I'm


not sure there's a whole lot of difference, but --


MR. McALLISTER:  And in the context of the


prison --


QUESTION:  -- for the grandfathered people it


looks more like a punishment, chopping him down to 1, but


in the future, at least, he just doesn't get promoted from


1 to 2 to 3.


MR. McALLISTER:  That's certainly a possibility,


and one thing about --


QUESTION:  You say it's a possibility.  I mean,


I suppose it's always a possibility, but does the scheme


for those who are not grandfathered provide that they will


never yet be on the intake level if they are a sex


offender and so on, unless they agree to this?


MR. McALLISTER:  No.  They will progress, unless


they have other reasons that they're not, because what


happens with this program, it's an 18-month program.  Our


inmates are not even evaluated, typically, for release


until they're 2 years from their scheduled release date,


so anybody with a sentence of any length will go several


years in the system, working their way up if they're


complying with what they're supposed to do.

 QUESTION:  Well then, the only person that's


going to be in the position that Justice Scalia described


is the person who's been getting in trouble along the way


and never does progress.  The person, I take it, like this


petitioner here is going to be in the same position as


this petitioner.


MR. McALLISTER:  Yes, potentially, but in our


view it doesn't matter in the prison, should not matter in


the prison context whether you view it as taking away a


benefit or not bestowing a benefit, because none of these


inmates come in with an expectation to any of these


privileges.


QUESTION:  Could the -- Kansas do that -- this


with respect to a prisoner who's writing letters to the


editor, to the newspaper, complaining about prison


conditions?  They say, well, this -- all this is


privileged.  We don't have to give you anything.  You have


no --


MR. McALLISTER:  I think that's a different


case, and that probably takes the Court quickly to Turner,


where the Court has addressed the --


QUESTION:  But why is the First Amendment


different from the Self-Incrimination Clause?  I mean, if


in the one case you can't disadvantage the person for


exercising that constitutional right, why in the other

case can you?  I mean --


MR. McALLISTER:  Two --


QUESTION:  -- you have the First Amendment --


MR. McALLISTER:  Two things, Justice Ginsburg. 


One, we don't think we are disadvantaging here in terms of


actually compelling him.


QUESTION:  But then you should say the same


thing about the First Amendment.  You're not taking away


anything you're entitled to.  You've no liberty interest,


property interest, all that.  If that follows, then what's


wrong with saying --


MR. McALLISTER:  But in the First Amendment


context he has a right, a free speech right or a right of


access to the courts that may be at issue.  In this


context, all the Fifth Amendment says is, no person shall


be compelled, so --


QUESTION:  As I recall it, the First Amendment


says -- speaks of abridgement --


MR. McALLISTER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- right, and Fifth Amendment speaks


of compulsion.


MR. McALLISTER:  Compulsion, that's the language


in the amendment.


QUESTION:  I'm concerned about the same thing


Justice Ginsburg is concerned -- I have to say I can't

find in our cases a statement that a burden on your -- or


an unconstitutional condition which involves the Fifth


Amendment is barred, but I'm wondering if it oughtn't to


be.


Is it your -- it seems to me to follow from your


position that every prisoner in Kansas could be told,


either you confess to the crime for which you've been


convicted and all other crimes you've committed or you go


to maximum security for the rest of your time here.


MR. McALLISTER:  Not necessarily, Justice


Kennedy.


QUESTION:  Because I think the State does have


an interest in saying, we want to rehabilitate you, and


it's best for you to confront your wrong.  Would you say


the statute, or the rule I've proposed is problematic?  Is


it different from what you're proposing?


MR. McALLISTER:  I think it's potentially


different, although it is potentially permissible


constitutionally, but the question would become, what sort


of legitimate valid penological interest do we have?  Do


we have such an interest in having every inmate do that


from the day they enter prison?  This is very different.


QUESTION:  I think you can make a better


argument.


MR. McALLISTER:  We could make that argument.

 QUESTION:  It's better for people to confront


the consequences of what they've done.


MR. McALLISTER:  We could make that argument,


and in this case it's critical, actually --


QUESTION:  I'd be very troubled by that.


MR. McALLISTER:  Well, it's much more than that


in this case, because here the therapists are clear that


denial is a big problem with sex offenders, and to


overcome that denial we need a meaningful acceptance of


responsibility, not an immunity that simply allows the


inmate to talk with no consequence whatsoever,


potentially.  We need a meaningful acceptance, and that's


what we're after here, and Mr. Lile has not questioned


that's a legitimate --


QUESTION:  Well, you think it can only be


meaningful if you compel them to admit to a new crime for


which they could be prosecuted?


MR. McALLISTER:  Except with all due respect,


Justice O'Connor, we would not say we're compelling them. 


We're simply giving them a choice that has some real


consequences.  We want people in this program who really


want to participate.  We have a waiting list to get into


this program, so we don't need inmates in this program who


are not serious about this.  We have plenty who are


willing to take advantage of the program as it's done,

right now, and it's full, and there's a waiting list.


QUESTION:  Then why isn't your penalogical


interest satisfied in confining the program to those who


want to be in it, who will not be subject to this


compulsion, if that's what it is?


I mean, your argument is that we have a


penalogical interest, in effect, that justifies these


consequences.


MR. McALLISTER:  Yes, we do.


QUESTION:  But if you could fill your program


without even having to raise the issue that involves these


consequences, why do you have a penalogical interest in


the insistence that gives rise to this case?


MR. McALLISTER:  Because these fellows have


proven that most -- or, not most, but many of them will


not voluntarily engage in this program, even though they


need --


QUESTION:  I'm assuming that is so, but if you


can fill the program with people who will, why is there an


interest in effect in forcing the issue for those who do


not want to do it voluntarily?


MR. McALLISTER:  Because we still have an


interest in rehabilitating all of these sex offenders. 


Just because some of them are more willing to be


rehabilitated doesn't mean the State does not have an

interest --


QUESTION:  Well, if the program is full, then is


your interest in simply getting statements of guilt or


something from people who will never go into the program?


MR. McALLISTER:  No, and that's why he has the


choice.  He can simply refuse.  He could refuse, and


there's no incrimination if he refuses to participate, but


what he's doing is taking up a bed in the medium part of


the facility, which is overcrowded at this point, in


essence double-celled everyone, and the medium unit is a


working unit.  The medium unit is for people who are


actively involved in prison programs, and so we just don't


have the space.  If you're not going to work at your


programs, we'll move you.  That's what we're trying to do


with Mr. Lile.


QUESTION:  But it's not a voluntary program,


it's a conscription system.  What you -- first, I'd like


you to go back to the rehabilitation thing, because that


is an aim, an aspiration for every prisoner, and you made


very strongly the point that the first step in


rehabilitation is acceptance of responsibility.  If that's


so, I don't see why you -- this -- you could not do this


with every prisoner who enters.


You could say, take responsibility by confessing


that you did what you were accused of doing, no matter

what your defense was.  Two, tell us about all your other


nefarious deeds.  You apply this to sex offenders, but the


reasons that you did seem to me to be across the board. 


Is there any distinction, any constitutional distinction


that you would make, or are you saying yes, we could do


this in the case of every prisoner?


MR. McALLISTER:  If there's -- as long as


there's a deter -- a legitimate penalogical interest, yes,


potentially we could.  We don't.  We're only focused on


the sex offenders here, but if there's a legitimate reason


to do it, potentially --


QUESTION:  Well, let's take out the if, because


is there or isn't there?  Is it -- in the case of everyone


that you incarcerate there is an interest in


rehabilitating that person.


MR. McALLISTER:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  And you have said that the first step


in rehabilitation is acceptance of responsibility for the


wrong that you've done.


MR. McALLISTER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  But you also rely, don't you, Mr.


McAllister, on the fact that the therapists for this


particular type of crime have come down very hard on the


idea, and I take it perhaps there may not be the same body


of support for that sort of treatment for other offenders.

 MR. McALLISTER:  And there's certainly not, for


example, treatment programs necessarily for burglars or


robbers or other categories.  The sex offender program is


somewhat special in that respect.


QUESTION:  But constitutionally, if suddenly


somebody got a good idea here and a psychiatrist came


forward saying yes, you can reform property criminals too,


we'd be in exactly the same boat.


MR. McALLISTER:  Yes, potentially, and that's


not, in our view, a constitutional problem, because this


Court has long said none of the things we're talking about


here are atypical in prison.  The inmates have no


particular expectation of a particular set of living


conditions within prison.  Meachum v. Fano is very clear. 


They could be transferred from one prison to another for


whatever reason or no reason at all, without violating the


Constitution.  This is a very mild incentive program to


try to get these fellows to meaningfully participate in


the program.


QUESTION:  The kind of conundrum that puzzles me


that I don't have an answer to is illustrated by the trial


process itself.  I suppose the Government couldn't


possibly say, if you insist on your right to a jury trial,


and insist on your right to remain silent, we're going to


sentence you to 10 more years in jail.  But the Government

can say, if you confess, and don't go to trial, and show


true contrition, we'll give you 10 years less.  That's


written into the guidelines.


But they seem to come to the same thing.  Well,


that seems to be true of this case, and if I could


understand how to analyze the first, I might be able to


understand how to analyze the second.


MR. McALLISTER:  Well, Justice Breyer, to say


the first is different, or in essence we're different,


because all of our -- this takes place inside the prison. 


The expectations are quite different.  That's why we


discuss Sandin in the briefs, not because it is


necessarily transportable to the Fifth Amendment, but what


Sandin recognizes is prisons are very different, and what


the expectations are, what the hardships are is just a


very different situation than free citizens, and what they


may be confronted within the way of choices.


QUESTION:  You are saying you can have two


classes of prisoners, those who have confessed to their


crimes and those who haven't, and you can treat them


differently, no TV, no meat at lunch, no recreation, no


softball, and it seems to me the necessary consequence of


that for a prisoner facing a long term is that it's going


to induce confessions from innocent people.


MR. McALLISTER:  Except, Justice Kennedy -- it

may do that, but our program, just like the Federal


program, has pretty strict confidentiality limits. 


Basically there's a patient-therapist privilege that


operates here, and the only reason -- they're given a form


right up front that says the only reasons the therapist


will disclose anything that's disclosed to the therapist,


very limited, things that deal with safety within the


prison, threats to other inmates --


QUESTION: 

Mr. --


QUESTION:  I thought you conceded -- you


conceded that a prosecutor, say, in the sexual history --


he says, I committed X, Y, Z rapes -- that a prosecutor,


as long as there's no statute of limitations problem, in


Kansas -- unlike, as I understand the Federal program is,


a prosecutor could say, okay, now we're going to indict


you for that.


MR. McALLISTER:  My understanding is they could


do that in the Federal program as well, because there's no


immunity granted under the Federal program either, so if


they actually made a statement, the Federal program could


prosecute them just like we could.  We have not, in 13


years of this program.


QUESTION:  Yes, but under the Federal program


they don't suffer any loss of anything if they don't make


the statement and under yours, they do.

 MR. McALLISTER:  That's true, but --


QUESTION:  But under yours, in any case, whether


the Feds do it or not, under yours the prosecutor could


use that information, couldn't he?


MR. McALLISTER:  Could.  We never have, but


could, yes, theoretically could.


QUESTION:  May I ask you, Mr. McAllister, do you


know -- there's similar programs in a lot of States, as I


understand it.  Do any of them give the inmate immunity if


he participates in the program?


MR. McALLISTER:  Justice Stevens, it's my


understanding that some may, although I don't know the


exact number, and I do know from the State amicus brief


the 18 States that signed onto that obviously think


immunity is a bad idea and, as I said, the Federal


Government does not immunize the inmates who participate


in the Federal program.


QUESTION:  I understand the Federal Government


does not, yes.


MR. McALLISTER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Of those, how many are like Kansas? 


That is, it isn't a voluntary thing?


MR. McALLISTER:  Justice Ginsburg, I don't know


the answer to that. I don't know exactly what their


programs are like.

 Ours was the first of its kind in some sense


when we implemented this program, so some may have


followed our model, but I don't know for sure.


With the Court's permission, I'd like to


remain -- reserve the remainder of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. McAllister.


Mr. Garre, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


QUESTION:  Mr. Garre, why does the Federal


Government not think it a good idea to grant immunity?


MR. GARRE:  Justice Scalia, the Federal


Government has a very limited program that applies in only


one facility Nation-wide, and it has made a determination


to allow for voluntary participation among convicted


sexual offenders in that program.


Now, in our view that is a judgment that this


Court's decisions clearly enable the Federal Bureau of


Prisons to make, and we think that the Kansas prison


officials have acted within their judgment to adopt a


different kind of program.  As the therapists all


acknowledge, denial is one of the biggest obstacles to


receiving treatment in these kinds of programs, and I


think it's important for the Court to recognize --

 QUESTION: Are you going to get around the


answering my question?  Why did the Federal Government


think it not a good idea to grant immunity in its program?


MR. GARRE:  Oh, the Federal Government reserves


the right of the same confidentiality limits that the


State does, that is, to deal with offenses that threatens


institutional security, to deal with suspected cases of


child abuse, to deal with suspected cases of harm to


individuals within the prison or outside of the prisons. 


Those confidentiality limits are clearly related to


legitimate penalogical interests, and we think that the


Federal Government --


QUESTION:  Only those things can be prosecuted? 


I thought that it -- that prosecution was available for


anything that was disclosed, although there was


confidentiality.


MR. GARRE:  That's right.  The confidentiality


limits work in conjunction --


QUESTION:  Those are confidentiality limits, not


immunity limits, right?


MR. GARRE:  That's right.


QUESTION:  So the Federal Government has not


given use immunity for anybody in the program.


MR. GARRE:  And that's absolutely clear from the


waiver of the confidentiality statement that inmates sign

before they enrol in the program, and we think that


particularly where you're dealing with a program that does


clearly promote legitimate penalogical interests in


rehabilitating a class of offenders that poses a unique


risk of recidivism upon their release, that States, the


mere fact that the State doesn't grant immunity to inmates


who participate does not provide an answer to the


constitutional problem.


QUESTION:  The Feds --


QUESTION:  Well, does the Federal Government


deprive the prisoner of any benefits or programs if he


refuses to engage in the program?


MR. GARRE:  The Federal Government doesn't apply


the same incentive schemes that the State of Kansas does


for participation.


QUESTION:  Are there any?  What are the


incentives in the Federal program?


MR. GARRE:  The incentives -- the overriding


incentive is, of course, the value of the treatment that


the inmate receives.  Now, once a --


QUESTION:  But not -- nothing is threatened or


carried out in the Federal program to deprive the


nonconsenting prisoner of any privilege, is that right?


MR. GARRE:  Well, that's true up front in terms


of the incentive scheme.  Now, once an inmate is in the

program, and if he chooses not to comply with the


acceptance of responsibility goals, the inmate can be


transferred back to his parent facility and that can be


something on its record, but certainly up front --


QUESTION:  The choice to go into the program is


strictly the inmates.  There's no coercion or inducement. 


He loses nothing if he chooses not to go in, is that


correct?


MR. GARRE:  That's the way the Federal Bureau of


Prisons --


QUESTION:  Is it a more desirable facility?


MR. GARRE:  It is at a more desirable facility.


QUESTION:  So what he loses is, he doesn't -- he


isn't -- he doesn't get out of the rotten place he's in to


a better facility, right?


MR. GARRE:  I think that's right, and I think


it's important --


QUESTION:  But he doesn't lose a benefit that he


currently has?


MR. GARRE:  Well, we don't -- we think that the


privileges that we're talking about in the case of Kansas,


TV ownership, personal TV in the cell, visitation


privileges beyond immediate family, and lawyers, canteen


expenditures, these aren't the sorts of things --


QUESTION:  The right to work, the right to take

other programs in the prison?


MR. GARRE:  The privileges are reduced.  I think


that the chart that's on page 27 of the joint appendix


explains how they're reduced.


QUESTION:  Substantial reduction in how much you


can earn in prison, what jobs you can do in prison, isn't


that so?


MR. GARRE:  There is a definite reduction, and


the flip side of that is Kansas reserves the higher


privileges, the more modern facilities to those inmates


who choose to take the constructive steps towards


reentering society.


QUESTION:  Okay, but there's no --


QUESTION:  Mr. Garre --


QUESTION:  There's no reduction in the Federal


system, is that correct?


MR. GARRE:  There's no -- the Federal system


currently doesn't employ the same earnable privilege


scheme that the Kansas prison does.


QUESTION:  We're trying to be specific about it. 


As I think we think we understand it, the inmate cannot


lose privileges that the inmate currently enjoys simply by


exercising the option not to enter the program.  Are we


correct?


MR. GARRE:  That's correct, except that the

inmate can be sent back to his parent facility.


QUESTION:  Yes, but you have said -- you said in


your opening statement, and you seem to be backing away


from it, you said the Federal program is a voluntary


program.


MR. GARRE:  As is --


QUESTION:  It's not a voluntary program, at


least not for the people like --


MR. GARRE:  Well --


QUESTION:  That's sort of the issue here, isn't


it?


MR. GARRE:  With respect, we think that that is


the issue.  I mean, we're not talking about losing


someone's job, or means of livelihood, the consequence


faced by free individuals in the penalty cases that


respondents relied upon.  We're talking about loss of


institutional privileges that inmates have no expectation


of enjoying once they enter the prison.  We think that the


prison context is key to evaluating the Fifth Amendment


claim in this case.


QUESTION:  Let me ask you this, Mr. Garre. Maybe


you can give me some help with the larger question that's


bothering me and I think underlies Justice Ginsburg's


first question.  The rule of unconstitutional conditions


doesn't seem to apply in our cases, or hasn't been applied

in the Fifth Amendment context.  Why is that?


MR. GARRE:  Well, foremost because the Fifth


Amendment says, compelled self-incrimination.  The


amendment therefore recognizes that there are some sorts


of pressures or conditions short of compulsion which would


not meet the Fifth Amendment standard, and this Court's


cases --


QUESTION:  Anything short of compulsion does not


meet it?  That is to say, you can have two classes of


inmates, those who've confessed and those who haven't, for


all of prison life?


MR. GARRE:  Well --


QUESTION:  And isn't there a danger, then, of


inducing innocent people to confess?


MR. GARRE:  I think that type of hypothetical is


much different, much further afield than the program in


this case.


QUESTION:  Well, the Fifth Amendment doesn't say


inducing, does it, it says compelling.


MR. GARRE:  It says compelling, that's exactly


right, and that's supported by the text and history and


purpose of the amendment.


QUESTION:  Mr. Garre, don't we in fact have two


classes in all prison systems, those who have pleaded


guilty and have gotten a relatively short sentence by

reason of their guilty plea for a particular crime, and


those who have refused to plead guilty and have gotten a


longer sentence because of their refusal to do so, for the


same crime?


MR. GARRE:  That's --


QUESTION:  You have two classes in prison.


MR. GARRE:  That's absolutely --


QUESTION:  I mean, not just not being able to


spend as much at the PX, but they're there for another 15


years.


MR. GARRE:  That's correct, and I think it's


important for the Court to recognize that these sorts of


earnable daily privileges like TV ownership, canteen


expenditures, and housing in preferred facilities are


among the most common tools the prison administrators use


to manage order in the prison environment and to encourage


inmates to take socially constructive steps.  This Court's


cases like Sandin and Meachum and Bell v.Wolfish recognize


that once someone is lawfully incarcerated, that brings


about a necessary withdrawal of many rights and privileges


consistent with the needs of day-to-day management.


QUESTION:  So is compulsion anything other than


physical, or psychological?


MR. GARRE:  Oh, sure.  Sure.


QUESTION:  So what would be -- I mean, in --

outside prison we know, at least this Court's precedent


has said losing your membership in the bar, losing your


job, that counts as compulsion, even though no one is


putting you on the rack and screw.


MR. GARRE:  And we think -- we agree with Judge


Friendly and others who have suggested that those cases


lie at the outer reaches of this Court's Fifth Amendment


jurisprudence, and we think that the denial of the sorts


of common, routine privileges at issue in this case, TV


privileges, canteen expenditures, don't even come close.


QUESTION:  How about loss of visiting


privileges?  That could be crucial to a prisoner.


MR. GARRE:  Well, it's not a complete loss of


this case.  Again, the chart on page 27 of the joint


appendix in the case that --


QUESTION:  Suppose it were.  I mean, there are


some of these things that must mean all the difference in


the world to someone who's incarcerated.


MR. GARRE:  Well, I mean, the further the Court


goes out in that direction, then obviously at some point


that program would be more difficult to defend under the


Turner v. --


QUESTION:  That's the Kansas program. --


MR. GARRE:  -- analysis.


QUESTION:  They want to offer no limit on what

they can do here.  They can prosecute for a new crime that


might be disclosed, and they can deprive the prisoner of


all visiting privileges and all kinds of things.


MR. GARRE:  Well, with respect, we don't think


that that's the Kansas program.  The Kansas program offers


incentives by withholding privileges from those inmates


who choose not to take socially constructive steps.  It's


important to recognize that no one disputes that the


rehabilitation program in this case is designed to serve


legitimate penalogical interests.  There's widespread


agreement the sexual offender treatment programs benefits


inmates and society alike by enabling convicted


offenders --


QUESTION:  But it just sounds like a basic


difference.  As I understand your description in the one


Federal program, it sounds like if the prisoner says no, I


won't participate, the prisoner goes back to the facility


of origin and can still, over time, earn various


privileges, and Kansas is telling us in their scheme no,


they reserve the right to deprive the prisoner of any


privilege thereafter during his term in prison, and to put 


him in a more severe condition of incarceration.


MR. GARRE:  Well, again, I would disagree with


the characterization of the Kansas program, but more


importantly we think that the judgment made by the Federal

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW J. WILTANGER


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. WILTANGER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


If you're a prisoner in Kansas and you commit a


rape while in prison, you get the same penalties that Mr.


Lile gets.  If you're a prisoner in Kansas and you commit


arson in your cell or somewhere in the prison, you get the


same penalties that Mr. Lile gets.  If you commit a theft,


you get the same penalties.


QUESTION:  You mean, someone who commits arson


in prison gets only those penalties?  He isn't prosecuted

for committing arson?


MR. WILTANGER:  There could be a potential


prosection if they turn him over --


QUESTION:  That might --


QUESTION:  Like a number more years in jail.


MR. WILTANGER:  That could be, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  That's quite different.


MR. WILTANGER:  But under the State system they


get moved down to the same level that Mr. Lile is, and in


fact their punishment could be worse, because --


QUESTION:  And I expect the arsonist considers


that he least of his worries.


QUESTION:  When you say punishment, you assume


your answer in your favor.  What I'd like to know is, the


way they characterize it, basically, is that you come in


without anything.  Indeed, your client went -- he started


off in a maximum security part of the prison with a medium


security bed, or at least he could have done, and then


what happens is, people who participate in treatment


programs get bonuses, privileges, and if you don't


participate in the treatment program, well, obviously you


don't get the privilege.  Now, that's their


characterization of it, basically.


Yours is, well, if you start treatment and you


stop, you get punished.

 Now, you're both describing the same thing, but


it sounds as if it has very different consequences, and


how are we supposed to say which is the correct


description, the appropriate characterization?


MR. WILTANGER:  I think the difference, Your


Honor, is somewhat illustrated by the Government's


attorney in that this is not voluntary, and that once you


achieve a level -- the State has set up a structure, Your


Honor, under which if you're good, you do your job, you


get to a certain level, and that's for everybody.  They


have rules on this, and Mr. Lile did that.  He got to that


level.  He had achieved something.


And what the State does is, it comes along and


says, well, if you don't give up your Fifth Amendment


rights, and if you don't tell us about all these other


uncharged crimes, we're taking that away from you.  You'll


no longer have it.  You'll lose your job.


QUESTION:  Is that true, or is it true that


their system is, you will be awarded privileges as long as


you participate in treatment, but our privileges are open


only to people who participate in treatment?


MR. WILTANGER:  I would disagree with that, Your


Honor.


QUESTION:  All right, because?


MR. WILTANGER:  Because people in the prison

privileges --

QUESTION:  That's a different category of


MR. WILTANGER:  But there could be other sex


offenders in the prison who are not required to take SATP,


for example, if there was a -- if for some reason there


was a statutory rape penalty they may not be required to


take SATP, but yes, all prisoners in the system, sex


offenders, murderers, arsonists, get a chance to get --


QUESTION:  What case from our Court, or what


cases do you think most strongly support your position?

Garrity, Gardner, Cunningham support --

civilian society.  Do you think the denials here are of


that consequence?


MR. WILTANGER:  I do, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Why?


MR. WILTANGER:  Specifically as to the job, Mr.


Lile, if -- any inmate in the prison system in Kansas, if


they were, for example, in minimum security can work an


outside job.  They obviously can't leave, but they could


go pick up trash along the road and they could make


whatever the employer is going to pay them.  Say -- assume


it's $7 an hour.  Maybe it's not that much.  They can keep


that money.  If they don't keep all of it, they pay some


to the prison, they pay some to victims' restitution, but


if they lose their job, under the Kansas structure they


will never get to work a job that is even equivalent to


that.


QUESTION:  You're talking about a situation


where in civilian life the person who loses his job loses


his livelihood, basically.  Certainly that's not true in a


prison.  This man is going to eat whether he does it or


not.


MR. WILTANGER:  He will eat, Your Honor, but at


the same time a policeman on guard or a policeman on duty


could go out and get another job and earn something, an


equivalent wage, or possibly even a better wage.  Mr. Lile

QUESTION:  Mr. Wiltanger.


QUESTION:  Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Wiltanger -- I am


very reluctant to extend our expansive notion of what


constitutes compulsion to the area of criminal law and


penology for this simple reason.  Why does the situation


of your client differ from the situation of the person


who's been arrested for first degree order, and the case


is put to him by the prosecutor, you know, I'll go ahead


with this prosecution for first degree murder.  You will


be in prison for life.  On the other hand, if you confess


that you are guilty of voluntary manslaughter, you'll get


a 15-year term.  Now, has that person been compelled to


plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter?


MR. WILTANGER:  No, they haven't, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  But that's -- you know, either you do


it, or you're going to get life.


MR. WILTANGER:  I don't -- Your Honor, our view


is not -- is that that is not compulsion, because what is


being extended to the murder suspect is a benefit, some


way to improve your lot.


In this situation, for example, if the State


wanted to -- what they're doing -- it's not Mr. Lile's


case, because he was convicted before 1995, but if you're

convicted after 1995 you can be stripped of your good-


time credit.  They take it away from you.  If, on the


other hand, the State decided that what we're going to do


for those inmates who are participating in the program is


extend their good-time credit or make their situation


better, or give them a benefit, I don't think that's -- I


don't think that would be --


QUESTION:  It's almost a play on words, then.


QUESTION:  Well, yes, just start them off in the


worst situation and just say, you know --


QUESTION:  That certainly doesn't benefit


prisoners as a class.


QUESTION:  The Constitution surely can't turn on


that, whether you characterize it as giving them a benefit


or depriving them of a benefit they --


MR. WILTANGER:  Well, the Constitution obviously


prohibits any kind of sanction for the invocation of your


Fifth Amendment rights.


QUESTION:  Mr. Wiltanger, you said it in your


brief, and I wanted to make sure that it really is your


position.  You said, here is a man with a certain set of


privileges.  They take that away, and that's compulsion,


but if you started everyone -- you didn't say everyone,


you said every sex offender goes in at level 1, the lowest


level, and never gets out of that unless he signs up for

this program with all its terms and conditions.  That


person you say is not being compelled because for him it's


not achieving privileges rather than having privileges


taken away.


Is that -- do you adhere to that distinction,


that the State of Kansas could do exactly what it's doing


now if it said, Mr. Wiltanger and all sexual offenders,


you go in at level 1 and you never get out of it unless


you take this program?


MR. WILTANGER:  Your Honor, I do think that's


certainly closer to the -- that would be closer to a


constitutional law.  That wouldn't be unconstitutional.


QUESTION:  Would be, or wouldn't?


MR. WILTANGER:  It would not be, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  It would not be.


MR. WILTANGER:  It would not be


unconstitutional.


QUESTION:  That's what you said in your brief.


MR. WILTANGER:  It would not be


unconstitutional.  That is our position.


QUESTION:  So the whole thing, then, it comes


down to, subtraction is no good.  That doesn't work, but


addition is okay.  I mean, you could give the person


nothing in the beginning, and then the carrot is okay. But


you can t once -- so this really says to Kansas, what

you re doing, the whole program is fine. The only thing


is, you take this category of offender and you don t give


them anything until they take this program.


MR. WILTANGER:  If they could set up a system or


a structure or fashion some rules -- obviously, they don't


have that now -- I don't think that would be


unconstitutional.


Again, I do think there is -- if the Court


doesn't want to draw a hypertechnical distinction, that's


fine, but the Court -- the Fifth Amendment doesn't


prohibit benefiting somebody or making their life better.


QUESTION:  So you think the Sentencing


Guidelines would be invalid if, instead of the current


provision, which gives you good points for acceptance of


responsibility, it rather gave you bad points for refusing


to accept responsibility.


MR. WILTANGER:  I do, Your Honor.  I do.


QUESTION:  If that's so --


QUESTION:  It's a constitutional distinction.


MR. WILTANGER:  I do believe so, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  If that's so, does this case -- my


understanding of it is that the prison created a new


policy, and that policy was that everybody was at level 1


unless you participate in a recommended program, that that


was their new policy, but that your client was

grandfathered in at level 3 because he was in prison at


the time, and so this case in your opinion turns on the


fact that we're dealing with one of the few prisoners who


was grandfathered in, and therefore it's a taking away


rather than being a new prisoner who would have started at


level 1, in which case it would have been added on.


MR. WILTANGER:  Not exactly, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Because?


MR. WILTANGER:  Because all inmates -- there


were not just inmates at level 3 who were grandfathered


in.  Every single inmate who enters the prison system can


get to level 3, and as opposing counsel --


QUESTION:  Even without participating in a


recommended program?


MR. WILTANGER:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  But then they changed the rule and


said, if you don't participate in the recommended program,


you can't get to level 3.  Is that right?


MR. WILTANGER:  If -- they have not changed the


rule.  That is not the current rule.  The current rule


is -- and the way that SATP, or the sex offender treatment


is structured is, you don't really become eligible to take


it or forced to take it until about 2 years before your


first parole date, so by that time -- especially in Mr.


Lile's case.  He's been in prison for 15 years -- most

inmates are going to be at that level 3, so while he was


grandfathered in, most inmates, when they get eligible or


are forced to take it are going to be at level 3.


There has been no change in policy.  The State


is now not saying that you don't get from level 1 to level


2 unless you participate in SATP.  The law still is, if


you're at level 3, you're going to level 1, and you're


going to go to maximum security, and you're going to stay


there forever.


Again, the reference I was making at the first


is, the arsonist --


QUESTION:  That's -- this is a product of the --


they don't have the facility to give this course to


everyone, so they say, when you're getting closer to


release time, you get it, so most people who were in as


sexual offenders don't have the opportunity.


MR. WILTANGER:  Well, the State wants all --


wants their sex offenders to take it.  There is a little


bit of a concern response, but what they do is, they move


people around to make sure that those people who are


coming out --


QUESTION:  But not their first year, from what I


understand.


MR. WILTANGER:  No, Your Honor.  I apologize if


I misspoke.  You would not be entering into sex offender

treatment your first year, typically.


QUESTION:  But your brief described a system


where, suppose we had all sex offenders, they go in at


level 1 unless they take the program.  That's something


that doesn't exist in the current world only because of a


lack of resources, that Kansas can't give this program to


all the people who would qualify, so it concentrates on


the people who have served a substantial part of their


sentence already.


MR. WILTANGER:  That is correct, and please


understand, Your Honor, that that is only one possible


solution that would allow the State to continue to run its


SATP.  Obviously, another solution, as set forth by the


Tenth Circuit, would be immunity.


Another thing, to follow the program that the


Federal Government runs, make it voluntary.  Extract no


penalties, and punish no one if they don't want to


participate in the program, or take away the admission of


responsibility, or take away the need --


QUESTION:  The second one is no solution.  The


State wants people to take it.  They think it's important


for the rehabilitation of the people and for the safety of


society.  They do want to exert some pressure for people


to go into it.  The question is whether this pressure is


somehow unconstitutional when you deprive the person of

nothing to which he's entitled, nothing to which he had


any expectation of receiving when he goes into prison.  He


could have been kept at level 1 for his whole period


there.


MR. WILTANGER:  Your Honor, I agree with that. 


The one distinction I would make is, the State has set up


a system by which prisoners understand that if they do


certain things they get to levels.  While there may not be


a constitutional liberty interest in it, they do know that


if they follow the rules they're going to get to this


level.


But as far as addressing your first point,


immunity would be the result then.  If you had to have


everybody in the program, if there was no other option,


then you would extend them immunity, or the other solution


could be, if you wanted everyone in the program, don't


make them admit guilt to their crime.  Don't make them


catalogue every offense that they've never been charged


with.  Don't then use a polygraph test to sit down and


ferret out and make sure that you've got every single past


crime.  That would be one solution beyond simple immunity.


QUESTION:  But that's a solution that isn't


consistent with the therapist's idea that this is how it


should be done.


MR. WILTANGER:  Potentially, Your Honor.  I

mean, the State has not always required a written


admission of responsibility.  It's only been within the


past 10 years that they've required that.  But you're


correct, the therapists apparently believe that you have


to have an admission of responsibility.  I'm not sure why


it has to be a written statement where you fess everything


up.


QUESTION:  But certainly the Constitution can't


turn on whether or not a written statement is required.


MR. WILTANGER:  I -- Your Honor, I agree, that


is correct.


QUESTION:  Do you know -- I asked your opponent


this question -- the extent to which other States have


granted immunity to solve this problem?


MR. WILTANGER:  There are a couple of States


that I know off-hand, Your Honor.  California and Kentucky


have confidentiality provisions, privileges that keep all


of this stuff kept within.  I don't believe it's a


majority of the States that do that.  I wish I had a


better answer. I do believe Kansas is the only State that


requires all this additional ferreting out of additional


information.


QUESTION:  Well, if the -- the programs are


important, I take it, really important, and they're


thinking that this is a very important way to run them, I

give them that, all right.  Now, if I take your


approach -- and I find this very difficult.  I take your


approach, and I try to distinguish between what's the add-


on as a privilege and the subtraction as a penalty, now my


concern would be, I'm now facing a nightmare of varying


situations in prisons across the country, and varying


efforts to say what's the status quo in respect to a


particular prisoner, what is an add-on as opposed to a


subtraction, and the arguments are infinite.  Now, what


could you say that would relieve me of that concern?


MR. WILTANGER:  Well, first, Your Honor, if this


Court doesn't want to get drawn into a benefit versus a


punishment distinction, you don't have to follow that for


this rule.  That is the position that we mentioned in the


brief, that there is -- that we feel there is a difference


between a benefit and a punishment.


But I also don't think that there will be a rash


of litigation.  The Supreme Court law, obviously, as you


know, speaks to sanctions, speak to penalty, anything that


makes your indication of your Fifth Amendment rights


costly, and we've have that rule for quite sometime, and


certainly there have been cases that have come down since


then where you look at it and decide, well, is he being


penalized, so again I'm -- I apologize if I'm sticking to


a hypertechnical distinction, but I do believe that the

law would not really complicate matters, and that there is


not going to be a rash of litigation where --


QUESTION:  Well, you didn't answer the question,


though, and I have the same problem Justice Breyer does. 


I don't know that we can distinguish between a benefit and


a sanction. I don't know that that's a line that at the


end of the day is going to be a good line, so what other


line do you offer?


MR. WILTANGER:  Well, I do believe that


sanction -- or what you can look at is, you could look at


this Court's ruling as to what is a voluntary statement in


the Colman case, whether or not he's being able to make an


unconstrained choice.  Now --


QUESTION:  Why not look to what Sandin looked to


in -- true, not in the context of the Fifth Amendment, but


in another context, and that is whether you have been


deprived of in prison is beyond what is the normal


expectation of prison life.


MR. WILTANGER:  Your Honor, I think that does a


couple of things, and why we disagree with Sandin.  One


is, I think you're creating a new rule, whereas I think we


already have a fine rule that works in the Fifth Amendment


arena, and if we're concerned about applying a Fifth


Amendment rule in the prison system --


QUESTION:  No, no, we don't have a rule that

applies in the Fifth Amendment arena with regard to


depriving people of things to which they are not entitled


as free citizens.  When you deprive someone of a job, he


isn't entitled to that job.  You are depriving him of some


liberty that he, in fact, possessed.


Your client has been deprived of no liberty to


which he was entitled, not a single liberty to which he


was entitled.  He could have been kept in level 1 for his


entire period in prison.  He would have had no complaint


at all, so I don't think it's parallel to the out-of-


prison cases, so it seems to me we need a new rule for in-


prison cases.


We could have a rule that so long as you haven't


been deprived of a liberty to which you're entitled, there


has been no compulsion.  That goes pretty far.  We don't


have to go that far.  We could use a line that Sandin


uses, so long as what's been done to you doesn't go below


the normal expectation of prison life.  I mean, if they


said, you either enter this program or you're going to be


in solitary for the rest of your 15 years, you know,


that's beyond the normal expectation of prison life.  But


what your client has suffered is not that, it seems to me.


MR. WILTANGER:  Your Honor, I would agree with


you that Mr. Lile has no liberty interest at play here,


but I would also suggest that there is no liberty interest

in an at-will employment.  This Court has previously found


that if you're an at-will employee, you have no protected


property or liberty interest, and yet in those cases like


the Gardner case and the Garrity case there has been found


a Fifth Amendment violation.


There certainly is no liberty interest in being


a political party officer in the Cunningham case, and yet


we still have a Fifth Amendment violation.


QUESTION:  Don't call it liberty, call it a


right.  Call it a right.


MR. WILTANGER:  That's --


QUESTION:  He's entitled as a free citizen to


have that.  Your client is not entitled to be in level 3.


MR. WILTANGER:  But the way that the State has


set up its structure, they have made rules that they want


everybody working.  He's entitled to have a job.  They


want him to have a job.


The other reason I think Sandin doesn't work,


Your Honor, is I do share some of the concern that was


previously expressed by some of the other justices, is


that there would seem to be no reason why the State


couldn't walk up and down the hall, or up and down the


cells with a note pad and suggest, well, what's your


crime, did you do it?  I'm not really concerned at whether


you have an appeal ongoing or not, I just want to know

whether you did it, and oh, by the way, please let me know


everything else you've done.


QUESTION:  Okay, so we'll add to it, there has


to be -- and the State of Kansas is perfectly willing to


add to it, it has to be for a legitimate penalogical


purpose.


MR. WILTANGER:  And certainly I would agree with


what's previously said, that there could be a legitimate


penalogical purpose in confessing, in coming clean, and


that you will not be a model prisoner unless you take


responsibility for your crime, whether it be a sex offense


or whether it be a murder.


The other reason I think Sandin is not


applicable to this case, and should not be extended to


this case, is that this Court actually said in Sandin,


while you don't have a due process right in a particular


level of confinement, you do retain other protections such


as the First and the Eighth Amendment, that if we move


you, you get moved from one place to another, you still


may be able to bring a constitutional claim, and that's


what Mr. Lile's done.  He's been moved in response to a


proper indication of his Fifth Amendment rights, and he


has brought a lawsuit against the State.  He his actually


following some of the dicta in Sandin.


I don't think Sandin should be extended.  I do

think there is a potential for abuse.  Why would Sandin,


if you extend it, why would it necessarily be limited to


the Fifth Amendment?  Is it possible that a State, if it


wanted, to go around and abridge First Amendment rights


and suggest that that's --


QUESTION:  That's -- you see, I was thinking


about that, and the trouble with analogies, if you get one


that's very close, you become uncertain again.  I mean,


suppose that the actual analogy was, there is a treatment


program, and the treatment program requires the prisoner


to be isolated and not get any mail and not write any


letters to the newspapers for a couple of months, and they


say as part of this -- and it's totally legitimate, and


they say as part of this legitimate treatment program that


you can't write your letter to the newspaper, that's part


of the treatment, and moreover, we'll give you a privilege


if you do it.


And now what happens is, they grandfather one


person in.  Now I'm back in the same -- you see, I'm back


in the same dilemma.  Maybe it's not quite as bad, because


you don't have the word compelled there, but --


MR. WILTANGER:  Your Honor, I agree with the


concern over the technical distinction between benefit and


penalty, but I would say in that instance, again, keep in


mind that Mr. Lile's not just the sole person who's been

grandfathered in.  He's one of many who were grandfathered

QUESTION:  It's not the grandfather -- I mean,


it is the grandfather, isn't it, in this case that makes


him -- you said there were some other things, and I'd like


to be sure to have them in mind, that make it a penalty


and not just the withholding of a privilege.


MR. WILTANGER:  Assume for the moment Mr. Lile


were not grandfathered in.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. WILTANGER:  Assume for the moment he


arrives -- assume he committed his crime last year, and he


gets sentenced to 20 years to life tomorrow.  If he were


to enter the prison system at intake level 1, in about 18


years from now the State will ask him to take the sex


offender treatment.  That's how it's typically planned.


Mr. Lile will follow the rules that the State has set out,


will follow the regulations, will be a model prisoner, as


Mr. Lile actually has been, and he will get all the way to


level 3.


QUESTION:  I see.


MR. WILTANGER:  He will get all the way.  He


will be there, and then --

Amendment is that there is a compulsion requirement in


order to invoke the Fifth Amendment, where the First


Amendment doesn't have anything like that.


MR. WILTANGER:  I agree.  They are different. 


They are different standards.  The only point that I was


trying to raise, Your Honor, is that I think Sandin is a


little bit of a dangerous --


QUESTION:  I suppose --


QUESTION:  That's what distinguishes the


detriment and the benefit.  There's a compulsion, but then


it's a detriment.  The First -- Fifth Amendment doesn't


say it shall be unlawful to bribe a witness to get him to


testify.  The Fifth Amendment draws the line between


benefits and detriments, doesn't it?


MR. WILTANGER:  It does, and that's again -- I'm


sorry.


QUESTION:  So the Kansas program would be


perfectly okay, in your estimation, if it provided that at


the end of 18 years of 20-year sentences, or 2 years


before the end of their sentence, all sex offenders shall


be reduced, all sex offenders shall be reduced to prison


level 1.

 MR. WILTANGER:  No, Your Honor, I -- I'm --


QUESTION:  Why not, because then -- then if they


choose to come in this program they will be getting the


benefit of going back up to 3, but all of them go down to


1.


MR. WILTANGER:  I don't think that would be


constitutional, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Why not?


MR. WILTANGER:  I think it would be set up as a


way to get around SATP and a way to get around the


invocation of your Fifth Amendment rights.


QUESTION:  Well, any --


MR. WILTANGER:  It would be an artifice.


QUESTION:  Well, of course it's an artifice, but


so is the whole thing, benefit versus punishment.  I


mean --


MR. WILTANGER:  The one thing I would encourage


this Court to look at is, look at how it affects itself on


the prisoner, and again, if you're going to look at the


Colman case, which is -- again, is his choice an


unconstrained one?  Look at what is done to the inmate


here.  He's never going to get back to level 3.  The


arsonist will get back to level 3.  The arsonist will not


be moved to maximum security.  Mr.  Lile is there forever.


QUESTION:  It's the same in my hypothetical,

though.  There's no compulsion on  him.  After his 18


years in prison he's been knocked back down to 1.  There's


no compulsion on him.  He gets a benefit if he joins this


program.


MR. WILTANGER:  If it's entirely divorced from


the program or the Fifth Amendment, Your Honor, then that


potentially would be constitutional.  I would agree with


that.  But unfortunately for Mr. Lile's case, it's not how


the State has set up the structure if you get to a point,


you follow the rules, you become a model prisoner, and


then you get broken down.  That's what they're doing here.


And again the point I was trying to make earlier


is, the punishment's more severe.  The Court calls -- or,


excuse me, the State calls this punishment.  They call it


punishment.  When we're dealing with arsonists, when we're


dealing with rapists, when we're dealing with somebody who


steals something, they call that punishment, but they're


unwilling to call that punishment here.  It's an


incentive.  It's a benefit, or an extension of a


privilege, but it's not.


QUESTION:  You're saying to decide what is


compulsion you've got to look at how other people are


treated, in effect.


The -- in your answer to Justice Scalia you


said, you know, if everybody got knocked down within 2

years, no matter what the crime, there wouldn't be the


constitutional problem, but if only these people are, even


though it's written into the scheme the moment they go in,


there still would be a constitutional problem, and it's a


comparative treatment criterion among prisoners in


different classes of offenses that you're relying on,


isn't it?


MR. WILTANGER:  Somewhat, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. WILTANGER:  Somewhat, and I agree, if the


State had set up a strict --


QUESTION:  Then let me ask you to concentrate on


that question a little harder, because you did say in your


brief that if all sex offenders -- not all prisoners, all


sex offenders on day 1 were put in class 1, they could


stay there, and never get out unless the carrot that was


dangled was taken.  You did say sex offenders.  You didn't


say all prisoners.


MR. WILTANGER:  That is correct.


QUESTION:  So apparently you are not objecting


to a distinction between classes of prisoners.


MR. WILTANGER:  No, Your Honor, you're correct,


and again that's consistent with the view that we took


between the benefit and the sanction.


QUESTION:  So there isn't a comparative analysis

as between classes of prisoners depending on their


offense.


MR. WILTANGER:  No, Your Honor, there isn't.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. WILTANGER:  I apologize if I misspoke.


QUESTION:  Now, I understood you the other way. 


That is, that you agree it would be an artifice, but if


the State did not knock down all sex offenders to level 1


2 years before they get out, then you acknowledge your


client wouldn't have a case.


MR. WILTANGER:  Essentially, yes, that is


correct.  Again, that is not what we have in place here,


but that is correct.  That is correct.  The Fifth


Amendment's a bedrock principle.  This Court says it's the


mainstay of the criminal justice system, and there's no


more powerful piece of evidence than someone's confession.


They ask a lot of Mr. Lile and other sex


offenders.  They not only ask for the admission of guilt,


they ask for everything, catalogue and give me everything


you want, and despite what the State says, there really


isn't a great deal of confidentiality.  These records can


be subpoenaed.  They have to turn these records over if


someone were to make an admission about a child sexual


offense.  Further, these inmates are forced to discuss


this stuff in group therapy session.  There's no

confidentiality, and also to point out, the State has not


appealed or contested that what it seeks is incriminating


information.


This information, the Fifth Amendment itself, is


far too valuable that the State can go around and force


people to give it up and to extract penalties and


punishment for that.


Thank you for your time.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. McALLISTER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,


and may it please the Court:


I'd like to start, Justice O'Connor, by


answering a question you raised.  Can the State simply


take away all the privileges?  Absolutely not.  We


recognize at some point it becomes compulsive, that this


Court has always treated the Fifth Amendment compulsion


inquiry as contextual.  We're simply arguing that in


prison that's a very different context from being on the


outside and losing a job or losing your law license.


At some point a court could decide, if we took


away everything from Mr. Lile, that maybe that would be


compulsive, so we're not saying we can take away

everything, but what we're saying is, what we're using


here is mild in the way of incentives in a prison.  We


haven't taken away his right to spend money at the


canteen, his right to have visitors, his right to earn


money.  We've limited them, but none of that has been


taken away from him completely.  That --


QUESTION:  They're saying with the cohort of


prisoners you'll go along for 10 years, all of them


earning points and credits, and then after 10 years,


they're all up to level 3, and then because he won't go in


the program, he alone is pushed back to level 1, and


that's a big change, and he says that's taking away --


MR. McALLISTER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- something.


MR. McALLISTER:  Yes, but I mean, in our view


there's an important penalogical reason for doing that,


and it doesn't rise to the level of compulsion because


we're in the prison setting.  That's why we think Sandin


is helpful here.


QUESTION:  But why wouldn't the same penalogical


reason justify taking away all privileges?  In other


words, why did you make the concession you made at the


beginning of your rebuttal?


MR. McALLISTER:  Because, all I'm saying is at


some point even Sandin recognizes at some point things are

atypical and they exceed the line, so although he could be


moved to disciplinary segregation without a due process


hearing, if he was put in solitary confinement, that might


have been different.  There is a line at which it becomes


too much.


QUESTION:  No, but if he were put in solitary


confinement it would be justifiable, if at all, because of


a penalogical reason for the way he had behaved in prison,


creating dangerous conditions, et cetera.  Why isn't the


rehabilitation of sex offenders who, if unrehabilitated


will go out in the community and repeat their crimes, just


as important a penalogical reason, and why wouldn't it


justify taking away all privileges?


MR. McALLISTER:  Because the text of the Fifth


Amendment says no person shall be compelled, and the


question is compulsion, and at some point, if we took away


everything, or we make him work 20 hours a day or -- we


could do things to him that I think the Court would have


to say --


QUESTION:  No, but you're saying -- if I


understand your argument, you're saying, one reason why


you should not characterize this as compulsion is the


valid penalogical reason for doing it.


MR. McALLISTER:  That's part of it.


QUESTION:  And my suggestion is, if there -- if

the State should say, look, the protection of these


victims on the outside, who are going to be preyed upon by


this person if not rehabilitated, is just as important as


preventing people from setting fires in their cells, and


therefore, if we take all privileges to the fire-setters,


we've got an equally good penalogical reason to take away


all privileges from the person who won't go into the


program.


MR. McALLISTER:  And that I agree with.  We do


have potentially --


QUESTION:  Then you could take away all the


privileges.


MR. McALLISTER:  Not all the privileges, because


it has to rise to the level of compulsion, and if they are


entitled to nothing in prison --


QUESTION:  That's the question.


MR. McALLISTER:  That's the question, and --


QUESTION:  Give him some rebuttal time.


QUESTION:  Go ahead.


MR. McALLISTER:  That's all right.  I mean, that


is the question, and again, the point that was drawn out


here on the distinction between --

 MR. McALLISTER:  All right.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


The distinction here between a loss of privilege


and the granting of a benefit in the State's view is


simply a semantic game.  There really -- I mean, from the


inmate's perspective it just can't be any different, and


if the notion is what we should have done is, we should


all treat them as -- we should treat them all when they


come in as poorly as we can as long as we satisfy


constitutional minimum, treat them as poorly as we can,


and then make them earn everything, if that's all it


takes, we can go back and do that, but that certainly


doesn't benefit inmates as a class, and it's certainly not 


how prisons are run at this time in this country.  It


would be a vast shift in the way prisons are administered.


So that's really a semantic game, and the key


inquiry here is, are we compelling them, are we doing


something sufficiently substantial to these inmates to


override their will and really force them to make these


admissions, again which are in a treatment context, not to


law enforcement officials, confidentiality guidelines,


we've never prosecuted someone for anything they've said


in this program --
