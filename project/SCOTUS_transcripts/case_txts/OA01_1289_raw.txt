JUSTICE STEVENS:  We'll hear argument in Number


01-1289, State Farm Mutual v. Campbell and others.


Ms. Birnbaum, you may proceed whenever you're


ready.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHEILA L. BIRNBAUM


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and


may it please the Court:


This case arose from a single failure by State


Farm to settle a third party automobile case in the State


of Utah within the policy limits of its insured in Utah.


There was evidence in the record, uncontroverted


evidence, that this was the only case in the State of Utah 

where a policyholder of State Farm had been subject to


potentially a threat of execution on a judgment.  All of


the other judgments that were in excess of policy limits,


which there were seven of in the State of Utah over a 14-


year period, including both before and after


Mr. Campbell's case --


QUESTION:  Ms. Birnbaum, may I ask you a


question about the record?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  As I understand the other side, what

is at issue is a policy that your company had over the


years, I forget the name of it, BP and something or other,


and I looked for that policy in the record, and I couldn't


find it.  Is it in the record?  Is there a written --


MS. BIRNBAUM:  It's in the lodging, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  It's a lodging?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  It's at 1506 to 1531 in the


lodging, and if you look at the B, so-called PP&R -- it's


called the Performance Planning and Review Manual -- it is


a guide.  It is a personnel evaluation guide on how to


evaluate personnel, and it applies to all, all the


personnel of State Farm, all thousands of personnel, and


what the plaintiff did was to cherry-pick from this long


manual which is in the lodging, as I said, one or two 


points that didn't even apply to claims adjustors or 

claims representatives, but to supervisors, to try to


create this pervasive nationwide scheme that there was an


attempt by State Farm over 20 years to lessen the claims


that they were paying and not pay the fair value of


claims.


QUESTION:  Nonetheless, if the jury found such a


policy, that there was a policy as alleged by the


plaintiff, that's not -- we have to take that as a given,


don't we, Ms. Birnbaum?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  You may have to take that as a

given, Your Honor, but the question becomes, how is that


policy related in any way to this decision to try a case


in the State of Utah, and how can State Farm be punished


for its nationwide conduct, when all this case was about,


and should have been about --


QUESTION:  Do you say the evidence of conduct in


other jurisdictions should have been excluded, it was


inadmissible?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Your Honor, some evidence could


have come in under this Court's determination in BMW to


show reprehensibility, but evidence that could have come


in to show reprehensibility had to be comparable to the


conduct that was at stake here.


QUESTION:  Well, what do you say to the argument


on the other side that the instances of conduct involving 

facts having nothing to do with settlement within policy


limits, all came in, in effect as rebuttal, as admissible


rebuttal evidence in response to issues that State Farm


raised?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Your Honor, the record is replete


in our opening brief.  We cite to the many times all of


this evidence came in on direct, of the plaintiff's


experts and the plaintiff's so-called fact experts. 


That's a makeshift argument.  This didn't just come in. 


This was a 2 and month trial on -- and most of that trial

was geared to this nationwide scheme.


And more importantly, if you look at what the


Utah Supreme Court said in reinstating this incredibly


excessive verdict, 145 to 1, when you look at that, it is


very clear that the Utah Supreme Court was looking at a


national scheme.


QUESTION:  Well, yes, that may be.  I mean, I


think there's no question it was looking at a national


scheme.  The question is whether our gripe, or your gripe


is with the Utah Supreme Court or with the case as it was


tried, and I take it your answer to my question is, there


was evidence going to practices having nothing to do with


settlement within policy limits that did come in without


any relationship to rebuttal at all.


MS. BIRNBAUM: 


That's exactly right, Your Honor. 

QUESTION:  Okay.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  And it's all cited in our brief,


in our opening brief, many, many times.


QUESTION:  And why doesn't --


QUESTION:  And were objections made each time?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Your Honor, there was not,


because that wasn't necessary in the State of Utah.  If a


litigant objects in limine to the introduction of this


evidence, which was done --


QUESTION:  That was done.

 MS. BIRNBAUM:  That was many times done, and


Your Honor, when this case came down with the case of BMW


v. Gore, there was an oral argument made that that kind of


evidence was unconstitutional under Gore, because it was


dissimilar and extraterritorial.


QUESTION:  Ms. Birnbaum, why doesn't it go to


reprehensibility if it were true that this failure to


settle claims that were quite valid was simply part of a


nationwide pattern to pay out less than was due, not just


in this context but in every context?  Why doesn't that go


to reprehensibility?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Because, Your Honor, if we are --


if we permit litigants to create this overriding scheme


that you are engaged in fraud in all your business


practices, and that you can be punished for that, it is as 

if in Gore --


QUESTION:  Well, I think it does go to


reprehensibility if we're giving some kind of an ethical


report card to State Farm.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  It does not go to reprehensibility, I


would think would be your point, as to the harm suffered


by this plaintiff.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  And that seems to me the difference.

 MS. BIRNBAUM:  Absolutely.  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  You say it would go to


reprehensibility, and it would go to the harm suffered by


this plaintiff, if they introduced evidence of doing the


same thing to other plaintiffs in other States, the same


thing to other plaintiffs.  How does that go to the harm


to this plaintiff?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Well, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  You know, I don't understand how you


can possibly say you cannot introduce evidence from other


States, and at the same time say, unless it's introduced


to show reprehensibility.


Once you say you're allowed to introduce it for


reprehensibility, I don't know why all of this doesn't go


to show that State Farm is more reprehensible. 

MS. BIRNBAUM:  Your Honor, because in Gore v.


BMW this Court, the majority of this Court held that you


can introduce on the reprehensibility question similar


conduct that compares to the conduct that occurred to the


particular plaintiff in the underlying case.


QUESTION:  Of course, that's all that was


offered in Gore, of course.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  But that -- but Your Honor, it


would be like --


QUESTION:  So we didn't really have to reach

your question in that case.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Your Honor, but it would be like


in Gore saying that there was a plan to maximize profits,


and that not only could you introduce and consider the


repair issues that occurred in Gore, but you could also


show that there was discrimination against minority


customers, that there was --


QUESTION:  But the answer is that all that does


go to reprehensibility.  It does.  A person who commits


this conduct and is part of a company that engages in all


kinds of bad action is a person who is somewhat more


reprehensible than if you worked for a company that


doesn't engage in all this bad action, but I thought your


point was that that's true, but unless you draw a line


like the line that was drawn in Gore, you are inviting a 

jury to punish the company for all kinds of things that


truly do make them more reprehensible, but without


standards, without a legislature telling them how


reprehensible, et cetera.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  I couldn't have said it any


better, Your Honor.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  Well then, maybe -- maybe you can


tell me how one defines reprehensibility so that it only


includes what you call the same acts.  Maybe you can tell

me.  That's what gives me the trauma, and you say not


different acts.  What is different acts? It has to be


something --


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Well, I think --


QUESTION:  -- other than a policyholder who --


you know, who passed five, six cars on the highway?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  No.  No, you have --


QUESTION:  Why isn't cheating all policyholders


in all contexts, paying less than they're entitled to, why


isn't that similar to what happened here?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Because it had nothing to do with


what happened here, and I'd like to explain to you.  Maybe


it's a little -- but what happens in third party and first


party cases, in this particular case there was a decision


to go to trial. 


Why was that decision made to go to 

trial?  Because at least the lawyers for State Farm in


some of the claims represented felt this was a no


liability case.  Mr. and Mrs. Campbell said that they were


not liable, that they didn't cause this accident.  This


wasn't a no-brainer.  There was evidence.  The jury


decided on other evidence.


But when you bring into this equation 20 years


of conduct that, some of it that is lawful, this wasn't


only fraudulent conduct.  This jury heard and was


instructed -- not instructed, but in the summation there

was references to the payment of non-OEM, the


specification of non-OEM parts, was perfectly legal in


almost every jurisdiction.


QUESTION:  How would you formulate the standard


that you want us to adopt, the standard which confines the


reprehensibility evidence to what you deem to be


appropriate in a case such as this?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  I think --


QUESTION:  What rule do we have?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  I think, Your Honor, the proper


reprehensibility inquiry is limited to an examination of a


defendant's specific misconduct toward the plaintiff and


similar conduct by the defendant toward others, but it has


to be similar.  This was not similar conduct requiring --


QUESTION: 


And here you're not drawing a line --

one of the lines was similar conduct and in the same


State, but in the automobile, automobiles, we're a very


mobile society, so I don't think -- well, perhaps you are,


but you said this is, we draw a line around Utah, but


suppose the driver who was insured by State Farm was from


California, or from New York, where you get more than


seven incidents out of 14 years?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  But the question here was, was


there a bad faith failure to settle?  That is the conduct. 


If there was evidence of bad faith failure to settle in

other States, that could come in on reprehensibility. 


That could inform the jury in some way, and under BMW v.


Gore, you said that that kind of conduct, similar conduct


in BMW was identical conduct.


QUESTION:  Well then, then you have no concern


with punishing for acts that took place out of State?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  No, I --


QUESTION:  You're abandoning that, or --


MS. BIRNBAUM:  We have not gotten to the ratio


of the comparable penalties questions under BMW.  We were


just focusing on reprehensibility.


QUESTION:  What is similar conduct in BMW, to


give some feel for what you mean by similar conduct?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Exactly what the Court --


QUESTION: 


Selling cars with scratches on them, 

or is it selling -- what about, you sell cars with


defective, knowingly, with defective clutches?  Would that


be similar?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  No, it would not.


QUESTION:  It would -- it has to be cars with


scratches, it has to be the same thing?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  It's the conduct --


QUESTION:  Wow.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  It was the conduct that occurred


in that case.  In that case there was a failure to tell

consumers --


QUESTION:  The car had a scratch.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  -- that the car had a --


QUESTION:  So the only cases that are relevant


are other cases where BMW pawned off cars that had


scratches?  It could pawn off all sorts of other defects,


but not scratches?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  If you open it up to all kinds of


other defects, then you're opening it up --


QUESTION:  You lose, right.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  You're opening it up --


(Laughter.)


MS. BIRNBAUM:  -- to the kind of thing that can


happen here, especially if it gets punished.  In this case


there was a million dollars' worth of compensatory 

damages, a substantial number, and this verdict was 145


times that.  That could only be considered because it was


punishing all of this extraterritorial, dissimilar, and in


many instances, lawful conduct.


QUESTION:  I thought we had just gotten off the


extraterritorial -- where you said it wouldn't make any


difference if the insured was from California or from


Utah.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  That's exactly right, Your Honor.


The really important thing here is that the Utah

Supreme Court --


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  I don't understand where


we are on the out of State.  You say you're going to get


to that under another --


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- prong?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Under ratio and comparable


penalties, Your Honor.  Because this Court has said that


you could introduce extraterritorial conduct, similar, 


past conduct with regard to reprehensibility, but there


are three guideposts in Gore, and the Utah Supreme Court


ignored the other two guideposts.  Of course, when it came


to the ratio guidepost, this Court has repeatedly said


there has to be a reasonable relationship, reasonable


ratio between the penalty, the punishment, and the harm to 

the plaintiff: not the harm to others, not the harm to the


community at large, not the harm to all of the consumers


that dealt with State Farm, as the Utah Supreme Court held


and found, and --


QUESTION:  So how do we measure that?  How do we


measure the ratio, the reasonable relationship of the


penalty?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Here, Your Honor, there was a


compensatory damage award of a million dollars.  That was


a substantial compensatory award.  The ratio that would be

reasonable with regard to a million dollars could not be


145 to 1.


QUESTION:  Except that, you know, we say that


you can't take into account harm to others, but you can


take into account harm to others so long as that is done


under the rubric of reprehensibility.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  As long --


QUESTION:  If you've done the same thing to


other people, you can be punished more.  Now, you may find


a significant difference between punishing you for what


you did to the other people, and punishing you more for


what you did to this person, because it is rendered more


reprehensible because of what you did to other people, but


I don't see a whole lot of difference between the two.


MS. BIRNBAUM: 


But even if there is a ratio, 

what reprehensibility does is put you on the continuum of


blameworthiness, and this Court has said previously that 4


to 1 is close to the line.  In TXO it permitted 10 to 1


because economic damages was small, and you looked at


potential harm as well as the realized harm to the


litigant there.


Here, he had substantial compensatory damages. 


In addition, if you look at the third guidepost in Gore,


you have comparable penalties and sanctions for comparable


conduct.  That's how that is defined.

 What was the conduct here?  It was a failure to


settle within policy limits.  It wasn't intentional tort;


it was --


QUESTION:  May I just suggest an analogy?  This,


in a way this reminds me of the argument we heard last


week -- maybe it was last session -- about the three


strikes law in California; that you're not necessarily


punished for the other things you did, but you can take


into account your prior crimes even in other States in


order to justify a more severe penalty for what you've


done here.  And isn't it -- part of the argument the other


side makes is that this is a very large company, and the


board of directors doesn't hear about a $100-million


punitive damage award down in Texas, and therefore you've


got to at least give them enough money so the board of 

directors will know they ought to take corrective steps.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Could I just first answer this


$100 million punitive damage award, because I think that


really shows where the Utah Supreme Court is going.  There


was no judgment.  This had nothing to do with bad faith


failure to settle.  It had to do with an uninsured


motorist coverage.  The case was settled for pennies on


the dollar.  There was no --


QUESTION:  99 cents?

 MS. BIRNBAUM:  Pennies.  Pennies.  Unfortunately


I couldn't put into evidence the amount because there as a


confidentiality agreement, but that case had nothing to do


with the kind of conduct here.  You cannot --


QUESTION:  No, but I suppose to the extent it's


relevant it is, that you need an awfully big award against


an awfully big company, because you want the company


itself to take corrective steps, and if this $100 million


award isn't even called to the attention of the board of


directors, maybe that says you needed a larger award than 


would otherwise be justified.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Your Honor, I think if you look


at this, this was a jury award that was never made into a


judgment.  Why would anybody -- it was settled.  It was a


runaway verdict in a place. 


Why would anybody go to the 

board of directors with something like that?


QUESTION:  Okay, let's assume the $100 million


had never happened.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Okay.


QUESTION:  The argument as made is, this is a


company with a surplus in, literally measured in the


billions.  You've got to have a really big judgment to get


their attention.  What's your response?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  The answer to that is, first of


all, surplus was the wrong number to ever focus on.  That

money is accounted for, and there are some very good


briefs, amicus briefs that talk about surplus.


There was never a profit from underwriting in


this particular instance, and the fact that the company


has surpluses, that's to pay out claims.


QUESTION:  That's just saying how rich they are. 


I mean, the question -- whether they're rich or not, they


seem quite rich, but maybe they're not, but the harm here


was what?  That is he had a $50,000 policy.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And he for a period of time the


client thought that he'd have to pay $136,000 out of his


own pocket, for how long a period of time?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  There is a question in the


record. 


The trial court said that it was for a short 

period of time.  The Utah Supreme Court said it was for 18


months.


QUESTION:  All right, so for 18 months he's


frightened that he'll have to pay $136,000 out of his own


pocket, all right.  Now, because of that fright, he was


given a million dollars in compensation and another $145


million -- I don't know, how much went to him?  How much


went to the lawyers?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Well, Your Honor, there would be


40 percent that would go to the lawyers --

QUESTION:  $56 million goes to the lawyers.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Right.


QUESTION:  And how much went to him?  How much


went to him?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  10 percent of the award was --


QUESTION:  All right, so $14 million went to


him, and where did the rest go?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  It went to the two other


plaintiffs in the original case.


QUESTION:  Okay.  Now, that's all necessary for


the follow -- or at least not necessary, reasonable for


the following reason.  This is a very big company, and


unless you really make them pay they might do this again, 

or if not this, something equally bad, okay?


Now, what's your response?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  The response to that, Your Honor,


is there's nothing in this record -- first of all, that


kind of ratio is totally unreasonable and out of


proportion to the harm to the plaintiff.


QUESTION:  That's not my question.  My question


is, there is a claim.  Even if it's out of proportion to


the harm, we've got to wake these people up at State Farm. 


Now, they get wakened up by this 145 million judgment,

believe me, and --

that.


QUESTION:  All right.  Now -- all right.  Now,


what's your response to that, that's a very desirable and


necessary thing, or they might do it again?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  It's not a necessary thing on


this record, it is not a desirable thing.  There was no --


QUESTION:  Because?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  There was no evidence in this


record that there was any other case in which there had


been a failure to settle within policy limits that


jeopardized an insuree --


QUESTION:  All right, suppose there had been 10


cases in which 10 other people were frightened of having 

to pay $136,000 for a period of 18 months.  Then, in your


opinion, would it have been justified to enter this


judgment of $145 million to wake them up?  Indeed, at 4


month intervals they kept doing this over and over.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Your Honor, if that happened,


then each one of those plaintiffs could have a bad faith


failure to settle claim in which they could have gotten


punitive damages in their own States. There is no -- this


whole concept that this is a clandestine scheme, every --

suffice.  Maybe we have to send them to jail.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Well, that's what --


(Laughter.)


MS. BIRNBAUM:  That's what the Supreme Court of


Utah said, even though it's not in their statute.  Can you


imagine, on fair notice, when we talked about fair notice,


that you could go to jail for a failure to settle one case


in the State of Utah?


QUESTION:  Did this jury --


QUESTION:  It didn't have authority to send them


to jail though, did it?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  No, they didn't.


QUESTION:  You know, but you're making -- I


think you're making two arguments.  First, you're making


the argument that you started with, and that is, evidence 

was improperly admitted, acts in other States were


improperly considered, acts unlike failure to settle were


improperly considered.


Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that you


lose -- I mean, if you win on that, I presume we're not


going to get to the point you're arguing now.  Let's


assume you lose on that.  You get to the point that you're


arguing now and you say, okay, 4 times the amount of


actual damage would be okay, 145 is not.  What do we put


in an opinion to indicate what is the proper point in

between 4 and 145?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  I think you've already put that


in your opinions in this Court already, and that is that


there has to be a relationship between the amount of the


punitive damages and the compensatory harm to the


plaintiff.


QUESTION:  Yes, I know that, and the question


is, is 4 times the relationship appropriate, and 145 is


not?  And how about 80, and 60, and 20?  How do we grapple


with that?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Well, I think you grapple with


that only by looking at the three guideposts that you've


already put forth, and it could be 4, it could be 5, and


some courts have even held 10, but most of the courts that


have followed your jurisprudence have held that 3, or 4, 

or 5 is close to the line.


QUESTION:  Is the point of your argument


ultimately -- you're not saying this, but I mean, if we


accept the way you're going, are we really going down the


road to saying, look, at some point we've got to leave


this in a less protean state, and we've got to pick a


number, and is that our business to do?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Now, we're not asking you to put


a bright line.  It would be helpful, but I don't think


this Court is prepared to do that.

 QUESTION:  Well, would the bright line be


helpful if we said, up to -- pick a number -- 10 times


will be usually accepted unless that is not adequate


enough to compensate the plaintiff for the wrong that was


done to him?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  That would be an excellent way of


drawing the line, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  You get this out of what provision of


our Bill of Rights?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Your Honor, we get it out of due


process, the two bedrock provisions called due process and


federalism.  Federalism, comity, States' rights.


QUESTION:  But as far as --


QUESTION:  It's not specific, is it?  10 times


is what it says.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  No, we're not suggesting that.  I


thought it was a good idea, however.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  Ms. Birnbaum, I'd like you to clarify


your position on what has been called


extraterritoriality --


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  -- because I thought today that you


were very forthright with the Court.  You said no, you're


not going to make a distinction whether the plaintiff

comes from California or New York rather than Utah.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Right.


QUESTION:  So you can't just draw a line around


the State of Utah and say, that's the relevant State.  But


you tell us a supplemental brief was calling attention to


a case where there was a specific request to make that


kind of charge.  You made no such, State Farm made no such


request in this case, as far as I can tell.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Yes, they did, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Yes?  Where?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Well, it might not have been


totally the same that --


QUESTION:  Which one?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  It's in the lodging at 394.  It


was instruction number 46.


QUESTION:  Yes, and instruction number 46, which


I looked for, was the closest thing.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  That's right --


QUESTION:  That talks about both compensatory


and punitive damages, that you should base it on State


Farm's conduct in handling of the case against Curtis


Campbell.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Right.


QUESTION:  Only.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Right.

 QUESTION:  Now, that's not even saying other


people within Utah.  So that's -- and it's alike for


compensatory and punitive.  That is nothing like the


charge that said, look in the State of Nevada.  But I just


wanted to make sure that you are saying, you don't look


only to Utah, because this particular plaintiff happened


to come to Utah.  It would be the same thing if the


plaintiff came from California.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Absolutely, Your Honor.


Let me just mention one other part of the


guideposts which I think are very relevant here, and that


is comparable penalties for comparable misconduct, and


here it is uncontroverted that the penalty that the Utah


courts or the Utah system could have placed on State Farm


for an act, for a single act of bad faith failure to 

settle, which was at stake here, was $10,000.


Yet when the Utah Supreme Court examined that


guidepost from the Court, it looked at the scheme.  It


looked at all of the nationwide conduct to determine that


1) you could be -- you would have to disgorge all your


profits or you could be imprisoned, which was not correct


anyhow under the Utah statute.


But if you restate the guideposts that you have


already come down with, and you make it clear that we're


talking about conduct that was permitted to the


25

plaintiffs, that we're talking about reasonable ratios


that had to do with the plaintiff's wrong, not harm to


others, not harm to all of those in Utah -- in fact, if


you look at the bad faith failure to settle issue, there


was no one in the State of Utah that was harmed by that


kind of conduct.  There was nobody that was even subject,


Justice Breyer, for a short time with execution, and


that -- and there was no reason, there was no reason to


deter that kind of conduct because there was no conduct in


the future, after the Campbell case, that that even came


close to.


So I think that if you focus on those factors,


those guideposts that you elucidated to in Gore, and make


them stronger, that would be sufficient for the lower


courts to do their job in doing a meaningful -- meaningful 

appellate review, not the kind of review here that was


based on questionable conclusions and improper predicates.


Thank you.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Birnbaum.


Mr. Tribe, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. TRIBE:  Justice Stevens, and may it please


the Court:


I think I might begin by saying that I barely

recognize the case that, though I didn't try, I read the


transcript in, from hearing Ms. Birnbaum's description. 


She says that the conduct involved in this case was simply


the failure to settle.  It wasn't, she says, even an


intentional tort.  Well, the Court's --


QUESTION:  Well, that was the sole ground of


liability, was it not?


MR. TRIBE:  The sole ground of original


liability was objectively unreasonable failure to settle,


but phase 2, which was held at the insistence of


plaintiffs, who wanted -- of the defendants who wanted to


bifurcate, phase 2 focused on the question of whether


there was an intentional tort, and there was found to be


fraud; and the court, the trial court affirmed the


judgment partly on the ground of intentional fraud; and 

the fraud, and it's not a surprise really to the lawyers


for the defendants, because they made it clear in their


opening statement that they understood the whole theory of


this case to be that the insurance policies that were


being sold by State Farm, which led people to think that


in first and in third party cases the claims adjuster


would try to do a reasonably objective job of satisfying


the claim if possible, in fact weren't bad at all.


There was a clandestine cap that was imposed by


this innocuous-looking bureaucratic PP&R program that was

thoroughly documented and that was imposed from


headquarters, documented elaborately by hundreds of


examples; and it's true, some of them came from other


States, and I will get to that; but they were all just


illustrative, because it came from headquarters in


Bloomington, and it was a directive --


QUESTION:  I take it the policy is, pay as


little as possible, even if fraud is necessary?


MR. TRIBE:  And, in fact, it was necessary here. 


That is, they made up things.  They doctored the file.


QUESTION:  All right, I see that, but what's --


MR. TRIBE:  They made up the fact that -- they


defamed this dead person and said that he was speeding to


meet a pregnant girlfriend, who didn't exist.  There were


findings that they systematically shredded, and destroyed, 

and fabricated documents for two decades in order to cover


up the fact that they were not selling what they were


pretending to sell.


And it was found in this case clearly, and then


again de novo by the Utah Supreme Court, that this policy,


which was clandestine and then covered up, was a policy


that had persisted for two decades, which they even now


seem unwilling to acknowledge.


QUESTION:  Can I interrupt with a question?


MR. TRIBE:  Sure.

 QUESTION:  I'm sure you're going to get to it,


but one can infer -- maybe it's not entirely clear -- that


all of this was established, and there are very, very


many, many bad, bad deeds done in all parts of the United


States, but that the $145 million is in large part


punishment for what was done outside of Utah.


MR. TRIBE:  Oh, I don't think so, Justice


Stevens.  I do plan to get to that.


QUESTION:  The second point that relates to that


is that when the Supreme Court of Utah made the comparison


to what the criminal penalty might have been, they had to


be referring to more than what could have been imposed in


Utah. 


MR. TRIBE:  No, Justice Stevens, what they said


was this. 


They referred among other things to the Utah 

Unfair Claims Practices Act, which said $10,000 fine per


violation; and there were in their view thousands of


individual instances of wrongfully denied benefits.


QUESTION:  In Utah?


MR. TRIBE:  In Utah, yes, because they didn't


draw this fancy distinction between first and third party


claims that is being drawn for the convenience of State


Farm.  The wrong is not --


QUESTION:  That's the basis of the underlying


tort, which was the failure -- which was the excess.

 MR. TRIBE:  That was the example --


QUESTION:  Which was the excess.


MR. TRIBE:  -- Justice Kennedy.  That was the


tip of the iceberg.


Justice Kennedy, this is very important.  In


this particular case, it was the failure to settle a case,


and it was a fraudulent failure to settle a case, not just


a random accident, but it was pursuant to exactly the same


policy, capping the average amount that a given claims


agents puts out in terms of State Farm money, that is used


in these other instances.  It was exactly the same policy.


In this case, it was because this fellow named


Bill Brown wanted to move to Colorado, and because he did,


and because he was close to his quota, and this is all in


the record, and it is found -- and it's not disputed any 

longer.  Because he wanted to move to Colorado, he puts


pressure on somebody underneath him to make sure that that


year's numbers look better.


QUESTION:  Of course, companies would have a


policy of trying to make as much money as possible.


MR. TRIBE:  It's not just making as much


money --


QUESTION:  Well, some companies could add --


MR. TRIBE:  -- it's stealing.


QUESTION:  -- could add to that, by the way, one

way we make money is, we pay out as little as possible and


we charge as much as possible.  I remember an airline that


had the policy, charge the customer the highest price he


will pay for the service that he wants, all right?


MR. TRIBE:  But Justice Breyer --


QUESTION:  There could be such a policy.


MR. TRIBE:  Right --


QUESTION:  Now --


MR. TRIBE:  -- and if the policy is sell him a


ticket and then turn him away at the door --


QUESTION:  Oh, no, no, but by the way --


MR. TRIBE:  -- pretending to sell him a place --


QUESTION:  -- it might be that such a policy


would even condone doing a lot of bad things to do that,


and what's worrying me about permitting that kind of 

policy to serve as a justification for a $145-million


judgment is precisely what I wrote in my concurrence in


the BMW case, that the Constitution, indeed the Magna


Carta says that you should not take life, liberty, or


property without law; and to take 12 people, call them a


jury, selected at random, and tell them that they are free


to go through the business practices of a company --


MR. TRIBE:  Justice Breyer --


QUESTION:  -- to unite them under the name of a


policy and then assess $145 million for every bad thing

that this jury thinks --


MR. TRIBE:  Justice Breyer, please -- I believe


in the Magna Carta as much as you do.  It was not


arbitrary.  There were criteria.  The criteria were


pursuant to an instruction proposed by State Farm, and in


this case it was not every bad thing.  All of the


specifics, including these seemingly trivial things like


appearance allowances, were all introduced in particular


cases to show how they were being used by someone who was


up against his monthly quota, and because he was up


against the monthly quota -- you read the testimony of


Gary Fye at page 1375 and 1387 of the joint appendix. 


Because they were up against the monthly quota, the people


at the receiving end who thought they had a claims agent


who was, as they call him, a good neighbor, in fact had 

someone who was selling them a place in the airline, and


it wasn't there, deliberately.


QUESTION:  Nothing you have said, Mr. Tribe,


Professor, persuades me that the jury didn't punish this


company for being a bad company quite without reference --


MR. TRIBE:  Because of the --


QUESTION:  -- to the harm this plaintiff


suffered.


MR. TRIBE:  Well, first of all, as to the harm


suffered, proposed instruction 40 by State Farm would have

told the jury, I think consistent with this Court's


jurisprudence and with the history of punitive damages,


that they could consider the effect of State Farm's


behavior, quote, "on the lives of plaintiffs and of other


policyholders," and it's because, Justice Breyer, of what


you said in BMW that a lot of other people who are harmed


by these practices are not likely to be able to sue.  That


is, they're not going to make it.


Mr. Fye testified at 30 and 44, for everyone


like Campbell, who will take on a company this size and


with the resources of State Farm, there are hundreds, if


not thousands, who will simply go away, because State


Farm --


QUESTION:  Mr. Tribe, maybe fewer, maybe fewer


now after a verdict of that size, and isn't that one of 

the problems? 


MR. TRIBE:  Well, that's the hope.  That --


QUESTION:  Isn't that -- now there's an


incentive for lawyers to pursue such claims.  Before they


might have thought them too small to be worthwhile.


MR. TRIBE:  One of the advantages -- there may


be down sides, but if we prevail, Justice Ginsburg, we're


prevailing on a theory that the practice we've identified,


which is quite specific, for 20 years of putting these


invisible caps that cheat the insured in all kinds of

cases throughout the State of Utah, there will no longer


be anyone who can recover for those harms, beyond


compensatory damages, because the penalty will have been


extracted.


QUESTION:  The question that's bothering me --


QUESTION:  Is that true in New York or Vermont? 


I mean, you said in Utah there would be no one who can get


another $145 million --


MR. TRIBE:  I think if they've done this in


every State, then they should be exposed to the


possibility of punitive damages in other States.


QUESTION:  So you could multiple that by 50.


MR. TRIBE:  Well, you know, it seems to me, if


you look at the opinion that was delivered from the bench


by the district court after 2 months, in his own words --

they accuse us of writing his opinion.


In his own words, what he said was that absent a


punitive award, the problem of recurrence of their


misconduct is extremely high, the probability of


recurrence; because he saw the evidence that they never


stopped; and he said that even the $25-million award that


he felt constrained by State law, mistakenly, to give, he


thought would not suffice because -- and I'm now reading


from his December 19 opinion -- because the $25 million


may not be enough to offset the profit that they're likely

to have earned.


That is, every time they cheat the insured by --


QUESTION:  Mr. Tribe, you've told me that this


is all based on what happened in Utah.  I haven't read


this massive record, and you tell me you have.  In the


second phase of the punitive damages trial, not the first


one --


MR. TRIBE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- when they did get into out of


State evidence, what proportion, in your judgment, of that


evidence related to Utah, and what proportion related to


other States?


MR. TRIBE:  I think the overwhelming majority


related to Utah, and every time it came in dealing with


another State, contrary to what we heard, it was because 

the door had been opened, and it was specifically found by


the trial court that they waived any objection to the


testimony in question, despite what we heard about --


QUESTION:  But you're telling me that over half


of the evidence related to Utah itself?


MR. TRIBE:  Yes, but let me tell you, Justice


Stevens, it was so uniform that the particular examples


were picked because they so nicely illustrated the way a


particular device like the use of non-OPM parts would


interact with the cap that was imposed.  It was nothing

about --


QUESTION:  Are they correct in telling us that


this -- there's only one example of a failure to settle --


MR. TRIBE:  We have no way of knowing, Justice


Stevens, because they have erected -- the record also


shows that since the 1970s, part of their policy of


destroying records has included --


QUESTION:  Yes, but there must have been a lot


of records --


MR. TRIBE:  -- getting rid of all those records.


QUESTION:  But they didn't destroy all the


evidence to have a trial go on this long.


MR. TRIBE:  Well, it's because -- part of what


was said by the trial court was that it took the


persistence of a David to bring this particular Goliath to 

his knees.  Much of the evidence certainly wasn't produced


through discovery.  The key evidence, including the May


1979 PP&R report, was obtained indirectly through other


cases, not with any cooperation on the part of State Farm. 


State Farm kept saying, we don't have a PP&R policy.  Oh,


and then we got rid of it in 1992; and we got rid of it


again in 1994; and yes, there's a PP&R policy, but it


doesn't actually set the cap on any particular claim.


Well, that's a nicely and artfully put point. 


It doesn't.  What it does is, it imposes a ceiling which

averages things out and forces whoever is unlucky enough


to come in when somebody is about to hit his ceiling to


get cheated.  It seems to me that we -- it's true that it


all began by looking at this, as it happened, failure to


settle.  That's a happenstance.  It could have begun in


some other way.


Because it happened to a couple that was rather


vulnerable, and yet tenacious: this fellow had had one


wife who had been murdered in his home, another wife who


had died of cancer.  He himself had Parkinson's disease. 


They were part of the weakest of the herd, as


State Farm's policies put it, that they're picked on,


because they're less likely to fight back. But it happened


that these people did fight back, and it seems to me it's


not a matter of rewarding them. 


They get a relatively 

small piece of this.  The family of the dead young man


gets part of it.  The State may get part of it.  The key


point is that it is a critical disincentive, and Justice


Kennedy, any notion --


QUESTION:  Well, some people get part of it that


weren't hurt at all.


MR. TRIBE:  Some lawyers will certainly get part


of it.  I don't --


QUESTION:  I wasn't referring to the lawyers.

QUESTION:  I was referring to them, and my


problem is that in fact what you have is a system where if


you take, let's call it the most evil corporation in the


world, and I'm sure there are some such, and they commit a


very minor tort in respect to someone, pursuant to their


policy of being evil --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION: 


-- and it seems to me that there are 

criminal laws, there are regulatory authorities, there are


statutes --


MR. TRIBE:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- there is common law, there are


many, many sources of law; and it's disturbing in terms of


the picture of the law to have 12 people picked at random


to assess an enormous fine without standards other than,


"this defendant is evil," and I'm assuming he is evil.


MR. TRIBE:  Justice Breyer, first, it's not fair


to say that was the only standard.

 QUESTION:  Oh, no, I'm trying --


MR. TRIBE:  Second -- second --


QUESTION:  -- to get you to say what the


standard was, if it is not that.


MR. TRIBE:  I thought this Court did a rather


good job in BMW.  Reprehensibility could hardly be higher


when one has a repeat offender who even now


mischaracterizes its intentional tort, when one has a


repeat offender that obstructs justice --


QUESTION:  But again, you're defining


reprehensibility quite without regard to the specific


injury imposed on the plaintiff.


MR. TRIBE:  Well --


QUESTION:  You're defining -- you're giving a


report card to the entire company.


MR. TRIBE:  No, but Justice Kennedy, in TXO this


Court talked about the ratio not just of the harm that


actually befell the particular plaintiff, but of the


punitive damages to the harm that might have befallen that


plaintiff if the tortious plan had been carried to


completion. 


Here, if it had been carried to completion the


home would have been taken, because a deal would not have


been struck in December of '84 -- of '84, and also in TXO,


and in other cases, you've spoken of the harm to the

larger community.  You've also spoken of the importance of


extracting the profit from tortious behavior.


QUESTION:  I think -- Justice Breyer touched on


this.  Part of the harm to the larger community here is


the image that this does to the judicial system when


corporations, businesses, people of substance want to use


the courts and they're deterred from doing it by the


threat of runaway punitive damages, and that is not good


for the legal system.


MR. TRIBE:  Justice Kennedy, I certainly agree


in principle; but to pick a case in which a corporation


has defied the legal system, has shredded documents, has


covered up its deliberate wrongdoing, has not even


bothered to pay attention to a $100 million award -- yes,


of course it wasn't reduced to a judgment, but the 

evidence in this case is that that's not relevant.  What


was critical is that they had built a wall of deniability


so that no one in a decisionmaking capacity is informed of


punitive judgments.


Mr. Muskowski testified in this case that he


would not let anyone know, in a position of authority,


even of the punitive judgment in this case; and in their


reply brief they say, well, Mr. Mendoza had decisionmaking


authority, but if you look at the relevant pages in the


joint appendix, you'll see that that's not true.  In the

colloquy it's clear that he did not.


What that means is that a company can surround


itself with an impregnable wall and in effect spit at the


legal system.  How good is that for its image?


Now, it may be that an ideal legal system might


not use juries for this purpose, but is it the mission of


this Court to redesign the legal systems of the 50 States? 


15 States have signed an amicus brief here saying it's


important to them to be able to use punitive damages when


the regulatory and criminal justice systems haven't quite


caught up with whatever latest axis of evil is afoot in


the corporate world. 


Is it really helpful to any of us to have a


corporation be able to defraud all of the people who rely


on it, who depend on it, and get away with paying simply 

what harm they happened to cause in the one case when they


get caught?


It seems to me especially bizarre, especially


bizarre for State Farm to speak here proudly of the fact


that this is the worst case in history.


QUESTION:  Can I ask one other question just


about the proceedings here?


MR. TRIBE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  The record is so large I didn't have


the whole thing completely in mind.  After the trial judge

reduced the jury's award of $145 million to -- what was


it, $20 million?


MR. TRIBE:  25.


QUESTION:  -- $25 million, State Farm still


MR. TRIBE:  There was a cross-appeal by State


appealed.


Farm.


QUESTION:  Well, did both sides appeal that?


MR. TRIBE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  I see.  It wasn't clear to me.


MR. TRIBE:  That's right.  State Farm appealed


because it thought there should be no punitives.  It seems


even now they think it did nothing wrong.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. TRIBE: 


And there was a cross-appeal by the 

Campbells on the grounds that they thought it was a


mistake of State law to have reduced the punitives.


QUESTION:  I was thinking it would have been


quite a shock if State Farm had been the only appellant


here and that was the result of that appeal.


MR. TRIBE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  It's sort of dramatic, yes.


MR. TRIBE:  Yes, well --


QUESTION:  Both sides appealed.


MR. TRIBE:  Yes, that's correct.

 QUESTION:  And isn't there a certain irony in


that it was chopped down to $25 million, and then the Utah


Supreme Court, using this Court's case law, saying we


don't give the ordinary deference that we would give to


that judgment of the trial court, because the Supreme


Court had told us we must engage in de novo review, and


engaging in de novo review, we don't chop it down, we put


it back to where it was originally.


MR. TRIBE:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think in a


sense that looks ironic.  It looks as though Cooper v.


Leatherman came back in a boomerang, but I think really


the way I read the opinion of the Utah Supreme Court, they


applied Cooper in an even more vigorous way in general. 


That is, they didn't just engage in de novo review of the


question of excessiveness. 


They engaged in de novo review 

of all the facts, so you have not just a jury, but a jury


and a trial court and a full appellate court.


The only fact on which they said they weren't


going to defer was a technical issue about the wealth of


State Farm, and the real reason they actually gave for


increasing the 25 to 145 was their conviction that the


trial court believed that 25 would not stop State Farm


from persisting in its practices, and that it was only


their own earlier suggestion that the ratio should matter


a great deal that had misled the trial court.

 QUESTION:  What do you think the ratio should --


I mean, we did say something in BMW about ratio between


compensatory damages and punitives.  What do you think the


ratio should be?  No limit, 10 to, 145 -- whatever it


takes to stop them?  I mean, what if nothing will stop


them but sending them to jail?


MR. TRIBE:  Well, in this case, sending them to


jail was an option that the Supreme Court of Utah


mentioned, and that State Farm doesn't seem to take very


seriously.  They think the State Supreme Court of Utah


doesn't understand its own law.  There are provisions of


Utah law that make deliberate fraud of the sort they


committed an imprisonable offense, and maybe that's an


option, but that suggests --


QUESTION: 


You mean, you could right in this 

case put people in prison for --


MR. TRIBE:  Well, I haven't -- I have no contact


with the Attorney General of Utah, but they --


QUESTION:  No, no, I mean, you'd have to bring


another trial, wouldn't you?


MR. TRIBE:  Well, of course you -- yes.  Yes,


but the comparability standard asks, how serious an


offense is this, and I submit it's extremely serious.


But to your question, Justice Scalia, on ratio,


I think that instead of trying to come up with a number --

because I think suggesting any number would be so


arbitrary that it would do more damage to this Court than


good to the legal system.  It's not like 6 months for the


idea of a serious crime.  I mean, it would just be a


number plucked from the air, and it would backfire,


because as the law and economics people are fond of


pointing out, any number you pick will then lead people to


sort of modify their behavior accordingly, and just


internalize the costs on a kind of bad man theory, and


what you really are trying to do is stop the behavior. 


We're not talking about negligence here.  We're


talking about something of which the optimal level is


zero.  The optimal level of deliberate fraud and deception


covered up in this way is zero.


The relevance of the ratio, I think, is simply 

as one thing to look at.  If the ratio looks very high,


you ask why is it so high?  In this case, the answer comes


back, it's so high because the ratio of the number of


people they hurt to the number who are going to be


motivated to sue and able to sue is very low.  I mean, is


very -- you know, a number -- a huge number will be hurt. 


A very small number are going to be able to make it


through that filter.


QUESTION:  Well, with verdicts like this, we


might see an increase, don't you think?

 MR. TRIBE:  Well, I suppose.  I suppose, but


there are ways of getting rid of frivolous lawsuits.


The point also is, it's hard -- if you see an


increase, Justice O'Connor, and if it is an increase that


gets anywhere, it might be because they stopped destroying


the evidence, because they stopped fabricating -- they've


so doctored the files, like the file in this case, to make


it look in any given case as though the report that they


give corresponds to the history of the case, and it's


awfully hard to sue successfully when the file has been


massaged and doctored.


The result in a case like this is of course it


looks like a very large award, but --


QUESTION:  What if there were in Utah a second


Campbell, a second excess carrier, and the case was tried 

6 months later.  Would they get the same punitive damages?


MR. TRIBE:  No.  If it was for any activity that


occurred during the period from May 1979 to the time of


this trial --


QUESTION:  Both hypothetical plaintiffs are


injured around the time Campbell is, and they both bring


the same kind of suit and they have the same evidence;


they each get the 145?


MR. TRIBE:  No.  I think that it's a penalty


that is like -- there ought to be some double jeopardy

like doctrine that if they can show that they've already


been punished for this course of conduct, they ought not


to have to pay the penalty a second time.


Now, the Double Jeopardy Clause --


QUESTION:  Mr. Tribe, I thought you answered --


QUESTION:  What's the authority for that


proposition?


MR. TRIBE:  I would -- I just made it up.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  Professor Tribe.


MR. TRIBE:  I just made it up.  I said there


ought to be such a doctrine.


QUESTION:  Mr. Tribe, you're talking about a


second Utah plaintiff.  I thought you answered --


MR. TRIBE:  Yes, a second --


QUESTION:  Several questions ago you said this


could be multiplied at least 50 times.  That is, one big


winner in each State.


MR. TRIBE:  Well, if they commit 50 big


offenses, it's part of our jurisprudence of 50 States that


they might be subject to 50 penalties.  That --


QUESTION:  Your argument is that this is all


Utah damages, so there are --


MR. TRIBE:  That's right.  That's --


QUESTION:  -- 49 other claims out there that

must be at least as valuable.


MR. TRIBE:  Well, that's right.


QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And even in Utah, I thought our case


says you're punishing them for the harm done to this


plaintiff.


MR. TRIBE:  Ultimately, you are.


QUESTION:  If you can take reprehensibility into


account, but it's for the harm done to -- well, what about


the harm done to all the other plaintiffs in Utah?


MR. TRIBE:  Justice Scalia, there's no pretense


that this is compensatory damages.  The compensatory


damage compensates them for the harm done to them.


QUESTION:  Then you shouldn't have said that.


MR. TRIBE: 


Then the reprehensibility of what 

was done to them is affected by, as this Court has said,


whether it was an isolated event, as they claimed, or


whether it was done as part of a schematic, systematic


form of predation.


Now, it was of that sort.  That was shown.  The


fact that it was predation that was launched from


Bloomington and therefore spread throughout the country is


State Farm's problem.  It shouldn't be the problem of the


plaintiff who collects punitive damages in a given case.


QUESTION:  Mr. Tribe, I can't remember -- I

assume it's in the briefs, I just don't remember, what was


the instruction to the jury on any limits on their


consideration of the out-of-State evidence?  Was the jury


told, look, you can only punish them for what they did


here, this only goes to intent, or something like that?


MR. TRIBE:  There was no request here, as there


was, for example, in the recent Ninth Circuit case against


Ford, no request whatsoever by State Farm for such an


instruction.


What they did request, and were not entitled to,


was that under BMW they preserved an objection that the


out-of-State evidence be completely disregarded, even


though it came in in response to the doors that they had


opened, but they did not --


QUESTION: 


But the objection never eventuated in 

a request for an instruction --


MR. TRIBE:  Not at all.


QUESTION:  -- or in instruction addressing


specifically that point?


MR. TRIBE:  No, and they were fully aware -- I


mean, the day after BMW came down, there was a bench


conference.  There was an extended colloquy.  It was


fully --


QUESTION:  But wasn't that after the trial?  I

 MR. TRIBE:  No.  The -- May 21, 1996 was before


the full-blown 2-month period of the phase 2 trial.


QUESTION:  I see.


MR. TRIBE:  And it was known very clearly the


day after BMW that a good bit of the evidence in this


case, because many of the examples of how this policy


worked, would come from other places, would not be Utah-


based.  The $100-million verdict which would illustrate


the wall they built would come from Texas.


They never once asked for an instruction


limiting matters to Utah, and I don't fault them for it. 


It would have been rather bizarre to do so, because they


knew full well that we were not asking the Utah jury or


the Utah courts to punish them for what they did


elsewhere.


We were simply using what was done elsewhere


first to rebut their commissioners -- they brought in


commissioners from various States to testify that State


Farm never did anything wrong.  The trial court said, now


you know, if you do that, you're going to open the door --


Justice Stevens, I wanted to just -- if you do that,


you're going to open the door to proof of what happened


elsewhere.  They didn't mind, and they insisted that the


sequence of proof be rebuttal first, actually, through


depositions, and then the principal arguments, which made

it look as though it was part of the direct case.  I think


that --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Tribe.


MR. TRIBE:  -- this judgment should be affirmed.


Thank you.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Do I have a little time, can I


just -- left to respond?


QUESTION:  You have about --


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Two minutes?


QUESTION:  You have, I think, a minute and a


half -- but let's make it two and a half. 


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHEILA L. BIRNBAUM


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Thank you, Your Honor, I


appreciate that, because there are certain things that Mr. 

Tribe said that I think we have to clarify.


First of all, this case, on the openings of the


plaintiff, the plaintiff said to the jury, this case


transcends the Campbells' file.  It involves a nationwide


practice.  He went on to say, you're going to be


evaluating and assessing and hopefully requiring State


Farm to stand accountable for what it is doing across the


country.  That is the purpose of punitive damages.


On the summation, they asked this jury to act as


a national regulator, because none of the regulators had

acted against State Farm.  Can you imagine, in a 14 -- in


a 20-year period, State Farm handled approximately 280


million claims.


QUESTION:  What limiting instruction did you ask


for?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  The only instruction, Your Honor,


was the instruction that I previously read to Justice


Ginsburg that they should look to the conduct toward the


Campbells, and that was the instruction.  There was no


other instruction.


But whether there was an instruction or not, I


think as the Ninth Circuit just said in White v. Ford, you


have to look at the evidence, the openings, the closings,


and what was punished here.  It was a scheme, and the


scheme had no causal relationship with the decision to try 

this case. 


You asked, Justice Stevens, how much of the


evidence was extraterritorial?  Huge amounts, and it came


in on direct, and we have it cited in our brief, and it


wasn't only --


QUESTION:  Do you disagree with Mr. Tribe's


suggestion that over half the evidence related to Utah?


MS. BIRNBAUM:  No, Your Honor.  It related to


Mr. Campbell's underlying case, not to actions in Utah


that harmed Utah policyholders.  That was all inferred

from this large national scheme.  In fact, the evidence is


contrary.


QUESTION:  You're saying the Utah evidence was


evidence relating to this particular case --


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  -- rather than to other Utah


policyholders.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  And if you look at the footnote


in their brief, and look at our reply brief, we point out


all of that evidence had to do with the underlying case. 


The lawyers from the underlying case, Mr. Campbell, Mrs.


Campbell, Ospital, Slusher et cetera, and this issue of


whether there was one, whether this -- Mr. Campbell was


vulnerable, Mr. Campbell was the only person in this whole


trial that wasn't vulnerable. 


He was a 60-year-old white 

man and who had a B.A. and an M.A.  He sat through the


entire trial and he said he was not liable, and the


decision was made that this was a no liability case.


Mr. Tribe says Ospital was not speeding --


JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Ms. Birnbaum.


MS. BIRNBAUM:  Thank you so much.


JUSTICE STEVENS:  I think we've got your


position.


The case is submitted.
