CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  15­6418,  Welch  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States. 

 

            

Mr.  Ali. 

 

              

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  AMIR  H.  ALI 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ALI:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Johnson  is  retroactive  because  it  is  a  rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of  substantive  criminal  law,  not  a  procedural  rule  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulates  only  the  manner  of  determining  a  defendant's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

culpability  or  sentence.  This  Court  applies  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

straightforward  test  for  distinguishing  between  those 

 

 

 

 

 

rules  that  are  procedural  and  those  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive. 

            

Assuming  perfect  trial  or  sentencing 

 

 

 

 

procedures,  does  the  new  rule  change  the  authorized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outcomes  of  the  criminal  process?  If  no,  meaning  that  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  could  have  reached  the  same  outcome  had  it  applied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perfect  procedures,  then  we're  dealing  with  a  procedural 

   

 

 

 

 

 

rule. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Well  ­­

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  do  you  do  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  argument  that  the  ­­ the  concern  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motivated  Johnson  is  all  procedural?  Fair  notice  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  that  checks  against  arbitrary  enforcement, 

 

 

 

 

 

those  are  procedural  concerns? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ALI:  Your  Honor,  we  think  under  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  decision  in  Bousley,  it's  clear  that  you  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  to  the  source  of  the  rule  and  that  that's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governing.  And  what's  relevant  here,  as  it  was  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant  ­­ in  Bousley  is  that  there  was  no  valid  active 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  which  authorized  the  punishment  for  a  class  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

persons.  Here  the  class  of  persons  who,  absent  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual  clause,  would  have  two  or  fewer  qualifying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes  under  ACCA.  In  Bousley,  the  class  of  persons 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  those  who  merely  possessed  firearms. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  to  answer  your  question  more  directly, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg,  as  we  explain  on  page  16,  17  of  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reply  brief,  we  think  it's  far  from  clear,  even  if  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  the  test,  that  vagueness  sounds  only  in  procedural 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due  process.  In  fact,  it's  qualitatively  different,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  from  procedural  due  process  in  the  sense  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  control  or  regulate  which  criminal  prescriptions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  can  or  cannot  pass  in  a  way  that  we  don't  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  when  it  comes  to  procedural  due  process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  Johnson  didn't  say,  Government,  if  you

provide  notice  to  people  or  greater  notice,  you  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  come  after  them  under  the  residual  clause.  What 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Johnson  said  was  the  residual  clause  is  facially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional.  No  person  may  be  sentenced  to  15  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life  under  the  residual  clause. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  what  we  know  now  is  that  people,  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner,  are  spending  somewhere  between  an  additional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

five  years  to  the  rest  of  their  life  in  prison  based  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  there  was  no  valid  active  Congress  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized  that  punishment.  And  that,  we  believe,  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  clearly  a  substantive  rule  under  Bousley. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  before  you  get  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue  too  deeply  into  the  substance  of  your  argument, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  I  just  ask  a  possibly  irritating  question  about 

   

   

 

 

 

 

the  facts  of  this  particular  case?  The  first  question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  raise  in  the  cert  petition  is  whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  was  in  error  when  it  denied  relief  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  2255  motion. 

 

 

            

And,  I  mean,  I  want  to  ­­ if  you  look  at 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

page  96A  of  the  Joint  Appendix,  the  first  sentence  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  sorry,  the  paragraph  8  on  that  page,  can  you  tell  me 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  were  a  district  court  judge,  would  you  have  seen 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  that  argument  the  argument  that  the  residual  clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Armed  Career  Criminal  Act  is  unconstitutionally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vague?

MR.  ALI:  Your  Honor,  we  believe  that  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

liberal  pro  se  pleading  standards,  that  what's  said  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

96  and  what's  said  on  page  83  where  Petitioner  invokes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  Fifth  Amendment  right  to  due  process,  combining  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  language  here,  that  he  does  not  mean  ­­ meet 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Armed  Career  Criminal  requirements  because  it's,  quote, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"ambiguous,  vague,  and  without  any  violence,"  we  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  satisfy  it.  But  more  importantly,  we  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  just  ­­ and,  I  mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

this  wasn't  exactly  the  question  I  asked.  Particularly 

   

  

 

 

 

 

when  I  was  on  the  court  of  appeals,  and  we  reversed  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  judge,  they  would  always  complain  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  you're  asking  us  to  ­­ to  ­­ you  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  our  situation. 

 

 

            

My  ­­ my  question  is,  if  you  were  a  district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge,  would  you  have  seen  in  this  sentence, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Petitioner's  robbery  under  Florida  State  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  812,  et  cetera,  is  ambiguous,  vague,  and  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  any  violence  and/or  physical  force,"  if  you  read 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  as  a  district  court  judge,  would  you  have  seen  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  argument  that  the  Court  adopted  in  Johnson? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ALI:  Your  Honor,  I  think  the  answer  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

yes.  Again  ­­

MR.  ALI:  ­­ when  you  read  it  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  before  ­­ and  ­­ and  but  more  fundamentally,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  answer  is  that  it  doesn't  matter  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  question  that  Petitioner  is  entitled  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit  of  Johnson  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  How  can  it  not  matter? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

You're  arguing  that  the  district  judge  made  a  mistake. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  your  answer  is  you  would  have  seen  it  there,  and  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  a  very  prescient  district  judge.  That's  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

answer. 

            

MR.  ALI:  Well,  Your  Honor,  my  more  complete 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer  is  that  the  questions  presented  that  were  drafted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case  and  granted  about  the  Court  were  drafted  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  pro  se  litigant. 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  that  taking  the  two  questions 

   

 

 

 

 

 

together,  what  those  questions  ask  are:  Did  the  court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  appeals  err  in  reversing  ­­ or  in  denying  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certificate  of  appealability?  So  the  first  question  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

referring  to,  did  it  err  on  the  basis  of  the  elements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause  question.  And  that  raises  merely  the  question  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  reasonable  jurists  could  disagree  as  to  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  conviction  qualified  under  the  elements 

 

 

 

 

 

clause. 

            

And  the  second  prong  goes  to  Johnson's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactivity,  which,  again,  raises  the  question  of

whether  reasonable  jurists  could  disagree  as  to  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Johnson  is  retroactive. 

 

 

            

So  it  may  be  the  case  that  the  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  presented  as  drafted  by  the  pro  se  litigant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  it  was  ­­ and  granted  by  this  Court  suggests  to  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  is  that  whether  the  district  court  erred. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  I  think  the  better  reading  of  the  question  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  district  ­­ sorry,  whether  the  court  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals  was  erroneous  in  reversing  ­­ or  in  denying  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certificate  of  appealability. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You  mention  the  elements 

  

 

 

 

 

clause.  That  wasn't  ­­ that  wasn't  passed  on  below,  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it?  The  ­­ I  think  the  court  of  appeals  said  it  wasn't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deciding  it,  that  ­­

 

 

 

            

MR.  ALI:  Your  Honor,  with  respect  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements  clause,  on  direct  appeal,  the  Petitioner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenged  whether  he  qualified  under  either  of  the  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clauses,  the  residual  clause  or  the  elements  clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  Eleventh  Circuit  on  direct  appeal  said  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguable  that  the  elements  clause  would  not  have  ­­ have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied.  It's  ­­ it  was  not  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

holding. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  They  didn't  make  that  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  ALI:  It  did  not  make  that  a  holding. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

That's  correct,  Your  Honor.  What  it  did  was  fall  back

on  the  residual  clause,  as  many  courts  at  this  time  did, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  residual  clause,  as  this  Court  acknowledged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Johnson,  provided  a  relatively  easy  standardless 

   

 

 

 

 

analysis  that  would  allow  ­­ that  ­­ that  many  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  subsumed  with  it,  and  that's  really  the  problem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  is  we're  dealing  with  an  instance  in  which  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  no  active  Congress  which  authorized  this  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Johnson.  And  what  we  had  was  essentially  courts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

deciding  whether  people  did  or  did  not  fall  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  ­­ this  clause  that  this  Court  has  described  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nearly  impossible  to  apply  as  a  judicial  morass  in  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

black  hole  which  frustrated  any  attempt  to  apply.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  think  it  follows  from  that,  that  this  is  clearly  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  rule  getting  back  into  the  merits  of  ­­ of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactivity. 

            

And  if  ­­ if  you  will,  Your  Honors,  I'd  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  just  talk  briefly  about  how  illogical  it  would  be  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deny  retroactivity  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  consider  a  decision  of  this  Court,  like 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Skilling,  where  the  Court  narrowly  interpreted  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

honest  services  fraud  statute  to  its  core  conduct, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bribery  and  kickbacks. 

 

 

            

Now,  that  case  under  under  ­­ under  Bousley 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  retroactive,  because  it  is  an  interpretation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  everybody  who  falls  out  of  that  core  scope

would  get  the  benefit  of  ­­ of  Skilling  retroactively, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that's  what  the  court  of  ­­ courts  of  appeals  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concluded. 

            

Now  if  the  Court  denies  retroactivity  here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  it  would  be  saying  was  ­­ is  if  the  three  justices 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Skilling  had  their  way  and  instead  the  Court  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concluded  that  there  is  no  possible  interpretation  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  statute,  it's  incapable  of  interpretation,  all  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  same  people  ­­ if  the  Court  went  the  further  step, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  those  same  people  would  be  denied  relief,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ we  think  that's  entirely  arbitrary.  And  it  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  shows  in  the  context  of  ACCA  itself. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  this  Court  in  Begay  said  that  DUI  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  clearly  fall  within  ACCA's  residual  clause.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  in  chambers  the  Court  said  that  failure  to  report 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  a  penal  institution  does  not  clearly  fall  within 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

ACCA's  residual  clause.  And  as  the  Court  made  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions,  those  are  retroactively  applicable,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  amicus  agrees  with  those  ­­ should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactively  applicable. 

 

            

And  what  the  Court  would  be  saying  if  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

denied  retroactivity  here  is  that  if  the  Court  goes  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further  step  and  says,  in  fact,  we  have  no  idea  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  did  or  did  not  want  to  follow,  so  nothing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly  follows  or  almost  nothing  clearly  falls  within

this  clause,  that  retroactivity  ­­ nobody  would  get  the

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel.

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MICHAEL  R.  DREEBEN 

 

 

 

 

 

                   

FOR  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

            

            

IN  SUPPORT  OF  VACATUR  AND  REMAND 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  DREEBEN: 

 

   

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  United  States  agrees  that  Johnson 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutes  a  substantive  decision  that's  retroactively 

   

 

 

 

applicable  on  collateral  review.  The  effect  of  Johnson 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  controlling  inquiry  here. 

 

 

 

 

            

What  Johnson  did  was  eliminate  a  substantive 

   

 

 

 

 

basis  for  imposing  an  enhanced  sentence  under  the  ACCA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  effect  of  that  is  to  create  a  class  of  people 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  law  cannot  punish  under  ACCA.  This  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  language  in  Schriro  v.  Summerlin  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  a  substantive  rule. 

   

 

 

            

The  reason  ­­

the  use  of  the  word  "class  of  people."  Amicae  is  right 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that's  almost  a  circular  argument.  You're  a  class 

   

   

  

 

 

 

of  people  because  I  say  you  can't  be  covered  by  this. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  doesn't  make  much  sense  in  terms  ­­ can't  be  covered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  this  law. 

 

 

            

What's  ­­ isn't  there  a  simpler  way  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

arguing  this,  which  is  that  if  ­­ and  your  co­counsel  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ Petitioner's  counsel  is  suggesting  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  you  can  be  retried  under  the  existing  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  a  corrective  process,  that's  procedural.  If  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

can't  be  retried  and  sentenced  that  way,  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substance  ­­ substantive. 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well,  I  ­­ I  think  that's  a 

   

   

  

 

 

 

fine  way,  Justice  Sotomayor,  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Pretty  simple  rule. 

  

 

 

 

What's  wrong  with  it? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  The  only  caveat  that  I  have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

about  it  at  all  is,  as  this  Court  knows  from  Montgomery 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

v.  Louisiana,  the  government's  view  is  that  a  law  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalidates  a  mandatory  minimum  punishment  within  an 

   

 

 

 

 

existing  range  is  a  substantive  rule  because  it  expands 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  range  of  outcomes.  May  not  eliminate  the  outcome 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  defendant  actually  received,  but  it  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require  an  expanded  range  of  outcomes,  and  we  regard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  as  a  substantive  holding.

But  with  that  caveat,  I  entirely  agree  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  basic  distinction  between  substance  and  procedure  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  substantive  holding  changes  the  question  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  or  the  sentencer  is  answering.  It  changes  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from,  in  this  case,  did  the  defendant  have  a  conviction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  qualified  under  the  residual  clause,  to  does  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  conviction  that  qualifies  under  the  elements 

   

 

 

 

 

 

clause  or  the  enumerated  offense  clause  only.  It  ­­ it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strikes  from  the  statute  a  basis  ­­ a  discrete  basis  for 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding  ACCA  applicable. 

 

 

            

And  that  is,  I  think,  as  you  correctly  point 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

out,  Justice  Sotomayor,  very  different  from  a  procedural 

   

 

 

 

 

 

rule  that  would  say  you  have  to  give  the  defendant  20 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

days'  notice  before  the  defendant  litigates  this,  or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  has  to  be  able  to  introduce  certain  kinds  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  in  support  of  the  defendant's  claim.  But  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  is  still  answering  the  very  same  question:  Was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  a  violent  felony  under  a  preexisting  definition 

   

   

 

 

 

unaltered  by  the  Court's  new  ruling. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  once  the  Court  divides  the  world  between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural  consequences  and  substantive  changes  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  that  alter  the  question,  the  very  question  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  is  answering,  I  think  that  resolves  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

substance­versus­procedure  inquiry.

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ in  a  State  court  ­­ a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

State  criminal  system  if  the  statute  says  that  the  judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  take  into  account  whether  or  not  past  acts  and  past 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes  were  crimes  of  violence,  and  a  judge  makes  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding?  It's  almost  in  ­­ in  the  same  terms  as  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  that  was  struck  down  in  Johnson.  What  ­­ what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

results  there? 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Justice  Kennedy,  I  think  the 

   

  

 

 

 

result  would  be  the  same  if  it  were  actually  an  ­­ an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analogous  State  law  provision  that  was  worded  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  was  invalidated  on  vagueness  grounds  in  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  that's  ­­ that's  even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

assuming  that  the  sentence  the  judge  gave  after  making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  finding  was  within  the  maximum  permitted  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute? 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Yes.  If  the  substantive  basis 

  

  

 

 

 

 

for  imposing  that  sentence  is  altered  so  that  the  judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  no  longer  rely  on  the  fact  that  he  did  rely  on  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impose  that  sentence,  then  it  ­­ it  alters  substantive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law. 

            

And  there  may  be  defendants,  and  in  fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  may  be  one  for  whom  ACCA  is  still  applicable, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  there  is  an  alternative  way  of  imposing  the  same

sentence. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Can  you  explain  it,  how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

­­ how  this  elements  clause  might  work.  You  say  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual  clause,  it's  substantive.  But  you  say  these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements,  it  might  be  ­­ it  still  might  fall  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements  clause.  Can  you  spell  that  out? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well,  Justice  Ginsburg,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

time  of  the  conviction,  he  was  convicted  of  strong­arm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

robbery.  And  there  was  an  argument  that  he  raises,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continues  to  raise,  that  strong­arm  robbery  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require,  as  interpreted  by  Florida  law  at  the  time  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  conviction,  violent  force.  This  is  what  the  court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held  is  required  to  satisfy  the  elements  clause  in  ACCA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  other  Johnson  case,  the  Curtis  Johnson  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  he  argues  that  violent  force  wasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required;  that  the  Eleventh  Circuit  looked  at  some  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  precedents  and  said  we're  just  not  going  to  decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  issue;  it's  easier  to  resolve  under  the  residual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause.  So  it  remained  an  open  issue  under  Eleventh 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  law.  And  the  courts  below  just  haven't  decided 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it. 

              

I  think  there  is  a  very  substantial  argument 

   

 

 

 

 

that  a  proper  reading  of  Florida  State  law  would  lead  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  conclusion  that  you  do  need  to  use  enough  force  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  property  from  another  person  to  be  convicted  of

Florida  strong­arm  robbery,  and  that  would  satisfy  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Curtis  Johnson  standard,  in  which  case  his  conviction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  count,  but  on  an  alternative  basis. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  he  has  arguments  to  the  contrary.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  never  been  reviewed  by  the  courts  below.  And  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  why  the  government's  view  is  that  this  Court  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolve  the  retroactivity  of  Johnson  in  this  case  if  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concludes  that  Johnson  is  retroactive.  Rather  than 

  

 

 

 

 

 

being  a  court  of  first  view  on  the  elements  clause,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  should  let  the  Eleventh  Circuit  sort  that  out. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  Eleventh  Circuit,  as 

  

 

 

 

 

counsel  said,  decided  the  case  on  the  basis  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual  clause.  But  there's  one  other  part  of  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  a  little  foggy  to  me,  and  it  doesn't  arise  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Welch's  case  because  this  is  ­­ his  is  a  first  2255 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motion;  is  that  ­­

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  That  is  correct. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  there's  something 

  

 

 

 

about  successive  ­­ second  or  successive  motions.  Does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  work  a  little  differently,  or  is  this  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  It  works  very  differently, 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg.  To  get  certified  for  filing  of  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second  or  successive  2255  motion,  a  defendant  has  to  go 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  court  of  appeals  and  request  authorization  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receive  it  under  2255(h).  And  2255(h)(2)  permits

been  made  retroactive  to  cases  on  collateral  review  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court.  So  it  requires  a  ruling  from  this  Court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  ruling  that's  relied  upon  is  retroactive. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  courts  of  appeals  have  split, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

methodologically  and  substantively,  on  whether  this 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  made  Johnson  retroactive. 

 

 

 

 

            

To  be  very  brief  about  it,  the  government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  is  that  this  Court  has  done  so  through  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

combination  of  holdings.  It's  a  syllogism.  All 

   

  

  

 

 

substantive  rules  are  retroactive;  Johnson  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  rule;  therefore,  this  Court's  jurisprudence 

 

 

 

 

 

makes  Johnson  retroactive. 

 

 

            

But  that  has  occasioned  substantial 

 

 

 

 

disagreement  in  the  courts  of  appeals.  Unfortunately, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  precluded  certiorari  review  in  the  AEDPA,  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  cannot  directly  review  that  conflict. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  the  Court  in  this  case  were  to  hold  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Johnson  is  retroactive,  it  would  make  Johnson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactive,  and  thereby  entitle  the  second  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

successive  filers  to  come  in.  And  the  government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

believes  that  that  would  be  appropriate  because  if,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  they  are  serving  an  ACCA  sentence  based  on  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual  clause  conviction,  they're  in  jail  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimum  of  five  years  longer  than  Congress  ever  validly

authorized. 

            

And  in  the  government's  view,  that's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  substantive  holding  that  Justice  Harlan  had  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind  in  the  Mackey  case,  which  was  the  progenitor  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Teague  opinion.  It's  ­­ means  that  the  criminal  process 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  come  to  rest  at  a  point  where  it  never  should  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  to  rest. 

 

 

            

The  residual  clause  was  not  found  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional  until  Johnson,  but  once  the  Court  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concluded  ­­ contrary  to  the  government's  argument,  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  sure  ­­ but  that  it  is  facially  void,  it  means  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  never  supplied  a  valid  basis  for  those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

sentences.  And  we  think  that  it  is  consistent  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrinal  framework  that  the  Court  has  announced  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas  cases  and  for  the  substantive  versus  procedural 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry  to  hold  it  retroactive. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now  the  amicus  in  support  of  the  judgment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  offered  an  alternative  way  of  analyzing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactivity.  Its  method  ­­ its  approach  is  to  look  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  source  of  the  underlying  right  rather  than  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect  that  it  has  in  the  criminal  proceeding. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That  approach  is  in  some  ways  reminiscent  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  first  step  in  retroactivity  analysis  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Linkletter  v.  Walker,  the  very  approach  that  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overthrew  in  Teague.  That  inquiry  said,  what  was  the

purpose  of  the  new  rule  being  designed?  The  amicus's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  would  send  the  courts  back  to  look  at  that  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposed  to  looking  at  the  ­­ the  effect  of  the  rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  Justice  Harlan  himself,  I  think,  offered 

   

 

 

 

 

us  a  very  clear  indication  that  he  understood  that  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  the  effect  of  the  rule,  rather  than  the  source  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  rule.  He  examined  two  cases  in  combination  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mackey  decision  and  the  United  States  in  Coin  &  Currency 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  involved  a  Fifth  Amendment  violation,  punishing 

   

 

 

 

 

somebody  for  compelling  ­­ you  know,  compelled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self­incrimination.  And  that  is  a  procedural  rule,  but 

   

  

 

 

 

 

when  it  is  the  very  basis  for  criminal  liability,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  words,  punishing  somebody  for  failing  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incriminate  themselves,  Justice  Harlan  said  that's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  effect,  and  it's  entitled  to  retroactivity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

When,  on  the  other  hand,  it  simply  gives 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rise  to  evidence  that  should  not  have  been  admitted  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  otherwise  valid  proceeding,  it  produces  a  procedural 

   

 

 

 

 

 

rule  that  Justice  Harlan  believed  was  not  entitled  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactivity.  Same  right,  two  different  outcomes 

  

 

 

 

 

depending  on  the  effect  in  the  particular  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  think  that  that  effects­based 

 

 

 

 

 

approach  is  what  the  Court  adopted  in  Schriro  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Summerlin  and  in  Teague  and  has  applied  in  numerous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  cases.  And  it's  also  the  basis  for  the

government's  view  that  while  Johnson  does  apply  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  guidelines,  in  the  sentencing  guidelines 

 

 

 

 

 

context,  it  does  not  create  a  substantive  rule.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

creates  a  procedural  rule.  The  sentencing  guidelines 

   

  

 

 

 

serve  as  information  that  the  judge  must  legally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider  in  imposing  the  sentence,  but  it  does  not  alter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statutory  maximum  or  require  a  statutory  minimum. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  a  mistake  in  applying  the  guidelines 

   

 

 

 

 

functions  as  a  piece  of  misinformation.  It's  analogous 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to  wrongly  weighed  facts  or  legal  considerations  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  preexisting  range.  And  in  our  view,  that  is,  under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  definition  that  Justice  Sotomayor  articulated,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  definitions,  a  procedural  rule.  It  influences  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

way  a  guideline  sentence  influences  what  the  judge  does, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  the  judge's  charge  remains  the  same,  to  impose  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  that  is  sufficient,  but  not  greater  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary,  to  achieve  the  purposes  of  punishment  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  preexisting  statutory  minimum  and  maximum. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  so  suppose  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  judge  says  in  a  guidelines  case,  because  you  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilty  of  a  crime  of  violence,  I  find  you  within  that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  of  persons  to  whom  I  will  give  a  ­­ an  enhanced 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence?  Procedural? 

  

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  I  think  it  is  still  procedural 

    

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  meaning  of  the  Teague  line  of  jurisprudence

because  errors  that  result  in  a  judge  giving  too  much 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weight  to  a  particular  factor  in  making  a  discretionary 

   

   

 

 

 

 

decision  fall  into  the  procedural  basket. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  Court  has  a  number  of  death  penalty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

cases  in  which  either  the  jury  was  deprived  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considering  certain  information  or  it  improperly  gave 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weight  to  certain  factors.  It  received  instructions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  may  have  relieved  itself  of  a  sense  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsibility  or  ignored  mitigating  factors. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  Court  has  said  those  are  procedural. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  don't  change  the  ultimate  outcomes  that  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  before  it.  They  only  influence  the  way  in  which  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party  gets  to  the  outcome.  And  there  may  be  ­­ there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  be  error  there,  quite  serious  error,  but  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  for  retroactivity  is  not  whether  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error.  It's  whether  it's  procedural  error  or  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  error  that  actually  alters  the  range  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  that's  being  punished.  Here,  we  believe  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  latter. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Do  you  have  any  view  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  we  should  say  about  whether  the  vagueness  issue  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

properly  raised? 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  I  believe  that  the  appropriate 

    

 

 

 

 

thing  to  do,  Justice  Alito,  would  be  to  leave  that  issue

instance.  It  has  not  been  passed  on  by  any  lower  court. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  do  quite  agree  with  your  reading  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  complaint.  I  do  not  believe  that  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

vagueness  issue  was  properly  raised  in  the  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  It  was  called  to  the  Court's  attention  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application  for  the  certificate  of  appealability  and  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  request  to  hold  that  application  for  Johnson.  At  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  that  the  Eleventh  Circuit  denied  those  things,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committed  no  error,  either,  because  Johnson  had  not  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided.  And  that  makes  this  case,  as  I  think  we  said 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  our  brief,  a  somewhat  unusual  procedural  vehicle  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

clarifying  the  law  as  to  Johnson. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  United  States  filed  a  ­­ a  brief  at  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

petition  stage  saying  just  to  vacate  this  case  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remand  it  so  that  the  Eleventh  Circuit  can  apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Johnson.  And,  of  course,  it  would  be  free  to  apply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  procedural  rules,  and  we  still  think  that's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Can  we  do  that?  Can  we  just 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide  an  abstract  legal  question  without  deciding

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

In  the  25  years  since  Teague  was  decided, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  has  never  held  that  a  new  rule  based  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

central  procedural  guarantees  of  the  due  process  clause, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  either  the  Fifth  Amendment  or  the  Fourteenth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment,  nonetheless  constituted  a  substantive  rule 

   

 

 

 

that  could  apply  to  overturn  final  criminal  judgments. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You  should  not  do  so  for  the  first  time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  How  can  it  not  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  when,  under  one  rule,  the  sentence  range 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goes  minimum  of  15  years  up  to  life,  and  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading,  it's  zero  to  ten  years?  I  can't  imagine 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  more  substantive  than  five  extra  ­­ a  minimum 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  five  extra  years  in  prison. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WALKER:  Because  the  government's 

  

 

 

 

articulation  of  the  test,  which  is  an  effects­based  test 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  draw  from  a  statutory  construction  case, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Bousley,  is  not  the  proper  inquiry  for  asking  whether  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new  constitutional  rule  is  substantive  or  procedural. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Since  Penry,  which,  after  all,  was  the  case  that  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extended  Teague's  first  exception  into  the  sentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  in  the  first  place,  there,  the  Court  looked  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  existence  of  a,  quote,  "substantive  categorical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  guarantee."  And  ever  since,  that's  what

this  Court  has  looked  for.  The  foundation  stone,  as  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  just  two  months  in  Montgomery,  is  the  existence  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a,  quote,  "substantive  constitutional  guarantee."  That 

  

 

 

 

 

must  be  the  lodestar  for  whether  a  new  constitutional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  is  procedural  or  substantive. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  what  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

substantive  constitutional  guarantees?  Much  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

Sixth  Amendment  is  ­­ is  all  procedure,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WALKER:  That's  true.  And  that  was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Summerlin,  Justice  Scalia.  And  that  actually  proves  my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  about  the  proper  analysis.  In  Summerlin,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Scalia  looked  to  the  Sixth  Amendment  right  to  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial,  which  was  the  underlying  constitutional  basis  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  new  rule  announced  in  Ring.  And  he  said,  well,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  be  substantive  because  the  Sixth  Amendment  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial  right  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  scope  of  conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  can  either  punish  or  prohibit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so,  too,  here,  I  don't  think  there's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

really  any  question.  I  don't  think  my  friends  on  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  side  have  seriously  contested  this,  but  Johnson  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  case  that  is  founded  on  the  procedural  due  process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  not  to  be  put  in  jail  under  a  vague  law.  There  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  in  Johnson  that  suggests  there  was  any  concern, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  than  clarity,  predictability,  determinacy.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

void  for  vagueness  cases  that  the  author  of  Johnson

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  ­­ what 

  

 

 

 

 

procedures  would  allow  somebody  to  be  convicted  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  residual  clause?  If  it's  a  procedural  protection, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

there  must  be  some  procedures  that  would  allow  people  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  convicted.  What  are  they? 

  

 

 

 

            

MS.  WALKER:  Absolutely.  What  Johnson 

  

  

 

 

required  was  the  use  of  a  framework  that  specified  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nature  of  the  inquiry  to  be  conducted  and  the  kinds  of

sentences. 

            

The  problem  in  Johnson  was  not  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  was  wrong  with  15­year  mandatory  minimums,  per 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

se,  but  just  that  Congress  hadn't  articulated  its  ­­ its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  goal  in  sufficiently  precise  terms. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Why  don't  we  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Suppose  you  have  a  statute 

   

  

 

 

 

which  makes  it  a  crime  to  engage  in  conduct  annoying  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

others? 

            

            

MS.  WALKER:  That  was  Coates. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  the  Court  said  this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

void  because  it  is  vague.  That's  procedural. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WALKER:  That's  the  Coates  decision, 

  

 

 

 

 

which  said  ­­ struck  down  a  State  law,  I  think  it  was  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  said  that  you  can't  stand  on  the  street  and  annoy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  people,  and  you  definitely  can't  annoy  a  police 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer. 

            

The  Court  said  that  is  void­for­vagueness, 

 

 

 

 

 

because  nobody  can  tell  what  the  particular  standard  is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  the  Court  actually  went  out  of  its  way  to  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  States  can  regulate  behavior  on  the  street. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're  not  saying  that  States  lack  the  power  to  do  this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're  just  saying  you  have  to  do  this  in  a  sufficiently 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  way. 

 

            

So  Coates  fully  supports  our  reading  of  the

void­for­vagueness  doctrine. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  the  procedural 

  

 

 

 

 

protection  is  that  Congress  can  change  the  law? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WALKER:  The  procedural  protection  is 

  

 

 

 

 

the  right  to  fair  notice  and  an  avoidance  of  the  risk  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitrary  enforcement.  Those  are  the  two  prongs  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

void­for­vagueness  doctrine.  And  those  have  always  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

understood  to  come  under  the  procedural  due  process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

component. 

            

Johnson  was  based  on  the  Fifth  Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  there  are  essentially  only  two  options  here,  Mr. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chief  Justice.  Johnson  was  either  founded  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural  component  of  the  due  process  clause,  or  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  founded  on  the  substantive  component.  And  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  if  you  read  fairly,  Johnson,  from  beginning  to  end, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you'll  not  see  any  substantive  concern.  The  concern  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  underlying  conduct  was  somehow  constitutionally 

 

 

 

 

 

protected,  which  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Why  did  we  make  Bailey 

  

 

 

 

 

 

retroactive?  Congress  could  have  made  mere  possession. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  it  subsequently  did,  in  some  form.  It  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  changed  the  law  and  fixed  the  problem.  How  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  than  here? 

 

 

            

It  could  make  certain  class  of  crimes  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  defendant's  particular  crime,  if  it  chose,  it  could

take  the  elements  of  this  crime  and  say,  these  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violent  crimes.  So  how  are  they  different?  We  made 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bailey  retroactive. 

 

            

            

            

MS.  WALKER:  They're  different  in  two  ways. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Yes,  you  did,  Justice  Sotomayor. 

 

 

 

 

First,  Bailey  was  a  statutory  construction 

   

 

 

 

case.  And  what  Bousley  explained  is  that  when  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  construes  Federal  criminal  statutes  in  such  a  way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  to  definitely  exclude  particular  conduct,  they're  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mere  possession  of  a  firearm  ­­

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  we  have  excluded 

  

 

 

 

 

particular  conduct.  We've  said  the  residual  clause 

  

 

 

 

 

 

can't  define  a  violent  crime. 

   

 

 

            

MS.  WALKER:  With  all  respect,  that  is  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  we  read  Johnson.  Johnson  said  the  statute  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indeterminant.  We  can't  say  that  particular  conduct  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

definitively  outside  the  scope  of  the  statute,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  Court  did  in  Begay  and  Chambers  and  cases  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bailey.  And  there,  we  know  that  the  defendants  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

innocent  of  anything  that  Congress  meant  by  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  acts. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Whether  it's  Bailey  or 

  

 

 

 

 

here,  Congress  has  to  redefine  the  crime. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WALKER:  That  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It  has  to  step  in  and

pass  a  new  statute.  So  why  is  it  substantive  in  one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  but  not  another?  Same  two  things  have  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done.  The  law  has  to  be  changed. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WALKER:  Because  we  have  to  ask  why  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  has  to  be  changed.  In  Bailey,  the  law  had  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changed  because  this  Court  said  the  statute  didn't  reach 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  conduct.  And  so  the  defendants  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

innocent  of  anything  that  Congress  ever  meant  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminalize. 

            

In  Johnson,  though,  the  Court  didn't  say  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  that  all  defendants  sentenced  under  the  residual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause  have  been  sentenced  on  the  basis  of  a  crime  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  never  meant  to  cover.  In  fact,  the  Court  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite  the  opposite.  They  said  we  can't  tell. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You  said  when  you 

  

 

 

 

 

started  that  Congress  could  change  the  statute  to  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonuse  criminal,  just  possession. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WALKER:  Yes,  and  that  showed  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  so  Congress  could 

  

 

 

 

 

change  the  statute  and  make  this  conduct  criminal.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  see  the  difference. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WALKER:  So  what  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  don't  see  ­­ you  still 

    

 

 

 

 

 

need  a  congressional  act  ­­

   

 

 

            

MS.  WALKER:  Right.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ to  ­­

  

 

 

 

MS.  WALKER:  And  the  fact  that  you  needed  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

congressional  act  both  in  Bailey  and  here  just  shows  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimate  point,  which  is  that  Johnson  didn't  deprive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  of  the  power  to  legislate  in  this  area.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply  said  you  have  to  do  a  better  job. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  Court  didn't  strike  down  the  residual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause  because  Congress  had  exceeded  its  powers  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article  1,  or  regulated  something  that  didn't  affect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interstate  commerce,  or  regulated  something,  some 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct,  some  private,  primary  conduct,  that  is  entirely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  categorically  off  limits.  The 
 

  

 

 

 

Court  just  said  you 

 

 

 

need  to  do  a  better  job. 

   

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:

Please. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  How 
 

  

 

do  you  deal  with  the 

 

 

 

 

argument  that  counsel  made  saying  it  would  be  passing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strange  if,  when  a  law  is  narrowed,  then  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive.  But  if  a  law  is  invalidated  entirely,  then 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

we  put  it  on  the  procedural  side.  That  ­­ that,  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first,  at  least,  that  seems  to  be  a  persuasive  argument.

First,  the  case  of  Bousley  is  a  statutory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

construction  case.  There  was  no  new  constitutional  rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Bousley.  So  all  the  late  Chief  Justice  Rehnquist 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  there,  writing  for  the  Court,  is  that  when  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  interprets  a  statute,  we  are  outside  the  Teague 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

framework  entirely.  And  there,  of  course,  the  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

hadn't  even  reversed  itself  on  the  statutory  question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  there  wasn't  even  a  new  statutory  issue  there. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

When  the  court  says  what  a  statute 

   

 

 

 

 

definitively  means,  it  is  making  a  judicial 

   

 

 

 

 

determination  that  the  conduct  at  issue  falls 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definitively  outside  the  scope  of  the  relevant  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Here,  precisely  because  Johnson  said  that  the  clause  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hopelessly  indeterminant,  we  can't  know  with  certainty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  everybody's  conduct  fell  outside  the  clause.  At 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  end  of  the  day,  it  is  a  function  of  this  Court's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach  to  statutory  construction  decisions  on  the  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hand,  which  just  aren't  affected  by  Teague.  After  all, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  problem  that  Teague  set  out  to  solve  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactivity  in  a  world  of  changing  constitutional 

   

 

 

 

 

rules.  And  so  statutory  rules  are  to  one  side.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  looking  here  to  the  test  for  when  a  new 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  rule  is  substantive.

argue  that  the  rule  in  Johnson  fits  within  either  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional  standards  for  distinguishing  substance  and 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure  in  the  constitutional  context. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  If  we  could  go  back  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy's  question  and  the  Chief  Justice's,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  not  have  the  distinction  correct,  but  I  thought  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction,  at  least  as  we've  interpreted  it  in  Teague, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  provided  ­­ produced  a  different  answer.  There  is  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  It  says  that  pestiness  is  a  crime.  Sounds 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

like  a  pretty  good  statute.  But  you  ­­ you  can't  pester 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people. 

            

Okay.  Now,  the  Court  says,  I'm  sorry, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

desirable  though  that  may  be,  it's  unconstitutional. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  the  end  of  it.  Okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

There  are  32  people  in  prison  for  having 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violated  that  statute.  They  were  convicted  many  years 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ago.  Do  they,  under  Teague,  get  out? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WALKER:  I  don't  think  they  do  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  that  amazes  me. 

  

 

 

 

 

Because  I  thought  the  point  of  Teague  was  that  if  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  under  which  they  are  convicted  doesn't  exist 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anymore  because  ­­ for  whatever  reason  ­­ because,  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example  ­­ and  did  not  exist  at  the  time,  because  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  unconstitutional  statute  ­­ they  are  serving  time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  a  statute  which  was  then  and  is  now  nonexistent

and,  therefore,  they  get  out. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  if  the  change  that  was  made  in  the  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  change  having  to  do  with  the  accuracy  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure  that  was  used  to  convict  them  of  that  statute, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  statute  still  exists.  They  didn't  get  the  right 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure  when  they  got  convicted  of  it,  but  we're  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  let  everybody  out  of  prison  for  those  kinds  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mistakes  for  a  variety  of  reasons.  It  may  be  there  are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too  many  of  them  or  whatever.  But  then  he  doesn't  get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  under  Teague. 

 

 

            

Now,  that's  what  I  thought  basically,  we 

   

 

 

 

 

said,  Bousley,  I  don't  know,  a  bunch  of  cases  here. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Now  ­­ now,  if  I  ­­ if  I  have  this  fundamentally  wrong, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  what  I've  just  said  is  wrong,  so  you  can  explain  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  what  I  ­­ what  I  did. 

   

   

 

 

            

MS.  WALKER:  Justice  Breyer,  what  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Harlan  said,  and  what  the  Court  adopted  in  Teague,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  habeas  should  issue  when  private,  primary  conduct

this  Court  holding  that  a  substantive  Federal  criminal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

statute  does  not  reach  certain  conduct. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MS.  WALKER:  And  that's  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  See? 

  

 

MS.  WALKER:  ­­ the  statute  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Therefore,  there  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

statute,  perhaps.  But  this  person  is  in  prison,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  person  is  in  prison  for  doing  a  thing  that  there  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  statute  makes  illegal.  That's  how  I  read  that. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

That's  Bousley. 

 

            

MS.  WALKER:  And  that's  the  statutory 

  

 

 

 

 

construction  decision,  which  is  all  my  friends  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rely  on  here,  when  of  course  what  we're  analyzing  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  rule.  And  they  don't  even  say  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bousley  by  its  terms  applies.  They  ask  you  to  say  ­­ to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopt  a  radical  new  test,  a  comparable  effects  test. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

But  we  don't  need  to  analogize  by  an  analogy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  a  constitutional  rule,  which  is  what  Bousley  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about.  We  should  use  the  standard  for  judging  whether  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  rule  is  substantive  or  procedural. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  why  would  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Harlan  have  wanted  that  distinction  in  the  world  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  rules,  because  it  seems  to  me  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Harlan,  as  Justice  Breyer  suggested,  would  have  looked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  this  and  said,  well,  yes,  but  these  ­­ this  person  or

these  32  people  could  not  ­­ it  is  improper  for  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  to  be  sitting  in  jail  under  any  statute  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  lawfully  passed.  I  mean,  it  might  be  that  they 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  sitting  in  jail  under  a  different  statute  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  didn't  pass.  But  Congress  didn't  pass  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  and  that  makes  this  sentence  for  this  person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

improper,  unlawful,  under  any  measure. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  why  would  justice  Harlan  have  wanted  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclude  those  people  from  the  protection  that  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested  in  Mackey? 

 

 

            

MS.  WALKER:  What  Justice  Harlan  was 

  

 

 

 

 

concerned  about  in  Mackey  was  situations  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  at  issue  is  immune  from  punishment.  Nobody  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immune  from  punishment  under  the  residual  clause  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense  that  they  were  engaging  in  constitutionally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protected  conduct,  which  is  plainly  what  Justice  Harlan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  talking  about. 

 

 

            

And  it's  not  enough  that  this  Court  simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalidates  a  statute.  We  must  ask  why  the  statute  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalidated.  Was  it  invalidated  for  a  reason  that  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

based  on  a  substantive  or  a  procedural  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  understand  your  test.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

guess  I'm  just  struggling  to  understand  the  reason 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behind  it.  Because  you  said  if  ­­ if  he  weren't  immune, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  Congress  could  have  passed  a  different  statute,  you

know,  coulda­woulda­shoulda,  Congress  didn't  pass  a 

 

 

 

 

 

different  statute,  and  that  means  he's  in  jail 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawfully. 

            

MS.  WALKER:  Well,  one  is  in  jail  lawfully 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if,  at  the  time  the  sentence  became  final,  he  was  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  law  as  it  stood  at  the  time.  We  only  apply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new  rules  on  habeas  when  they  fall  within  this  narrow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

category  of  substantive  rules. 

 

 

 

            

And  the  notion  that  when  this  Court  declares 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  statute  unconstitutional,  for  any  reason,  that  makes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  underlying  judgment  or  conviction  or  sentence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawful  and  as  if  it  never  were,  the  void  ab  initio 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concept,  going  all  the  way  back  to  the  19th  century,  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  rejected  by  this  Court  in  its  retroactivity  cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Linkletter  explained  that  even  when  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalidates  a  statute,  the  prior  existence  of  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

statute  is  an  operative  fact  that  cannot  justly  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ignored. 

            

So  we've  moved  past,  well  past  any  notion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  a  law  that  has  been  declared  subsequently 

   

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional  simply  disappears,  and  we  must  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretend  it  never  existed. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yeah,  but  that's  still  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  a  point  that,  because  it's  not  quite  like  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pest  statute.  The  pest  statute,  when  we  say  there  is  no

such  statute,  it's  unlawful.  And  there  they  are,  22 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  now  in  jail  because  they  violated  a  statute,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  statute,  there  was  no  such  statute,  or  it  isn't  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  future,  you  see?  And  so  we  say,  you  get  out. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

On  the  other  hand,  if  the  only  reason  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  ­­ anybody  got  out  is  because  they  were  convicted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  a  procedure,  you  see,  that  was  unconstitutional, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  within  the  class  of  a  valid  statute  putting  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jail. 

            

The  valid  statute  puts  them  in  jail.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  not  certain  he's  the  right  one  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure  was  unfair.  Is  he  really  that  kind  of  person? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that's  the  procedural  thing.  It  doesn't  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

backwards. 

            

Now,  if  those  are  the  two  categories,  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  some  of  both,  you're  quite  correct.  He  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted  for  having  violated  a  legitimate  law,  though 

   

 

 

 

 

 

he's  not  quite  like  our  pest. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

On  the  other  hand,  after  time  has  passed,  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

large  number  of  these  people  are  sitting  there  in  prison 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  there  is  no  statute  of  the  Federal  government  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  a  person  like  you  have  been  told  you  are,  deserves 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  can  be  put  in  jail.  And  so  in  that  respect,  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  the  pest.  And  so  is  it  like?  Which  is  it  like? 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  seems  to  be  the  problem  in  this  case.

MS.  WALKER:  Well,  it  actually  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  don't  know  if  you  want  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

address  that  or  not.  It's  up  to  you. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  WALKER:  I  would  love  to. 

    

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right. 

  

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MS.  WALKER:  Johnson  has  to  be  substantive 

  

 

 

 

 

 

if  it's  going  to  apply  on  collateral  review.  So  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  not  quite  sure  whether  it's  procedural  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive,  then  the  default  has  to  go  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonretroactivity,  because  whether  we  want  to  call 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  due  process  rule  an  exception  to  Teague,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  we  simply  want  to  say  they're  not  subject  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Teague  at  all,  the  point  is  there's  a  particular  type  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  that  qualifies  as  substantive.  And  if  it  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

squarely  qualify  as  substantive,  and  I  think  the  fact 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  my  friends  have  had  to  resort  to  an  effects­based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test  that  draws  from  a  statutory  construction  case  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

analogizes  to  the  actual  first  Teague  exception,  shows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Johnson  doesn't  squarely  fall  into  the  bucket  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  rule. 

 

            

And  my  second  response,  Justice  Breyer, 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  that  Teague  assumes,  it's  inherent  in  Teague, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  will  be  constitutional  violations  that  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unremedied.  Otherwise,  all  new  constitutional  rules  as

announced  by  this  Court  would  apply  retroactively.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  certainly  not  what  Justice  Harlan  ever  intended. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  How  ­­ my 

  

 

 

 

 

understanding  is  that  it's  properly  categorized  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural  if  there's  some  people  who  could  be  convicted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  it  legitimately;  in  other  words,  Miranda  ­­ you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  get  Miranda  warnings,  but  you  know,  you  were  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  law  professor,  you  knew  what  your  rights  were. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  who  is  it  who  could  be  convicted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimately  under  the  residual  clause?  We're  sure, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

yes,  okay,  it's  ­­ it's  vague,  whatever,  but  you  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definitely  covered,  so  you  shouldn't  get  the  protection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  what  you  would  regard  as  a  procedural  flaw. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WALKER:  We  certainly  agree  that  Johnson 

  

 

 

 

 

 

invalidated  the  residual  clause,  and  therefore,  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer  your  question,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  nobody  can  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentenced  under  the  residual  clause  going  forward,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  residual  ­­ anybody  that  was  sentenced  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual  clause  would  get  the  benefit  of  that  new  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  direct  appeal. 

 

 

            

But  the  question  that  Teague  asks  is  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  remedy  should  be  available  on  collateral  review. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  answer  to  that  depends  upon  ­­ and  this  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reaffirmed  just  two  months  ago  in  Montgomery  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existence  of  a  substantive  procedural  guarantee.  Once

we  cut  the  analysis  loose,  subs  procedure  under  Teague's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  exception,  cut  it  loose  from  the  underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  basis  for  the  rule,  we're  going  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entirely  at  sea. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  I  ­­ but  my 

   

  

 

 

 

 

understanding  is  that  the  characterization  of  that  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural,  it  turns  on  whether  or  not  there  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  group  of  people  who  could  be  convicted  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  provision  where  vagueness  would  be  off  the  table. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  however,  it  may  appear  to  other  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaging  in  this  type  of  conduct.  Maybe  it's  vague  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them,  but  for  this  group  of  people,  that's  not  vague. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  we're  not  worried  about  not  applying  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactively. 

            

MS.  WALKER:  But  we  can't  know  that  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody  that  was  sentenced  under  residual  clause.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

yet,  holding  Johnson  retroactive  would  give  relief  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody  categorically  that  was  sentenced  under 

 

 

 

 

 

residual  clause.  Any  ­­

including  some  people  you  think  it  shouldn't  be  applied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to. 

            

MS.  WALKER:  Absolutely. 

  

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  who  shouldn't  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

residual  clause  apply  to?

MS.  WALKER:  Well,  for  instance,  let's  take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Petitioner  in  this  case,  Mr.  Welch.  His  sentence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  correct  under  the  residual  clause  at  the  time  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

became  final,  which  is  what  Justice  Harlan  said  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  looking  at.  But  even  today,  Mr.  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice,  his  sentence  is  plainly  correct  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements  clause,  Florida  law  has  made  clear  since  1922. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  ­­ what  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about,  the  residual  clause. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  WALKER:  Yes. 

  

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  guess  what  I'm 

    

 

 

 

 

trying  to  ask  you  is  who  are  the  people  who  you  can  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  a  doubt,  their  conduct  otherwise  involves 

   

 

 

 

 

conduct  that  presents  a  serious  potential  risk  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

physical  injury? 

 

            

MS.  WALKER:  The  people  who  committed  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

crimes  that  were  at  issue  in  this  Court's  decisions  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

James  and  Sykes,  the  people  who  had  engaged  in  vehicular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flight,  and  the  second  crime  is  now  escaping. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  The  problem  in 

  

 

 

 

 

Johnson,  I  think  we  took  a  look  back  and  said,  yeah, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  we  did  say  that,  but  I  have  to  think  Johnson 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggests  that  those  decisions  were  not  clear. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WALKER:  Certainly  Johnson  overruled 

  

 

 

 

those  decisions  with  respect  to  the  vagueness  holding,

but  this  Court  itself  said  that  people  who  engaged  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  two  particular  crimes  were  entirely  correctly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentenced  under  the  residual  clause.  The  Court  actually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  say  that  that  itself  was  wrong. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  what's  interesting  about 

 

 

 

void­for­vagueness  doctrine,  and  Johnson  in  particular, 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  it  took  30  years  for  the  vagueness  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual  clause,  the  hopeless  indeterminacy  of  it,  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

materialize.  That's  all  the  more  reason  not  to  pretend 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  if  the  residual  clause  never  existed  at  all,  as  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friends  would  have  us  do  under  the  nineteenth  century 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Blackstonian. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  you  would  go  back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  say  that  we  think  that  vehicular  homicide  is  conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ today,  with  the  benefit  of  the  analysis  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Johnson  ­­ I  mean,  assuming  we  were  wrong  in  those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  which  I  think  Johnson  suggests  or  said,  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonetheless  it's  clear  that  those  people,  the  vehicular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

homicide  people,  we  shouldn't  be  concerned  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applying  this  ­­ not  applying  this  retroactively  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they,  and  other  ­­ and  other  category  clearly  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covered  by  it. 

 

 

            

In  other  words,  put  aside  our  cases  where  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  ­­ I  understand  your  argument,  well,  we  decided

wrongly. 

            

MS.  WALKER:  Right.  There's  ­­ there's 

  

  

 

 

 

other  ­­ other  kinds  of  crimes  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

example? 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Yes. 

  

 

 

MS.  WALKER:  I'm  sorry,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

There's  other  ­­

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What's  another 

  

 

 

 

MS.  WALKER:  Other  kinds  of  crimes  that  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  found  by  the  lower  courts  to  count  are  attempted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rape,  child  molestation,  assault  with  intent  to  kill.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  all  of  those  crimes  would  fall  within  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

heartland  of  the  residual  clause  without  a  whole  lot  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debate. 

            

But  the  point,  again,  is  that  we  need  to  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  to  the  existence  of  a  substantive  constitutional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

guarantee.  The  reason  why  we  are  here  in  a  sentencing 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  is  because  Penry  extended  Teague  into  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  context  by  reasoning  that  Justice  Harlan  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spoken  of,  quote,  substantive  categorical  guarantees 

 

 

 

 

 

accorded  by  the  Constitution.  Nobody  in  this  case  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  attempted  to  fit  Johnson  within  that  core  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Harlan's  theory. 

 

 

            

The  cases  that  Justice  Harlan  cited  in

those  conducts  immunizing  decisions  of  this  Court,  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Griswold,  Stanley,  Street,  and  Loving,  the  other  side 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  even  mention  those  cases  in  their  briefs.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  shows  just  how  far  Johnson  retroactivity

intended. 

            

If  the  Court  has  no  further  questions.

MR.  ALI:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  just  have  a  couple  of  quick  points  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

make. 

            

The  first,  when  questioned  by  you,  Mr.  Chief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice,  the  Court's  amicae  suggested  that  the  clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples  under  Johnson  would  be  James  and  Sykes.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'd  just  like  to  point  out  how  this  Court  describes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

James  and  Sykes  in  Johnson. 

 

 

 

 

            

This  Court  said  that  James  ­­ the  case  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

James  illustrates  how  speculative  the  enterprise  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  residual  clause  is.

she  also  went  on  to  suggest  some  holdings  in  the  lower 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  that  seemed  a  little  more  on  point  than  James  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sykes.  What  ­­ what  about  those? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ALI:  Well,  Your  Honor,  what  this  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  was  that  it  was  skeptical  that  those  clear  examples 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cited  by  the  government  in  ­­ in  Johnson  and  cited  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  dissent  in  Johnson  were  so  easy  once  you  looked  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  more  closely.  And  so  the  Court  gave  the  example, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  instance,  of  rioting  in  a  prison,  and  said  that  when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  actually  break  that  down,  it's  not  so  simple. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  ­­ and  the  Court  seemed  skeptical  that  there  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  very  many  offenses.  Now,  it  did  suggest  ­­ it  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accept  that  there  would  be  some  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Yeah.  Rioting  in 

  

  

 

 

 

prison  may  be  right.  But  the  ­­ the  example  of  rape, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  that  clearly  fall  under  that  language? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ALI:  Well,  the  court  accepted  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  may  be  some  clear  cases.  It  didn't  define  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  ­­ what  ­­ the  universe  of  those  cases  it  had  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind.  But  more  importantly,  what  the  court  did  was  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  residual  clause  is  so  standardless,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

despite  that  fact,  we  are  going  for  in  validate  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

altogether,  because  it  is  not  capable  of  being  applied. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that's  what's  relevant  for  the  purposes  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactivity.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What  would  be  your  rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

on  ­­ on  this  issue  I  posited  to  Mr.  ­­ to  the  Assistant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solicitor  General.  What  would  be  your  take  on  its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect  on  the  guidelines? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ALI:  Your  Honor,  with  respect  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

advisory  guidelines,  we  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  I  know  that's  not 

   

  

 

 

 

the  issue  we've  posed,  but  I  ­­ I  just  want  to  have  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  idea. 

 

            

MR.  ALI:  That's  fine.  We  think  that  the  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  guidelines  are  different  in  that,  again,  they  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  the  statutory  range.  Now,  that  would  be  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  this  Court  could  distinguish.  But  we  do  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  complicated  question. 

   

 

            

So,  for  instance,  in  Pugh  this  Court  talked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  anchoring  effect  of  the  guidelines,  and  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  pending  decision  in  Molina­Martinez  may  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comment  on  the  anchoring  effect  of  the  guidelines.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  there  is  an  argument  to  be  made  there,  but  I  do  agree 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  government  that  it  can  be  distinguished  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  that  when  somebody  brings  a  challenge  based  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual  clause  of  the  guidelines,  what  they're  saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  my  sentence  might  have  been  different.  When  they

lower  sentence  even  if  he  was  sentenced  50  years  ago. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  what  we  would  be  saying. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  there  are  many,  many  reasons  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  guidelines  or  perhaps  statutory  portions  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sentencing  Act  might  be  held  unconstitutional. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  think  I  agree  with  you.  The  reason 

   

   

  

 

 

 

isn't  the  point  in  Teague.  The  fact  is  that  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  thing  is  struck  out,  because  if  it's  struck 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out,  there  is  no  basis  for  holding  the  person  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prison,  you  see?  And  that's  what  you're  arguing. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

I  ­­

 

            

MR.  ALI:  Your  Honor,  I  agree  with  that,  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  what  I  can't  foresee  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

this  ­­ and  maybe  you  have  ­­ is  what  effect  it  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  on  sentencing  across  the  board.  The  government's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reassuring,  because  they  say,  well,  we  thought  about  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Doesn't  seem  to  have  that  much  of  an  effect.  It's

important.  But  if  you  could  be  reassuring  on  that,  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've  thought  about  it. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ALI:  Your  Honor,  I  ­­ I  will  be 

   

   

  

 

 

 

reassuring  on  that. 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'm  sure  you  would. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  ALI:  What  we're  saying  is  this  court, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  clear,  has  not  distinguished  in  the  context  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactivity  or  habeas  between  conviction  or  sentence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that  distinction  wouldn't  make  sense,  because  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  whether  someone's  confinement  is  unlawful. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now,  what  we're  saying  and  what  the  ­­ I  think  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  ­­ the  reason  it  wouldn't  have  such  a  great 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect,  is  what  we're  saying  is  that  when  it  is  just  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  those  substantive  criterion  in  a  particular  provision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  setting  forth  the  sentence,  which  is  struck 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down.  It's  not  simply  a  procedure  or  some  sort  of  rule 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governing  how  you  reach  that  sentence.  It's  that  rare 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance  in  which  an  actual  substantive  criterion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  qualifies  someone  or  makes  someone  eligible  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  punishment  authorized,  which  leads  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance  which  Your  Honor  described,  which  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  person,  the  Petitioner,  is  now  spending  time  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prison  that  was  not  authorized  by  any  valid  act  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress. 

            

And  that's  what  makes  this  case  much  more

clear  than  the  guidelines,  because  someone  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guideline's  circumstance  cannot  assert  that  aspect  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  that  my  sentence  was  not  authorized  by  any  valid  act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Congess. 

 

            

 

Now,  again,  there  may  be  arguments  that 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  made  to  suggest  that  that's  valid,  that  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevantly  similar,  but  it's  certainly  not  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  necessarily  entailed. 

 

 

            

I'd  just  like  to  comment  briefly  on  the  idea 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  substantive  rule  should  be  limited  to  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  ­­ in  which  Congress  completely  is  deprived  of  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority.  We  think  that  Chief  Justice  Rehnquist 

  

 

 

 

 

 

answered  that  question  in  Bousley.  He  didn't  talk  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress's  intent.  In  fact,  what  he  said  was  that  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute's  scope  is  narrowed,  like  rules  which  place 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  beyond  the  power  of  Congress,  the  law  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punish  those  persons.  You  create  a  set  of  persons  who 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  law  doesn't  punish.  And  for  that  reason,  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance,  we  believe  it's  controlling,  as  well. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Johnson  invalidated  the  residual  clause. 

 

 

 

 

There  was  no  law  authorizing  the  punishment  of  15  years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Petitioner  received  at  trial.  And  ­­ and  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe  that  Chief  Justice  Rehnquist's  decision  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bousley  controls  here,  and  it  follows  that  the  court  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal's  decision  should  be  reversed.  Thank  you.
