CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 01-1015, Victor Moseley and Cathy Moseley


doing business as Victor's Little Secret versus V. Secret


Catalogue, Inc.


Mr. Higgins.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. HIGGINS, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. HIGGINS:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it


please the Court, counsel:


We are here today to obtain a construction of


the Federal Trademark Dilution Act, FTDA, that will keep


Federal trademark law in its proper bounds.  We submit


that can be accomplished by choosing objective proof over 

supposition and inference to guide future FTDA cases. 


This case from the Sixth Circuit involves a non-identical,


non-confusing trademark operating in the remote reaches of


the economy that was nevertheless enjoined under the FTDA,


and demonstrates the dangers of an unchecked FTDA.


QUESTION:  You mean Tennessee is remote, or this


particular business is?


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  Kentucky.


MR. HIGGINS:  Your Honor, this case actually

came from Kentucky, and --


QUESTION:  Oh, well, Kentucky --


MR. HIGGINS:  -- I suppose that's even more


remote than Tennessee in some cases.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  Was there a Victoria's Secret in this


town?


MR. HIGGINS:  There was not at the beginning of


this case.  The closest one was 60 miles away.


We say that the result --


QUESTION:  In Tennessee?


(Laughter.)


MR. HIGGINS:  We say that the result below is


contrary to the actual words that Congress used in the


FTDA, namely the plain words, causes dilution.  If this


result stands, the FTDA threatens to usher in an


anti-competitive expansion of trademark law into patent-


like realm.


Perhaps the best example of that is the Second


Circuit's Nabisco decision, urged in part here by


respondents, which involved a goldfish-shaped cracker, and


it -- the court there applied the FTDA to grant


exclusionary rights in an unpatented, uncopyrighted design


of a product to enjoin a product that they said diluted. 


That is contrary to this Court's two most recent decisions

involving Federal trademark law, the Wal-Mart decision and


the TrafFix Devices decision.


QUESTION:  Before you -- just would you spend


one minute -- it would help me a lot if you explained to


me what dilution is, and I'll be specific.  It seems to me


what you have here is a case of what's called tarnishment,


and what tarnishment -- what I think of is this, is it


like this, that -- that -- imagine some small shop wants


to start a bug spray business.  It's a funny example, but


it comes from an actual case, and they decide to call


themselves Bugwiser Bug Spray, and their slogan is, Where


there's life, there's bugs, all right.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  Now, Budweiser is not going to enter


the bug spray business. 


Nobody thinks Budweiser, in fact, 

is the source of the bug spray, but Budweiser has an


interest because the people who see this ad are going to


think Budweiser, yuck, and they don't want people to think


that.  Now, is dilution encompassed?  Does dilution


encompass that, and my reason for thinking maybe it


doesn't is, the words of the statute refer to


distinctiveness of mark.  They don't refer to tarnishment. 


But -- is it -- so I want some explanation of what


dilution here refers to.


MR. HIGGINS:  There's a lot of people who want

explanation of what dilution is, and their tarnishment


aspect of dilution is part of the legislative history.  It


is not expressed in the words that Congress used to define


dilution.  Congress defined dilution as the lessening of


the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish


the goods or services to which the famous mark --


QUESTION:  But you believe --


QUESTION:  Which wouldn't include tarnishment. 


Which wouldn't include tarnishment.  I mean, it can still


identify Budweiser beer very, very well.


MR. HIGGINS:  Well, it could identify Budweiser


beer, but the -- the -- our point about this case is that


there needs to be objective evidence that consumers, in


fact, identify the accused mark with the famous mark.  In


other words, we say that section 43(c)(1) of the FTDA in 

its words causes dilution, imposes a causal connection


between the accused mark and the beneficiary.


QUESTION:  All right, excuse me, before you go


back to cause, which is your main point which I want to


hear, I do -- I'm assuming now that for purposes of this


case anyway, you concede that tarnishment is part.  If you


don't concede that, or even if you do, will you please


explain as well what this -- what it is, what the injury


is where you're talking about a lessening of capacity to


identify and distinguish, what injury is that, if it is

not tarnishment?


MR. HIGGINS:  Okay.  The injury in a dilution


case is focused, the courts agree, on the selling power of


the famous mark and the way that the cases go is that


everyone agrees that that selling power is the hook that


the famous mark --


QUESTION:  Okay, then please explain, putting


tarnishment to the side -- there is no tarnishment,


assume -- how does the fact that you have a tiny, totally


separate product with the same name ever, ever hurt the


selling power of the big famous name?


MR. HIGGINS:  The question becomes, again, one


of consumer perception.  All of that is tied up into the


gist of the FTDA.  What is being protected is the selling


power of the famous mark -- which the Fourth Circuit in 

Ringling Brothers referred to as the economic value of a


trademark -- and I would agree with you, Justice Breyer,


that if there is no injury there should be --


QUESTION:  No, I don't understand conceptually


how there ever could be an injury.  I've got to understand


that first, and the reason is, I can imagine an injury


through tarnishment.  I can imagine an injury where the


big product, Kodak, intends to enter the small area, the


Kodak -- whatever, monkey wrench -- and it is intending to


enter and draw on the selling power of, everyone thinks

Kodak is good, so I can think of those two things, but


where they don't intend to enter, where there's no


tarnishment, what, in principle, is the harm that you say


we have to show really exists?  Unless I know what that is


in principle, I can't tell if you're right.


MR. HIGGINS:  It -- it would show whether or not


consumers would now identify a single mark with two


different sources, and -- and that is the essence of what


trademark dilution by the circuit court --


QUESTION:  All right, and that is harmed


because?


MR. HIGGINS:  The theory is -- with which we


don't totally agree -- the theory is that consumers are


used to seeing only one Kodak, and now they see two, and


the theory is that that is the -- among a number of 

metaphors, that is the first of a thousand cuts that will


lead to harm.


Now, our difficulty with that is that not every,


even identical use of the same trademark ultimately leads


to the dilution --


QUESTION:  Well, do you say that actual


confusion is relevant to the dilution analysis?


MR. HIGGINS:  Actual confusion is primarily a --


a Lanham Act infringement concept.


QUESTION:  So it's not, in your view, relevant

to the dilution?


MR. HIGGINS:  If there were actual confusion, it


might be relevant, but this case --


QUESTION:  In this case, the other -- the Lanham


Act was thrown out, in effect.


MR. HIGGINS:  That's the main point of this


case, is that the Court has ruled as a matter of law that


these accused marks by our clients are not going to lead


to confusion.  It is --


QUESTION:  And you say that actual confusion


doesn't matter, then, for purposes of this statute, the


dilution statute, or it could?


MR. HIGGINS:  I say that it could in some


circumstances.  It's not involved in this case at all.


QUESTION:  All right, now --


QUESTION:  You -- you -- go ahead.


QUESTION:  Then what about actual economic harm? 


Is that a requirement, in your view, under this statute --


MR. HIGGINS:  We think that --


QUESTION:  -- for the plaintiff?


MR. HIGGINS:  We think that the plaintiff in a 


dilution case needs to show objective proof of dilution,


and that necessarily has an economic component with it.


QUESTION:  Well, but the statute does not, in


defining dilution, speak in terms of economic harm, does

it?


MR. HIGGINS:  The statute does not mention


economic harm per se, but it does say, the lessening of


the capacity of the famous mark to identify and


distinguish and, focusing on the selling power of the


mark, we say the best evidence that would be adduced in a


case of dilution is surveys of consumer perceptions of the


impact of --


QUESTION:  That's the best evidence.  That's the


best evidence, but let's go back to what is -- causes


dilution?  One can distinguish what the Patent and


Trademark Office does.  That is, it considers marks before


they're in use, so one might say, oh, the distinction


between causes dilution and likely to cause is, likely,


you're looking at the thing before it's ever used.  Once


it's used, you're into the causes territory.  That would


be a nice clean line to say that all that it means, all


that the difference in phraseology, causes dilution as


opposed to likely to cause, is, did it have -- a causation


case, you have to have a junior mark that's in use, so why


isn't that a satisfactory line between what's -- what


causes dilution as opposed to what is likely to cause


dilution?


MR. HIGGINS:  We think that is not a completely


satisfactory distinction because of the language of the

statute that authorizes the Patent and Trademark Office to


look at a mark before it begins.


QUESTION:  Yes, well, that's likely to.  They


can't judge it, because it's not -- it's not in use.


MR. HIGGINS:  And the statute actually says


that.  Section --


QUESTION:  But I'm asking you, getting out of


that territory, it can look at things before they're in


use, and now that -- now the junior mark is in use, why


isn't that enough to satisfy the dilution act?


MR. HIGGINS:  Well, we would agree that the


mark, the junior mark has to be in use, but we would not


agree that just by merely using a mark that is


semantically similar to the famous mark, that dilution


will inevitably result, which is the position of the 

respondents here.


QUESTION:  But the one thing I think you're


asking for beyond Justice Ginsburg's example is, to take


the Kodak wrench and the Kodak camera, you're asking for


some proof that somebody heard the word Kodak and said,


was it the camera or the wrench? -- and if that proof


exists you've got your objective proof, and why do you


have to go to the point of saying that -- proving that


Kodak lost a sale as a result?


MR. HIGGINS:  We don't suggest that we have to

prove that Kodak lost sales.


QUESTION:  But you're -- you're asking for proof


of some kind of --


QUESTION:  That's the point of this, for


heaven's sake.


QUESTION:  -- of economic consequence, and --


MR. HIGGINS:  We think --


QUESTION:  -- I -- that's the point that I don't


see.  If I understand it, the dilution occurs when -- or


that dilution is the process of lessening the capacity of


Kodak to identify the camera rather than to identify the


wrench.  If -- if it is shown that that process has


begun -- that it is occurring -- why do you -- what is the


point of your argument that it has got to be carried


forward to the point of an economic loss of some sort? 

MR. HIGGINS:  Well, first of all we believe that


consumer surveys do have evidence of economic impact, and


we don't say that economic damage is required.  That takes


our position too far.  The actual question that is


certified is whether the plaintiff must show objective


evidence of harm to the economic value of the famous mark,


not that it must show economic harm per se.


I realize that's subtle distinction --


QUESTION:  Well, isn't there -- under the terms


of the statute, isn't that shown simply by the fact that

the consumer stops for a second and says, is it the


camera, or is it the wrench when the consumer hears the


word, Kodak?


MR. HIGGINS:  I don't --


QUESTION:  What further proof of loss of -- what


further economic proof is required to come within the


statute?


MR. HIGGINS:  That is not a complete economic


proof.  What we say is that not every, even identical use


leads to dilution in the minds of consumers.  Think of --


as we put in our brief -- Delta Airlines, Delta Faucets. 


Think of Apple Records, Apple Computers.


QUESTION:  Maybe because those are names that


are generic, like apple.


MR. HIGGINS: 


Well then, how about Ford Motor 

Company and Ford Modeling Agency?  You know, that's the


same result.


QUESTION:  How about Kodak Pianos?


MR. HIGGINS:  Kodak Pianos is in the legislative


history as --


QUESTION:  Or Dupont Shoes, or Buick Aspirin?


MR. HIGGINS:  All of those are identical marks,


and we say that this case presents a non-identical mark. 


There are semantic differences and there are gender


differences.

 QUESTION:  Well, there is evidence -- or, at


least, how did this all get started?  Someone sees


Victor's Secret and writes to Victoria's Secret and says,


you want to stop these people, so we know that one


consumer, although he wasn't confused, said, they're


diluting your mark.  Now, suppose you had 12 of those who


said, yeah, I passed this shop, Victor's Secret, and I


thought immediately of Victoria's Secret.  Would that


proof be sufficient and if not, why not?


MR. HIGGINS:  We say it is not sufficient,


because the -- but that is essentially the analysis that


the Sixth Circuit put in there.  The Sixth Circuit said at


page 27a of the petition, the appendix to the petition,


that they are focusing on what a consumer is, quote,


"likely automatically to think," unquote, and then link 

that to the famous mark.


QUESTION:  And what's your answer?  What's


your --


MR. HIGGINS:  What our position is, that that


requires a court to guess whether the association that the


consumer thinks of is 


-- 

QUESTION:  What do you want?  What do you want


in place of that?


MR. HIGGINS:  What we would like --

show?


MR. HIGGINS:  We want the plaintiff to show that


there is objective proof of consumer perceptions that it


causes dilution, exactly what the statute says.


QUESTION:  I don't know -- what does that mean,


of consumer perceptions that causes dilution?  Objective


proof that a particular consumer, when he saw Victoria's


Little Secret -- or Victor's Little Secret -- had in mind,


gee, you know, that's like Victoria's Secret.  Is that


enough?


MR. HIGGINS:  No, that's not enough.  That's --


QUESTION:  What is enough?  What is enough? 


What does dilution consist of?


MR. HIGGINS:  Dilution consists of a


consumer's -- the -- general consumers, not a single 

consumer, but general consumer perception that there used


to be one Victoria's Secret and now, in their minds, there


are at least two.


QUESTION:  Well, how many consumers do you need? 


You say one isn't enough , and you say general consumer


perception.  I mean, if you had 20 people would that be


enough?


MR. HIGGINS:  Well, the -- the record and the


briefs reveal some articles by trademark scholars who


discussed --

 QUESTION:  Yes, but I was asking you a


particular question.  Would 20 be enough?


MR. HIGGINS:  I don't think so, Your Honor.  You


know, this -- we live in an age when consumer surveys,


voter surveys, public opinion surveys are done over a


weekend, and in this situation that is the kind of survey


that we would suggest.


QUESTION:  And what do you ask these consumers? 


How many Kodaks are there?  Is that what you want to ask


them?


MR. HIGGINS:  No, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  What?


MR. HIGGINS:  You ask them the scientifically


designed question.


QUESTION:  Which is?


MR. HIGGINS:  Which is, you know, do you think


of another famous mark, and do you believe -- as the law


review article suggests -- do you believe such things as


whether or not the new entrant had to get permission from


the famous mark in order to market this product.


QUESTION:  Well, that -- most consumers wouldn't


even understand that question.


(Laughter.)


MR. HIGGINS:  And that's -- that's part of our


point, Your Honor.  If --

 QUESTION:  This sounds like a lawyer's dream.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  But it seems to me that the owner of


the senior mark is entitled to more protection than that. 


I -- I just want to make clear, you do not contest that


tarnishment is a -- a basis for the respondent to prevail


in this case?


MR. HIGGINS:  We do not.


QUESTION:  All right.


MR. HIGGINS:  As -- per se.  What we say is that


there is --


QUESTION:  I -- I don't know why you need


sophisticated, so-called sophisticated polls to determine


whether there's tarnishment.


MR. HIGGINS: 


Because, remember, this case is a 

statute that is wholly different than the common law.  It


has no common law antecedent.  It is granting property


rights through Congress' action under the alleged use of


the Commerce Clause, and we say those property rights that


are being granted by this statute create rights that go


well beyond any trade area --


QUESTION:  It's not just beyond, I would have


thought that -- you don't make a point of it, so I might


be wrong -- there's a pretty significant speech


interest on -- on your side of the case.  That is, if this

statute gets out of hand, advertising is part of --


whether we like it or not -- our children's, anyway, daily


communications, and all of a sudden, if there's no real


harm you're going to cut off what people can say in


commercial contexts.


Now, you don't make much a point of that, so


don't let me put words in your mouth.  Explain it to me.


(Laughter.)


MR. HIGGINS:  We did mention that in our briefs,


but the primary people who are positing that position here


are the amici, who represent the public interest, and the


main point about this FTDA is that, other than bumping up


against the First Amendment, there really isn't a public


interest that is being expressed or applied here.


QUESTION: 


Well, why -- why isn't there a public 

interest in not having some organization like yours simply


copy another person's name?


MR. HIGGINS:  Well, we -- if there is that


situation, then that would be a case of trademark


infringement or copyright infringement.  This case does


not involve -- this case does not involve --


QUESTION:  No, Congress has gone further here


and said you can't simply copy someone else's name.  Now,


you say there's no -- maybe Congress shouldn't have done


it, maybe it hasn't done it, but to say there's no public

interest at all on that side doesn't make much sense to


me.  I mean, you -- you don't come -- your client doesn't


come off well in this case.


MR. HIGGINS:  Well, there is a public interest,


but that is addressed primarily on the free speech aspect


of things.  We would agree with that.  The problem with


this case is that it requires courts to speculate whether


the beginning of a semantically similar mark is going to


inevitably lead to dilution, and that's contrary to the


words that Congress used.


QUESTION:  You started off saying dilution,


you -- to show dilution, you had to show economic harm. 


That I can understand.  You produce evidence that -- of


some economic harm.  That is now not your position.  I


don't understand what your position is. 


If it is not a 

showing of economic harm, you know, the -- the mark is


worth so much less than it was, what precisely do you want


to show?  I truly don't understand.

 QUESTION:  I don't understand what it is that


you do demand.  What?


MR. HIGGINS:  We do demand that the plaintiffs


show that our mark is harming theirs in a dilution way,


that it does lessen the capacity of that mark to identify


and distinguish its goods or services, and that's best


done by consumer surveys.


Your Honor, if I may reserve the balance of my


time.


QUESTION:  Very well.  Very well, Mr. Higgins.


Mr. Wallace, we'll hear from you.


Mr. Wallace, our records reflect that this is


your 157th argument before the Court in the 34 years you


have been an attorney in the Office of the Solicitor


General. 


Some years ago, you eclipsed the 20th Century 

record of 140 arguments.  I understand that you will soon


retire from Government service, so on behalf of the Court


I extend to you our appreciation for your many years of


quality advocacy and dedicated service in the Solicitor's


Office -- Solicitor General's Office -- on behalf of the


United States.  That doesn't mean we're going to rule in


your favor.

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. WALLACE:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chief


Justice, and may it please the Court:


What constitutes dilution, other than the


abstraction of the statutory definition perhaps is


reflected a bit in the examples we've given of consumer


surveys that might be used to produce evidence in a case


of this nature.  If consumers were asked what products do


you associate with the name Victoria's Secret, and those


who were aware of Victor's Little Secret answered it


substantially differently and included items found only in


that store and not in Victoria's Secret stores, or what


attributes do you associate with Victoria's Secret, and


those aware of Victor's Secret were more apt to say


tasteless rather than tasteful, which would -- might be 

the response from those familiar with Victoria's Secret.


QUESTION:  What if the answer was simply, I'm


not sure any more?  Would that show that dilution had


occurred?


MR. WALLACE:  It -- it might.  All of these -- I


mean, we don't take the position that a consumer survey is


necessary in order to prove a case in the first place, but


I think the way a survey would be designed and what the


answers would show is illustrative of what constitutes


dilution.

 QUESTION:  But you -- you would get that answer


from a consumer if you asked them about the word, Delta,


what products do you associate with the word, Delta, and


the consumer would say, airplanes, or air -- you know, air


travel and faucets, and there wouldn't be any dilution


there, would there?


MR. WALLACE:  Not unless their -- a conclusion


could be drawn based on other factors that --


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. WALLACE:  -- a mark had established a


certain distinctiveness that is associated only with the


particular mark, and now that is being blurred.


QUESTION:  Well, I believe -- are you saying


that the Delta example is only good now, and that when the


person who made Delta Faucets first came out with a faucet 

that he called Delta, or Delta Airline -- I don't know who


came first -- the chicken or the egg, the airline or the


faucet.  Whoever had the name first, are you saying that


when somebody used the name Delta that the senior user of


Delta could have excluded the faucet-maker from -- from


Delta?


MR. WALLACE:  Only under the Federal dilution


statute of '95 if the mark is a famous mark, and in the


Toro case that we cite, the --


QUESTION:  So I can't even have Delta Peanuts?

Once Delta is famous, just for air travel, I can't use


Delta for anything else?  That would automatically violate


the Federal statute?


MR. WALLACE:  Well, not automatically, but if --


QUESTION:  All you have to do is find a consumer


who knows of Delta Peanuts and says, you know, what do you


associate the name Delta with, and he says, airlines and


peanuts?


MR. WALLACE:  Well, that would involve an exact


replication of the mark, which are the only examples given


in the House report or in the legislative history, such as


Kodak Pianos.  Most of the cases, however, are about


similar marks rather than exact replications, and those


are much more problematical to ascertain whether there is


the kind of effect we're -- the act is concerned with. 

QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, at least in some of the


circuits, I'm not sure in the cases of this Court, correct


me if I'm wrong, I thought that in trademark infringement


cases, that the circuit court said that they have certain


de novo authority.  Historical facts are clearly


erroneous, but the conclusions that you draw from the


historical facts give them certain powers of de novo


review.  That's the prevailing rule in many of the


circuits, is it not --


MR. WALLACE:  Yes.

 QUESTION:  -- in infringement cases, and


shouldn't that same rule be applied here?  I mean, judges


have the capacity in the trademark area, I should think,


to know what dilution is or is not if we have certain


historical facts.  I don't know why you need to survey. 


The Bugwiser-Budweiser example.  I mean, you don't have to


be too tricky a judge to figure out that this is very


harmful.


MR. WALLACE:  It is very difficult.  We don't


say that a survey is needed.  There are other factors that


are looked to, including --


QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, may I ask you something


to clarify the Government's position on this?  As I've


been listening to the argument, Mr. Higgins says you look


to see, he said, if before you thought there was one 

Victoria's Secret, now you thought there were two.  He's


suggesting that the association -- it's not what you think


of when you see Victor's Secret.  When you see Victor's


Secret, of course you're going to think of Victoria's, but


what counts is, when you think of Victoria's Secret, do


you think of Victor's.  That's -- that's what dilution is,


and if it's the latter, then it's -- those are two very


different things, aren't they?


MR. WALLACE:  Yes.  Dilution is about dilution


of the famous mark and its capacity to distinguish the

particular goods or services, but we think the court of


appeals was wrong in saying that mere mental association


of the two marks by consumers automatically results in


dilution.


QUESTION:  But the court of appeals was going


on, when you think of Victor's you think of Victoria's. 


I'm asking you, is the right question -- is the necessary


question of the customers -- when you think of Victoria's,


do you think of Victor?


MR. WALLACE:  I think the -- the question is not


do you think of Victor's, but when you think of


Victoria's, do you think of more than what Victoria's


Secret --


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. WALLACE: 


-- itself has as its merchandise 

and image.  Is their name now associated with a different


type of product that may change their renown or cachet


with customers.


QUESTION:  Is there -- what is the extra -- I'm


not -- if you're finished with that question, I'd like


to -- which I think there's a lot to.  Is -- what is


particularly the harm?  Is it just that the customer


thinks -- either customer -- thinks of the other even if


there's no specific tarnishment, and there's no general


tarnishment?  That is, people associate Buick with a good

car, and we can measure whether that's identical before


and identical after, and it is, so there's no general


tarnishment, there's no bug example tarnishment, there's


nothing but the fact that on Justice Ginsburg's question,


both sides say yes.


Now, is that harm under this statute?  Is that


dilution, or isn't it?


MR. WALLACE:  We don't believe that in itself


constitutes dilution if there is none of the damage to the


ability of the mark.  The --


QUESTION:  All right, so -- so the ability of


the mark consists either of my bug example, or some


general weakening of the goodness that inheres in the


name.  Anything else?


MR. WALLACE: 


Well, yes -- no, I think --

QUESTION:  No, okay --


MR. WALLACE:  I think the Fourth --


QUESTION:  The answer's no.


MR. WALLACE:  The Fourth Circuit case of


Ringling Brothers was very illustrative.  People might


associate Utah's use of Greatest Snow on Earth with


Ringling Brothers' use of Greatest Show on Earth, but if


they keep the two distinct in their minds, even though


they recognize that it's a play on the same words, but


they think the two trademarks refer to different products

and services, then there -- no harm is done to Ringling


Brothers as the Fourth Circuit held, and the Fourth


Circuit even suggested that perhaps they even benefit from


having people think additionally of their mark.  That's a


question on which the Patent and Trademark Office has not


taken a view, but the harm has to be that consumers are --


are diminished in their capacity to recognize the mark


that is the famous mark that's being protected.


QUESTION:  That's -- but that's confusion.  I


mean, if -- if there's confusion, you don't need this new


law.  I thought that it was the case that if you come out


with a Kodak Piano, even if nobody in the world thinks


that Kodak, the photography company has anything to do


with Kodak Piano, the mark has nonetheless been


diminished.  Isn't that right?


MR. WALLACE:  That's true, at least when it's an


identical mark, or one that's so confusingly similar --


QUESTION:  But that goes to the very point


you've just been talking about, and contradicts what


you've said.  It doesn't matter whether there's any


confusion or not, you can't use Kodak.


MR. WALLACE:  There -- there has to be confusion


as to the mark, rather than as to the source of the


product.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Wallace.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER E. DELLINGER, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. DELLINGER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The question on which the Court granted


certiorari was whether the plaintiff must demonstrate that


it has already suffered economic injury as a precondition


to any and all relief under the 1996 act.  The text of the


act answers that question, and answers it no.  There's


simply no such requirement included in the statute.


QUESTION:  Well, it -- I mean, that's to some


extent a play on words.  It depends on what you mean, has


actually suffered economic injury.  What your opposing


counsel says now is that all he means by, has actually 

suffered economic injury, is, has suffered dilution, has


actually suffered dilution of the mark, which, of course,


entails economic injury.  If the mark is diluted, the mark


was worth a lot, and it's now diluted, there's economic


injury.  Now --


MR. DELLINGER:  Justice Scalia, we agree that


the act requires a showing of actual, present dilution,


and that such a showing was, in fact, made below.  What is


dilution?  A number of you have asked that question.  It's


best understood in light of the fact that this is a very

narrow statute that only protects a few very famous marks. 


I do not think, for example, Justice Scalia, that Delta


would qualify as a famous mark because it has been used so


often in other third party uses.  The --


QUESTION:  But what about the first time it was


used either for -- what is it, the airline, and what's --


faucets?  Whichever came first.  What about the first time


it was used for the second product?


MR. DELLINGER:  Then it would not suffer the


disqualification that would come as to what is present --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. DELLINGER:  -- about proliferating uses. 


Whether it would otherwise satisfy that would remain to be


seen.  I think that the Court can, and the courts can


narrow the application of this statute by taking very 

seriously the requirement that it has to be a truly famous


mark that has.


Take the example that was given to the House --


QUESTION:  Well, let's -- and keep it so I can


understand it.  Let's assume the first use was Delta


Airlines.  Everybody recognizes Delta Airlines.  Somebody


starts advertising Delta Faucets.  Was Delta Airlines


famous enough --


MR. DELLINGER:  I don't know --


QUESTION:  -- on your criterion?

 MR. DELLINGER:  -- on those facts.  I'd have to


know whether, if -- as it is today, yes, I would think if


it --


QUESTION:  All right.  Let's assume it's famous


enough.  The ads start going out in the magazines for


Delta Faucets.  There is no proof that Delta Airlines has


suffered any tangible damage at this point, but there is


proof, let's assume from a survey of magazine readers,


that when they see the word, Delta, standing by itself,


they're not sure who the source of the product is.  Is


that dilution?


MR. DELLINGER:  If they're not sure who's the


source of the product, it may be infringement, and the


reason I resist the use of Delta is that a lot goes into a


determination of whether -- as it did in this case -- as 

to whether a mark has those special qualities that mean


that the second or junior user and the third, fourth, and


fifth are lessening its capacity to communicate these very


distinctive ideas.


The example used in the House report was


Tiffany's, for example.  We all know that if another


jewelry store starts as Tiffany's you've got an


infringement claim, because consumers would be confused,


but as the House was told, what about a Tiffany's


Restaurant, and that means that Tiffany's used to stand

for one thing, it now stands for two, but here's the


absolute heart of the matter, where the FDA comes into


play.


QUESTION:  That was bad?  I mean, you see, I am


so far behind understanding you that I don't know whether


you have just asserted that that's obviously bad.  I think


you have.  Tiffany's Restaurant is bad.


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. DELLINGER:  I have, and --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  And the difference between Tiffany's


Restaurants and Delta Faucets is what?


MR. DELLINGER:  There may be no difference.  I'm


assuming that both -- if you assume that both Delta and 

Tiffany's are famous marks.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. DELLINGER:  But here's why Delta Faucets and


Tiffany's -- if the original marks are famous -- both


constitute the harm of dilution.  Dilution --


QUESTION:  You mean, just using the name?


MR. DELLINGER:  Just using the name --


QUESTION:  Is likelihood of dilution enough?


MR. DELLINGER:  No, not under the act, and --


and nor is just using the name enough, nor is just

semantic similarity.  You have to make out the statutory


proof that it actually --


QUESTION:  That it causes dilution for


everybody --


MR. DELLINGER:  It causes dilution, and


dilution --


QUESTION:  Is expressed --


MR. DELLINGER:  It's creating a mental


association.  Similarity is not enough.  But take an


example that shows how critically important stopping the


first use is.  If you can have a Tiffany's Restaurant,


then you can also have a Tiffany Shoe Store, a Tiffany Pet


Store.  Very soon Tiffany's no longer --


QUESTION:  Where will it all end?


MR. DELLINGER: 


Where will it all end? 

(Laughter.)


MR. DELLINGER:  That is exactly --


QUESTION:  Well, so what?  So what?  I mean, I


don't say so what facetiously.  I say so what to get you


to identify the harm specifically that that's likely to


bring about to the first owner.


MR. DELLINGER:  Exactly.  The -- what Congress


saw as the harm, Justice Breyer, for truly famous marks,


to quote from the House report itself, is that dilution


applies when the unauthorized use of the famous mark

reduces the public's perception that the mark signifies


something unique, singular, or particular, so that


Rolls-Royce, which once stood for one thing, once it's on


100 products or 1,000 products no longer identifies and


distinguishes --


QUESTION:  No longer identifies one thing.  It


now identifies a thousand things, and that, of course, is


true by definition, and what I'm trying to get at is, why


is that bad?


MR. DELLINGER:  Congress determined that that


was bad because --


QUESTION:  Just automatically?  Oh, no, go


ahead.  Why?


MR. DELLINGER:  Congress determined that that


was bad to the extent that the mark no longer stood for 

something singular or particular, no longer conveyed --


QUESTION:  Then again, that's just another way


of repeating the same thing, and the reason that I think


it's important is, perhaps we can survive with only having


one Tiffany's, but let's think of some slogans out of my


youth, you know.  It floats.  99 and 44/100th percent


pure.  The beforehand lotion, whatever that meant.  I'm


just repeating slogans from old radio programs, and the


reason that I'm doing it is because I want you to see


immediately, as soon as you depart from a word like

Tiffany's, which is totally arbitrary or fanciful, and you


get into actual advertising slogans, you will tie up free


speech in lawsuits like mad, and that's what's worrying


me.


MR. DELLINGER:  No, I do not -- it is not at all


the case.  Congress made it clear that safe harbors were


to extend a wide --


QUESTION:  Yes, the safe harbor is fair use.


MR. DELLINGER:  And it --


QUESTION:  Fair use, and that's what's again


worrying me, because those two words, fair use to me spell


lawyers, lawsuits, uncertainty and confusion.


MR. DELLINGER:  If you lose distinctiveness,


what you lose is the selling power of the mark. 


Rolls-Royce stands for something important.  It conveys


something that consumers -- it signals to consumers. 


Rolls-Royce is very careful about what products it


allows to --


QUESTION:  Chevrolet doesn't matter.  You can


use Chevrolet, because that's --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  Is that right?  Or Edsel, even


easier -- yes.


(Laughter.)

you look at whether a mark is famous -- and in this case,


it's simply not contested.  This is a mark that comes in


behind Levi's and ahead of Rolex on the -- on the list,


but when you contest that, you do look at a number of


factors, so you can't stand here and pick out any one, and


that's a -- that's an important gatekeeping function to


narrow this statute.


Now --


QUESTION:  When you say it signifies something


distinctive, you don't mean that Buick signifies cars, you


don't mean that Tiffany's signifies jewelry, you don't


mean that Rolls-Royce signifies sedans, right?


MR. DELLINGER:  Not just that, but a certain


mark and quality and kind of product is exemplified, and


that's what makes a mark famous. 
 It gives it this. 

Now, if -- we know that these marks have value. 


When -- when companies are acquired, often as much as


four-fifths of the value may go to use that name.  That is


something quite valuable, Justice Breyer, and its value is


going to be lost --


QUESTION:  Fine.  Why not --


MR. DELLINGER:  -- if there are a thousand


different ones.


QUESTION:  Why not require some proof of that? 


That is, some proof that this mark -- which not only

identifies a wonderful car, but now has come to stand for


wonderfulness in general -- some proof that because


somebody's using it on a tricycle, that people think it's


a little less wonderful.


Now, that's not -- that's hard to prove one way


or the other, but not -- I mean, requires some reason for


thinking that.


QUESTION:  So Pepsodent would lose, or, you


know, just some -- some product --


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.  Yes.


QUESTION:  That's just a -- you know, it's an


ordinary product.  How can you have an absolutely


wonderful toothpaste?


QUESTION:  Oh, no, you can.  You can.


QUESTION: 
 There's no Tiffany of toothpastes, 

right?


(Laughter.)


MR. DELLINGER:  There is no --


QUESTION:  So we're only talking about


Tiffany's, Rolls-Royce, a couple of other really, really


quality names.  Is that what the statute was directed at?


MR. DELLINGER:  I believe that is the case,


Justice Scalia, that --

Cadillac and Chevrolet, do you?  Chevrolet would have just

much cachet --


MR. DELLINGER:  No, I think they would be on


similar footing, and Chevrolet has its own kind of appeal. 


It appeals to -- for those of us who live in NASCAR


country, there is sometimes a more appealing image to


Chevrolet than to Cadillac.  I don't mean to make value


judgments.


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Dellinger, why isn't it


useful to think in terms of whether there's proof of some


diminution of value of the mark?


MR. DELLINGER:  That is a very good question,


and that is Justice Breyer's question for --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. DELLINGER:  We believe that obviously the


mark does suffer in value if you make out the finding of 

dilution.  The Fourth Circuit would require you show


actual --


QUESTION:  Well, you -- you wouldn't think we


should just presume a diminution in value, would you,


because the mark is similar?


MR. DELLINGER:  No, but what you -- what you


presume is that the economic injury that you're talking of


may not be identifiable -- often would not be


identifiable -- until it's too late to rectify the harm


that has been done.  If you think of -- we usually use as

examples where there is one other competing user.


What faces the sort of in-house intellectual


property counsel for a company with a famous mark is that


there are users popping up all over the country all of the


time, so that if the first user, say Victor's Little


Secret, exists in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, and if you


can't show that that alone produces the kind of harm


you're looking -- or that your question would imply one


might be looking for -- how can you stop the second, the


third, the 500th use?


At what point -- there's no privilege for the


first user, so that by the -- here's what would happen. 


By the time you could show economic damage to the harm,


first of all as a matter of law you might have lost the


status as a famous mark because there are all those users 

out there.


Secondly, the -- it is not clear why you would


prohibit the 500th user of the mark, the 500th different


kind of store when you allowed the first 499 to go on, so


that -- you ask the question of whether, at present, this


use lessens the capacity of that mark to identify and


distinguish.


QUESTION:  Focusing on the present, suppose I'm


a trial judge, and this case comes to me in the pretrial


conference stage, and I say, you know, it does seem to me

that this second -- this junior user is going to tarnish


the image of -- of the senior user.  Is that all I need to


say, and then I -- what do I put down when I write an


opinion so that the circuit court can review my thinking? 


I mean, what -- what do I put down?


MR. DELLINGER:  Well, I think this case is a


very good example, because you have a court which goes


through a list of factors to reach a conclusion.  The


opinion is rather short, but that's because the conclusion


in this case is so close to being a core example of the


statute.  They -- they mention the fact that it's a very


distinctive mark, the degree of similarity, the proximity


of the product lines helping to create that association,


the shared customers -- 39,000 catalogues distributed in


Elizabethtown. 
 The suggestion is there are some --

QUESTION:  39,000 in Elizabethtown?


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.  There are 39,000


Victoria's Secret catalogues distributed in Elizabethtown,


Kentucky in 1998.


QUESTION:  What's the population of


Elizabethtown?


(Laughter.)


MR. DELLINGER:  That is a good question, but


I -- four, he says, but I think that's his guess.  We


don't know.  I --

there, particularly if it's a --


QUESTION:  So what do I -- would this be


appropriate for a summary -- would you urge me to take


this on summary judgment?  I --


MR. DELLINGER:  Absolutely, just as I think you


could, Justice Kennedy --


QUESTION:  All I need to know is the number of


catalogues, how well-known the mark is, and that's it?


MR. DELLINGER:  What you have to --


QUESTION:  And then my own judgment as to what


tarnishment is?


MR. DELLINGER: 


No, because here you have --

here you have an actual association.  What you have in


this case, for example, that the judge relies upon, is not


a survey.  It's proved by actual consumers.


QUESTION:  Well, but suppose right here, to take


this case, that the people who go to Victor's who have


ever heard of it honestly do not believe the less in any


respect whatsoever of Victoria's Little Secret, and the


people who use Victoria's Little -- I mean, why should


they? -- and the people who use -- go to Victoria's Little


Secret have never heard of Victor's, so you -- why -- why

QUESTION:  You're confusing the marks.


QUESTION:  Now, why -- I  understand you're


confusing the marks.  No, you're not confusing the marks. 


No.  I'm -- he's saying I'm confusing the marks.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  But I -- did I have it backwards?


QUESTION:  Yes, you did. 


QUESTION:  Not Little -- all right.  The people


who go -- no, the customers of Victor's do associate


Victor's with Victoria, but they think nonetheless of


Victoria.  They might even think more of Victoria.  I


don't know what they think, but it's not negative in any


respect, and the people who go to Victoria's, to use


Justice Ginsburg's example, don't care, or don't know, or 

they've never heard of Victor's, so although there is --


in a subset of people -- an association of the name, there


is no harm of any sort whatsoever, and they will prove


that.  Should they not have the opportunity to prove it?


MR. DELLINGER:  Justice Breyer, Congress simply


did not agree that no harm has been done when the famous


mark loses its singularity, and remember, if there can be


one store under Victoria's -- under Victor's Little Secret


in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, there can be a thousand


opening the Monday after Superbowl Sunday.

 QUESTION:  So then in your view, anyone who


starts going around for a commercial reason and using the


two words, it floats -- it floats -- where they want


people to think of Ivory Soap, they are open to a lawsuit,


and they have to rely on a fair use defense, or are there


other defenses?


MR. DELLINGER:  The --


QUESTION:  Is my example wrong?


MR. DELLINGER:  Well, it's -- your example is


that there is a -- you're suggesting a mere mental


association.  I'm not sure your --


QUESTION:  Well, in a commercial context -- in a


commercial context where people are polled --


MR. DELLINGER:  Secondly, I am not -- by no


means -- it would take a lot to persuade me that it floats 

is a truly famous mark deserving of this protection, but


Congress believed that the harm is that if you have a


mark, and Congress identified marks like Buick Aspirin,


but if you -- the very harm Congress sought to prevent is,


when a mark stands for one thing -- this narrow set of


truly famous marks -- and you have replicating uses, it is


no longer going to stand for anything in your mind, and


Congress believed, and the market reflects, that that is a


true loss.

show, as the Fourth Circuit would require, an actual


revenue loss, you can't unring the bell, particularly with


tarnishment.  If someone opened up --


QUESTION:  Mr. Dellinger, can I just clarify,


then, it doesn't make any difference that this particular


shop happens to sell sex toys.  It could just as well --


Victor's Secret could sell men's underwear and your


argument would still be the same, am I right?  So we get


out the tawdriness or the disparagement or the


tarnishment.  It's just -- it's a store, it sells


underwear, men's underwear, and it's got the label,


Victor's Secret.


MR. DELLINGER:  Justice Ginsburg, I don't


entirely agree with that.  We do believe that the dilution


of the Victoria's Secret name through blurring would be 

sufficient, but in this case, you don't have to rely upon


that, because the court below did find that there was


tarnishment when a name not only ceases to stand for one


thing, but is associated --


QUESTION:  But how does tarnishment fit the


language of the statute?  That's what --


QUESTION:  Yes, I'd like to know that, too.  I


don't see how tarnishment -- you know --


QUESTION:  Does that lessen the capacity of the


mark to identify --

 MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, it does, and the --


QUESTION:  I thought it just changed the


reaction to the mark, rather than lessening -- I mean, you


know, you have an unfavorable reaction, rather than not


knowing what you're talking about.


MR. DELLINGER:  Let me just quote you from the


treatise, one sentence from the McCarthy treatise.  One of


the classic functions of a trademark is to signify that


all goods and services sold under the mark are of equal


quality, or of a special quality.  That is part of


identifying and distinguishing a mark.  It -- the capacity


is lessened.  It lessens the capacity to identify and


distinguish a particular mark when that mark is tarnished


by what the trial court found some customers would find to


be an unsavory association.


QUESTION:  I don't understand -- you can say it,


but I don't understand it.  I can still identify and


distinguish Victoria's Secret, but I just think less of


it.


MR. DELLINGER:  Well, --


QUESTION:  It -- it doesn't -- any -- it isn't


any less identifiable.


MR. DELLINGER:  Justice Scalia, I think you're


misstating the statute.

 MR. DELLINGER:  It's not whether you can


identify and distinguish.  It's whether the mark's --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. DELLINGER:  -- capacity to identify and


distinguish is lessened, and if it no longer stands in


one's mind --


QUESTION:  I'll take that.


MR. DELLINGER:  If it no longer stands in one's


mind, or in the mind and the public perception for the


same connotation of quality as it did before the


association with the unsavory image, its capacity to


identify and distinguish that quality has lessened, but


moreover --


QUESTION:  But you have to add the word quality


to the statute.


QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  The statute doesn't contain that


word.


MR. DELLINGER:  The statute uses dilution,


Justice Stevens, as a term of art, and nothing could be


clearer than that Congress thought that term of art,


dilution, encompassed both blurring and tarnishment, as I


think --

Scalia --


QUESTION:  Nothing could be clearer than that


Congress adopted a definition of what -- of what dilution


consists of and, to my mind, that definition does not at


all cover disparaging the other product.


MR. DELLINGER:  Well, it -- Congress thought


otherwise.  The House report says that the definition --


QUESTION:  The House committee thought


otherwise.


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  What Congress thought was the


definition that Congress adopted.


MR. DELLINGER:  And the definition of lessening


the capacity encompasses that, but in any event, since


blurring is still present, this is thought to be an easy 

case by the courts below, for -- for good reason.  If you


imagine hundreds of different users of the Victor's Little


Secret mark, the uniqueness, the quality, the public's


perception is going to be lessened.


Congress further -- to go back to a question


asked by Justice Breyer -- made it absolutely clear that


it wanted the safe harbors read as broadly as possible to


ensure that there was no restriction on First Amendment


rights, so the courts are warmly invited to create as


large a safe harbor for parody.  This is a case in which

we have blurring, we have tarnishment, which is a near


subset of blurring, but the courts below looked at the


direct customer testimony.


Colonel Baker, the Judge Advocate -- Staff Judge


Advocate at Fort Knox -- looks at a Victor's Little Secret


ad in the base newspaper and writes off to Victoria's


Secret and says, they're using your name in an unfavorable


way.  His -- his deposition testimony remarks --


QUESTION:  Well, he was concerned about the


tarnishment aspect, and I still have to -- I would like


you to comment on the -- on Justice Ginsburg's example,


too, would it diminish the capacity of the Victoria's


Secret mark to identify its line of goods if some --


somebody thought they also sold men's pajamas?


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes. 


Someone else, I think you 

well -- you begin to have the elements of the proof of


dilution when you show that someone is using the same --


or a name which reaches mental association because of a


number of factors.  You have the elements of dilution. 


You might not yet have, as you have proof in this case, of


a really lessened capacity to identify and distinguish.


Now, another -- the -- nobody sought to


introduce a survey in this case.  I would trust Federal


judges more than sociology graduate students to make this


kind of determination, and nobody sought to bring before

this Court a fact-bound determination of whether all of


the judges below were correct when they found that there


was a strong association, and beyond that, that the use of


the Victor's Little Secret mark to sell the kinds of goods


it sells, which some customers find unsavory, and which


Mr. Moseley himself testified some members of the public


find -- at least -- extremely offensive, that that has the


effect of lessening the capacity of a Victoria's Secret


mark to identify and distinguish those famous goods and --


and products, and that's --


QUESTION:  But the blurring, then, that you're


describing now has no quality component to it?  That only


comes when you get to the subset?


MR. DELLINGER:  That is correct.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. DELLINGER:  It -- it only affects the fact


that it doesn't -- no longer singularly stands for


anything, that if Rolls-Royce were on 100 different


products, it would no longer -- it would no longer mean


anything, and would no longer -- they might as well call


their car a Yugo if it's used on products hither and yon.


Tarnishment is a particular good example of why


the lessening itself needs to be remedied, because once


you've tarnished a product, it's hard to unring that bell


in the public's mind, if someone had a national program.

 QUESTION:  Of course, if you're dealing with


Rolls-Royce, I suppose virtually any blurring is also


going to be tarnishment, which you don't necessarily have


even in other famous marks.


MR. DELLINGER:  Tarnishment has generally been


restricted so far in the case law to more unsavory


associations, sex, drugs, and matters of that kind.  This


is an act which is more limited than its critics suggest. 


They -- of course, whether it was a bad policy was a


matter that should have been addressed to Congress, but it


can be limited to a few very famous marks.


A safe harbor is read broadly.  People can use


the term, Victoria's Secret, for any purpose they want in


parody and commentary, on the steps of the courthouse. 


They just can't make this one use of it, that is a 

commercial use in commerce that lessens the capacity of


that mark to carry out its function that Congress so


clearly had in mind when it passed the Federal Trademark


Dilution Act.


That's why I think the courts below saw this,


like Buick Aspirin and Kodak Shoes, as a core paradigm


example of precisely what the statute was designed to


prohibit, and why none of the --

QUESTION:  -- is proof, then, submission?  If


you've got a very famous, distinctive mark, and you've got


a -- a very similar use.  You have those two things, and


then you get a few colonels to say yes, when they think of


the junior mark they think of the senior, is that enough


proof?


MR. DELLINGER:  It is in this case, Justice


Ginsburg, where the sufficiency of that I think was really


not challenged.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Dellinger.


Mr. Higgins, you have 2 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. HIGGINS, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. HIGGINS: 


Mr. Justice, and may it please the 

Court:


There's no evidence in this case that Colonel


Baker was ever in petitioner's store, and his particular


affidavit was challenged and disregarded by the trial


court.  What we have here is a choice between two


standards to interpret the FTDA.  Our choice is grounded


in the actual use, words that Congress used, and the


respondent's position is grounded in the academic theory


of dilution which we say is way ahead of the law.


Our standard is objective and predictable. 


50 

Theirs is subjective, unpredictable, invites the courts to


substitute its own judgment for consumer perceptions. 


It's consistent with almost nothing.  Our standard focuses


on measurable consumer perception.  Theirs focuses at the


beginning on semantic similarity, and a presumption that


dilution follows from that.  Our standard merely puts the


famous mark owner to their proof to show that Congress'


words, the lessening of the capacity, has been established


as a matter of proof.  They should not get a national


injunction without that.


Our standard keeps trademark law in its proper


bounds.  Their standard merely rewards the achievement of


fame.  Our standard, if applied in this case, should


result in this Court reversing the injunction and


directing that the petitioners be allowed to use Victor's 

given name in their business.


Thank you.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you,


Mr. Higgins.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
