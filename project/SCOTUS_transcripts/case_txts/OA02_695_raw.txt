CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-695, Michael Fitzgerald v. Racing


Association of Central Iowa.


General Miller.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. MILLER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. MILLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The Iowa Legislature, consistent with the Equal


Protection Clause, can charge different tax rates for its


riverboats and its racetracks for a number of legitimate


State interest reasons, including and especially the one


highlighted by the district court judge here, the 

promotion of the development of river communities. 


In 1983, Iowa broke ground and got more friendly


with gambling and allowed horse racing and dog racing in


our State.


QUESTION:  It's called gaming if -- if you favor


it.


Honor? 


MR. MILLER:  I -- is there a neutral term, Your


In -- in regard to gaming, one of the main


purposes of having horse and dog racing was to develop a

new subset of our agricultural economy, the breeding,


training, and raising of horses and dogs.  And that


succeeded.  It turned out to be about a $50 million


industry. 


Six years later, with visions of Mark Twain in


the background and the two incredible rivers in America


surrounding our State, the Mississippi and the Missouri,


the legislature authorized riverboat casinos, riverboat


gambling.  And one of the main purposes there was tourism,


economic development for the river communities and


riverfront development.  In a very short time, there were


$17 million worth of investment along the various


riverfronts. 


A few years later, though, neither gaming


enterprise was -- was doing as well as they would like, 

indeed, not doing -- not doing well at law.


In regard to the riverboats, the problem was,


well, Iowa had this sort of, in a way, naivete maybe about


betting.  They restricted the amount of bets on


riverboats.  It could only be a $5 bet and one couldn't


lose more than -- more than $200 in one setting.  Well,


Illinois had a different view and had no limits and were


starting to succeed competitively. 


The -- the situation with the racetracks was


more severe, that economically it just wouldn't work to

have racing, either horse racing or dog racing alone.  So


Iowa became the first State in the Nation to allow the


sort of the -- the golden goose of gambling, slot


machines, at racetracks.


QUESTION:  So now the bulk of the earnings are


from slot machines rather than the races.  Is that right?


MR. MILLER:  That -- that's right, Your Honor. 


Indeed, really the slot machines support the -- support


the racing.


QUESTION:  But under your scheme, I take it the


highest tax rate for slot machine income at racetracks is


36 percent versus 20 percent for slot machines on


riverboats.


MR. MILLER:  That -- that is correct, Your


Honor. 


And that was provided on a -- on a graduated 

basis.  Actually in next year it's -- the 36 percent would


be -- would be reached.


QUESTION:  And you want to offer a rational


basis for that scheme? 


MR. MILLER:  Yes.  Yes, we do, Your Honor.  And


what -- what we say is that the development of the -- of


the riverboats could be rationally preferred by the -- by


the legislature because of riverboat development, because


of economic development on the -- on the rivers.


Additionally, the -- the district court found

that the additional rational basis could be sort of


supporting the riverboat enterprises as a -- as an


industry, promoting riverboat history. 


Also, we argue that there was a problem of


riverboats leaving the State, that three out of six in the


previous -- previous to 1994, the legislation year, had --


had left the State. 


QUESTION:  Well, because of that legislation,


the Delta King left the Sacramento River and it's gone up


to the Mississippi. 


MR. MILLER:  Well, that was the next purpose,


Your Honor, to try and get other boats to -- to come to


Iowa, and apparently --


QUESTION:  They're -- they're saying -- and


maybe there's -- I take it from their brief that, look, 

there's never been a tax scheme like this.  Obviously, a


State very often would -- would tax at a different rate a


handsaw and a screwdriver, but we've never heard of a


State that said when you sell a screwdriver, you pay 5


percent tax if you sell it in Des Moines and a 3 percent


tax if you sell it in Dubuque, and if it's sold by one


kind of a person, they sell 8 percent tax, and it's all


the same screwdriver.  So they're saying there's never


been a -- really a tax system like this anywhere, and --


and they better have some pretty good reason or -- or

something. 


I mean, now -- so is all that true, that there


never has been a system like that, saying the same


screwdriver, everything identical, all it is is it's sold


in different parts of the State or by different people,


and -- and you have to pay a different tax? 


MR. MILLER:  Well, I think there's been many


times where the -- the taxpayer has been -- been treated


differently even if -- even if the transaction is the


same. 


QUESTION:  Like what?  Like what? 


MR. MILLER:  Sort of the -- the enterprise


zones, for instance.  Communities are -- are given


favorable tax rates all the time for economic development


purposes and that's what's here.  And --


QUESTION:  Typical -- typical sales tax.  You


know, the State may tax a barber's income at a different


rate than a hairdresser's and yet they may use the same


stuff.


MR. MILLER:  Yes.  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that


-- that would -- that would be another example. 


And, you know, the State has great latitude in


the taxation area and justifiably so because there are so


many complexities that -- that that be available to the


State.

 QUESTION:  Do -- do you agree, at least to the


extent the respondents say, that there's no other State in


which slot machines are taxed at a different rate


depending on their location, that this is unique to Iowa?


MR. MILLER:  I -- I think as far as I know,


that's -- that's the -- that's the case.  Slot machines


typically are not in multiple purposes -- not multiple


places like Iowa.  Typically they're in -- they're in


casinos.  So there's not -- not a lot of apt comparisons.


But you know, this is -- this is a -- a question


for the legislature.  When there's no suspect category or


fundamental right available, the legislature has -- has a


great deal of -- of discretion.  And the enterprise -- the


purpose of the enterprise is different.  The economic


development as opposed to the agricultural, for instance. 

When that -- when that is the case, the -- the legislature


really has -- has a great deal --


QUESTION:  So I push their argument or am I


imagining -- I'm trying to put it the strongest way. 


Look, cosmetologists and barbers do different things, and


moreover an enterprise zone is a special part of the State


that's not exactly the same.  Something different is going


on there.  Here it's slot machine income.  Nothing


different is going on.  Nothing. 


MR. MILLER:  Well, there is difference --

 QUESTION:  I -- I -- yes, go ahead.


MR. MILLER:  There is difference in -- in the


enterprise.  One has slot machines and table games.  The


other has slot machines and -- and racing.  But here you


have a -- a series of communities in -- in eastern Iowa


and then in western Iowa along the rivers that had


suffered loss of manufacturing jobs.  This was -- this was


an effort, a legitimate effort, on the part of the


legislature to advance a new industry, a tourism industry,


on the two rivers.


QUESTION:  As I understood it, didn't -- didn't


the tax on the -- the higher tax on the racetracks come


later? 


MR. MILLER:  It was -- it was phased in, Your


Honor.  That --


QUESTION:  And I can't quite understand how


imposing an extraordinarily high tax on racetracks is


suddenly going to provide a benefit for riverboats.


MR. MILLER:  Well, the legislature, of course,


had the -- had the discretion to -- to have them both at


36 percent.  The -- the benefit of the -- to the -- to the


riverboats was that -- that they didn't go to the higher


rate that -- that the -- that they did for the -- for the


racetracks.  It's sort of a chicken and egg problem, but


-- but they're spared that -- that higher rate and -- and

that's -- and that's an appropriate benefit. 


QUESTION:  It's across-the-board rate for


everything that goes on at the riverboat, right?  It's a


20 percent rate, whether its roulette or card games or


dice, it's all 20 percent. 


MR. MILLER:  That's it.  The --


QUESTION:  For the race, there's a great


disparity between the parimutuels.  It's only what, about


5, 6 percent? 


MR. MILLER:  That's right, Your Honor.  There's


a -- there's a very favorable rate for the -- for the


racing at the -- at the racetrack.  So it's a -- in a


sense it's a -- it's a blend of rates between the two. 


Again, understandably so --


QUESTION: 


Is the rate -- is the rate for taxing 

other gaming activities on the riverboats different from


the slot machines on the riverboats?


MR. MILLER:  No, Your Honor, it's not.  It's --


it's the same.  It's the same rate.  So you have -- you


sort of have 20 percent there as opposed to, say, as was


just pointed out, 4 or 5 percent for the racing at the --


at the racetrack. 


QUESTION:  So it's administratively easier to


calculate if you have all one rate for the riverboat?


MR. MILLER:  It would be -- it would be more

easily to -- to calculate and more efficient. 


QUESTION:  You say the riverboats, obviously,


are located on the rivers which bound Iowa on the east and


on the west.  How about the racetracks?  Are they


scattered throughout the State?


MR. MILLER:  They are scattered throughout the


State.  Two of them are on the -- turned out to be on the


rivers.  But the largest one, the premier one, Prairie


Meadows, is in the Des Moines area in -- in central Iowa.


QUESTION:  Add that if we looked into this at


any depth at all, we'd discover this originated from a


legislator who hated racetracks and loved riverboats and


was trying to kill the whole thing.  And then they say


that besides that, there was a report of a committee that


said all this enterprise zone -- we don't think that's so, 

et cetera, et cetera. 


MR. MILLER:  Well, I mean, shocking that -- that


a legislator on -- on -- in riverboat country would try


and help the -- help the riverboats.  I mean, that's, for


better or worse, part of the -- part of the legislative


process, always was and always will be.  And -- and courts


can't be sort of cops to -- to make sure that -- that they


-- that they do not do that. 


QUESTION:  Well, under --

for things, it would be a disaster, wouldn't it? 


(Laughter.) 


MR. MILLER:  Yes.  Well, it's, you know, the old


adage about sausage, making sausage, that you shouldn't


watch it, that --


QUESTION:  But the Iowa -- the Iowa Supreme


Court seems to think it could look to what was the real


purpose, not the purpose that we could conceive.  Lots of


nice purposes like the riverboat drifts away and the


racetrack is --


But you said something in your reply brief that


-- that really surprised me.  It seems to me that if we


say -- if you're talking about Federal equal protection,


this is an area in which the leeway for the legislature is


the widest that there is. 


But couldn't Iowa then say, 

okay, we're just doing this under Iowa equal protection,


and we can make that whatever we want?  And for us, the


real purpose counts, not the conceivable purpose.


MR. MILLER:  Yes.  The -- you know, the -- the


legislature -- the court could have said that they were


diverging from -- from the standards of this Court.


QUESTION:  But you said they couldn't do that on


remand.  On page 6 of your reply brief, you said that the


Iowa Supreme Court cannot reconsider the State court


decision in order to subsequently establish an adequate

and independent State ground.  Why couldn't it?


MR. MILLER:  Well, our argument is -- is, Your


Honor -- and we know we're -- we're into sort of a little


bit new territory here.  But our argument is that -- that


the court has made a decision that the -- the analysis --


a clear decision that the analysis is the same under the


Federal and the State constitutional provision.  If that


analysis, judged by a higher court, is determined to be


wrong, then that would -- would seem perhaps to settle it.


But more significantly, the -- the respondents


didn't argue below that there was a separate analysis,


that -- that they should look at it separately.


QUESTION:  But they could.  I mean, nothing


would foreclose them on remand or the Iowa Supreme Court


itself. 


MR. MILLER:  Yes.  It's -- it might not, but we


argue that -- that they sort of waived that argument, that


they didn't argue that in -- in the first time through,


that they -- it was a different analysis.  They conceded,


like everybody else, and assumed that it was the same


analysis. 


QUESTION:  All our opinion would say, if we


reverse the Supreme Court of Iowa, was remand it for


further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. 


And so certainly, so far as our remand order is concerned,

the Supreme Court of Iowa is free to do whatever it wants


so long as not -- as it's not inconsistent with our


opinion. 


MR. MILLER:  I understand, Mr. Chief Justice. 


Maybe I'm making my argument too soon and -- and will --


QUESTION:  I doubt if you'll have any better


luck with it before the Supreme Court of Iowa. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. MILLER:  Well, we -- we will -- we will try


I -- I assume. 


What -- what we're saying here is that -- that


there are multiple legitimate State purposes available


that are well within the zone of Nordlinger and the


related cases that have been before this Court, that --


that this is comfortably a legitimate State interest, a 

number of them, most specifically the development of the


-- of -- of the river communities.  And that's -- that's


consistent --


QUESTION:  Would it make any difference in your


analysis -- I don't know if this is true or not -- but if


the legislative history, if you had a complete record of


all the debates and everything else, and it was perfectly


clear that the hypothetical reasons you advance were


definitely not the reasons that motivated the particular


tax rates, that they did it just, say, to get even with

the racetracks because somebody was unhappy with something


they had done in the past or something like that, would


that make any difference? 


MR. MILLER:  Well, I -- I don't think that


there's -- there would be sufficient legislative history


to foreclose rational speculation.


QUESTION:  No, no.  Take his hypothetical. 


There is.


QUESTION:  I'm assuming that there is, that --


that there's a reason out there that -- that -- none of


the reasons that you advance were, in fact, considered by


any of the legislators.  In fact, they rejected them. 


They thought, we really don't want to help the riverboats. 


What we want to do is do something to really penalize the


racetracks because they're an immoral business, they're 

even worse than gambling on the rivers.  But that's why


they're doing it.


QUESTION:  And they put that right in the


preamble to the act. 


QUESTION:  Would that make any difference in


your analysis? 


MR. MILLER:  I -- I think that that kind of --


kind of history would not, in a rational speculation case,


that -- that --


QUESTION:  I guess my question is, is it

rational speculation when you know it's not true? 


(Laughter.) 


MR. MILLER:  Well, I -- I suppose not.


QUESTION:  Well, it's usually not true.  I mean,


usually these things are done for the self-interest of --


of legislators from various districts, and -- and as long


as there could be a rational -- I -- I would have -- I'm


surprised it took you so long to answer that question. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. MILLER:  I wanted to be thoughtful, Your


Honor.  But like -- we get back to -- to the -- the rough


and tumble of the legislative process as -- as you


suggest, Your Honor, is such that the courts don't --


don't review that, don't -- don't --


QUESTION: 


But isn't -- isn't that exactly 

really the point?  The courts just don't review it.  And


unless you get to -- to some fact pattern that -- that


gets you a -- a higher level of scrutiny, it's not so much


that we're engaging in rational basis scrutiny.  We're


just saying we can't touch the political process unless


you get yourself into a suspect class.  Isn't that really


what we're saying? 


MR. MILLER:  That's -- that's pretty much --


pretty much what's -- what's being said here and -- and


how the cases have been interpreted.  And is -- and it

makes -- makes a lot of sense because like you -- like you


suggest, Your Honor, when there's -- there's not a


fundamental right or a suspect category, that's the pure


legislative authority and that's where democracy kicks in


our -- in our country, for better or for worse, and the


assumption is that if they make a mistake, democracy later


will -- will catch that mistake.


Your Honor, I'd like to -- to now turn it over


to -- this has been my first argument, so I refer to him


as my safety net.

that a State's desire to promote or foster one type of


business over another or even to promote or foster one


mode of doing a business over another is a rational basis


that supports taxing the one and exempting the other.


For example, in State Board v. Jackson in 1931,


this Court held -- upheld a tax differential, a different


tax treatment, of chain stores versus single enterprise


retail stores.  Even though these businesses did


essentially the same commerce, the Court held that in the


State's exercise of its broad authority to govern the


economy of the State, it can prefer one mode of doing the


same business over another. 


And that same rationale has been applied by this


Court in numerous contexts involving tax distinctions


between, for example, warehouses located near railroads 

and warehouses not located near railroads, between


laundries that are operated by hand and laundries that are


operated by machine, and even between individuals and


corporations that are conducting identical businesses. 


QUESTION:  What about -- what about slot


machines owned by Republicans versus slot machines owned


by Democrats? 


(Laughter.) 


MR. JONES:  Assuming that we're still talking


about State laws --

 QUESTION:  No, that's exactly -- I'm serious


about --


MR. JONES:  Assuming we're still talking about


State laws, I would have to ask myself what would be the


rational basis.  The rational basis --


QUESTION:  The rational basis is the Republicans


have a majority in the State legislature. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. JONES:  Well, that might explain -- the


difference I think between your hypothetical and -- and


where I'm trying to come from is that the rational basis


has to be related to a legitimate State purpose.  There's


a -- a legitimate State purpose in fostering certain kinds


of commerce and suppressing others. 


QUESTION: 


What about -- what about slot 

machines owned by farmers and slot machines owned by city


dwellers? 


MR. JONES:  It's -- it's hypothetically


conceivable and that's the question that this Court asked


itself under -- under FCC v. Beach.  Is there a


conceivable State interest that would justify that


distinction?  And obviously, that -- the fact that there


has to be one doesn't mean there always is one, and I'm


not standing here saying, well, every imaginable


distinction is justifiable.  The distinction in this case

is simply between -- is whether the State could


conceivably have preferred riverboats over racetracks.


QUESTION:  What -- what have we held wasn't


justified outside of a suspect category situation, such as


-- I don't mean Republicans and Democrats.  You're into


First Amendment suspect categories I suppose.  What --


what have we ever held was -- was irrational that didn't


involve race or -- or, you know, political discrimination


or something like that?


MR. JONES:  The -- there's a case that Justice


Ginsburg could tell us about.  She argued a case where


this Court -- I think it was called Weinberger v.


Wiesenfeld, a case -- not a tax case.  It was a Social


Security benefits case, and the Court held that the


distinct treatment of -- of the surviving spouse's 

ability --


QUESTION:  It's a suspect category, and I mean,


we're into sex discrimination. 


MR. JONES:  Well, it -- it was described by the


Court as -- as a rational scrutiny case, and it said there


was no legitimate State interest because in -- in the


context between treating differently male and female


surviving spouses, in light of the objective of that


statute, which was to protect the -- the children of the


couple, there was no rational basis to prefer one rather

than the other. 


That is -- that is the only case that I can cite


to you where this Court has applied a rational basis test


to strike down a Federal statute.  There may well be


others.


QUESTION:  There are others, but it's -- it's


the -- it's quite interesting, is -- is there a -- there


are two sets where they're struck down.  One is what you


might call the heightened rational basis which are


normally not economic regulation, but there was the mental


-- the mental -- the building, you know, the -- of the


home for the mentally disturbed or whatever.  And then


there are the ones that are out-of-state, which are


Dormant Commerce Clause cases.  But is there any which is


a pure rational basis in an economic area? 


You think the 

answer to that is no, and I can't think of one. 


MR. JONES:  I -- I can't think of one, but it's


not because there is no rational basis test.  It's because


in applying this test, the Court is very deferential in


recognizing that States have intentionally been given this


authority over regulating State commerce, and that these


kinds of choices are left to the legislative branch.


QUESTION:  Mr. Jones, when you talked about


Federal tax, I thought you were going to say the one that


you have in your brief, Martz against Commissioner.

(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Oh, yes, there is and it was a tax


case.  It was a State tax case.


(Laughter.) 


MR. JONES:  But -- but the -- it was -- it was a


tax case.  But in that case, the Court -- you were -- the


Court was persuaded that the distinction was invidious.

The Court didn't say that a different treatment of


unmarried men and unmarried women in this particular


deduction context was irrational.  The Court said it was


invidious.  So I believe that the only tax -- Federal tax


case that has -- well, I don't believe there is a Federal


tax case that this Court has decided that violated --


failed to meet the rational basis test. 


The -- the court below made -- the Iowa Supreme


Court -- where it went wrong was looking to only one of


the purposes of the statute.  There were many purposes. 


They looked to just the purpose of whether it aided


racetracks, which just kind of strikes me as an


unrealistic way to look at what the purpose of a


legislation that imposes a tax on racetracks would be.


But to answer a question that Justice Stevens 

raised earlier, when -- in applying the rational basis


test, the courts are to look to any plausible or


conceivable theory.  And -- and in FCC v. Beach, as well


as other cases we've cited, in applying that test, the


Court has said that you don't look -- you're not bound by


the facts of the particular case.  And indeed, you're not


supposed to make fact findings as to what these legitimate


interests might be.  Instead, you're supposed to allow the


State any rational legitimate interest that the Court


might -- might be able to perceive and -- and nail down

that point in that case by saying that -- and I'm quoting


-- it is entirely irrelevant whether the conceived State


purpose actually motivated the State's decision.


So you don't have -- the State doesn't have to


show that these rational, legitimate State interests, in


fact, motivated the decision.  It doesn't have to show


that they are, in fact, the basis for the decision because


this is a Federal constitutional question.  This is not a


question of interpreting the State law.  If we wanted to


interpret the State law, we'd want to know what its


purpose was, but that's not this task.  In looking at the


constitutional limitation, it only -- it only takes effect


if the State has no conceivable or plausible legitimate


interest in the classification. 


One other point to mention briefly is they say 

Allegheny Pittsburgh points another direction.  Allegheny


Pittsburgh was the rare case that this Court said in


Nordlinger -- was the rare case where there was a West


Virginia State constitutional provision that said all


assessment -- all property taxes will be levied based on


market value.  A local assessor in that State didn't like


that and he -- he assessed taxes based on acquisition,


which is prices, which is the last sale price of each


property, and that resulted in -- in a differential


treatment of each taxpayer.  And what this Court held in

-- in Allegheny Pittsburgh was that because the State


constitution prohibited any taxation other than market


value, there was no legitimate State interest to justify


the -- the distinguishing tax rates. 


Well, that case doesn't have any application


here because there's no provision in the Iowa constitution


that says that the Iowa Legislature cannot, in regulating


commerce, prefer or promote riverboat traffic and


riverboat --


QUESTION:  Do you read Allegheny as saying that


the -- if the State had enacted exactly the scheme that


was being administered there, that it would pass equal


protection review?


MR. JONES:  It -- well, in Nordlinger, the Court


-- if I understand your question right, in Nordlinger, the 

Court upheld an acquisition -- last sale price tax scheme


I think in California where there was no constitutional


provision in California that required market value


taxation.


QUESTION:  Would the answer in this case be


different if the Iowa Supreme Court told us that the Iowa


constitution requires that all slot machines be taxed


alike?


MR. JONES:  I think that you would make -- I


think in that -- in looking for a legitimate State

interest, you would make an inquiry into whether the Iowa


constitution prohibited preferring riverboats --


preferring riverboat commerce because a legitimate State


interest for Federal purposes -- and the Court made this


very point in response to a dissent of yours in -- in the


opinion by Justice Brennan in the Minnesota v. the Clover


Leaf Creamery case. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Jones.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK McCORMICK


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. McCORMICK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


I think the Iowa Supreme Court in this case, as


this Court will determine as it reviews the opinion, 

addressed two questions, not merely one question, in this


equal protection challenge. 


The first question the court addressed is what


did the legislature have in mind in enacting this


legislation.  In doing so and in answering that question,


the State court was doing what State courts routinely do,


interpreting State law. 


Once having determined the meaning of State law,


as was its prerogative, the court then moved to the second


question which is the only question that the State and the

United States have argued here, really, which is the equal


protection issue. 


We think the first question has to be answered


before you jump to the second. 


QUESTION:  Well, what about the -- our decision


in FCC v. Beach, which was just referred to earlier, where


it says it really doesn't make any difference what the


actual facts were? 


MR. McCORMICK:  The -- the decision in Beach, as


I understand it, did require the establishment of a


legitimate State purpose under the FCC provision that was


at issue.  In fact, the court of appeals had sent the case


back to the FCC:  Tell us what you had in mind, and the


court of appeal -- or the FCC said, we can't think of a


better reason than was given by Judge Mikva in his 

concurring opinion, and this Court accepted that as being


a plausible basis then for the distinction that was at


issue in that case. 


QUESTION:  But we have said that any conceivable


rational basis is enough.  We don't care what Iowa really


had in mind. 


MR. McCORMICK:  I think you do, Your Honor, and


I think the case that was mentioned earlier, the


Weinberger case, is an illustration of how it makes a


difference.  In that case, as the Court ultimately found,

there was gender discrimination which was inappropriate in


dealing with the issue survivorship benefits as to


spouses, and the argument that was being proffered by the


Government in that case was, this is okay because this


statute was intended to take care of women who have


trouble, when they are widowed, getting by in the work


place.


QUESTION:  If you think gender discrimination


cases aren't different, you're just wrong. 


MR. McCORMICK:  No, Your Honor.  I -- I am not


saying that the analysis was the same, but I am saying


that the Court looked to the actual intent as it was shown


by legislative history. 


QUESTION:  Some legislatures -- some


legislatures don't have legislative history.  What is to


be done in those cases?  What, do you -- you convene a


trial court to take testimony from legislators and others


to find out what was the actual intent of the legislators?


MR. McCORMICK:  What is routinely done in Iowa


is what we did in this case, which is -- and what courts


routinely do at the State level, at least what's done in


Iowa, is that the court looks at any available materials


that would bear on the concerns --


QUESTION:  There are no materials.  I mean, some


States don't have legislative history.  They just don't

keep it. 


MR. McCORMICK:  That's right. 


QUESTION:  What do you do in that case? 


MR. McCORMICK:  I'm telling you. 


QUESTION:  Do you call witnesses? 


MR. McCORMICK:  We don't have -- we do not have


records or transcripts of legislative debates at committee


hearings. 


QUESTION:  So were -- were -- was testimony


taken from legislators asking why did you vote for this


bill?


MR. McCORMICK:  No, Your Honor, but --


QUESTION:  Why not? 


MR. McCORMICK:  -- affidavits -- excuse me.  But


affidavits were obtained that explained what the concerns 

were that were being addressed.  We have a full record. 


This was a summary judgment motion in which we put in


information that was available to the legislature.


QUESTION:  Affidavits from legislators?


MR. McCORMICK:  Yes, Your Honor, but not saying


why they voted as they did, but explaining the legislative


history.  And the Iowa court routinely, in dealing with


the meaning of State law, has accepted the kinds of


materials that we put in the summary judgment record.


QUESTION:  Why didn't they explain why they

voted as they did?  If, as you say, the -- the intent of


the legislature is the criterion, why didn't you ask them,


why did you vote the way you did? 


MR. McCORMICK:  Because Iowa, like this Court,


suggests that an individual legislator is incompetent to


say that, but Iowa, like this Court, will permit


legislators to explain legislative history, which is what


was done here.  That's what we did with these legislator


affidavits.  The Iowa Court used the kinds of materials


that States use when they --


QUESTION:  The whole is the sum of its parts. 


If you're really interested in why the legislature did it,


you ought to get affidavits from every legislator saying


this is why I voted for it, and if 51 percent voted for it


for a certain reason, that was the reason. 


MR. McCORMICK:  In a State like Iowa, where we


don't have the kind of information that's available from


Congress, what we do is we ask our court to determine what


the legislature intended as it must in many, many cases,


including this kind of case, and offer the court the kind


of information, the background information that's


available. 


QUESTION:  If that's how it's done in Iowa, it


can be done that way.  This Court, when it's dealing with


tax cases, it doesn't do it that way.  It doesn't look for

the actual purpose. 


And in -- and in the Wiesenfeld case, the whole


thing was driven by it being a gender classification, and


the Government's argument was this was pure favor to


women.  And the argument is that, no, that was not the


actual purpose.


MR. McCORMICK:  This Court has said in several


cases -- it has said in the Nordlinger case and also in


Heller against Doe -- that even in a rational basis case,


to be plausible, a justification must not be precluded by


the record. 


And, for example, that is how Nordlinger


distinguished Allegheny Pittsburgh because Allegheny


Pittsburgh had determined that the West Virginia property


tax scheme was a market value valuation or appraisal 

system.  And in Nordlinger, the position was being


advocated, well, this case is governed by Allegheny


Pittsburgh.  You can't have an acquisition value system


like California.  The Court distinguished Allegheny


Pittsburgh by saying that the record in Allegheny


Pittsburgh precluded the legislative goal of having a


market value -- excuse me -- having an acquisition value


tax system.  That's how the case was distinguished.


QUESTION:  But if you're looking at what -- what


the legislature did, they did one thing great for the

racetracks.  They gave them permission to have these slot


machines, which they didn't before, so they're preferring


the racetracks by giving them this, but they say not too


much because we're going to let you make money from these


slot machines, but not too much.  We're going to take a


piece of it.


So you like what they did, the permission to


have the slot machines, but then say, ah, but once -- they


have to give us as sweet a deal as they gave the


riverboats.  They didn't have to give you anything.  They


didn't have to let you have the slot machines.


MR. McCORMICK:  Well, Your Honor, our argument


about that is that they -- they threw us a lifeline when


we were faced with economic disaster, just as they were


throwing a lifeline to the riverboats, but it had an 

anchor attached to it.  What they did, of course, was have


a 2-year moratorium before the first escalation of tax


occurred and they provided for a total of 10 years before


the 36 percent is effective.  It will be effective next


year.


QUESTION:  But it was -- it all came in in the


same legislation, didn't it --


MR. McCORMICK:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  So they gave you something you never


had before and it was pretty good, but you didn't --

 MR. McCORMICK:  The Iowa Supreme Court said what


they did by that legislation was put us in a class the


same as the riverboats with respect to slot machines,


which was the main activity at both -- both venues, and


that they treated us differently by imposing this


draconian --


QUESTION:  Well, then to treat you the same, I


think that they would have to raise the parimutuel betting


from 5 percent, whatever it was, to 20 percent. 


MR. McCORMICK:  Your Honor, the record here


shows that parimutuel betting has invariably been a losing


proposition at the tracks, and the legislature, when it


passed this statute, specifically and expressly required


that the riverboats use the revenue first to pay their


debt, because they were in terrible circumstances, but 

secondly to subsidize the purses at the parimutuel betting


and to promote the -- the horse industry.  And such --


these are mandated goals which were -- which the


legislature required.


QUESTION:  That the riverboats do that or that


the tracks do that?


MR. McCORMICK:  No.  That the racetracks do


that.


QUESTION:  Oh, okay.  You said the riverboats.


MR. McCORMICK:  I'm sorry.  I meant the

racetracks are required by the statute to -- to do those


things.  Parimutuel betting has -- has never been a source


of net revenue in -- at least since the bankruptcy of the


main racetrack in 1992. 


QUESTION:  As I understand, the riverboats


wouldn't make money either if they didn't have the slot


machines. 


MR. McCORMICK:  Well, that's certainly arguable. 


They've had them since they were initiated.  Their problem


in 1994 was getting rid of the betting and loss limits.


But the -- the Iowa court -- and it's our


contention that this was a matter that was within the


prerogative of the court -- in ascertaining the


legislative intent in this case, said it was not the


intent of the Iowa Legislature to benefit riverboats at 

the expense of the racetracks.


QUESTION:  So how does this work?  I mean, I


thought there was a distinction between your trying to


show in a case like this that the rational purposes that


are advanced simply are not served -- that's a factual


matter.  And I take it that's Allegheny.  They showed that


the -- that this wasn't a way to bring about what they


claimed.


MR. McCORMICK:  Yes.

to show that the legislature didn't really have that


motive for the reason that if the courts permitted you to


show it, there would be no end to that.  People would be


arguing about legislative theories in State cases like


this forever.


So if that's right -- I -- I mean, you're not --


I don't think you can show the first.  Maybe you can. 


MR. McCORMICK:  Well, our contention is that --


QUESTION:  Yes -- is you can. 


MR. McCORMICK:  -- this Court left that open to


us in Allegheny Pittsburgh.


QUESTION:  Yes.  I think it did leave it open,


but you see, they come in with some rational purposes, and


you think you've showed here that -- that they don't --


that this -- this particular statute could not serve those 

purposes as a matter of the world of fact?


I mean, one is, for example, they say if we


don't have a lower rate -- you've heard it -- they'll go


off to some other place, and they have one that went to


some other place.  And you don't deny they went to some


other place. 


MR. McCORMICK:  Well, the question is not only


legitimacy of the goal, but whether there is a rational


relationship and whether the classification involved is


reasonably related to any differential treatment.

 As in Allegheny Pittsburgh, our complaint here


is a comparative one.  It's the comparative treatment for


the same activity essentially in the same place because


we've got racetracks in two of the cities that -- that are


the cities where two of the three riverboats were in fact,


and -- and on the same activity, which is what the Iowa


Supreme Court found when it determined that for


classification purposes, it saw no difference except that


one was a facility that was fixed and the other floated.


And then having -- having made that


determination of the equal situation, the court looked at


differential treatment too and said --


QUESTION:  But there was another factor that --


that was part of it, isn't it?  There was a 20 percent


rate across everything, all the kinds of games that they 

have on the riverboat.  So that's nice and


administratively convenient.  You don't want to have one


rate for the slot machines and another one for blackjack.


MR. McCORMICK:  Yes, Your Honor.  And that rate


was in place in 1994.  There wasn't any change in the tax


paid by riverboats.  The legislation imposed for the first


time, because it authorized for the first time, a tax on


slot machine usage and activity at the racetracks.


QUESTION:  May -- may I address a -- a slightly


different argument that you were making, I think you were

making a minute ago?  And that is, now -- it had two


premises. 


Number one, you said our own cases show that a


-- a conceivable rational basis cannot be relied upon when


the record indicates that in fact that was not the basis


for the legislation.  So fact limits what is -- what can


be considered as conceivable. 


Number two, you said a moment ago that the Iowa


Supreme Court made a determination about the -- the


purpose of the statute, and -- and at least they


determined that the purpose of that statute was not to aid


riverboat gambling. 


So I take it your argument is you can't argue


that this differential treatment is rationally related to


the promotion of -- of riverboat development or river 

development because the Iowa Supreme Court has


definitively determined that that was not the case.  Is


that a fair statement? 


MR. McCORMICK:  That's certainly part of our


argument, yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  All right.  My -- my question I guess


is this.  There is no question that the Iowa Supreme Court


in the construction of the Iowa constitution can approach


matters that way.  If this Court approaches matters that


way, then in effect we're going to have two different

methodologies, one for Federal cases, I guess, and -- and


one for -- for State cases.  And we're going to have to


take every State case subject to fact determinations made


by the State courts, and that's going to limit the


application of this conceivable rational basis test. 


Why would it not be wiser for us to say, just to


keep the systems running smoothly, look, we are not going


to be bound by State court determinations of legislative


intent or purpose?  The State courts are perfectly free to


do that under their own constitutions, but when it gets to


us, we will not accept, for example, the determination in


a case like this by Iowa that the purpose was not to aid


riverboat gambling.  Why wouldn't that be a sensible way


for us to -- to go, leaving the State courts to run their


systems any way they want to? 


MR. McCORMICK:  We think, Your Honor, that the


question of the meaning of State law has always been


within the domain and prerogative of -- of the State


courts. 


QUESTION:  But this isn't a question of State


law.  It's a question of State fact in applying a Federal


law, i.e., the -- the rational basis scrutiny under the


Federal -- the Equal Protection Clause.


MR. McCORMICK:  Yes, Your Honor.  I'd invite


your attention to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company

against Ward, which came out of Alabama, dealt with


burdensome taxes placed on out-of-state insurers that


wanted to do business in Alabama.  That case, like this


one, involved a summary judgment proceeding where


information was put into the State court record.  The


State in that case advanced, as I understand it, something


like 17 reasons as rational bases for that


differentiation. 


Now, this Court reviewed two of them because the


State court held that they were valid justifications under


that summary judgment record.  This Court reversed,


finding that those justifications were not valid or


supportable.  They were not rational.  But this Court did


not go further than to look at the other proffered


justifications by the State. 


The Court sent the case back 

for completion of the summary judgment proceedings. 


And what was being done in that Alabama case is


exactly what we did in this case by looking at the summary


judgment record. 


QUESTION:  I thought that was -- involved


interstate discrimination against out-of-state actors.


MR. McCORMICK:  That was the -- that -- that was


the issue that was being reviewed on equal protection --


QUESTION:  But here you have everybody internal


in the same -- the same State.  So I think that's a

different case.


MR. McCORMICK:  Excuse me, Your Honor? 


QUESTION:  Well, you're not discriminating


against out-of-staters, which is a Federal concern. 


MR. McCORMICK:  Yes, Your Honor.  I'm not


talking about the -- the equal protection issue there. 


I'm talking about the manner in which the record was


determined and the State court was given the prerogative


of telling this Court what it determined the purposes were


of the law.


QUESTION:  But if you're -- if you're right


about how Iowa goes about doing things, then you go back


and tell the Iowa court, the Supreme Court has this any


conceivable purpose test.  You have what's the real


purpose test. 


So now say we'll apply our own State notion 

of what equal protection is and -- and that's the end of


it.


MR. McCORMICK:  We're going to say that we


thought the -- this Court would say if the record showed,


whatever the record was, in this case our summary judgment


record, that the rational speculation by the Government is


not supported by the realities of the situation, then that


the court -- that sort of justification is not plausible.


We thought that's what this Court's view was. 


We certainly will argue to the Iowa court that

it is within its prerogative initially first to decide


what the legislative purposes were, as it does in many


cases and as this Court has in many cases respected when


it is doing Federal constitutional review where the


meaning of a State law is a threshold issue.  We'll be


then inviting the Iowa court, if this Court remands the


case, to reconsider the case under the Iowa constitution. 


QUESTION:  Mr. McCormick, why isn't there a


categorization problem in this case?  I mean, there is no


Iowa law pertaining to slot machines in particular.  There


is a law taxing table games at -- the revenues from that,


at 20 percent.  Right? 


MR. McCORMICK:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Why isn't it perfectly reasonable to


look upon these laws this way: 


Iowa is taxing a business 

which has nothing but table games at 20 percent on all the


table games.  It is taxing a business which has parimutuel


betting plus slot machines at 5 percent for the parimutuel


betting and 34 percent for the slot machines.


I mean, you certainly wouldn't be complaining if


they taxed racetracks at a combined rate of 15 percent or


-- or a combined rate of -- of 30 percent for that.  Now


you -- you would have no complaint.  So why does it make


any difference if they simply, instead of picking one


percentage, charge 5 percent on the parimutuel and 34

percent on the slot machines?  But they're two different


businesses.  One is just table games.  The other one is


horse -- horse racing and slot machines.  They're --


they're different businesses.  They're taxed differently. 


MR. McCORMICK:  Well, the -- at least the view


of the Iowa court was that these two enterprises, the


riverboats and racetracks, are engaged in the same


business.  They are in the same class.  And singling one


of those taxpayers out for differential treatment violates


equal protection in the view of our court. 


The -- the --


QUESTION:  Your court is entitled to -- to view


it that way from State law, but they were -- they've said


that State law mirrors Federal law, and just because they


choose to look at it that way, that doesn't mean I have to 

look at it that way. 


MR. McCORMICK:  No, Your Honor.  That's --


that's certainly correct. 


But in terms of the classification here, we


think that the State court was warranted in finding that


these two taxpayers are in the same class.  Parimutuel


revenues have -- have not, from 1994 -- actually


immediately preceding that and subsequently, ever been a


factor in the revenues of racetracks except a negative


factor.

 The table games -- that's an advantage that the


riverboats have over racetracks, not a justification for


differential treatment for putting a heavier tax on the


same activity at the racetracks. 


QUESTION:  It's an odd position when you say


there was no obligation whatever for the State to allow


slot machines at racetracks, but if they allow it, they


have to be as generous to the racetrack as they were to


the riverboats.  What didn't come in as a discrete item


came in as part of the whole gambling operation.  It is


strange to say not only -- once you give it to us, you


have to give us the best deal.


MR. McCORMICK:  We're not -- we're not really


saying that.  We're saying that -- that any differential


treatment cannot be of the magnitude that exists here and 

be consistent --


QUESTION:  But you'd have no equal protection


argument at all if they didn't let you have the slot


machines.


MR. McCORMICK:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Iowa -- the Iowa court made the


statement, as I understand it, that the Iowa Equal


Protection Clause and the national Equal Protection Clause


had identical requirements at least for the purposes of


this case.

Now assume, for the sake of argument, that we

protection.  Do you understand the Iowa decision to be


that there is -- despite that finding on our part or that


conclusion on our part, that there is no question that


what they said in that opinion does reflect the Iowa Equal


Protection Clause and the result that they reached will be


and -- and can be found on the basis of this opinion to be


the result under the Iowa clause?


MR. McCORMICK:  Yes, Your Honor.  We --

difference in the -- in the ultimate result in this case. 

MR. McCORMICK:  If the Iowa Supreme Court, if


this case were remanded, determines through the use of the

QUESTION:  Unless they change their rationale,


there is no question, as I understand it, on the basis of

in its opinion in this case said that the Iowa Equal


Protection Clause and the Federal clause were the same or

QUESTION:  And I suppose if we decide that it's


wrong on the Federal section, it goes back to the Supreme 

Court of Iowa, they could just as easily say, well, our --

 MR. McCORMICK:  Well, what they said is the


scope and the import of the two constitutional provisions


are the same.  Actually part of that -- if one looks at


the history in Iowa, there's an old case, 1911 case, State


against Fairmont Creamery.  The Iowa court for years in


interpreting the Iowa equal protection provision never


made any reference to Federal law.  And that case, for the


first time in 1911, cited a couple of cases from this


Court and said our decisions are in harmony with the


decisions of the United States Supreme Court.


I believe the evolution shows and history shows


that what the court has done since then is for


convenience, because of the availability of the precedent


of this Court, said we use the same analysis.  And we --


we do the same thing in antitrust law. 


We do the same 

thing in civil rights law, even though we have some


statutory differences. 


But the court is still free to arrive at a


different result under that analysis, and in this case


certainly the court arrived at the decision that it did


not only under the Federal Constitution but the State


constitution. 


QUESTION:  It would mean they were wrong twice,


both in their interpretation of Federal law and also in


their interpretation of Iowa law, right?

 MR. McCORMICK:  I don't believe so, Your Honor,


because I think what they have said is that they use the


same analysis.  They don't say the same result is


foreordained.  This -- our court, for example, doesn't


follow the Lyon case on the issue of the good faith


exception to the exclusionary rule.  The court has been


independent, treated State grounds as being adequate and


independent in appropriate cases, even though generally,


as it said here, it tracks with the Federal cases under


similar provisions. 


One thing I'd like to mention to you because I


think it is a little bit of a misinterpretation of reality


to suggest that these riverboats were created in Iowa to


-- to sit on our border rivers.  The statute involved and


the implementing regulations will allow a riverboat in 

Iowa on any river in Iowa, on any lake in Iowa, or on any


reservoir.  And -- and there is, in fact, as the record


shows, a riverboat on a landlocked lake in southern Iowa


such that for comparison purposes, comparing these


racetracks, two of which are in river cities, and --


actually all three of them in river cities, but two of


them in river cities where there were also riverboats at


the time of this --


QUESTION:  How do you get the boat to the


landlocked lake?

MR. McCORMICK:  Yes.  It's African Queen. 


And the notion that there is any particular


navigation or -- or sailing involved with these -- with


these methods of housing gambling activities is -- is more


imaginary than real. 


I appreciate very much your attention.  We


believe that this Court in reviewing past State court


equal protection decisions and more recently in the -- in


the tax area in Williams against Vermont and Hooper 

against Bernalillo County has -- has respected the -- the


determinations that have been made by the State courts as


to what legislative intent was, as we ask the Court to do


in this case, and in those cases, and applying -- after


that threshold determination, applying equal protection


analysis, found the statutes under a rational basis


analysis did not comport with equal protection.  We think


this is a case where the record will support this Court in


finding that the Iowa Supreme Court got it right and that


the State and Solicitor General have it wrong under this

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. MILLER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. MILLER:  I would just point out that


Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Company is the -- is the


case where this Court decided that in -- in a case before


this Court that comes from a State court, that the Federal


process, the Federal analysis applies, and that the total


work, the total decisionmaking done by the State court is


reviewable here, so much so that in that case they


reversed a factual finding in -- in the court. 


I would emphasize too that -- that the Iowa 

Supreme Court has said that -- that the analysis is -- is


-- always is the same between the State provision and --


and the Federal provision, and has only departed, as a


matter of result, only one time, the Bierkamp case, in the


130 years that the two provisions existed at the same


time.


With that, I would respond to any questions that


you might have or -- or conclude by asking you to uphold


the constitutionality of this -- of this act because there


are multiple legitimate State interests developed by
