CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 01-653, Federal Communications Commission v.


NextWave Personal Communications and a companion case. 


Mr. Clement.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it


please the Court:


Congress has directed the FCC to use auctions to


allocate scarce wireless spectrum in a manner that


furthers the public interest.  Those auctions allocate


spectrum to the party who will -- who values the spectrum


most highly and, by assumption, will use it most


effectively to serve the public.  In addition, Congress


has directed the FCC to consider a number of specific


factors in assessing the public interest, including


promoting opportunities for small business and ensuring


the rapid deployment of wireless services.  Nothing in


that public interest regulatory regime runs afoul of


section 525 of the Bankruptcy Code.


To be sure, in administering its auctions the


FCC does place consequences on the regulatory signals

provided by the failure to meet regulatory payment


deadlines.  In particular, the FCC views the failure to


make a timely regulatory payment as a proxy for a


determination that continued possession of the license is


not in the public interest.


QUESTION:  But your point is, is that the


regulatory discretion and authority of the agency has been


replaced under the statutory scheme in large part by the


dynamics of the free market.  The highest bidder shows us


which is the most qualified person.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  That's right.  It's been


replaced in large part but not exclusively, and I think


both aspects that are important --


QUESTION:  Well, as to the first part, isn't the


Bankruptcy Code and the policy of new start and creditors


and so forth, isn't that really part of the free market


structure?


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, I think there's a


difference, though, when a regulator regulates solely for


timely payment for its own sake, and in that case it


implicates only the policies that are addressed by the


Bankruptcy Code, and I think it's a different situation


when the regulator looks at the failure to make timely


payment as a proxy for something else.


QUESTION:  Well, but Mr. Clement, in your

petition for certiorari, the question presented speaks of


an obtained option automatically canceled.  That suggests


that it is indeed automatic.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, it's automatic in the


sense --


QUESTION:  I mean, automatic means without any


discretion.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  With respect, Justice, Chief


Justice Rehnquist, when it says automatic, what it means


is that it cancels without any, the need for any further


action from the commission, but in any given case, the


cancellation of a license is a result both of the


automatic cancellation rule and the fact that a payment


deadline has come forward, and where the commission has


discretion is in relaxing the payment deadline, and you


can see that in this very case.  NextWave's license is


canceled, according to the FCC, because NextWave failed to


make the very first installment payment due under those


licenses.


Now, according to the licenses in the first instance,


that payment was due on April 30, 1997, but the licenses


didn't cancel on April 30, 1997 because the commission in


its discretion, as part of a multifactor public interest


determination, extended the payment deadline a full 18


months.

 QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Clement, it appears to me


that the FCC went along with the bankruptcy filing, filed


a claim for the amount that wasn't paid, and apparently


went along with the proposals for a while to work this out


and then, very shortly before the decision to reauction


the things, the FCC decided not to go along with it.  That


doesn't sound like some automatic cancellation.  I mean,


the FCC appeared to treat it very much like the bankruptcy


claim for quite some time, didn't it?


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, to be sure, the FCC


participated in the bankruptcy proceedings and protected


its interests as a creditor, but at the same time it has


independent interests as a regulator, and the FCC, as we


point out on page 19 of the reply brief, made clear at


various points well before NextWave went into bankruptcy


that it did not view bankruptcy as an exception from the


regulatory provisions of the Communications Act, and I


think if you look at the specific event that NextWave


points to as the automatic cancellation, it's the failure


to make a payment that was due on October 29, 1998, and it


was due on the 29th of October, 1998, rather than April


30, 1997, precisely because of a public interest


determination by the commission.


QUESTION:  You say a public interest


determination, but the only correlation that seems clear

to me is a purely economic correlation.  When the value of


the leases dropped, the FCC apparently went into the


Bankruptcy Court and said, we want our full $4 billion,


and when the value of the leases went up, the FCC took the


position, we want to reauction them and get the increase


in value.  It seems at each point at which the FCC made a


decision, it was making an economic decision, not a


regulatory decision.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  With respect, Justice Souter,


I don't think that's correct.  When -- I mean, it is true


that the FCC tried to go in and protect its interests as a


creditor, but at the point that NextWave was trying to


keep its regulatory licenses that it promised to pay $4.7


billion for, and trying to keep those licenses for just


over a billion, the result of that process would have been


that the rest of that amount, the $3 billion plus, would


have been an unsecured claim of the FCC, that would have


been really worth virtually nothing, so I think the better


way to understand this case is that the FCC does have


interests as a creditor, and it has tried to protect those


interests in the bankruptcy proceedings and has


participated in those proceedings, but at the same time,


it has interests with the -- as a regulator, and in its


capacity as a regulator it hasn't acted in a way that


would result in a sole-cause cancellation.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, suppose -- and I


consider this a classic case for what this provision of


the Bankruptcy Code was directed to.  Suppose you have a


State law that says anyone who is in default of traffic


tickets that amount to more than $500 shall have his


license revoked, okay, and the person in question goes


into bankruptcy, doesn't pay the $500, gets the $500


discharged in bankruptcy, the State you think can revoke


his license?


GENERAL CLEMENT:  No, I don't, but let me give


you --


QUESTION:  Why not?  Isn't there a regulatory


purpose there?


GENERAL CLEMENT:  No.  The only regulatory


purpose there, at least as I understand your hypothetical,


is in providing for timely payment, but suppose a State --


QUESTION:  No, the regulatory purpose is having


financially responsible drivers so people don't run around


the road hurting people and leaving them to bleed on their


own account.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well --


QUESTION:  There's just as much a regulatory


purpose in that hypo as there is here.


QUESTION:  You can always find a regulatory


purpose.  I mean, it's the easiest thing in the world to

do.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  But again, but if a State had


a regulatory purpose in ensuring that its drivers were


financially responsible, and presumptively said that a


license would fail to cancel for the failure to pay $500


in traffic tickets, but provided a mechanism for the


driver to go in before the regulatory commission and say,


look, I know I haven't paid $500 worth of traffic tickets,


but I'm actually financially responsible.  I have a ton of


money in the bank, and so you ought to give me a


relaxation of the rules or a waiver --


QUESTION:  There's always such a mechanism


whenever you have a debtor and a creditor.  The creditor


can always extend the payment.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Right, but --


QUESTION:  You need some special power from the


State to do that?


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, but again, if you look,


and what the regulator is doing is extending the --


extending the payment not as a creditor, but as a


regulator, I think you're in a very different situation.


QUESTION:  So you're just making up a regulatory


purpose, as a regulator.  I mean, as a regulator, as a


creditor you can always say it's being done as a


regulator, always.

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  I really don't think that's


true, with respect.  I think the kind of waiver proceeding


or opportunity to relax the rules would be out of place in


a regulatory regime that was only concerned with timely


payment.  It's precisely because the FCC uses the timely


payment, or the failure to make timely payment, as a proxy


for a public interest determination that it has this


waiver proceeding, and it gives the regulating entity --


QUESTION:  That's something that I don't fully


grasp in your argument.  First you say, this is fully


automatic, this cancellation of the license.  You don't


pay up, license gone.  But then you say, but we can extend


the time if we want to.  We can use our discretion.  Well,


the automatic argument seems at war with the discretion


argument.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, I mean, there is some


tension there, and the FCC has been at pains to try to


make sure that it doesn't bend over one way too far or the


other.  In its restructuring order that I think is


critical in this case.  It froze the payments -- it


suspended the payments ultimately for 18 months, and then


it also provided some restructuring options that required


further modifications of its rules.


QUESTION:  Well --


GENERAL CLEMENT:  When it did that --

 QUESTION:  Go ahead.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  When it did that, not only did


some people complain that they didn't give enough


regulatory relief, but other disappointed bidders ran to


the D.C. Circuit and said, look, you've acted arbitrarily


and capriciously because you haven't stuck with your


pre-auction rules.


QUESTION:  But this doesn't sound at all like


the question presented, which says at auction,


automatically cancel upon the winning bidder's failure to


make timely payments to fulfill its winning bid.  It --


when you were drafting that question, it sounds like your


perception of the thing was quite different than it is


now.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, again I think the key


is, the payments do cancel automatically after all the


efforts to get the payments extended have failed, and


that's just not like a hypothetical consideration in this


case, because in this very case --


QUESTION:  I agree, you've said two different


things there.  If it's automatic, it happened without


whatever happened next.  But you're saying it


automatically canceled after attempts to collect failed.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  No, no, not after attempts


to --

 QUESTION:  So when was the automatic trigger?


GENERAL CLEMENT:  The automatic trigger is when


somebody fails to make a payment --


QUESTION:  All right.  Is that enough?


GENERAL CLEMENT:  And -- no, it's really not


enough, if you look at the broader perspective of the


regulation, because there's an alternative way to get out


of the automatic cancellation.  It's not -- if you're a


regulated entity and you don't want your license to


cancel, you don't go to the commission and say, don't


apply the automatic cancellation.  What you do is, you go


to the commission and you say, I've a regulatory payment. 


It's going to be due April 30.  I'm not in a good position


to make that payment, so what I'd like you to do is relax


the payment deadline, and --


QUESTION:  And you say you have the authority to


relax the payment date?


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Not only does the commission


have the authority to do that --


QUESTION:  If that's true --


GENERAL CLEMENT:  -- it did it in this very


case.


QUESTION:  If that's true, why don't you settle


the case today?  They say they can pay in full today.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, the reason we don't

settle the case today, although obviously there were


efforts to try to settle this, which would require


congressional legislation, which we were unable to get in


a timely fashion, but the reason that they are not in a


position to cure their defaults, if you will, is because


our view is that they have -- the opportunity to cure has


passed.  The licenses have actually already --


QUESTION:  But is the option to cure -- if you


wanted to settle, would you be disabled from settling, or


could you settle, decide, well, we think it would be wise


regulation now to accept the payment?


GENERAL CLEMENT:  I think it would be within the


agency's discretion to settle the litigation at this


point.  Now, of course, if we did that, I'm sure, as in


the last time the commission tried to relax its rules, I'm


sure we'd draw a D.C. Circuit challenge to that exercise


of discretion to relax the rules.  But the very fact that


there is that reservoir of discretion to relax the rules


demonstrates that the ultimate cancellation is not a 


sole-cause cancellation.


QUESTION:  I think -- so it is really a legal


issue, whether you have that discretion or not?  I mean,


there are people who say you don't have that discretion.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  Well, do we have to decide that in

this case?  I didn't realize that was one of the issues


presented.  That may be a more important issue than the,


you know, few billion dollars involved here.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well --


QUESTION:  Right?


(Laughter.)


GENERAL CLEMENT:  But I don't think -- whether


or not the FCC has the authority to exercise that


discretion in a particular case might be an issue, but


it's undisputed that they have that right as a general


matter and, in fact, NextWave wouldn't be here today if


the FCC didn't have the authority to offer discretionary


relaxation of its rules.  When NextWave's --


QUESTION:  Well, you might not be here, but I


mean, we're just assuming that it had that.  The case is


here.  That is not one of the questions presented.  I


frankly don't want to decide that question, because that


is not one of the things I've given a lot of attention to. 


It sounds to me very, you know, at least quite arguable


whether they ought to have that authority.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Scalia, I don't


really think it's in dispute, because in this very case


the payment deadline --


QUESTION:  I agree it's not in dispute, which


means we don't have to decide it.  It's not presented in

the case.


QUESTION:  -- the question.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, I --


QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, the respondent also


makes a right-to-cure argument under the bankruptcy law,


and you haven't addressed that, I take it, in your briefs,


anyway.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  No.  We think the


right-to-cure argument is best addressed on remand.  I do


think there are two reasons why the right to cure is not


any longer available to NextWave.  One is that the


licenses automatically canceled on their own terms.  The


second reason is that the license restriction, the


licenses themselves had a restriction on transfer or


alienation, and there's law under 11 U.S.C. 365 that deals


with executory obligations that says that the debtor in


possession cannot take possession of a license, assume the


obligations of a license if there are restrictions on its


alienation or transfer.


QUESTION:  In FCC practice, have you ever


revoked a license and then decided that you're going to


reissue it to the initial holder?


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, there have been


situations like that, not necessarily in the C-Block


license situation, but there was a situation with respect

to a different program where a license canceled by its own


terms by a failure to renew, and the commission renewed


that license largely on the basis of the fact that that


licensee was already providing service, and so the result


of revoking the license would be to deny people service


that was currently being provided.


Now, in the reconsideration order that's the


subject --


QUESTION:  Well, a reconsideration order is


different, but a new issuance it seems to me is quite


questionable so far as the discretion of the agency, and I


think I agree with some of my colleagues, I'm not sure


that's before us.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, I think that particular


instance is particularly relevant, because NextWave relied


on that in its reconsideration proceedings before the


commission.  And the commission, in rejecting that, I


think demonstrated why this isn't a case of sole-cause


cancellation.  If you look at the commission's reasoning


on page 82a of the petition appendix, the commission says,


quote, "NextWave is providing no service.  The spectrum


licensed to NextWave has gone unused since early 1997, and


represents licenses in 90 markets across the United


States."


QUESTION:  But that same order repeatedly refers

to the automatic cancellation rule.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Absolutely, it does, and what


the commission decided in this order, which is under


review in this case, is that it was not going to relax or


provide an exception to the automatic cancellation rule,


but the reason it decided that is because NextWave wasn't


providing service, and that others stood ready to provide


service under that spectrum, and what I would respectfully


suggest is that under those circumstances the cancellation


is not a sole-cause cancellation.


It also reflects the fact that NextWave wasn't


providing service, that others stood ready to do it, and


that's enough to take it out of 525, which is, after all,


a very narrowly written provision.  It only protects


against sole cancellation.  It allows the failure to pay a


dischargeable debt to be a contributing factor in a


regulatory decision, indeed, the primary factor in the


regulatory decision, just not the sole cause.


QUESTION:  May I ask just one question about


your interpretation of the automatic cancellation?  Is it


the commission's view that they could -- there would be a


cancellation, they could reauction the licenses, and that


the original licensee would still remain liable for the


entire debt?


GENERAL CLEMENT:  I think the position is they

might have an opportunity to go after that as an unsecured


debt in bankruptcy.


QUESTION:  Yes, but they would remain liable for


the entire debt, in your view?


GENERAL CLEMENT:  That's true.


I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for


rebuttal.


QUESTION:  Well, may I just follow up on that? 


I mean, I assumed that was not an issue here because they


had auctioned them off again and they had mitigated their


damages.  Is that the way the commission treated it?


GENERAL CLEMENT:  That's an open question before


the commission that they haven't addressed.


Thank you.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Clement.


Mr. Franklin, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN


ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS ARCTIC SLOPE


REGIONAL CORPORATION, ET AL.


MR. FRANKLIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The question in this case is whether section 525


of the Bankruptcy Code permits a bankrupt company and a


bankruptcy judge to override the FCC's regulatory


determination of the public interest and thereby allow the

company to retain an exclusive entitlement to use the


Nation's airwaves that the FCC and Congress have


determined is not in the public interest for it to hold.


QUESTION:  You refer to it as a regulatory


determination which, of course, assumes the whole point at


issue.


MR. FRANKLIN:  Well, I don't think it -- I think


that that, in fact, is undisputed as this case comes


before the Court, that the FCC had valid regulatory


reasons for taking the action it did. 


QUESTION:  Then why is it phrased in terms of an


automatic cancellation rule?


MR. FRANKLIN:  Because the automatic


cancellation happened in November of 1998, but one cannot


look at that as a mere snapshot.  You have to look at the


reasons why the FCC had that rule and the reasons why the


FCC had their auction --


QUESTION:  Why do you have to look at the


reasons?  I mean, that's what troubles me.  The language


of the statute simply says that a governmental unit may


not revoke a charter, franchise, or other similar grant,


okay -- it goes on, solely because --


MR. FRANKLIN:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- such person is or has been a


debtor, blah, blah, or hasn't made a payment.  Solely

because.


MR. FRANKLIN:  Right.


QUESTION:  Now, let's assume that there is a


Federal statute that makes discrimination because of, or


failure to hire someone, or let's say, let's say killing


someone solely because of his race --


MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- a crime, a separate crime.  And


someone, let's assume he kills someone who is Jewish, and


he said, well, I didn't kill him solely because he was


Jewish; I killed him because I disagree with the policies


of Israel.  Does that get him out of the statute?


MR. FRANKLIN:  Well, I'm not aware of a statute


like that, that says, solely because --


QUESTION:  Oh, I made it up.


MR. FRANKLIN:  I know that, but --


(Laughter.)


MR. FRANKLIN:  But it's important.  The section


525 is drafted -- is an antidiscrimination statute, but


it's drafted differently than other -- title VII, for


example, does not use the word --


QUESTION:  I'm getting to the question of


whether the fact that you have some other motive --


MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- eliminates the sole causality.

The only reason this person was killed was because he was


Jewish, and so also here, the only reason this license was


terminated is because the person hadn't paid.


Now, there may be some regulatory motive in the


background, just as in the hypothetical that I invented


there was some international political motive in the


background, but that doesn't alter the fact that the


person was killed solely because he was Jewish, and it


seems to me that the license here was revoked solely


because the payment hadn't been made.


MR. FRANKLIN:  With respect, Your Honor, the


term because, when it is used in antidiscrimination


statutes, and we have cited cases on page 3 of our reply


brief, is used to mean motive.  Because means, for the


reason that.  That's what the definition of the word,


because -- when Congress drafted section 525, it drafted


the statute narrowly.  It intended to prohibit


arbitrary --


QUESTION:  Then the statute doesn't cover


anything, because every regulatory body that cancels a


license, whenever there's a license involved, you can say


that there is some regulatory motive, as in the


hypothetical that I gave to Mr. Clement.


MR. FRANKLIN:  Well --


QUESTION:  The motor vehicle cancellation.

 MR. FRANKLIN:  I think that -- under section


525, the mere fact that an agency has said it has a


regulatory motive is not sufficient.  It has to be a valid


one that is not simply an arbitrary attempt to collect a


debt, and, Your Honors --


QUESTION:  Okay, can -- on that point, do you


agree that the statute is a response to -- the Perez case,


the automobile cancellation?


MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  There was a regulatory motive there.


The regulatory motive is financially responsible drivers. 


The benefits of that are obvious.


MR. FRANKLIN:  Well --


QUESTION:  So if that situation is supposed to


be covered by the statute, then by a parity of reasoning,


so would this one be.


MR. FRANKLIN:  But in Perez the Court examined


that motive and determined that looking at the statute and


looking at the way it operated, in fact, as the Court put


it, the sole emphasis of the statute was not the


regulatory purpose.  It was -- as the Court said, the sole


emphasis was the collection of debts.


QUESTION:  Okay, then sole emphasis and sole


purpose really boils down not to exclusiveness but a kind


of proximate or principal causation theory, and if that's

the case, certainly here the FCC treated the debtor


relationship as the principal determinant of the various


steps that it took.  First, it insisted on its 4 billion,


then when the market changed it said, forget it, we want


to reauction, and if it's a principal or proximate kind of


causation theory, I don't see how you can prevail.


MR. FRANKLIN:  I don't think that section 525


embodies a causation theory in the way that Your Honor is


postulating.  I think that section 525 most specifically


speaks about which are the valid considerations that an


agency can look at, and in this case one needs to look at


the auction system that Congress established.


Congress intended to replace the cumbersome


comparative hearings and unjust lotteries of the past with


a new, more streamlined mechanism under which an


entitlement to use our airwaves, everybody's airwaves, is


allocated to the person that, or the company that values


it the most, and the way we know that is that they must


make good on the promises embodied in their auction bid.


QUESTION:  Then why doesn't automatic mean


automatic?  Your brother has just explained that automatic


means sometimes.


MR. FRANKLIN:  Automatic --


QUESTION:  It means automatic without teeth.


MR. FRANKLIN:  Automatic means automatic,

although there are opportunities, as --


QUESTION:  Automatic except where it isn't.


MR. FRANKLIN:  Well --


(Laughter.)


MR. FRANKLIN:  Our position in this case is


that the cancellation was automatic, but that it was


supported by valid regulatory concerns, and those


concerns -- I mean, the auction system mandated by


Congress would be completely vitiated if a bidder -- and I


represent people that, companies that are repeat players


in this game.  Bidders cannot come in and obtain an


entitlement to use our airwaves by promising that they


will make a payment, and that's the reason why they're


selected --


QUESTION:  Then Mr. Franklin, why didn't


Congress provide an exception, as it did in, for


perishable commodities for the Department of Agriculture?


MR. FRANKLIN:  Well --


QUESTION:  If there is this nonbankruptcy


overriding concern, then we have one example where


Congress responded to it by saying the bankruptcy


provision isn't going to prevail.


MR. FRANKLIN:  Well, I -- no exception was


needed here.  The agriculture programs allow the Secretary


of Agriculture to do what the FCC may not do here, and

that is to cancel a license solely because of a failure, a


bankruptcy status.


Now, if you look at the statutes that are cited


in our reply brief, the agriculture statutes, they allow


the Secretary of Agriculture to terminate an agricultural


license where somebody has been discharged from


bankruptcy, ever in the past, or even if a partner or a


shareholder of a company has been discharged from


bankruptcy.


Now, the legislative history of that specific


exemption makes clear that Congress -- there was a debate


in Congress as to whether the solely because language


would cover that, whether there was a regulatory purpose


or not, and Congress felt like they didn't want to have to


deal with that.


In this case, however, it is undisputed there


was a valid regulatory purpose, and with respect, Justice


Scalia, I do not --


QUESTION:  Of course, nothing in the Federal


Communications Act requires the Federal Communications


Commission to stand as the guarantor, you know, to hold


the bag for the person that they're giving away this


multibillion-dollar license to.  They could require cash


on the barrelhead, couldn't they?  And let the person who


wants the license get a loan from some bank, let them be

stuck holding the bag.


MR. FRANKLIN:  But even in that --


QUESTION:  So there's no regulatory necessity


for this whole tragedy, is there?


MR. FRANKLIN:  No, with respect, if one looks at


a cash-on-the-barrelhead system, the way the FCC auctions


work, and our clients are deeply involved in them, one


does not get the license right after becoming the high


bidder.  There is a period of time in which the FCC has to


look at various factors and people have the right to file


petitions to deny.  Under NextWave's interpretation of


section 525, which prohibits an agency from denying a


license to anyone for failing to pay a dischargeable debt,


under their interpretation the FCC would be required to


grant a license to somebody who has been declared the high


bidder and then declares bankruptcy the next day.


What NextWave is doing here is truly gaming the


system.  They are saying, it's a heads I win, tails you


lose scenario.  We can go into bankruptcy, we get the


license because we promised that we would pay more than


anybody else would --


QUESTION:  May I stop you in your hypothetical,


because I thought you don't get the license till after you


have make the down payment.


MR. FRANKLIN:  You make a down payment, and

NextWave made their down payment.


QUESTION:  Yes, but they didn't have any license


until they did that.


MR. FRANKLIN:  But what I'm saying is, even on a


cash-on-the-barrelhead system the FCC does not require


full payment, it can't require full payment until they


actually grant the license, and that is a several-month


lag between the time when you're declared the high


bidder -- in one case, in my client's case it was more


than a year after they were declared the high bidder for


licenses, and they actually received them, because of


proceedings that were filed.


QUESTION:  The rationale offered by the


commission here was that the policies of the FCC outweigh


the policies of the Bankruptcy Act.  Is there authority


for us to defer to the commission in making that kind of a


determination?  I mean, why don't we defer to the


Bankruptcy Court, which says the policies of the


Bankruptcy Act are more important than the policies of the


-- 

MR. FRANKLIN:  I don't think that the FCC has


deference in interpreting the Bankruptcy Code, but I don't


think it's a question of whether one policy outweighs the


other.  I think --


QUESTION:  Well, that's the explicit rationale

exception, the regulatory exception to the automatic --

exact rationale, but we think that the policies can be

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. VERRILLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The record is clear that the FCC revoked


NextWave's licenses solely because NextWave deferred a


payment to the FCC while reorganizing in bankruptcy. Two


and a half years ago the FCC blocked NextWave's bankruptcy


reorganization, and it did so by announcing that


NextWave's licenses had automatically canceled because


NextWave had deferred a loan payment to the FCC in 1998.


QUESTION:  What do you mean, had deferred it?

 MR. VERRILLI:  Well, because NextWave --


QUESTION:  You mean, failed to make it?


MR. VERRILLI:  It did not make it, yes.  It did


not make it.


QUESTION:  Why don't we say that?


MR. VERRILLI:  It did not make it --


(Laughter.)


MR. VERRILLI:  -- in 1998.


QUESTION:  There might have been some legal


mumbo-jumbo that had caused the payment not to be due.


MR. VERRILLI:  Well, we were reorganizing in


bankruptcy --


QUESTION:  You didn't pay it.  You didn't pay


it.


MR. VERRILLI:  -- and we did not pay because we


were reorganizing, that's right.


Now, throughout the proceedings in this case the


FCC has never identified a ground, other than that single


nonpayment, that would support revocation of the licenses,


and that's because there isn't one.  What the FCC has done


instead, and what it's done here this morning, is to


instead suggest that section 525 of the Bankruptcy Code


ought not apply because the FCC had a regulatory or public


interest purpose for making a nonpayment an automatic sole


trigger for revocation of a license, but in passing the

Bankruptcy Code, Congress already weighed the public


interests, and section 525 of the code is a clear


expression of Congress's judgment about where the public


interest lies.


QUESTION:  But they say it's not automatic. 


What do you say to that?


MR. VERRILLI:  I think the record utterly and


completely refutes that proposition, and it does so in the


following ways.  The regulation that they cite, which is


1.2110 of their rules, and it's at page 495 of the


appendix to the petition, says that the licenses cancel


automatically upon nonpayment.  The face of the license


says that the licenses cancel automatically upon


nonpayment and for no other reason.


The announcement of the license cancellation in


this case in January 2000 said that the licenses canceled


automatically for nonpayment and no other reason.


QUESTION:  But we know how the commission has


interpreted it.  I mean, they did say, we're going to give


you a moratorium.  We're going to give you a chance, and


we'll make a deal for you.  You give back some of those


licenses, and we'll work out a settlement, and for one


year the FCC said, it's okay if you don't pay while we're


considering some kind of settlement, so --


MR. VERRILLI:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, in the

restructuring orders they did do that, but that doesn't


make the revocation any less automatic.  All it did was


move the date back in a legislative, quasi-legislative


rulemaking, move the date from when it would initially


have occurred to a later time.  When --


QUESTION:  But if there had been such a


settlement, then there could have been some, at least,


licenses retained even though there had been the


nonpayment, which is supposed to be an automatic trigger.


MR. VERRILLI:  Well, yes, Justice Ginsburg, but


the date was suspended by the FCC well in advance.  The


payment date was suspended well in advance of its


occurrence, so a payment date never came and went without


NextWave or any other licensee failing to make a payment. 


All that happened here was that in advance of the payment


date, the FCC moved the payment date, but when it did so,


it reaffirmed --


QUESTION:  There had not been a failure to make


an earlier payment?


MR. VERRILLI:  That's exactly right, Justice


Scalia.  This was suspended in advance of the due date for


the first payment.


QUESTION:  Okay, so --


QUESTION:  Mr. Verrilli, let me ask you about


something else.  The bankruptcy court, as I understand it,

ordered a $3.7 billion reduction in the purchase price on


constructive broad grounds, is that right?


MR. VERRILLI:  That is right, Justice O'Connor.


QUESTION:  And if we were to affirm here, does


the FCC have any power to prevent a bankruptcy court from


reducing the price in that fashion?


MR. VERRILLI:  Yes.


QUESTION:  That's very strange.


MR. VERRILLI:  Yes, it does, and it's already


been taken care of, in fact.  The question under the


avoidance provisions of the Bankruptcy Code is when the


debtor's obligation becomes due, and the issue here was


whether the obligation became due on the date of the


auction or, instead, later, at the time the licenses were


awarded.  Now, that is a matter entirely within the


control of the FCC.  All they have to do is make clear in


their regulations when the obligation attaches.


The reason that there was a problem here was


that the regulations suggested that the obligation


attached later and, therefore, if the value of the asset


declined from the time of the initial auction to the time


of the license award, section 544 would apply.  But the


FCC has changed its regulations, and at this point it is


unambiguous that the obligation attaches at the time of


the auction -- and therefore 544 can't operate.

 QUESTION:  Well, didn't the second circuit set


aside the bankruptcy order in that case? 


MR. VERRILLI:  -- and it did.  It's just a


nonissue.  It's just -- that issue is just a nonissue, and


in any event it isn't -- the question really here is


whether the FCC, when it effectively acts as a lender, is


going to be treated any differently than a private company


when it acts as a lender.


QUESTION:  That is the question.  That's my


question.  As I read the statute, it seems to me, for at


least your argument's sake, it is solely because, and


moreover, of course this statute governs the FCC, but in


reading the statute, I don't see how this statute was at


all intended to govern the instance in which the


Government is acting as creditor in respect to receiving


payment for a good that it has sold.


Now, I base that on first reading the purposes


of this in the history, and reading the whole legislative


history, which will not convince some of my colleagues, 


but nonetheless is a factor in what I think, and I think


that this is clearly about a future loan, a future


situation in which the future situation, the Government is


forbidden to discriminate against a human being because he


was once in bankruptcy.


This seems to be to balance, to bring back into

balance the Government vis-a-vis the private creditor.  If


you're right in your interpretation, and I am wrong, I see


no way whatsoever in which the Government would have the


right to take a secured interest or in any other way


collect a debt which a human being owes it for buying a


license.


response.


Now, that's my question.  I want to get your


MR. VERRILLI:  My response is the following,


Justice Breyer.  First, the text of 525 is unambiguous. 


It applies to someone who is or was a debtor, and it


applies to debts that are dischargeable, as well as those


that have been discharged and, therefore, it is clear on


the face of the statute that it applies and protects


companies while they are reorganizing and before the debts


are discharged, so I think on the face of the statute


that's -- it's not correct.  It's not the right reading of


the statute.


And in terms of what it does in operation, it's


this.  Now, if -- if this had been a situation where the


FCC had demanded cash on the barrelhead up front, and


NextWave had gone and bid and gone out and borrowed that


money from a bank, and had to pay the bank over time, and


then filed for bankruptcy, there would be no question that


that, that the debt to the bank could be reorganized and

disposed of in the normal manner in bankruptcy.


QUESTION:  Well, I'm not sure about that.  I


think if you accept the FCC's argument here, they would


say we have a regulatory purpose, because we want it -- we


want these licenses to be given to people who have the


financial responsibility to operate the radio stations and


so forth.  The arguments they made would continue to apply


to that situation.


MR. VERRILLI:  Well --


QUESTION:  So I wouldn't say there's no


question.


MR. VERRILLI:  That's a --


QUESTION:  I think if we accept their argument


here, we would probably have to accept it in the other


situation.


MR. VERRILLI:  Well, I think if we -- well, I


think that that point is exactly right, Justice Scalia,


that the Government's regulatory purpose argument, if


accepted, would give them the authority to revoke licenses


not only when the payment was not made to the Government,


but not made to private parties.


QUESTION:  So far, I'm trying to get the answer


to my question, and so far, in terms of my interpretation,


the second point you made is in terms of to the


applicability, if my interpretation is right.  I want to

know if it's right, and I only come up with one thing that


you've said so far, which is text, which is important --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  -- but I learned the second year of


law school, I learned the second year of law school -- and


obviously many of my colleagues don't agree with me, but I


learned the second year of law school that when you have a


text which says "all," that there are often implied, not-


written exceptions.  All animals in the park.  No animals


in the park doesn't necessarily apply to a pet oyster,


okay, and so --


QUESTION:  Well, it's not an animal. 


QUESTION:  Thank you.  An oyster in my course in


biology is an animal, all right.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  Maybe in yours it was a rock, or a


vegetable or a mineral.  But regardless, you see my point,


and my question, of course, is that since that's how I


read statutes -- not everybody -- is that I find


exceptions implicit in statutes where to fail to read that


exception is to destroy the purpose of the statute, and is


not backed by anything in respect to what the people who


wrote it want.


MR. VERRILLI:  Well --


QUESTION:  Now, I believe it destroys the

purpose of the statute because I see no way in which the


Government as creditor could collect the money it's owed


through a secured interest in what they've sold, if my


interpretation is wrong.


MR. VERRILLI:  No, it --


QUESTION:  Now, I'm putting that as strong as I


can.  I want to get a complete answer.


MR. VERRILLI:  Two points.  First, the


Government can collect its interest as a secured creditor


in exactly the same way a private lender could through the


bankruptcy system.  It has enormous protections through


the bankruptcy system as a secured creditor.  It gets,


it's 100 percent entitled under the Bankruptcy Code to the


full value of the licenses, and it has numerous other


protections under the code.  It can make an election


under --


QUESTION:  Can I stop you right there?  How does


it do that?  Because when it goes to enforce its secured


interest, I take it it's revoking the license because of


the money that was due it.  And so how do you -- when you


go in to enforce your secured interest in the bankruptcy


court, and the bankruptcy judge on the other side reads


525(c), 525 on your interpretation, how does he do it?


Because it's just like this case.  They're revoking it.


MR. VERRILLI:  You can't -- the FCC, like a

private lender, can't foreclose on the lien.  It has to --


its debt has to be processed through the bankruptcy


system.


QUESTION:  Of course it should.  That's logical. 


My point is, how does the bankruptcy judge at that point


get around the language of 525, on your interpretation of


it, since on your interpretation of it, you would be


taking back the license because of failure to pay a debt.


MR. VERRILLI:  Right.  They can't -- under the


Bankruptcy Code they can't take back the license.  They


can get their secured claim paid to the same extent that a


private lender could, but they can't --


QUESTION:  So they cannot take a secured


interest in the license?


MR. VERRILLI:  Yes, they can, and -- but just


as --


QUESTION:  They don't take the license back if


they cause the debtor to have to sell the license and to


take the money from the sale of the license and give it to


the FCC.  Isn't that what's going on?  That's different


from a cancellation of the license.  The license subsists,


and the debtor can sell it to somebody else, or the


bankruptcy court on behalf of the debtor can sell it to


somebody else, is that right?  Does that need approval


from the FCC?

 MR. VERRILLI:  The transfer would, to somebody


else would need approval from the FCC, but the key point


here is that section 525 --


QUESTION:  But that's different from a


cancellation, isn't it?


MR. VERRILLI:  Yes, it is different from a


cancellation, and the key point here I think, Justice


Breyer, in answer to your question ultimately, is that 525


is in the Bankruptcy Code to protect the right to


reorganize.  What it says is that those who hold


Government licenses cannot be denied the ability to invoke


the bankruptcy process and reorganize solely because they


do what the Bankruptcy Code allows them to do.


Without this protection, licensing agencies would


have the ability to force insolvent debtors to liquidate,


because it would have the power to revoke their permission


to do business solely because they hadn't paid a debt, or


solely because even they were in bankruptcy, and that


would --


QUESTION:  Can the FCC -- can an FCC licensee


encumber the license?  Can it pledge the license to


some -- to a bank that's giving it a loan?


MR. VERRILLI:  Yes, it can.  It can give it as


a -- it can -- the answer to that is yes.  There are some


restrictions on it, but the answer to that is yes, it can.

 If I could, I'd like to get back to the question


of whether this was, in fact, an automatic revocation, and


the reconsideration order, which is the order under review


here, is the order in which the FCC says principally that


it departed from the automatic character of the


revocation, but that reconsideration order says no fewer


than 14 times by my count that the revocation was


automatic, and there's one statement in that in particular


which I think should put to rest as a factual matter the


question of whether this was anything other than an


automatic cancellation, and that's at page 74a of the


appendix to the petition, and it's right at the bottom of


the page, before the footnote.


And the FCC says in the reconsideration order,


thus, the only way that NextWave could have avoided the


loss of its licenses, even under the rule interpretation


it urges, was to avoid a default by making full and timely


payment on or before the payment due date.  If the only


way that NextWave could have avoided default was by making


the payment, then there is nothing else that could have


been shown, and nothing else that could have happened in


the reconsideration process or any waiver process, that


would have provided an additional ground for revocation.


And if I could also point the court to a


statement on the prior page, page 73a:  For all these

reasons we reject NextWave's interpretation of our default


and cancellation rules and reaffirm that the failure to


make full payment in a timely manner, following exhaustion


of all applicable grace periods, constitutes a default and


results in the automatic cancellation of the license


without further commission action.


Their theory is that this happens by operation


of law on the day after nonpayment.  It is as automatic as


anything can be, and nothing about the reconsideration


process, and nothing about their waiver authority changes


that one iota.


QUESTION:  Well, at least according to this


presentation the FCC said that it does have discretion to


grant relief from the automatic cancellation.


MR. VERRILLI:  Well, but they said in the


reconsideration order that they were not going to do that,


ever, because it was an automatic cancellation.


They also said in the restructuring orders,


Justice Ginsburg, that you referred to earlier, in each of


the restructuring orders they said they would not grant a


waiver of the payment deadline under any circumstances,


and then when individual licensees sought waivers, the FCC


rejected the waiver requests, and it cited back to those


provisions in the restructuring order saying, we told you


this was an automatic rule, and we reject your request,

and it did so even in instances, in two cases where the


licensees were providing service.  And so there's just no


question that this was an automatic cancellation rule and


therefore precisely at the core of what section 525


forbids the FCC or any other licensing agencies from


doing.


If I may, I want to turn to the question of


whether there is any conflict between the FCC's exercise


of its authority under section 309(j) and the Bankruptcy


Code.  The answer is, as a statutory matter there is no


conflict, because the FCC was not required to have an


installment payment plan, and even if it were required to


have one there wouldn't be a conflict because Congress


didn't say that the FCC had to make license revocation


automatic upon nonpayment.  So the FCC's argument really


is an implied repeal argument here, that 309(j) implicitly


repeals 525 in some applications, but --


QUESTION:  Assuming we think there's a conflict,


is there any authority for the agency's assertion that it


has the authority to determine which statute outweighs the


other?


MR. VERRILLI:  Yes, and the authority is exactly


contrary to the position that the FCC deserves deference. 


The FCC deserves deference only with respect to


interpretation of its own statute, not with respect to the

Bankruptcy Code.  So the answer is clearly that they don't


get any deference, and -- but there isn't any conflict. 


All there is is the FCC -- there isn't any statutory


conflict.  All there is, the only conflict arises from the


FCC's desire to make this an automatic cancellation rule,


and the conflict is between an FCC policy choice and a


directive from Congress.  When the conflict is at that


level, there's no doubt about what the answer is, which is


that the directive from Congress prevails.


QUESTION:  If they just simply changed their


rules to say the FCC "may" cancel the license in the event


of the nonpayment of any installment, that would be


enough?


MR. VERRILLI:  No.


QUESTION:  No?


MR. VERRILLI:  No, because what 525 forbids are


the grounds on which the license is revoked, so if the


license is revoked solely because of nonpayment of


dischargeable debt, then whether there's a rule or not --


QUESTION:  Oh, it isn't solely because of that. 


That is a necessary but not a sufficient condition.  The


FCC would be saying, we will consider the regulatory


situation.  If you fail to make a payment, you are


revocable, but we won't revoke necessarily.  It depends


upon the regulatory situation.

 MR. VERRILLI:  I think that would violate 525,


but for a different reason.


QUESTION:  Ah, okay.


MR. VERRILLI:  And it's this.  525 doesn't


merely forbid revocation for nonpayment.  It forbids


discrimination, and it forbids imposing conditions solely


because of nonpayment, solely because of being in


bankruptcy, so --


QUESTION:  What does the word "solely" do?  I


can follow what you just said if it simply said because


of, but Congress wrote solely, and that has to have some


function.


MR. VERRILLI:  I think it does have several


functions.  For example, Your Honor, the FCC has a build-


out rule for these licenses, says you have to build them


out within 5 years, and to serve, a requirement that we


were in compliance with, by the way.  But if we hadn't


been in compliance with them and the FCC had moved to


revoke the licenses because we weren't in compliance with


the build-out rule, and we had said, well, the reason we


are not in compliance with the build-out rule is that


we're in bankruptcy and we can't pay the vendors to build


it out, that would be a situation in which the FCC could


enforce its rule, even though at some level it is because


we were in bankruptcy.  It's just not "solely" because.

It's because we violated a neutral rule that was not


focused solely on nonpayment.  And I think there would be


other circumstances in which the fact of nonpayment could


be a consideration in a broader or a different -- in a


broader or different set of circumstances.


But when you have what you have here, is where


it is the only consideration, the only factor, the


determinative consideration, that is the paradigm case of


violation of 525.  What the FCC has done, it's --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Verrilli.


Mr. Tribe, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE


ON BEHALF OF CREDITORS NEXTWAVE 


COMMUNICATIONS, INC., as amicus curiae


MR. TRIBE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


Clearly, we're dealing in 525 with something


that is an exercise of regulatory power, and as several


members of the Court have noted, it's always possible to


say, even though we are revoking or canceling this license


automatically because you didn't make the payment, we have


other motives in mind, responsible, financially


responsible drivers on the road.  We are not simply out to


get you because of the dollars.


That's, of course, not what this statute is

about.  The whole point of the Perez decision was to get


rid of Kesler and Reitz, which required peering into the 


mind of the bureaucrats, not always a wonderful vision to


behold, and not clear.  This is a causation provision, and


let me turn to Justice Ginsburg's question from the


perspective of creditors who need to be able to rely on a


bright line test of whether something was done solely


because of nonpayment of a dischargeable debt, or solely


because of insolvency, or solely because of an invocation


of Chapter 11.


The word solely, I think, does serve a function


there, and that is, in its absence I suppose it would be


possible for a licensee in regulatory default, a licensee


who hadn't built out, to hide behind the existence of a


fiscal default and say, you see, it's because of the fact


that I didn't make a payment, not because I didn't build


out.  Then one has a complicated mess, and from the point


of view of creditors who need to know whether an agency is


going to pull out the lifeline without which this entire


edifice collapses and is just a bunch of hardware, not


worth anything more than the separate parts, from the


point of view of creditors who need to know, it seems to


me a very clear test is needed, and that is, was this the


sole trigger?  Have they come up with some other


substantive, independent basis which either was the

necessary cause or a sufficient cause?  That's what the


D.C. Circuit said, and it makes sense.


QUESTION:  Mr. Tribe, what do you say in


response to Justice Breyer's point that the statute really


deals with a situation in which the Government agency is


not the creditor?  That's what it basically was --


MR. TRIBE:  Well, I -- in a way, I think that


that makes our point all the stronger, that is, even when


the agency has no conflict of interest, it might not be in


it for the money, and one wonders here why, for example, 


why they don't yank the license when the debt is owed to


private creditors?  Doesn't that show in just the same way


that they're not reliable?  That is, in this very case --


QUESTION:  No, no -- well, they want their money


is all.


MR. TRIBE:  Well, money --


QUESTION:  They want their money, but there are


taxicab licenses, there are nuclear power licenses --


licensing is the most common thing in the world.  You


often pay for it, and what I really am worried about is,


imagine they took a secured interest in the license, and


on your interpretation, how do they get the taxicab


license back --


MR. TRIBE:  Well --

QUESTION:  Yes.  Yes.

confirmation the license is one of the assets of the


estate, and at that point --


QUESTION:  Well, they could get it back -- in


other words, they could take it back because they didn't


revoke it.


MR. TRIBE:  No, they don't take it back.  That


is, when -- there are a number of things in the estate at


confirmation.


QUESTION:  I'm a creditor, I'm a private


creditor, I say I have a secured interest in this, it's


mine, okay.  I sell it at auction.  Now, the FCC --


MR. TRIBE:  I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.  The


bankruptcy court is filled with elaborate rules about when


you can and cannot foreclose.  That is, an asset is part


of the estate at confirmation, and whether you're going to


be able to get your money back is a function of whether


you are under or oversecured.  There are provisions in


1111(b) for dealing with both situations.  Your situation


is no worse when you are a regulator than the Bank of


America, or one of the clients in our case, Citicorp, and

no better.


QUESTION:  That's the part that's precisely


bothering me, my situation is no worse.


When I read the statute, it seems to me my


situation is worse, because if the statute applies here,


it applies there, and you and your colleague both tell me


no, that isn't so, and if you can show me it isn't so, my


problem disappears.


MR. TRIBE:  What I'm saying, Justice Breyer, is


that after bankruptcy, if NextWave, for example, were to


emerge from bankruptcy they would still have the license,


but only on conditions in which you as the FCC, like other


creditors, in light of your secured interest, had taken an


appropriate piece of the pie.  You don't get it all,


that's the point.  Nor does a private creditor get to


grab the license and all the value from all the other


creditors and, in fact, when you are an agency that is


wearing really two sets of shoes, the ordinary regulator's


running shoes but also the wing tips of the creditor


agency, it makes the situation worse, not better.


That is, this law is designed to assure that


even the agency, which does not have a monetary interest,


can't simply yank all the value for itself because it has


the power over this license.


If the agency, on top of all that, is a creditor

and has that additional set of incentives, then it's all


the worse.  You wonder, for example, why it is that in the


MMDS licenses, in which there are licenses that are held


by a number of bankrupt licensees who did not make the


payments they promised to make, why it is that the FCC


does not regard them as not having been what they looked


like at the time of the bid.  The reason is that it's been


paid in full.  So it really is a situation in which the


FCC's position as a creditor should not redound to its


credit.  If anything, that makes this statute all the more


vital.


The capital formation that is necessary to make


309(j) work, to make it possible, Justice Scalia,


sometimes not to demand all the money up front, but to


have something more creative, maybe demand letters of


credit, guarantees, none of that can work if creditors who


put in over half a billion dollars, not in a gamble but on


a very careful business plan that was completely carried


out, they're not providing service, but Catch-22, it's


because their attempt to emerge and fully cure any default


was frustrated by the agency that saw pie in the sky,


large numbers.


In that situation, for the agency to be able to


collapse the capital formation here tells us something


rather unpleasant about the future.  How likely is it that

Citicorp and the California and Kansas pension funds and


all of the other organizations that have put money in on


reliance on the way section 525 works will do this again


next time around?


The formation of capital, the market on which


the FCC chose to rely, choosing to rely in the capacity of


a first lender, with no more or less secured protection


than others, that whole system depends on, in the most


literal sense, the rule of law.  It does not depend on the


question whether we can attribute to the regulator some


motive that does not relate solely to the money.  So if


the system is to work the way the FCC claims, 525 is a


dead letter.


Now, if you were right, Justice Breyer, if there


really was a problem that couldn't be solved in the way


the confirmation rules work, in the way the pie is divided


up, then maybe, as with perishable commodities, there


would be a problem for Congress to solve.  Congress has in


section 523 enumerated 18 categories of debts that are not


dischargeable in bankruptcy, and sometimes it does it in


another statute, not always in the Bankruptcy Code.  These


are policy judgments about whether something is unique


about the situation that requires treating the Government


in some different way, the way the Department of


Agriculture is treated.

 QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Tribe.


MR. TRIBE:  Thank you.


QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, you have 3 minutes


remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT


ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER


FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 


Let me first address Justice O'Connor's very proper


concern that licensees are going to be able to enjoy their


licenses for much less than they agreed to pay the


commission.  That is not a dead letter and, in fact, one


of the cases that is being held for this case involves


Kansas PCS, where the bankruptcy court approved the plan


that gave the FCC 5 cents on the dollar for the value of


its licenses.


Now, it's true that one mechanism to get the


licenses for less than they paid for, the fraudulent


conveyance theory, is something that the FCC can address. 


That was the GWI bankruptcy, where the FCC only got 16


cents on the dollar.  But there's a second way to do it,


which is to only give the FCC the value for its security


interest, the value of the licenses at that point, and the


bankruptcy court did that in Kansas PCS, and only gave the


commission 5 cents on the dollar.

 Second, let me address Justice Kennedy's concern


with, where's the authority for the FCC to take into


account bankruptcy policy concerns?  The authority comes


from a D.C. Circuit decision called LaRose, which is cited


on page 79a of the decision, the reconsideration decision


that's under review.  The LaRose decision is a D.C.


Circuit decision that tells the FCC that it must take


bankruptcy policy considerations into account.


Now --


QUESTION:  It's not binding on us, certainly?


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, it is binding on the


FCC, though, and the FCC tried to do its best to take


bankruptcy considerations into account.  Now, if it failed


to do it properly --


QUESTION:  But this, they're saying that they're


not going to take bankruptcy considerations into account.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  No, they did.  They did, and


again I think they -- one of the reasons they took


bankruptcy considerations into account is by extending


payments for all the C-Block licensees for 18 months.  But


if you think the problem here is that the FCC didn't do


the right balancing of bankruptcy policy and


telecommunications policy, then the D.C. Circuit or this


case could reverse for an arbitrary capriciousness, but


that's not the role of 525.

 525 is an exceedingly narrow provision that


simply prevents a regulator under any circumstances from


canceling a license solely because, and here it's just not


true that the failure to make a payment was the sole


trigger, because you have to look at it in context, and


what triggered default is the failure to make a payment of


a payment that was due for a particular reason.


Now, anybody in -- any FCC licensee could have


gone to the commission and tried to get a further


extension of that payment deadline.  They'd already gotten


extended 18 months.  They could have gotten extended even


further, and it's hard for me to understand how there's a


sole trigger when the very payment deadline that is


supposed to be -- trigger the automatic cancellation is


itself the reflection of a multifactor public interest


determination by the commission.  They extended it 18


months but no further, based on a consideration of the


public interest.


Now, on Justice Breyer's concern about what's


going on here, I think your concern is exactly right, and


what sense does it make from a bankruptcy policy to


disable the Government to make installment payments?


QUESTION:  Exactly right.  Why didn't you argue


it?


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, I think -- no, I


55

think -- I think --


(Laughter.)


GENERAL CLEMENT:  I think -- there's two reasons


we didn't argue it.  One, we did -- there is that flavor


in the brief, but the other reason is, you at one point


said, doesn't the commission just want the money?  That's


actually not true.  What we want is, we want the licenses


back --


QUESTION:  I know, but if they did, it's such an


obvious argument that I feel there's something wrong with


it because you didn't argue it.


GENERAL CLEMENT:  Don't worry -- thank you, Your


Honor.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Clement.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
