CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

this -- this morning in Case No. 15-827, Endrew F. v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Douglas County School District. 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Fisher. 

 

           

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The IDEA does not permit a school district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to provide a child with a disability a barely more than 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

de minimis educational benefit.  Rather, what the Act 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires is for the school to provide instruction and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

related services to the child that are reasonably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calculated to provide substantially equal educational 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunities. 

            

The school district's primary response to 

 

 

 

 

 

our argument is that the standard I just described to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you does not appear anywhere in the operative text of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the IDEA.  But let me get right to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it also -- it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

also didn't appear anywhere in the original petition, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did it?  I'm looking at Footnote 8 in your -- your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opening brief where you note that substantial

educational benefit was the standard that was discussed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the petition and then a significantly different one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

in your -- your opening brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't intend it to be significantly different.  What we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do intend, as we describe in that footnote, is to give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more detail as to how the standard works. I'd say --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The standard -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

standard you're asking us to adopt, substantially equal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity, that does appear someplace.  It appears in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Blackmun's concurring opinion in Rowley, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court itself did not adopt that formulation, did not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopt substantially equal opportunity.  So you're asking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

us to adopt a standard that the majority already had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before it and didn't adopt. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Justice Ginsburg, yes, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Blackmun proposed a standard similar to the one that we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offered the Court today, but that was 1982.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress has amended the IDEA twice, in 1997 and in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2004.  And in the findings and purposes, it now 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

describes the way the Act works with exactly the words 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm giving you:  Equal educational opportunity. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that raises a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

concern under the Spending Clause.  I mean, the Spending 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause operations are pretty clear.  The Federal

government proposes a deal to the States.  If the States 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

want the money, they have to agree to these provisions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And now you're saying that the content of those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions, though, is changed by new legislation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I just wonder whether that puts some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

strain on the idea that the States have agreed to these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions when they accepted the offer under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Spending Clause. 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  No, I don't think it does.  I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

think it's critical to get to the text for exactly the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason you say, Mr. Chief Justice. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We know from Rowley that there's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive guarantee in the IDEA, and we know from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rowley, even in 1982, the way the Act was put together, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that substantive guarantee must track the way that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the IEP provisions -- the individual educational program 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions work.  That's at page 203 and 204 of Rowley. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So to get to the text and exactly what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State agrees to, you start with the FAPE definition, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition for free appropriate public education.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

all agree on that.  Sub D of that definition says that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the school has to provide an education, quote, "in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conformity with the IEP plan." 

 

 

 

 

            

Then, to understand what that means, again, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is straight out of Rowley and straight out of the

text, you turn to what the IEP provisions provide, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

those are laid out at pages 52A and 53A of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's appendix. 

 

            

And, in a nutshell, what they say over and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

over again is that standards, generally speaking, for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children with disabilities should be aimed at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general educational curriculum.  So what you do is you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

start with the general educational curriculum that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies to all kids, then you identify the child's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability and how it impacts that child's ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participate and progress in that general educational 

 

 

 

 

 

 

curriculum. 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How does that work? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  Then --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  How does 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that work with students whose disabilities generally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't allow them in -- in their own -- with their own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potential to follow the general educational curriculum? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I understand how it worked in Rowley --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Right. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- where we were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

dealing with someone with a particular disability, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

one that was rather readily and easily addressed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Here you have a very

different context.  I mean, you would not say that the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

goal here, would you, was to progress consistent with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the general educational curriculum? 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Most likely not all the way up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to grade level in this case, Mr. Chief Justice.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that question, just as you asked me earlier, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expressly answered in the statute. 

 

 

 

 

            

So on page 52A, on the bottom of 52A in sub 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CC, what this -- what the IEP provisions say is that for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children with disabilities who take alternate 

 

 

 

 

 

assessments aligned to alternate achievement standards, 

 

 

 

 

 

a description of benchmarks or short-term objectives are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate.  And then the rest of the IEP provisions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

describe how you set those goals to meet those alternate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

achievement standards. 

 

            

Now, what the Congress is referring to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and let me just emphasize as I go through these 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory provisions, these are all from 2004, much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

postdating Rowley. 

 

            

What Congress is referring to with respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to alternate achievement standards are laid out at page 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

79A of the government's appendix.  These are the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

amendments to the ESEA that Congress enacted in the No 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Child Left Behind Act and that have been aligned with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the IDEA.  So if you look at page 79A, there are four 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

subdivisions -- or five, I'm sorry -- five subdivisions


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

that describe what you do for the child,


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Chief Justice, that you were asking about.  And


  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps the most important is -- are sub 3 and sub 4.


   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So if -- if you'll permit, because the text 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is so important, I'll read them to you. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Sub 3 says that the standards in this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

situation must, quote, "reflect professional judgment as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the highest possible standards achievable by such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

students." 

            

And then what sub 4 does to complete the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

circle and make absolutely clear to the States and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody else that this is required, it says those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards must, quote, "be designated in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individualized education program developed under the 

 

 

 

 

 

IDEA." 

            

So the question you asked is expressly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answered in the text.  It is expressly answered in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IDEA.  And so to bring me back to our standard, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"substantial educational opportunity" are the words 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress used in the findings and purposes to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

encapsulate what is required by these IEPs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I suppose -- I suppose 

    

   

 

 

it's implicit in your standards and in some of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions you read that what we're talking about is the

word "reasonable" that we see throughout the law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

Do -- do you see any -- any function for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that word and, in addition, as part of what reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, is there any place to discuss the cost that the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would -- would be incurred for, say, severely disabled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

students? 

            

MR. FISHER:  Let me answer both 

  

 

 

 

 

reasonableness first and cost second. 

 

 

 

 

            

So reasonableness, yes, is an essential 

 

 

 

 

 

feature of the Act.  And in Rowley itself, the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said that the plan that the -- that the IEP team puts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

together needs to be, quote, "reasonably calculated to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

achieve the level of educational benefit that should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guaranteed." 

            

So, if you go into court -- or actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, you don't start in court; you start with a hearing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer.  And if there's going to be a dispute, what a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parent has to show is that the plan the school adopted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was one that no reasonable educator would have adopted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And so reasonableness is an important part of the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- of the way a court would look at it, the hearing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer, and indeed the IEP teams. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, with specific reference to cost, let me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say three things about cost, Justice Kennedy.  First of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all, the vast, vast majority of IEPs and programs put

together under the statute don't cost much at all.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involve things like providing braille textbooks, 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

providing an iPad, providing some specialized 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction by a -- by a staff member who's already on 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

staff. 

            

There are going to be some extreme cases, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the Court saw one several years ago in the Garrett 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

F. case, which involved a situation where a child with a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

ventilator needed full-time nursing services, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court quite clearly said that even there, where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school district was saying that was going to cost 30 to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$40,000, the Act does not permit cost to trump what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act otherwise requires. 

 

 

            

And the reason why, Justice Kennedy, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because Congress expressly thought about this.  All the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

way back to the 1975 Act what Congress said is this: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Yes, it costs money and that's why it's spending cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislation and that's why we're giving money to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States, but it is cheaper to provide services to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody while they are being educated than it is to pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out of the public fisc for the rest of that person's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life than make up for the deficit that a bad education 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided. 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. -- Mr. Fisher, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

tab here is -- is at $70,000 tuition?

MR. FISHER:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

time this case was litigated, it was more like $40,000 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the private school.  Currently, it is closer to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number you described.  But the tab to put the child in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private school -- remember, the school district had an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity come -- to come forward with -- with a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper IEP plan to provide Drew with a FAPE, and it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply --

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And in your -- in your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

position, what -- in your view, what should have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done for this student? 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  The first and most important 

  

 

 

 

 

 

thing that should have been done is what's known as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behavioral assessment should have taken place to figure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out why Drew's behaviors were so dramatically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interfering with his education.  That's something that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

every reasonable educator would have done; all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

peer-reviewed research say it's vital.  It's the very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

first thing that the private school did in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation.  And if you look at the plans that are laid 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out in the supplemental Joint Appendix, that was never 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done. 

            

And what's -- what's particularly striking, 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kennedy, is that even after Drew was really, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an emergency situation in the spring of his fourth grade

year, put into private school, the parents came back to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the school district again six months later in November 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and said now that we see he's progressing, now that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they've done a behavioral analysis, what will you do, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because we actually would like to have him educated in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the public schools.  And it's amazing that all they did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was offer -- and this is at pages 182 and 183 -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exact same failed behavioral plan that they had been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using in the fourth grade. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Weren't they going to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

what -- the -- the conference that the parents didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attend, they had scheduled a conference, and I thought a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

behavioral expert was part of that conference. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  So there were two conferences, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg.  There was a first one in April of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Drew's fourth grade year that the same old plan was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented with no experts. 

 

 

 

            

They then offered to have another conference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a month later in May, and what the parents decided at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that point is things had reached such a critical and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

emergency stage, that Drew was falling so far behind, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they had to put him in a private school, so they did not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attend that meeting. 

 

 

            

But, Justice Ginsburg, what my friend on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other side leaves out of his brief is that what I just

described, which is the parents did return in the fall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

once Drew had been stabilized and did offer to meet with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the school district.  The school district brought no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

autism expert to that meeting, and the plan that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proposed to deal with his behavior is verbatim the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan that they had offered back in the fourth grade. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so at that point, the -- the parents had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no choice reasonably but to leave Drew in private school 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and to seek remedies under the Act.  And there are going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be -- and I think this returns me to Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kennedy's question about cost.  We recognized, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Congress recognized, and this Court recognized in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Burlington, that there are going to be rare extreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances where children are going to be put into a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private school or otherwise need significant 

 

 

 

 

 

resources --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why didn't the -- why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

didn't the -- the statement that an IEP, what it has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do is it has to, based on peer-reviewed research, when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practicable, will -- will be provided to the child to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advance appropriately towards attaining the annual goals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to make progress in the general education curriculum and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so forth.  So you've just described if the situation is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, wouldn't that have been violated?  Or if they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrote the IEP that way, wouldn't you be able to go to

court and say, look, there is their IEP and they didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

live up to it? 

 

 

 

            

So you already have two arguments under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, and the problem that's working in my mind is if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we suddenly adopt a new standard, all over the country 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we'll have judges and lawyers and -- and -- and people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting it differently and -- and -- so why isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the present situation sufficient? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Besides having nine people 

  

 

 

 

 

who don't know -- I mean, at least speaking for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

myself -- don't know that much about it, creating a new 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard out of legal materials which are at a distance 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the people, the children and the parents, who need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

help. 

            

MR. FISHER:  So I think the critical reason 

   

  

 

 

 

 

why the Court in Rowley itself gestured towards needing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the need for a overall standard that encapsulates the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act and the reason why we ask for it here today is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you will find in every brief in this case -- our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief --

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

MR. FISHER:  -- the red brief, their amicus 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs -- everyone agrees that school districts, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe -- this is at page 29 and 47 of my friend's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

brief.  They agree that the IEP provisions have to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

followed.  Everybody agrees that.  The difficulty is, is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that it just doesn't happen. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I'm sorry if it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't happen.  What are we supposed to do to make it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen?  I mean, you have a statute that certainly seems 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

to say that and you have a system for enforcement.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how does us suddenly using this word "equal" -- you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, the word "equal" has history from a lot of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different areas of law.  And -- and what do you do with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a wide range of -- of disabilities, a huge range in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual students and -- and -- do you see what I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foresee? 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Yes.  I --

    

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I foresee taking the money 

    

 

 

 

 

that ought to go to the children and spending it on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuits and lawyers and all kinds of things that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraneous.  That is what's actually bothering me. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Right.  So let -- let me 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

address -- say a word more about why we need a standard, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then I'll say something about the lawsuits question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you raised. 

 

 

            

So, first, we need a standard because the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Act -- it's best to encapsulate what the IEP provisions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required.  If you don't like the word "equal," I'm

seemingly giving you the word that Congress used when it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

amended the Act, and that very much -- this Court said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very much the same thing in Rowley when it said, in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general situation, a child's plan should be tailored to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow her to advance from grade to grade. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, if you don't want to use the word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"equal," here's what we would suggest, Justice Breyer: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You can say, as a general rule, the IEP provisions and, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore, the FAPE requirement of the Act, demands a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

level of educational services designed to allow the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child to progress from grade to grade in the general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

curriculum. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, suppose we have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

child who is a handicapped child, there's a range of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

people, and they can't do much for them, but they can do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something for them.  And if they can do something for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them, do it. 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But if you, say, measure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that in terms of their ability to progress from grade to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grade, maybe some will; some won't.  And how does that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- it seems to me the word "appropriate" tried to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize that.  And -- and do you want to recognize 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that?  I mean, you can't ask for more than is reasonable 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for them to do.  So -- so what -- what words do we use?

MR. FISHER:  At bottom, we agree that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

there's flexibility in the Act to accommodate each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child's individual potential and needs. 

 

 

 

 

            

But if I could just give a full answer to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

your question, we think that it would be fine if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court just said the IEP should be tailored to achieve in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a general educational curriculum at grade level for most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kids.  And when that is not possible, Justice Breyer, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and this goes back to Mr. Chief Justice's question, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would go to the alternate achievement standards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

according to the language I described to you at page 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

79(a), and that is all straight out of the text of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act.  It's a more complicated --

   

  

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  How so --

  

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  -- way of putting it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  It makes a big difference 

   

  

 

 

 

whether you take the word "equal" out though.  What 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've just said takes the word "equal" out of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard. 

            

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, it might --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't that --

  

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  It might be, Justice Alito, I'm

18 

equal opportunity means when an equal outcome is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practical. 

            

MR. FISHER:  What it means is that you give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- so when you're dealing with a child who cannot 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get to grade level -- I think that's what you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking -- what it means -- and this is in a 2005 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidance document by the Department of Education -- what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it means is you're giving children with disabilities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equally challenging curriculum on the academic side and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in terms of their functional and -- functional and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

developmental goals. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But for those --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  The standard -- I would just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

say the standard is highest possible standards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

achievable directly in the text of the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But for those of us who have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some feeling that the word "equality" is a poor fit for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this statute and its focus on individuation --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- what would you say to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

those of us?  How would you describe what you think is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required without focusing on equality? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  I would say just what the Court 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

said in Rowley for the -- for the typical child with a

disability who can achieve at grade level, which is the

standard that the school district has to try to meet, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

progress in the general educational curriculum --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

child who --

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we're dealing here --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  -- at grade level. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We're dealing here with a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  And then -- and then dealing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with a child who's not going to get there equally 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenging or, Justice Kagan, I would say alternate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

achievement benchmarks, to use exactly the words in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards, that are the highest possible achievable by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the student.  Those are the exact words at page 79(a) of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- of the -- of the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If I could reserve the remainder of my time,

The requirement of a free appropriate public

barely more than de minimis progress.  What it requires 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead is a program that is aimed at significant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

educational progress in light of the child's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances.  What that --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How does that differ --

  

 

 

 

 

 

how does your formulation differ from the one we were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just offered by Mr. Fisher? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  So I think we would take the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

same position with respect to Amy and similar students. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's grade-level competence for students who are in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regular classroom or in the general curriculum. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We're talking about 

  

 

 

 

 

somebody for whom I think you'd agree that that standard 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't apply. 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Right.  And so that is where 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

we have a slight area of disagreement.  We would say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant progress towards grade-level standards, not 

 

 

 

 

 

as close as possible to grade-level standards. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about "meaningful" 

  

 

 

 

instead of "significant"? 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  So we are not committed to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

any one particular terminology.  We think that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"significant" is synonymous with "meaningful."  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

synonymous with progress that's -- reasonably can be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expected.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  "Meaningful" --

  

 

 

MR. GORNSTEIN:  It's progress --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  "Meaningful" was a word 

   

  

 

 

used in Rowley. 

 

 

21 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Yes, it was used in Rowley. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the only reason I would -- of all the terms -- and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I -- and I would give you one more, which is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"appropriate."  In light of the child's circumstances, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

progress that's appropriate. 

 

 

            

The only one I would urge you away from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually is "meaningful."  And the reason is that it has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

baggage in various courts of appeals.  It means 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different things to different courts, and it has been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied in different ways by different courts.  So I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would urge you to pick -- although we think that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

captures what we're saying --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So we should come up with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

our own that can then be applied in different ways in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different courts. 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well, I think the most 

   

  

 

 

 

important thing for you to say is that this is not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

barely more than de minimis standard, and it's not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maximization standard.  What it is, is -- and I would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

leave it to you to choose any of those adjectives that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

--

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  The problem is you say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

leave it to us.  You represent the Department of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

Education here.  They at least have experience with it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and we have far less.  And so, obviously, I'm relying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and must rely upon people who have connection with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expertise.  And I don't want to do something that uses 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

words that has effects that I have no idea. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  So we --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So I go back to look at two 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

words.  The IEP is filled with the word "progress." 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's several.  So the word "progress" seems like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that should be there. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And then the other word --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GORNSTEIN:  I would agree with that. 

    

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- that goes -- goes -- you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see a lot is "appropriate."  Now, you've taken that word 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"appropriate" and spelled it out in light of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

student's particular needs and abilities.  I think 

    

 

 

 

 

that's what you're doing with "appropriate." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And if we stick 

  

 

 

 

 

"appropriate" in that sentence somewhere so it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant and appropriate, does that matter?

MR. GORNSTEIN:  That happen -- we are happy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with that.  One of the formulations we --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

you don't --

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You looked into this and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- see anything wrong with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sticking in the word "appropriate"? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  We do not. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Now -- now, the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

other thing I looked at in yours is you say the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school -- "requires school districts to provide."  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

when I see "requires school districts to provide," I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

begin to think everybody is going to start suing about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether they did provide. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  No, no. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So I'm thinking, well, 

  

 

 

 

 

maybe it should be something like they are reasonably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calculated to provide. 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  That's actually -- we agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with that.  That is what Rowley said, and that is what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the standard -- that's what it means to require.  It's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

program that is reasonably calculated to -- to make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant --

24 

MR. GORNSTEIN:  -- progress in light of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

child's circumstances. 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  For all of us who might 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a little slow --

   

 

 

            

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- now tell me what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

new standard you're proposing is. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  So --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And I don't mean to be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

buying into your --

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  So --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- adversary's position. 

  

 

 

 

I do think the Act provides enough to set a clear 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard.  But the words are what we're trying to -- to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come to that would be less confusing to everyone. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  So one formulation that I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think that would be consistent with what we are saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is reasonably calculated to make progress that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate in light of the child's circumstances. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So how does that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

actually work in -- in practice?  I mean, I understand 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

in the Rowley standard, you're dealing with someone who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has a disability that is readily addressed so that they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can keep track with grade progress.  But if you're out

of that realm where that is not a realistic goal in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

light of the child's potential, how do you decide what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is?  You're sitting -- you're sitting down at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meeting, and how do you decide --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  All right.  So you -- what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the IEP provisions tell you where to start.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at the -- where the child currently is in terms of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

academic performance, what are their present levels of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

achievement.  Then you examine the disability and you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ask to what extent has this impeding progress in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general curriculum.  And then what you do is you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically make an estimate --

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there somebody at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that meeting?  I mean, you have the parents --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  You have expert -- you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

educational experts who will say, make an estimate of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how much progress towards grade level standards that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child can make in light of where they are now and the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the nature of the disability. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maybe there's still 

  

 

 

 

 

time to grade level standards.  I would think in many 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations those would largely be irrelevant. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  So here's what we mean by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, Mr. Chief Justice.  You start with the grade level 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards, but then you see the building blocks that are

missing underneath those grade level standards, and you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26 

set those out.  So if you can't multiply and you can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

add, and multiplication is the standard, maybe you need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to learn how to add first.  So you set forth what are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the building blocks that the child is missing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Everybody -- I say 

   

  

 

 

 

everybody.  I assume everybody needs to learn how to add 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before they learn how to multiply. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And -- and the basis of my concern is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it seems to me that even though you have a lot of --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe because you have a lot of different adjectives to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

describe the standard, that there's really nothing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concrete there.  And when you're asking the courts to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undertake judicial review, it's not clear to me exactly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what they're supposed to do. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  So -- so again, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate in light of the circumstances.  And we think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this is just what most school boards are already 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing.  And I agree that the concern is with court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement of the standard, and the risk of court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over-involvement in educational decisions.  But the 

  

 

 

 

 

response to is that is not to adopt a barely more than 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

de minimis standard that nobody purports to apply, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's to say that the court's role is limited to ensuring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the State's program for progress or appropriate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

progress is based on reasonable educational judgments. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you agree with Mr. Fisher 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that cost has no place in this calculation?  No matter 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how expensive it would be and no matter what the impact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in, let's say, a poor school district would be on the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general student population, cost can't be considered? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And do you think in the real world, school boards are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disregarding costs entirely? 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  So they're definitely not 

  

 

 

 

 

disregarding costs entirely, because there could be two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different programs, both of which are reasonable, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they would take into account costs, surely, in deciding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which of those reasonable programs to adopt. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But more generally, I would say the answer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is no in the usual case.  And -- and from Cedar Rapids, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's -- what the Court said is you consider cost in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deciding what the standard should be in the first place, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but cost can't define what the standards are. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that makes sense to me in -- in light of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way you look at this statute.  Congress obviously 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knew, when it passed this law, that there were going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be some significant expenses associated with some kids, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that's why it gave money and made it an opt-in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

program.  So at the very least, it seems to me, Cedar 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rapids and the structure of the statute tell you that in

the usual case it can't be cost, but --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you -- do you know what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percentage of the funds that are spent by school 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts for this program are paid by the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government? 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  I think it's a relatively --

    

   

 

 

 

I think it's like 15 percent or something like that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Federal government pays 15 

  

 

 

 

 

percent? 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  I think it's something like 

    

 

 

 

 

that.  I could be -- I could be corrected, and maybe my 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- my -- but the point of it is they realized that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were going to give money and they made it an open-ended 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choice for the school district.  So if the school --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but do you think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that costs should be measured against the possible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

results to be achieved? 

 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  So not in the usual case.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think Congress took costs off the table in the usual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  I think in the extreme case, you would do exactly 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what you're talking about.  You would say for very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little gain for extreme cost, no. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

that --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Not appropriate.  Is 

  

  

 

 

MR. GORNSTEIN:  Not appropriate.  Yes.

29 

So --

 

            

this case. 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's not the case in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GORNSTEIN:  No.  No.  The -- the school 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

district in this case hasn't raised a cost defense.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

so --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And -- and more 

  

 

 

 

 

importantly, the cost gave significant progress. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

sorry? 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  The cost did give -- I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The cost of the private 

  

 

 

 

 

 

education resulted in significant --

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  It -- it did result in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant progress. 

 

            

Now, I'm not sure you would -- you -- the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the benchmark is what is to be achieved in a private 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school.  I think as long as the school district's plan 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes significant progress or appropriate progress 

 

 

 

 

 

towards grade level in light of the child's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances, that's all you have to do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, here, even by the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Tenth Circuit's admission, this was barely de minimis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

progress. 

            

MR. GORNSTEIN:  So I think what they -- the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

court of appeals said is -- the only thing it said is

there was a free, appropriate public education because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Drew had made minimum progress on some of his goals in

the standard that we're talking about.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

To prevail, my friends have to overcome 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three different things.  First, they must overcome the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Spending Clause, which requires that any standard be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed unambiguously. 

 

            

Second, they most overcome Rowley, which 

 

 

 

 

 

found far from a clear statement that the statute was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

noticeably absent on a substantive standard for the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

level of education, including any standard based on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equality. 

            

And third, they must overcome the fact that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with each amendment to the IDEA, Congress has reaffirmed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its faith in the procedural protections and systemic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements without touching the statute's substantive 

 

 

 

 

 

standard.

They have to --

 

 

 

31 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What did you -- what we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

were told by Mr. Fisher, I think he was referring to 79A 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the government's appendix. 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So he has two different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

arguments, Justice Ginsburg, about -- about the changes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the amendments.  We think neither of them is going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come close. 

 

            

First of all, nothing is unambiguous as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Spending Clause requires.  These are changes to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural protections in 1414(d), and an -- and an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional goal found in 1400.  None of that comes close 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to this. 

 

            

And I think the best barometer of this is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it's taken until Mr. Fisher's creativity for any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court, really, to even entertain the notion that the '97 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or 2004 amendments changed the standard.  He has not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single case to cite that supports this idea. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In all of the --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the procedural 

  

 

 

 

standards certainly are the measure by which a court can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine whether or not the procedures were adequate. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Absolutely, Justice Kennedy. 

  

 

 

 

We agree.

automatically make these part of the standards? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

            

MR. KATYAL:  We -- we do think it makes them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of the standards.  It just makes them part of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural standards.  That is to say, we agree with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them that in 1997 and 2004, Congress really changed the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IDEA in a significant way.  The question is --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, do you agree that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the procedures have to meet these standards? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And 

  

  

  

 

so to the extent the procedures are met, to the extent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then I don't understand 

   

  

 

 

your disagreement with Mr. Fisher. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, it's -- it's very large. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

That is, we think that these are -- a procedural 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

checklist, and it's a detailed and exhaustive one, to be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure, Justice Kennedy, after --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but are -- are not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the procedures subject to judicial review to see that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the procedures were followed? 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Absolutely, Justice Kennedy. 

  

 

 

 

We agree with that.  That's actually the way -- that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what Congress had in mind, the idea that you've got to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go through the checklist, you can look at the checklist

33 

the Court has considered those things -- excuse me -- so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long as the IEP process has considered those things --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the procedures, as I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sure you'll agree, is geared towards something.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

geared towards the provision of a free appropriate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

public education. 

 

            

Then the Act, what it does, is it sets up --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is why I -- I guess I -- I -- I can't readily agree 

   

   

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

with your understanding of it's all procedures and we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just have to make sure the procedures are followed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because what the Act does is it sets up an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative process.  And it says when you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagreements about the provision of a -- of a FAPE, you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

go to this administrative process. 

 

 

 

 

            

And what does the hearing officer do?  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to just read you, subject to another exception, "A 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision made by a hearing officer shall be made on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive grounds based on a determination of whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the child received a free appropriate public education." 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KATYAL:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So that's what the dispute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is ultimately going to be about.  It might be about some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures along the way, and maybe it will be solved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just by saying follow the right procedures, but often

not.  Often, what the hearing officer is told to do,

shall do, is to decide on substantive grounds whether a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child has received a free appropriate public education. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Justice Kagan, we don't 

  

 

 

 

 

disagree with a lot of what you said.  That is to say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we do think -- and Rowley is very clear on this --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there is a substantive standard in the IDEA.  It's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just a "some benefit" standard, not -- and there's nine 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different standards now that we've heard just in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

last half hour, which I'll walk you through in a minute, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but that the Petitioner and the government are saying, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so it's some benefit. 

 

 

 

            

We do think there's substantive review. 

 

 

 

 

 

That's what that provision is about.  And by the way, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that provision also says there can be procedural review 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on a harmless error. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But your substantive 

  

 

 

 

standard is so low, is so easy to meet, and then you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justify that.  You say, don't worry about it because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's all in the process. 

 

 

 

 

            

But this provision, the idea of what a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearing officer is supposed to do, and then what a court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is supposed to do, says it's not all in the process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There is a question of whether a student is receiving a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- a FAPE.

MR. KATYAL:  So we disagree in two different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

35 

respects.  Number one, the experience for 34 years since 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rowley, almost every circuit, both the government and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner agree, whether it's Eighth or Tenth Circuit, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been applying the -- the some benefit standard, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it had bite.  Indeed, their own reply brief at page 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 admits and says, look, actually schools are doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fine. 

            

So to the extent that you're concerned about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some really low standard in the courts, that's actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not what's materializing, and you will get case after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case on this ASA brief at page 24.  So it's three cases 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using the some benefit standard just from this year. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Judge Colloton's opinion in CB.  There's case after case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying this is not some, you know, totally minor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard, it is the standard that Rowley said. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It says "some 

  

 

 

 

 

benefit," but you're -- you're reading it as saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"some benefit," and the other side is reading it as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying "some benefit," and you know that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And it makes a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

difference.  And I -- one reason I think that it -- it's 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

problematic for you is because Rowley just doesn't say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"some benefit."  It tells you what it is.  And it's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

enough benefit to keep track with grade progress.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if that's what the standard is, that's certainly more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than -- you know, slightly more than de minimis. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36 

            

And, now, obviously, we -- we -- you can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take that actual substantive standard and apply it in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case such as this, but it does seem to indicate that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is a substantive standard and it's not just some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit. 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, our position is Rowley 

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't say that it's got to be grade-level progress. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rather, it says that you've got the -- the word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"appropriate" -- this is footnote 21 -- reflects --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The -- the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  -- reflects, quote, "Its 

  

 

 

 

 

recognition that some settings simply are not suitable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

environments for the participation of some handicapped 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children," not as a term of art which concisely 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

expresses the standard found by the lower court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equality standard.  That is to say, I think, you can --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there -- there are lots of different ways of trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand what the statute means, but Rowley said the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way for the Court to understand it is Spending Clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislation.  That is, the State entered into a contract 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

and they need to know the terms of the deal, and to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent there's any ambiguity, I think Rowley was very

clear in saying it is just some benefit, and that is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

natural thing it follows from the kind of presumption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against de minimis --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You don't think "some 

  

 

 

 

 

benefit" is ambiguous? 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think that there's a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

little bit of ambiguity in that, but I think it's a lot 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

easier to administer that question because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question -- you know, Justice Ginsburg, let's just say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is the way ordinary English works. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If I have a duty to benefit you, Justice 

   

   

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg, if I give you no benefit, I think courts can 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

easily review that.  I've given you no benefit, I've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fallen down on my duty.  Now, if I've given you some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit, I've met my duty to benefit you, but I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that --

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I think it doesn't 

   

  

 

 

 

say it's more than de minimis. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Exactly, but that can't be --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So what is it? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  That can't be -- just to finish 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that -- that thought.  It can't be that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard is, if I benefit you significantly, that's the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard; or if I benefit you equally with your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

colleagues or something like that.  That's all adding

words to the statute that aren't there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where is it?  As I see one 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

way of looking at what we're doing, two things have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurred.  One, Rowley itself is somewhat ambiguous.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't -- it deliberately doesn't say how much, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's why you get the ambiguity. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The second thing that happens is the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is amended.  So what we're doing is going back and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking at those somewhat ambiguous words in Rowley in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

light of a statute that was amended. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Now, when you look at the statute that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amended in the IEP, you do see in at least two and maybe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more places that that IEP is designed to be a statement 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that will produce -- meet the child's needs to enable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the child to be involved in and make progress in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general education, and then further, advance 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriately towards an -- annual goals to make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

progress in the general education. 

 

 

 

 

            

So now what the SG has done is go back, take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those words, "make progress," and put them in a phrase 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which, in fact, I think with not much modification says, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look, let's read what Rowley said in light of these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional words, "make progress," which are statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words, while taking account of great differences by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using words like "appropriately in light of the

student's particular needs and abilities," and those all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

come from the statute. 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So, Justice Breyer, three 

  

 

 

 

 

things.  Number one is we don't agree that Rowley itself 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is ambiguous as it's been interpreted for 34 years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indeed, they can't cite any cases showing that there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any problem.  Indeed, their reply brief admits at page 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19, things are working just fine.  So the idea that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's, like, some need for this Court to get involved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and clarify Rowley, I think, you know, there's no case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law or anything to support that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second, the idea that the amendments somehow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changed the game, I think, is not nearly enough to be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the clear statement that Pennhurst requires.  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

this isn't just elephants being hided -- hided in mouse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holes.  This is elephants being hidden in romanette 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mouse holes.  I mean, this is -- you know, just listen 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the things that he had to point to.  It's subsection 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D4, romanette ii, and things like that, none of which --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But would you agree with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

at least the courts should say that the formulation more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than de minimis sets the level too low, and that's --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the formula that was used at levels here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  And, Justice Ginsburg, we 

  

 

 

 

 

disagree with that.  We think more than de minimis, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

which is what almost every circuit is using right now, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has worked and it follows naturally from the some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit language in Rowley. 

 

 

 

40 

            

            

Now, you might disagree --

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you're -- you're 

  

 

 

 

 

equating some benefit to more than --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  More than de minimis.  We think 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

it means the same thing, and we think there's a long 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history of experience with this showing that it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

working. 

            

And to return, Justice Breyer, to a point 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that you had made before.  It's that there's some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern about the standard.  That's really got to be up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Congress.  If this Court were to change the standard, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, it would invite all sorts of litigation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And just look at what Mr. Fisher said.  As 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Chief Justice started, he -- first his petition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

started with a substantial equal opportunity standard, 

   

 

 

 

 

then it became in its merits brief an equal opportunity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard, then in the beginning of his oral argument it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was, quote, "tailored to achieve at grade level what" --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But, Mr. Katyal, 

  

 

 

 

 

let's say -- let's say that during the school year, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school districts -- district sends someone to work with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the particular student in this case, and they send her

there for two weeks, you know, she goes around.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's it.  And that's all they do.  That's some 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit.  Better to have the person there for two weeks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than not at all, but you wouldn't say that satisfies the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute. 

            

MR. KATYAL:  It does not.  As our brief 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

explains there is two different provisions in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, 1414(b)(r) and (c)(5)(A), which explain that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the benefit from special education must be, quote, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"continuous."  And Cedar Rapids actually said that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

So --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So -- and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

just change the hypothetical.  She's there five minutes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a day. 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  And -- and -- and, you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

five minutes a day, I think, wouldn't meet the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

de minimis standard.  That is -- that is, that itself is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not a significant -- that -- that is not a word --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I guess it 

   

  

 

 

 

depends on whether somebody can tell us at some point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it's beneficial.  And yet, I think most people 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

would agree that it -- well, I mean, are you saying that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the judicial review is supposed to be whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's de minimis or more than de minimis, and they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed to say, well, a half hour is -- is -- is good,

it's not de minimis, but that's all you have to do? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Mr. Chief Justice, I'm saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

two different things.  One is yes, ultimately, if we got 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there, that it would flunk substantive de minimis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review, but you wouldn't get there.  Congress's whole 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment here was to put the emphasis on procedural 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protections in the Act, and they bolstered them in '97 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and 2004.  And as long as they could shine a light by 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creating an IEP team process where they trusted teachers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and they trusted parents who are highly incentivized to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come together --

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah, but you're 

  

 

 

 

 

putting a lot -- you're assuming that the procedural 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

process will yield significant results.  What if they do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the whole thing?  Yeah, we have a hearing.  Everybody 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

comes in.  We bring the expert in and the expert says, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, you need to have somebody there six hours of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day to help the child learn, and they say, okay, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's -- that's the procedure, we listen to you.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, we're only going to have somebody there a half 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hour a day. 

   

            

MR. KATYAL:  I -- I am assuming that it is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

in general going to work, which is what Rowley itself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said at page 206 of its opinion.  That -- that was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress's judgment. 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

Now, I agree, you can give me a hypothetical 

   

   

 

 

 

 

43 

which says that in some case the procedures aren't going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to work and there's going to be a bad result.  No system 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is perfect, not even a judicial system, as the error 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correction rules of this Court recognize. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think the -- the question for the Court is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should you kind of re-jigger the statute and impose a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new standard, particularly in the context --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's not exact --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You'll have to excuse me, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I'm not sure I understood your answer to the Chief 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice. 

            

He -- he had a hypothetical where you have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the hearing, the hearing makes a recommendation, 

   

 

 

 

 

recommendation not followed.  What result? 

  

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KATYAL:  If the recommend --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and then I thought 

   

  

 

 

 

 

I heard you say, well, the procedure we followed, that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good enough. 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  If -- if -- I might have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

misunderstood.  I thought there was a five minutes of 

    

   

 

 

 

 

services thing. 

 

            

If it's not followed, everyone agrees 

 

 

 

 

 

there's judicial review of that.  The IEP is essentially 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a contract.  Our brief cites the provision which says

that you can come in and enforce the IEP.  I don't think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44 

there's any disagreement about that. 

 

 

 

 

              

I understood the hypothetical to be about 

 

 

 

 

 

some really low level of benefit.  And our point is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rowley says there is a some benefit standard.  That has 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

been interpreted in court after court to actually have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bite.  The ASA brief cites the -- three cases just in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the last year alone about that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The question is, in Spending Clause context, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do you want to actually impose something new?  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Gornstein gave you three different new standards, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

starting with his cert petition and then -- and then his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits brief taking a different view. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So where do you get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"some benefit" from? 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  I get it from Rowley itself at 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 200 which says that --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What do you do with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"meaningful" --

 

            

            

itself? 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So "meaningful" --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that was in Rowley 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  So "meaningful" was not 

  

 

 

 

 

actually in Rowley.  The Court there just mentioned 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"meaningful" once only to say that it can't be more than

meaningful.  It didn't adopt that as a standard.  There 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

is some baggage, as Mr. Gornstein says, but the really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important baggage is actually what this Court said in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cedar Rapids, which is that meaningful access doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require a particular level of education. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right. 

  

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So that's what we have --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what we have -- we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have now.  We have the words you've mentioned.  They are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in old cases.  As was just pointed out, those words 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"some" -- what is it?  "Some" -- "some" -- "some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit." 

            

            

MR. KATYAL:  "Some benefit." 

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You could say some benefit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

or you could say some benefit. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

ambiguity. 

            

            

MR. KATYAL:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, that's an 

  

  

 

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And as you pointed out, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

most courts have interpreted what I think is the correct 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing, they said benefit.  Okay?  And you say there is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really no problem.  Okay?  There is really no problem. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

But there still is a problem with the language in a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

handful of courts.  And now we have an IEP statute which

again and again and again looks to progress. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46 

            

So why is it making something up out of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole cloth --

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, first --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- simply to take that word 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the IEP, which is enforceable anyway, and say, look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at these two words of ambiguity, and we think we should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret them in light of the IEP requirements, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are pretty close to what the SG suggests? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  But, Justice Breyer, I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

think that there was some problem in the lower courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They're not citing cases that show that there's some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parade of horribles akin to the hypotheticals --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  -- that we've heard.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Congress's judgment was that the procedural protections 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will do a lot at the front end to avoid that problem. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There might be some situation at the back end, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's where the system -- systemic requirements of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IDEA No Child Left Behind are so important.  Because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what they say is that the Department of Education can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cut off funds, can redirect funds, can require annual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reports, all sorts of things happening. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And, indeed, annual reports have been 

 

 

 

 

 

required since 2004 to Congress.  Congress has never

changed the statute in the way they want, a substantive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard change.  You know, and -- and, again, their own 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

reply brief at page 19 and the SG's brief admits the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard is generally working.  Teachers are teaching to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the top. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What is frustrating about 

  

 

 

 

 

this case and about this statute is that we have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blizzard of words.  And if you --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KATYAL:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- read them literally, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not clear to me that they mean anything different. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, "progress" benefit.  Yeah, I don't see 

   

  

 

 

 

how you can have a benefit unless you're making some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

progress. 

            

"Significant," "meaningful," they're 

 

 

synonyms.  If something is significant or meaningful, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's more than de minimis.  And if it's more than de 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimis, you could say it's significant.  It's something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you note.  So it's really -- I mean, what everybody 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems to be looking for is the word that has just the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right nuance to express this thought. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, we think that you should 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

look to what Rowley did here, which is to say the word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is "some benefit."  And that actually follows from the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

text of the statute itself.  There is a long

presumption, Justice Alito, against de minimis, starting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

with Wrigley, which this Court said applies to all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes.  So we think our standard comes from the text, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but there is no canon about significance or quality or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything like that. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What is the difference 

  

 

 

 

 

between "some benefit" and "significant"? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  I think it's quite large; that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

is, you know -- you know, I think it's straightforward. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So, you know, basically, I think, you know, if -- if the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court is to ask whether there is some benefit, as I was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying to Justice Ginsburg in my hypothetical, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's a pretty easy question, is, have I benefited? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

Has the school district benefited?  But once we start 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting beyond that to "significant," the Court has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ask both:  Was there some benefit and then was that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit significant?  And I can imagine --

   

  

 

 

 

            

say --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It didn't just 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  -- a variety of views about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

what is significant. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It didn't just say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"some benefit."  It said that that benefit would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

normally allow the -- a student with the disability to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

keep up with his peers in a different grade.

Now, as soon as they say that, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appreciate that you're dealing with more than just some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

benefit.  I mean, that's a significant benefit.  Well --

    

   

  

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Significant --

  

 

 

 

"significant," "meaningful," whatever.  It's more than 

  

 

 

 

 

simply de minimis.  It suggests that you can't just look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at something and say, aha, here, that was helpful, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was helpful, because it's -- the whole package has got 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be helpful enough to allow the student to keep up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with his peers. 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Mr. Chief Justice, I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

think that's what Rowley said when it used grade to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grade.  I think that all the -- the grade to grade was 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just to say, procedurally, they've got to consider that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and make sure that, for example, a high school kid isn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put in first grade.  But I don't think that's part of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the test.  And several times Rowley rejected this idea 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there's any sort of level-of-education test. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, how does your 

  

 

 

 

 

position, Mr. Katyal -- you have a passage in your brief 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on page 47 which says, "An IEP must have the goal of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advancing a child in the general education curriculum 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and, to the extent possible, enable her to be educated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the school's regular classes." 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

And, to me, that sounds exactly like what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the chief justice just said, that an IEP has to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonably calculated to do those things.  And if it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50 

not, then relief follows. 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So I think, again, it's just a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

procedural guarantee that they have to think about and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider grade-level progress.  It does not mean sort of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive standard --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's wrong.  This is not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

just a procedural guarantee.  Yes, the IDEA has lots of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures in it, but they're all geared towards a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular substantive result.  And it's that 

  

 

 

 

 

substantive result that's the focus of the -- both the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative process and then judicial review of what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes out of the administrative process. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  But I don't think so, Justice 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Kagan.  I think all that those standards say is what an 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IEP must address, not how an IEP must deal with them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And so if you look -- and I think the Second Circuit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recently, in a case called LO v. New York City just a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple of months ago, decided -- basically went through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this and said the 1414 standards like that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

checklist.  You've got to consider grade-level progress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and things like that. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if we --

MR. KATYAL:  But you wouldn't --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- consider all of them and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we do none of them, that's just fine? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51 

            

MR. KATYAL:  That's -- well, the Congress's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

judgment was the process -- and this is something that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happens in NEPA --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So your answer to Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Kagan is yes.  If you consider everything but do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing, that's okay. 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  No.  Because there's still --

  

  

 

 

 

 

if you do nothing, then you haven't provided any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit.  And so there is still some substantive bite in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the standard of Rowley itself.  What we're saying is, in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the context of Spending Clause legislation, you can't do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more than that and require something significant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the reason, Justice Kennedy, is once you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

start going into significance, as the amici briefs point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out, education is the most -- one of the more contested 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

areas in our society.  Parents have been known to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagree.  There is more acronyms about lawsuits about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this newfangled theory or that newfangled theory or 30 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hours versus 35 hours being significant.  And you get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into a huge morass. 

   

 

            

What Rowley said citing San Antonio v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rodriguez is that that kind of thing in the educational

context is not where Federal generalist courts should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52 

be. 

            

Now, I suppose you could say maybe that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

not the right policy.  Maybe, you know, this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that should happen.  Courts should get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

involved in this.  That's really got to be a judgment 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for Congress to make, and it's got to be something they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say clearly in the context of Spending Clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislation.  Rowley expressly said the Pennhurst 

  

 

 

 

 

principle applies to this provision of the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This is core legislation, core -- a core requirement of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute, and they are imposing any number of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different standards. 

 

            

And so I understand that there is some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

policy concerns among -- among the Court, even if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're not shared by the -- my friends on the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side, because they disclaim them.  But to the extent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are those policy concerns, that's really got to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that Congress deals with. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And what I'm --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  One -- one aspect of --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of your position is you say yes, there is a substantive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard, some benefit.  And then you, in the course of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your argument, said some, as interpreted by most courts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has bite.  But then you say de minimis is enough -- more

than de minimis is enough. 

 

 

 

 

53 

            

            

MR. KATYAL:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So some with bite and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

more than de minimis don't sound like equivalence to me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  I think they are, and I think 

    

   

 

 

 

 

that's what the -- circuit after circuit has said, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that some educational benefit, the language at page 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

200, means more -- more than de minimis.  And so -- and, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, I think there is a whole variety of cases that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have interpreted this. 

 

 

            

And, Justice Ginsburg, even this Court has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually had one of them.  In Florence v. Carter, that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

came from a circuit which had a "more than merely de 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimis" standard.  The Court there found that the IEP 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantively didn't meet the protections of the "some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit" or "merely more than de minimis" standard. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  We get that -- I mean, how 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

does this actually work?  I thought there is a statute 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

in 1414 before that, it says you have to, school 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district, write an IEP.  Then it says what an IEP is. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And one of the things it says an IEP is, is it is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement of the services, et cetera, based on peer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review stuff that will be provided for the child to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advance appropriately and to make progress in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general education curriculum.

Now, suppose the school district writes a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54 

statement called an IEP, but it does not show that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child is likely to advance.  Can't they go to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative thing and then go to court and say to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge, look, they didn't write what they were required 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to write? 

 

            

            

            

key word --

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Absolutely.  So --

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 

  

 

MR. KATYAL:  -- if there is a statement, the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So they have to write 

  

 

 

 

 

 

something that's minimally --

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KATYAL:  -- is statement. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, let's suppose they 

  

 

 

 

 

write it, but they don't do it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KATYAL:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, isn't there something 

  

 

 

 

 

saying you have to follow the IEP? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

court? 

            

not --

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And so, again, they go to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  Correct.  But what there is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And what they -- again they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

say they didn't follow the IEP?

MR. KATYAL:  Correct, Justice Breyer.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

55 

what there is not is something in 1414 which says that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they've got to provide a significant benefit or an equal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But they do have to provide 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that makes progress in the general education 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

curriculum and --

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  They have to follow the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

checklist that is a statement --

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and advance 

  

 

 

 

appropriately --

 

            

statement --

 

            

            

MR. KATYAL:  Yes.  There must be a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- towards a --

   

  

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  -- yes. 

  

 

 

              

I think everyone agrees you don't look at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outcomes or anything like that.  So it's -- it's just a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural requirement --

 

 

            

calculated. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's procedurally 

  

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  It's just the same as Rowley. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rowley -- you know, we're not saying anything different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than what Rowley said. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't know.  I would say

two words were, what, beneficial?  What's the one before 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56 

"beneficial"? 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Some -- some benefit. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  Some educational benefit. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Some educational benefit. 

  

 

 

 

If you say "some," this is inconsistent with Rowley. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, I don't think so.  I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

think it's got to be some educational benefit designed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to get the general education curriculum or --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Katyal --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Mr. Katyal, are there --

  

 

 

 

 

 

in the wake of the many years this Act has been enforced 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and these many individual meetings, have there been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

documented areas of consensus as to certain standards, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain methodologies, certain systems that work and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain that don't?  And do the courts, in reviewing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these proceedings, ever refer to those? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So I think that's where the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

amici briefs are so important, because they show -- say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that education isn't really one of those areas.  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, people disagree about the most simple things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about educational philosophy. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So we've gone -- so we've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

gone nowhere.

nowhere, but I think that worry is to thrust courts into 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the business of deciding which philosophy is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate. 

57 

            

            

And take Firefly, for --

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you say that there is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally no consensus as to appropriate methodologies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for, say, a hearing-impaired student, an autistic 

   

 

 

 

 

student.  No agreement on that? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  I don't mean to say that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

there's no agreement.  I am -- I do mean to say that the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amici briefs and the case law recognizes that there is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot of disagreement.  And Rowley itself says this, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

picking up on San Antonio v. Rodriguez, that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress's judgment was not to thrust courts into these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really highly, very difficult considerations. 

 

 

 

 

            

And if I could just give you one example, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about Justice Sotomayor, your indication of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Firefly.  So eventually right, that, you know, once Drew 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went to Firefly, there was progress that was made.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was also a lot that was given up. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, one of the core purposes of the IDEA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is mainstreaming.  And of course, Firefly is not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mainstream school.  So yes, there were some behavioral 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

problems that were addressed by the private placement --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Katyal, can you go back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

to Justice Ginsburg's question that I'm a bit confused 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- about for the same reason. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58 

            

You said something like, well, this -- this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard is -- is being applied with bite.  So I'm just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wondering, do you favor a standard with bite? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  We favor the standard that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Rowley said, which lower courts have done for 34 years, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which does have --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you favor a standard with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

bite? 

            

MR. KATYAL:  It does have some bite.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

does.  We're not trying to --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Would that be "some bite" or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"somebite"? 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. KATYAL:  It is some educational benefit. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

That's the language of Rowley.  And if you disagree with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it, Congress can change it. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, again, if somebody 

  

 

 

 

 

said to you, write a stature with -- write a standard 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

with bite, I doubt you would come up with the words 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"more than merely de minimis." 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, but again, I think, 

   

  

 

 

 

Justice Kagan, Congress's bite, the substantive bite is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only at the back end.  It's a small feature in a much

bigger statute. 

 

59 

            

            

Congress's judgment was --

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the back end is what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case is all about. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. KATYAL:  I understand that. 

    

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  We are at the back end. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  But -- but, Justice Kagan, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't take the policy concerns about the hypotheticals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and other things to try and re-jigger the back end. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Congress's handiwork was to say it's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural protections shining a light, the IEP process 

   

 

 

 

 

 

with highly incentivized teachers and -- teachers and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parents that's generally going to yield the right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

result.  That's what Rowley itself said at page 206. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  We're going to have to use 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

musical notation to -- and not just words -- to express 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the idea that seems to be emerging.  All right. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Would you say -- I'll ask the same thing of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Fisher if he has a chance to address it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If -- if we were to look at what the lower 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts have been doing -- we don't see very many of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these cases, the lower courts see a lot of them.  If we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked at what they have been doing in general, would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you say that they are doing -- that they are applying

interpretation? 

60 

            

MR. KATYAL:  I would.  Ten circuits are 

    

  

 

 

 

applying the more than de minimis standard.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

working.  Sometimes it has some bite.  But to change it, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as Justice Breyer was indicating to my friend, is --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with eight million potential IEPs, is to invite massive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amounts of litigation. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  That sounds very harsh. 

  

 

 

 

 

What's the origin of this phrase, "more than de 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimis"?  Who thought this up? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, it goes back to Latin. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

And so again, we, you know --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

comes from. 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I know where "de minimis" 

    

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. KATYAL:  No, no, no.  No.  The -- the --

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

no.  The -- the presumption against trifles, you know. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's -- Justice Scalia invokes it why and folks in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wrigley case.  It's an old formulation. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But who -- who decided to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply it here in this context? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think the Court in --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

in Rowley, then Justice Rehnquist's opinion, invoked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that by talking about some benefit.  And Wrigley says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is a presumption that applies to all statutes.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Who -- who put the term, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"more than merely de minimis"?  That's the formula that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're -- that you are espousing. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KATYAL:  Yes.  We --

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And de minimis is not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

enough, you know.  It's "merely de minimis." 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And it's not in Rowley. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

So where does it -- who invented it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think that it came 

   

  

 

 

 

 

directly from the circuits right after Rowley.  But all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are saying is "some benefit" means the more than de 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimis test.  That's the way court after court has

that the IEP provisions are enforceable in the way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Breyer described, which is the plan has to meet 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the requirements of 1414(d).  And if the services on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ground don't meet the requirements in the plan, they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

62 

enforceable.  That's at page 47A of his brief and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throughout the others --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Answer Justice Alito's 

  

 

 

 

question.  What's the practice today? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Pardon me? 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the practice 

  

 

 

 

today?  Do most courts use the "more than de minimis" 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard? 

            

MR. FISHER:  Yes.  That is the formula in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

most of the circuits.  That brings me to an important 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question on the ground, and if I'll circle back to my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other statutory point. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Before -- putting aside -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't want -- I'll take 10 seconds.  Putting aside the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words, are the outcomes appropriate, or do you think the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower courts need a kick? 

   

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  I think they need a kick. 

    

   

 

 

 

  

I 

think the outcomes are quite scattered.  I think the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

only reason why you get some favorable outcomes is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because even the courts themselves don't believe barely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more than de minimis.

But I think you have a disjoint.  And my 

   

   

  

 

 

 

63 

friend keeps pointing to the amicus briefs.  I think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

educators are, by and large, following the plan -- I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorry -- the -- the standard we propose and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solicitor general imposes. 

 

 

            

The No Child Left Behind Act in 2004 was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very important, revolutionary, bipartisan policy change. 

 

 

 

 

 

And so educators on the ground are aiming high, as they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put it.  The city's brief says we are aiming to maximize 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the benefit for our students.  And so you have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disjoint between what educators are doing and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts.  And the reason they need a kick is because the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very, very, very, very, very rare case that makes it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into the court system is not being properly reviewed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that leaves the last point I want to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

respond to, which is the fact that Congress left us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alone after Rowley.  What the Court has said in Rowley 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and in Honig and in other cases is the IEP rules are, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quote, "the centerpiece of the Act."  They're the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

centerpiece for how the education delivery services are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put forward. 

 

            

If you look at page 182 of Rowley, the IEP 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions were quite hollow.  They didn't have any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

benchmarks at all.  That has dramatically changed.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

now have the general educational curriculum benchmarks

Justice Breyer has been referring to, and we repeatedly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refer to in our brief, and I think, Mr. Chief Justice, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you agree cannot be met under their standard. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64 

            

And then that leaves the last little piece 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the puzzle here, which is this child who cannot get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up to grade level standards.  We give you an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer-direct question that is directly in the text of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Act, just as my friend demands.  Alternative 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

achievement benchmarks at the bottom of 52A is what is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required.  And that takes you to 79A, which gives you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the exact statutory formula. 

 

 

 

            

So if you want to use that formula, combined 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with general educational curriculum at grade level, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that would be a proper answer to the question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented in this case. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The case is submitted. 

 

 

 

            

(Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
