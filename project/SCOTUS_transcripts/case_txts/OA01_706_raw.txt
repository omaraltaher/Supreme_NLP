CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 01-706, Rex Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine.


Ms. Brueckner.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF LESLIE A. BRUECKNER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. BRUECKNER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The question presented in this case is whether


State common law tort claims that a boat engine was


defective because it lacked a propeller guard are


preempted either by the Boat Safety Act of 1971 or by an


unpublished Coast Guard letter stating that the agency had


decided not to take any regulatory action with respect to


propeller guards. 


There is no express preemption here because the


Boat Safety Act includes a savings clause that expressly


preserves the availability of common law claims.  And in


light of this clause, this case boils down to the question


of whether our claims are impliedly preempted because they


conflict with some valid expression of Federal law.  And


the answer to this question is no for two distinct


reasons.


First, as the United States has argued, the

Coast Guard letter itself lacks the force of law


regardless of its content. 


And second, even if the Coast Guard could


preempt State law in this fashion, there's no preemption


here because our claims are entirely consistent with the


Coast Guard's stated reasons for not taking any regulatory


action with respect to propeller guards. 


QUESTION:  What would happen if there were no


savings clause in this case? 


MS. BRUECKNER:  If there were no savings clause,


our position is that there would still be no express


preemption because section 4306 of the Boat Safety Act, by


its terms, in our view does not encompass common law


claims.  But the savings clause --


QUESTION:  Well, except that -- that this clause


is different, say, than the one we had in Geier.  The


Geier clause -- savings clause begins -- or preemption


clause begins with the assumption that there is a


regulation.  This begins the other way.  It says the State


may not have any regulation unless it's consistent with an


existing Federal regulation. 


MS. BRUECKNER:  That's true, Your Honor, but


here, as in Geier, reading this preemption clause as


encompassing common law claims would render the savings


clause of this statute superfluous, and that is exactly

the result that this Court rejected in Geier.


QUESTION:  Well, suppose a State said there can


be a common law action in the courts of this State for the


violation of any safety regulation which this legislature


proposes, and we hereby direct that there be a propeller


-- a guard on every propeller.  Would that statute be


valid under -- under 4306? 


MS. BRUECKNER:  In our view that statute would


be valid because we read 4306 as not even preempting State


positive law, that is, laws and regulations, unless


there's an actual Coast Guard standard.  But this Court


need not resolve that --


QUESTION:  But -- but 4306 doesn't require a


Coast Guard standard.  It -- it says that there's a


disability on the State legislature unless there is a


Coast Guard standard and that State statute is parallel to


it. 


MS. BRUECKNER:  Section 4306 in our view can be


read -- read two different ways.  One, our reading of the


statute is that it only kicks in where the Coast Guard has


regulated.  The United States disagrees on this point and


reads 4306 as expressly preempting all forms of State


positive law, that is, laws and regulations, even where


the Coast Guard hasn't regulated. 


But the United States and we agree that however

you read 4306 with respect to State positive law, common


law claims are preserved, and the reason is that 4311(g)


would be stripped of any meaning if 4306 is read as


encompassing common law claims.


QUESTION:  Not -- not when -- I mean, that's why


I think yours is the better view, actually.  But I mean,


on your view you needn't drive a wedge between the common


law and positive law because there's meaning for both. 


MS. BRUECKNER:  Absolutely, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And I've never -- I guess it's a


better question for the Government.  I don't see why you'd


want to drive a wedge between those two.


QUESTION:  Well, let's -- let's take the


Government's position which is that the State could not


pass a statute on a -- requiring a propeller -- a


propeller guard.  If -- if that's true, if we accepted


that, why is it that a jury should be able to require the


same thing? 


MS. BRUECKNER:  Because that is what Congress


made clear in section 4311(g) that juries should be able


to do.  Jury --


QUESTION:  Ms. Brueckner, here's -- here's my


problem with 4311(g).  You can -- it not only is a savings


clause for common law, it's also a savings clause for


State law.  It says it does not relieve a person from

liability at common law or under State law.  Now, I -- I


do not know how an intelligent Congress could have --


could have written such a thing.  But that's what it says: 


at common law or under State law. 


Now, you can't read the savings clause portion


that says under State law to mean all State law because


then the savings clause would totally cancel the


preemption clause.  Right? 


MS. BRUECKNER:  I agree, Justice Scalia. 


QUESTION:  So you -- you have to limit State law


to mean, well, not all State law.  And why -- why would it


not be natural to read common law also not to include all


common law, for example, not including any common law that


specifically imposes liability for failure to have certain


propeller standards? 


MS. BRUECKNER:  First, Your Honor, the fact that


this savings clause is slightly broader than that at issue


in Geier, because of the reference to State law, is not a


reason to construe it narrowly. 


Second, the reference to State law can easily be


understood as a reference to, as the statute itself says,


liability imposed under State law, which we read to mean a


reference to State damages statutes such as wrongful death


and survival.  And this case is a perfect illustration of


that.

 QUESTION:  Well, that really is a bit of a


stretch, isn't it, to say you're talking -- when you say


State law, you're only talking about wrongfully tendered


an act and that sort of thing? 


MS. BRUECKNER:  I don't think so, Your Honor,


because section 4311(g)'s language is -- is quite clear


and it is set forth at the blue brief at page 6. 


QUESTION:  Well, to say it's quite clear -- it


does not relieve a person from liability at common law or


under State law.  Whatever we may come up with as the


meaning of that or you may suggest, I don't think you


could say it's clear. 


MS. BRUECKNER:  I disagree, Your Honor, because


the reference to liability at common law or under State


law to my mind suggests a reference to liability under


State law, and liability under State law in this context


is liability by which the measure of damages is a State


statute, such as the wrongful death statute or the


survival statute here that this complaint arises under.


QUESTION:  I guess you have a different meaning


of clear than I do. 


MS. BRUECKNER:  That -- that may be, Your Honor.


I would note, however, that in -- in Cipollone


this Court noted that language exactly like this, a


savings clause that specifically preserved liability at

common law or -- or under State law in the Comprehensive


Smokeless Tobacco Act, preserved common law claims.  This


is the same language.  And again --


QUESTION:  Why do you need that?  I mean, I'm --


I'm interested.  I might -- why do you need that if, in


fact, your interpretation of the preemption clause is


correct?  There are some regs of the Coast Guard that do


preempt positive common -- common law and positive law,


and some that don't.  And so the savings clause simply


makes clear that those that don't, don't.  It gives


meaning to it. 


MS. BRUECKNER:  You're absolutely right, Your


Honor. 


do you? 


QUESTION:  So you don't need this damages thing,


MS. BRUECKNER:  No, we don't, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Well, no, but the savings clause says


even those that do, don't. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  I mean, isn't that the --


QUESTION:  No, it doesn't necessarily have to --


the -- the -- I'm certain it's not clear to the contrary,


but it's at least arguably to the contrary. 


MS. BRUECKNER:  Even without the savings clause,


we read section 4306 on its face as not encompassing

common law claims, and the main reason why, putting aside


the savings clause, is that the language of 4306 tracks


the language of section 4302 of the statute, which is the


affirmative delegation of rulemaking authority of the


Coast Guard.  It's on the first page of the appendix to


the blue brief. 


And 4302 authorizes the Coast Guard to do two


things:  promulgate minimum safety standards and require


associated equipment.  And this is exactly the same


language that's in 4306. 


QUESTION:  Well, this is the kind of thing that


the Coast Guard could require, isn't it?  Propeller guard?


MS. BRUECKNER:  Absolutely, Your Honor, under


4302 --


QUESTION:  And in Arkansas Electric, I think we


held that a Federal decision to forego regulation in a


given area may imply an authoritative Federal


determination that the area is best left unregulated and


would have as much preemptive force as a decision to


regulate. 


Is that the situation here?  Certainly the Coast


Guard looked at it and decided not to regulate.  Should we


apply Arkansas Electric and say that's binding? 


MS. BRUECKNER:  No, Your Honor, and here is why.


This case really presents the question, putting aside the

express preemption issue which we believe is resolved by


Geier, of under what circumstances does an agency's


affirmative decision not to regulate pack a preemptive


punch such as -- so as to wipe out common law claims.  And


there are -- there are two preconditions that must be met,


neither of which is present here. 


First, the agency's decision not to regulate


must take the form that itself possesses the force of law,


and that is lacking here for reasons I'll explain in a


moment. 


Second, the agency --


QUESTION:  That was the holding of Arkansas


Electric; it doesn't have to take the form. 


MS. BRUECKNER:  Actually the holding of Arkansas


Electric was that there was no preemption at all in that


case, but perhaps Your Honor is --


QUESTION:  Yes, but the -- the passage I read to


you indicates that a decision not to regulate can, in


fact, be -- have preemptive effect. 


MS. BRUECKNER:  Yes, Your Honor, but a pure


decision not to regulate or a pure agency inaction has


only been held to exert preemptive effect in the context


of statutes that preempt the field where there's total


Federal occupation of the field. 


Here, however you read 4306 with respect to

State laws and regulations, common law claims we believe


are excluded from the regulated field.  Therefore, there


has to be a conflict.  And for affirmative -- an


affirmative agency decision not to regulate to preempt


State law under a conflict preemption analysis, there both


has to be an agency action that possesses the force of law


and there has to be an actual conflict between the


agency's underlying reasons for not regulating and the


common law claims.  And both of these criteria are absent


here. 


First, as the United States has argued -- and we


agree -- this unpublished letter -- Coast Guard letter


itself lacks the force of law.  It's important to remember


here that not only is there no agency regulation, but


there was never any rulemaking.  There was never any


publication of a notice that the Coast Guard was even


considering --


QUESTION:  Let -- let me ask you this question. 


Let's assume a -- a hypothetical case in which the engine


manufacturer is sued and is -- and is found liable by the


jury for having a propeller guard which makes the boat


difficult to turn so the boat hits the dock.  It -- it


can't turn fast enough to avoid the dock.  We have that


case and it's consolidated with yours.  So we have one


case where they're liable for having the guard and another

case where they're liable for not having the -- the guard. 


Would you argue the case the same way and would we have to


affirm both cases? 


MS. BRUECKNER:  Yes, Your Honor, and -- and Your


Honor's hypothetical actually illustrates my point.


There's no question that a boat manufacturer could not be


held liable for installing -- could not be held -- a -- a


claim alleging that a boat manufacturer was negligent per


se for installing a propeller guard couldn't be based on


an existing Coast Guard regulation because the letter


lacks the force of law with respect to boat manufacturers. 


There's no agency action here that could form the basis


for any common law claim one way or the other. 


QUESTION:  But -- but if the manufacturer is


subject to conflicting jury verdicts, as you indicate -- I


suppose we could change the hypothetical so we have two


States, one which requires it, the other of which -- and


-- and you would say those weren't preempted, either. 


MS. BRUECKNER:  That's correct, Your Honor.  And


-- and this is --


QUESTION:  That seems to me to -- to give very


little effect to the wording of the clause which says that


a State cannot have a standard unless it's parallel to a


Federal statute.


MS. BRUECKNER:  But it does give meaning to the

language of section 4311(g) which says that even where a


Coast Guard has promulgated a minimum safety standard,


common law liability is preserved except to the extent


that there's an actual conflict. 


QUESTION:  But you could -- you could read that,


couldn't you -- you -- you argue that to accept your -- to


respondent's view would mean the savings clause has no


work to do, but the savings clause could still be for


cases of negligent -- negligent operation, for cases in --


of negligent -- negligence in manufacturing a piece of


equipment.  So there -- there would be -- on any reading


of this, there would be something saved.  So -- so you --


I think you have to modify your argument.  The savings


clause would be nullified. 


MS. BRUECKNER:  I respectfully disagree, Justice


Ginsburg, and -- and here's why.  The respondent here does


contend that the savings clause applies to breach of


warranty and negligent manufacturing claims.  And that


argument fails, first of all, because such claims are not


encompassed within 4306 on its face, and therefore there


wouldn't have been any need for Congress to save those


claims. 


Secondly, this Court construed a similar savings


clause in Geier as expressing Congress's intent that mere


compliance with minimum safety standards would not be an


14

absolute defense to liability in a product liability


action.  And compliance with a Coast Guard regulation


establishing a minimum safety standard could never be an


absolute defense in a case involving negligent manufacture


or a breach of warranty, for example.  So, the


respondent's theory leaves really no meaningful role for


the savings clause to play. 


And I would emphasize that these arguments were


all asked and answered in Geier, and the Court held that a


similarly worded savings clause, albeit without the


reference to State law, has to mean that common law claims


are not expressly preempted. 


Now, that doesn't mean that our claims must


necessarily be permitted to go forward if they conflict


with Federal law, but there's clearly no conflict here


again for two reasons. 


First, the Coast Guard letter lacks the force of


law.  And on that point, before turning to the reasons why


our claims are actually consistent with the Coast Guard's


stated reasons for declining to regulate, I would further


note that not only is there no regulation, no rulemaking


here, but the Coast Guard letter was never even published


in the Federal Register.  It was never made available to


the public in any formal way whatsoever.  And it doesn't


even purport to set forth a definitive agency position on

the subject of propeller guards.  What the letter says is


that the agency is going to continue to consider the


matter and gather further data.  And so, this letter


itself lacks the force of law. 


The second reason, of course, is that even if


the Coast Guard could preempt simply by writing a letter,


our claims are not inconsistent with the Coast Guard's


stated reasons for declining to regulate.  The Coast Guard


was focusing on the lack of a universally acceptable


propeller guard solution, the costs of a retrofit, and


such other matters, and there's no inconsistency between


our claims --


QUESTION:  What if the Coast Guard's reason had


been we think putting the coast -- putting a propeller


guard on would make the -- the vessel even more dangerous?


MS. BRUECKNER:  There would still be no


preemption here because the Coast Guard letter lacks the


power to preempt.


QUESTION:  Would that satisfy the second


condition of -- of your two-prong test?


MS. BRUECKNER:  It would, Your Honor, but our


position is that there still has to be a regulation and


there's no regulation here. 


QUESTION:  Well, I understand. I'm just asking


you about the second part of your test.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The Coast Guard is the Federal agency charged


with administration of the Boat Safety Act and with the


promulgation of safety standards. 


And to understand the Coast Guard's traditional


view of these issues and the backdrop against which


Congress legislated, it may be helpful to look to what the


Coast Guard said at the time the Boat Safety Act was


proposed.  And if you'll look to page 31 of the blue


brief, this is the answer provided by the Commandant of


the Coast Guard when he was asked, in written form,


whether it was his view that compliance with Federal


safety standards would furnish a complete defense to


liability under common law or State law.  And he was


further asked, if there wouldn't be a complete defense,

should that be made explicit in the act.


And the Commandant said:  we do not believe that


compliance with promulgated standards under the act has


the effect of relieving a manufacturer from liability


under the usual tort law concerning negligence or


warranties.  For many --


QUESTION:  Go ahead. 


MR. STEWART:  For many years the Coast Guard has


required compliance with standards by inspected vessels. 


Courts have consistently held that a vessel owner's


compliance with Coast Guard inspection requirements is not


synonymous with seaworthiness under maritime law.  Though


the analogy is apparent, we would have no objection to an


express provision to clarify that a manufacturer's


compliance with promulgated standards does not by itself


relieve him of any tort liability which otherwise could


pertain. 


And I think the --


QUESTION:  Is he -- is the Commandant a lawyer?


MR. STEWART:  I'm not sure whether the


Commandant was a lawyer, but the -- the questions were


submitted to him in written form.  He was given time to


consult with his advisors and prepare his answers.


QUESTION:  But the Commandant's lawyer or the


Commandant might well admit that if, as Justice Ginsburg

pointed out, there's defective design, if -- if the


propeller falls apart and -- that then there's liability.


MR. STEWART:  I think -- I think what --


QUESTION:  So that -- this -- this thing that


you quote us just brings us right back to where we began.


MR. STEWART:  Well, I think a couple of things


are noteworthy about the way that the Commandant


responded. 


First, when he gave -- first, he made clear that


the Coast Guard was familiar and was comfortable with the


idea that even when it had inspected a vessel and had --


the -- the vessel had passed the Coast Guard's own


regulatory standards, nevertheless there was a -- the


possibility of damages liability based on unseaworthiness.


QUESTION:  Would --


QUESTION:  What do we care whether the Coast


Guard was happy?  I mean, this isn't even plumbing the


mind of Congress.  It's plumbing the mind of the Coast


Guard.  What do we care? 


MR. STEWART:  Well, I think part of the argument


on the other side has been that whatever the text of the


statute might say, the Court should strain to hold common


law claims --


QUESTION:  Well, maybe.  That may -- but what I


don't see here is whether he's aware of the fact which is

-- and I'm aware of it and you are -- that whatever


standard the Coast Guard has -- let's say you have to have


a 1-inch wire, and what my -- they mean by that is you


don't have to a 2-inch wire.  Okay?  Absolutely clear. 


And there is no point in telling the State of Idaho you


can't pass a law for a 2-inch wire when any jury in the


State of Idaho can come in with a judgment that does


precisely the same thing as that rule.  I mean, maybe this


Coast Guard Commandant doesn't care about whether it can


preempt at all, but it doesn't seem to me logical to take


the position you can't have a regulation but you can have


a tort judgment that is identical. 


MR. STEWART:  Well, first of all, the tort


judgment is not identical because it fulfills an important


purpose that the prescriptive standard doesn't, namely


compensating people who have actually been injured by


reason of defects.


QUESTION:  You could say we don't care if, in


fact, the rules that we're about to promulgate are totally


ignored by the States, as long as the purpose is to


compensate someone. 


MR. STEWART:  Well, as this Court made clear in


Geier, the effect of holding that State common law suits


are not categorically preempted is not that the Federal


judgments can be ignored; that is, there's still a role

for principles of conflict preemption.  The Court in Geier


said the point of the savings clause would be eviscerated


if common law claims were -- that were not identical to


Federal standards were categorically preempted. 


Nevertheless, particular common law claims can conflict


with the -- the text or purposes of particular


regulations. 


QUESTION:  The Commandant didn't seem to


understand that.  In -- in your endorsement of the


Commandant's statement, I thought you were disagreeing


with -- with counsel for the petitioners here who -- who


did say that there could be conflict preemption of common


law claims, anyway.  The Commandant doesn't even seem to


recognize that. 


MR. STEWART:  I think what he is saying is we


have always understood that compliance with our regulatory


requirements will not furnish a categorical defense to


suits at common law and we would understand the same --


QUESTION:  Well -- well, maybe it ought to be


interpreted, to try to make sense of this scheme, as


certainly covering the situation where the State by its


common law doctrine tries to make a requirement that the


Coast Guard has -- and the Federal Government has flatly


contradicted by regulation.  That may not be this case,


but if the Coast Guard were to pass a regulation saying no

propeller guards should be put on boats because we think


it is more dangerous, if they have them, now we should


interpret the savings clause as not allowing a cause of


action on that same ground.


MR. STEWART:  That's exactly right and that's


precisely the analysis that the Court went through in


Geier and it's the analysis we urge the --


QUESTION:  But -- but under your -- your


rationale, you say, oh, but there's a duty to compensate,


and that's different.  Why doesn't that same argument


apply so that you tell Justice O'Connor, oh, yes, the jury


can -- can go full speed ahead? 


MR. STEWART:  I mean, I think the Court has


often pointed out in various contexts that even where it


can be said that a primary goal of Congress was X, we


shouldn't assume that Congress intended to pursue that


goal at all costs.  The point is simply that Congress drew


a somewhat different balance with respect to common law


actions than it did with -- with respect to prescriptive


rules. 


And I think part of the reason for that was that


Congress was establishing a mechanism by which the Coast


Guard could itself promulgate prescriptive safety


standards.  In ousting State law, it was replacing State


law with something else.  But the Boat Safety Act doesn't

contain any mechanism by which an injured person can seek


compensation for his injuries, and therefore it was


natural for Congress to determine that subject to conflict


preemption principles, the remedial mechanisms that had


previously been available should continue to be available. 


And I think --


QUESTION:  Well, maybe -- maybe it doesn't do


that much.  I mean, maybe the savings clause allows causes


of action for breach of warranty, for negligent operation


of the boat, and things like that. 


MR. STEWART:  I -- well, the -- the same could


have been said of the savings clause in Geier, but the


Court, nevertheless, concluded that common law actions


were not categorically preempted.  And I think the reason,


as Ms. Brueckner said, was that no one could have supposed


that common law claims going to an entirely different


aspect of the manufacturer's conduct than the divine,


design feature that was at issue in -- in the Coast


Guard's regulatory --


QUESTION:  I -- I don't see how you -- you talk


about straining.  All -- there is some -- number of


statutes.  They all read a little differently, but there


isn't really that much substantive difference between


them.  And although the Court has disagreed, I've tended


to take the view, treat statutes and common law alike, and

probably they're not preempted either unless the agency


comes in and makes it pretty clear that they are.  Now,


that's pretty easy for people to follow.  If they want to


argue pro and con preemption, they go to the agency.


MR. STEWART:  I think that may --


QUESTION:  So wouldn't I reach that same


position here? 


MR. STEWART:  That -- that might be a legitimate


rule to follow in the absence of statutory language


expressly addressing the subject, but here we have one


provision that says a State may not establish a law


requirement of setting forth a safety standard or


requirement for associated equipment unless it is


identical to a Federal safety standard.


And then in the savings clause it says -- and


this is at page App. 6 of the blue brief -- compliance


with this chapter or standards, regulations, or orders


prescribed under this chapter does not relieve a person


from liability at common law under State law.  So whatever


that means, it has to mean there will be some


circumstances under which the manufacturer complies with


all applicable Federal rules and yet is nevertheless held


liable under the common law.  And --


QUESTION:  Very simple.  In those situations


where you -- as you just heard, the ones that the

petitioner just argued for.


QUESTION:  Design defect.


MR. STEWART:  But -- but if -- if the same rule


of preemption were applied to common law suits as to


prescriptive regulations, namely that the State couldn't


do anything that was not identical to Federal law, it


could never be the case that a manufacturer who complied


with Federal law could, nevertheless, be held liable at


common law.  The -- the preemption clause and the savings


clause, read together, compel the conclusion that Congress


at least intended a different rule of preemption to apply.


QUESTION:  That's -- that's not -- that's not


true.  The Coast Guard doesn't say how the -- the


propeller should be manufactured, out of a -- an eighth of


an inch or -- or of a tenth of an inch blade.  And if the


smaller blade falls apart, you can sue the manufacturer.


MR. STEWART:  But I -- I don't think anyone


would have contended that such a suit would be preempted


by the preemption clause even in the absence of the


savings clause.


And again, this is exactly the same situation


that was before the Court in Geier.  Had -- had that


argument been a sound one, the Court would presumably have


construed the -- the Motor Vehicle Safety Act savings


clause that was at issue there --

 QUESTION:  Geier didn't have the same clause,

MR. STEWART:  But it does refer --


QUESTION:  -- because you -- you have to


distinguish State -- not just State common law, but State


statutes.  You have to draw some line that is going to


exclude State statutes as well as the common law. 


MR. STEWART:  Well, it does refer to -- may I


finish? 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. STEWART:  It refers to liability under -- at


common law or under State law, and therefore State law is


most naturally taken to be a reference to laws that


accomplish purposes similar to those of the common law.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Stewart. 


Mr. Shapiro, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. SHAPIRO:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


I think a word of history here explains some of


the mystery surrounding the statutory language.  For over


90 years, Congress has specified the safety equipment that


has to be installed on motorboats, and it was in 1937 that


26

this Court ruled in Kelly v. Washington that the States


may not impose their own requirements for safety equipment


on boats that travel in interstate waters.  And that was


the background of this legislation. 


This act preempts State law creating any


requirement for boat equipment that is not identical with


the prescribed Coast Guard regulation.  And this serves a


critical fail-safe purpose.  Risky devices like propeller


guards may not be imposed on the public under State law


unless and until they're approved by the expert regulatory


agency under the criteria that Congress has laid down.


Now, this preemption provision has three


exceptions which are written right into the provision, but


none of those exceptions fits this case.  So my friends


have to make the argument that this general savings


clause, which says nothing about preemption, is another


implicit exception, but that's inconsistent --


QUESTION:  Unless there's just no Federal


regulation at all on this.


MR. SHAPIRO:  And -- and --


QUESTION:  Maybe the Federal Government has not


-- acting through the Coast Guard, has made no


requirement, no decision at all. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  And the -- the wisdom of this


statute is that until the Coast Guard makes a decision

about a device like propeller guards, they may not be


imposed on the public. 


Think of what happens under Justice Kennedy's


example.  If Illinois commands installation of these


devices and backs up that judgment with millions of


dollars in damages, people in 49 other States are exposed


to the risks and burdens of propeller guards.


QUESTION:  Well, not necessarily.  I mean, you


say if Illinois imposes it, I mean, this is one reason, it


seems to me, that you can take the statute at -- at its


word.  The common law never imposes a requirement.  This


jury found that a propeller -- that failure to have a


propeller guard was negligence.  Another jury in another


case in the same State may find that the failure to have a


propeller guard was not negligence.  There's no State


requirement being imposed. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, we agree with the statement


in Garmon that the Court, for preemption purposes, should


assume compliance and then ask what are the implications.


The implications are that Illinois could coerce the


installation of these devices.  Another State may


disagree.


QUESTION:  On the basis of one jury verdict?


MR. SHAPIRO:  Or one or --


QUESTION:  It's like in tort actions in general.

I don't see how you get from one jury verdict, that that


becomes the positive law of the State, that you must have


a propeller guard.


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, after the first jury


verdict, then the -- in come the claims for punitive


damages in the next case, and there is a powerful coercive


effect from damage actions.  This Court has said so.


QUESTION:  Mr. Shapiro, isn't it true that there


all -- aren't there -- isn't it true there are all sorts


of cases in which different designs of boats may have a --


be more dangerous than other designs, depending on whether


they have a propeller guard? 


I notice that one of the allegations in the


prayer for relief in the complaint was they provided an


unreasonably dangerous design in utilizing an unprotected


propeller.  That -- as I read that, that wouldn't


necessarily mean every boat needed a -- a propeller guard,


but rather some particularly dangerous designs might need


one. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, what's --


QUESTION:  So that you get some preemption and


some not. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  The -- what the safety council


found, the Coast Guard's committee of 21 experts, was that


for all boats that travel more than 10 miles an hour,

these are infeasible devices.  And the reason is you have


to match the propeller guard with the particular engine


and the particular hull combination.  There are thousands


and thousands of hulls out there. 


QUESTION:  But the -- the Coast Guard itself


didn't find anything.  It said we're not making the


standard now.  As counsel for petitioner pointed out,


there is no formal action.  There's just non-action by the


Coast Guard.


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, the -- the Coast Guard said


that the available accident data compiled by the 21


experts did not support a propeller guard requirement


under the --


QUESTION:  But they were still watching it. 


They didn't make a -- a determination that propeller


guards are dangerous, therefore should not be used.  They


said we're still keeping this under advisement.


MR. SHAPIRO:  And in April of 2001, they looked


at this again, and the Coast Guard representative on the


safety council said we realize we cannot mandate


installation of propeller guards.  They're not feasible,


and the propeller guard subcommittee said again, these


will increase blunt trauma injuries. 


QUESTION:  This is something that's published,


that's -- that's a formal kind of action?

through any, in effect, administrative procedure kind of


formal action? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, but under this statute, that


isn't necessary, Your Honor.  It -- they -- they did


have --


QUESTION:  Well, it may be -- it may not be


necessary in the sense that they are under an obligation


to do it, but if they don't do something like that, I -- I


don't know that their -- their announcement has any


particular status that's relevant here. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, because of the wording of


this statute, which is so different from Geier -- it's the


exact opposite of Geier -- under this statute, unless


there's an identical Coast Guard regulation in place,


State law is preempted. 


QUESTION:  I don't see how it is so different


from Geier.  I mean, you read it as saying if there's no


regulation at all, no requirements, then the State


couldn't have any tort law? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, as to equipment, associated


equipment, for boats, unless there's a Coast Guard

regulation in place, the States can't mandate that


equipment. 


QUESTION:  All right.  Then you would say, for


example -- not just that, but in your view if you had,


like a propeller that shot torpedoes, I mean, something


that was absolutely absurd, you -- the State would not be


able to have a tort judgment based on that even though the


Coast Guard has never had the chance to look into it?


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well --


QUESTION:  Now, I mean, I grant you that's a


possible reading. 


But I think perhaps a better reading of it would


be that you can't have a -- a rule or a regulation or a


tort judgment or any other requirement of law different


from a Coast Guard requirement when there is a


requirement. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  But not when there isn't. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Your Honor, we -- we think that


overlooks the history that I began with because under this


Court's decisions, the States could not impose


requirements for equipment or -- or construction, design


or structure for boats moving in interstate waters.  That


was Kelly v. Washington, a unanimous opinion by Chief


Justice Hughes.

 QUESTION:  But, Mr. Shapiro, in -- in this very


setting, the Coast Guard said, when this Boat Safety Act


was new, States, until we get around to doing this, your


law controls.  So there must have been some scope for


State law regulating equipment that was there for the


Coast Guard to say, it will take us time to get our


regulations.  In the meantime, State law applies.  So


there must have been some law to apply in the States.


MR. SHAPIRO:  Oh, yes, there -- there are three


exceptions to the preemption provision.  They're explicit


exceptions, and we don't have to go looking to the savings


clause for a fourth, implied exception. 


There -- there is an exception if the Coast


Guard grants an exemption under APA procedures.  They


didn't do that here. 


There's another exemption for local hazardous


conditions, but that exception doesn't fit here either. 


QUESTION:  But I'm talking about in the interim. 


It's from -- what was it -- '71 to '73?


MR. SHAPIRO:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  The rules that applied were State


rules because the Coast Guard said, States, your law


controls while we haven't got any yet.


MR. SHAPIRO:  That's the key point, Your Honor. 


That was done by formal exemption, and that shows that

been State law.  You -- you -- I thought you were saying


it's been forever or for a very long time that only


Federal law sets the standards.


MR. SHAPIRO:  Yes.


QUESTION:  The Coast Guard must have thought


there were standards in existence that could be applied.


MR. SHAPIRO:  What -- what was happening,


according to the legislative history, is the States were


beginning to require battery covers, anchors, lines, and


other pieces of associated equipment, including warning


decals on the boats, and Congress says, this has to stop.


There's nothing wrong with these requirements, but we


can't have 50 sets of them.  So this field is being


preempted for associated equipment requirements until the


Coast Guard adopts a regulation or the Coast Guard gives


an exemption, which it did in 1971. 


And I think the structure is very important. 


This is so different from Geier.  There was not a


structure like this with three exceptions written right


into the statute, and to treat the savings clause, which


doesn't say a word about preemption and which the


legislative history says is simply a matter of State law

defenses, as a fourth, implied exception to preemption


truly does violence to the structure of this law.


QUESTION:  Well, what do you --


QUESTION:  How do you treat the savings clause? 


What -- what do you think it means? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  It does not address preemption at


all.  It addresses an affirmative defense that it -- that


could be available under State law.  That's the defense of


compliance with Coast Guard regulations or orders or any


provision of this entire statute. 


Now, section 288C of the Restatement of Torts --


this is an echo of section 288C which was published just a


few years before Congress passed the savings provision. 


It doesn't deal with preemption at all.  It deals with --


with compliance. 


QUESTION:  Right.  To make this clear, would you


identify the kinds of cases that you envision at State law


that this clause, in effect, says you may not defend


conclusively by claiming compliance with a Coast Guard


reg?  What kinds of cases? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  It has a huge scope of operation,


unlike Geier.  To start with the Coast Guard's example,


the ordinary negligence case, negligent operation was very


important to Congress because most of these propeller


accidents occur because of negligent operation or reckless

operation of the boat.  That's what the Coast Guard says


on its web site today.  And so the defendant couldn't


defend by saying, gee, my boat complies with all the Coast


Guard regulations --


QUESTION:  Okay.  No, no, I understand your


point.  But you've got negligent operation and what --


what else do you have in mind? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  The -- the next thing the Coast


Guard referred to is express warranty.  The defendant


couldn't say simply because I've complied with this long


list of Coast Guard requirements, I don't have to honor my


contractual promises or --


QUESTION:  Okay.  How about negligent


manufacture?


MR. SHAPIRO:  Negligent installation is


certainly covered, and defective manufacture is also


protected by the savings clause.  That's when a particular


unit comes off the assembly line and it's defective. 


Those were the original tort cases --


QUESTION:  I -- I suppose there would be some


close cases.  Suppose there's two ways to make a


propeller.  One is to have it slightly canted with a


teflon cover and -- and a gear mechanism that makes it


stop the minute it hits a hard object.  The other is the


cheaper way, to make it terribly sharp and no -- no

ability to stop.  Could the injured party sue the


manufacturer of the second kind, the -- the cheap,


dangerous kind of propeller?


MR. SHAPIRO:  It is possible and for this


reason.  The language of the statute for associated


equipment only preempts requirements for associated


equipment.  And that could be construed to mean simply


requirements to install propeller guards, which you've not


installed. 


Now, if you took a different interpretation of


requirements for, it might encompass that case, but this


Court could give a narrow construction to requirements


for. 


And this case is the paradigm case because


manufacturers have decided not to use this kind of safety


equipment because they know it's a hazard.  It's a known


hazard.  Several courts have disapproved these devices. 


21 safety experts of the Coast Guard have pointed out the


dangers this creates.  So manufacturers have consciously


-- 

QUESTION:  Mr. Shapiro, I'm not sure you


answered my question before.  Again, supposing 90 percent


of the boats really don't need a propeller guard, using


the reasoning of the committee that decided not to


recommend.  But there are 10 percent that are some exotic

design that's particularly dangerous and they really are


dangerous unless they have a -- a propeller guard on them. 


Could you say that -- that 10 percent has to be treated


like the 90 percent? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, because the manufacturer


doesn't know --


QUESTION:  Well, it's the design.  I'm just


talking about a particular design --


MR. SHAPIRO:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- that seems to be particularly


hazardous if you had the propeller too close to the person


operating the boat or something like that. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, the reason that's preempted


and that that is a requirement for associated equipment,


even in the case that you give, is because the


manufacturer has no idea what hull is going to be put


together with this motor.  The motor can move from hull to


hull to hull. 


And what the Coast Guard found -- the -- the


committee found in its report was that you have to have an


exact hydrodynamic fit between the particular engine and


the particular hull and the particular propeller guard. 


So if juries, say, impose propeller guards on -- on


designs we think are dangerous --


QUESTION:  Yes, but what if the manufacturer of

the propeller is on notice that it's being -- was being


purchased for a particularly dangerous design, as I've


described?  It seems to me sometimes the -- the company


could know what kind of boats it's going on.


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, we -- we rely on the logic


of this committee report which says that -- that for all


planing boats that go 10 miles an hour or faster, these


devices are counterproductive because they interfere with


steering.  They double the amount of fuel that's consumed. 


They increase air and water pollution and they create


serious hazards of blunt trauma injury. 


So what the -- the committee found was that


these devices for any category of planing boat -- and here


we have a boat that goes 50 miles an hour.  We've got an


18-foot ski boat with a 115 horsepower engine. 


QUESTION:  But you could -- it seems to me as a


matter of defense to tort liability, you could put all


that evidence in, and say in this particular case, our


design was sensible for the very reasons you just


described.  Therefore, we're not negligent. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, that's true in many of these


preemption cases, but all it takes is an errant jury


verdict or two or three to coerce a decision by the


manufacturer to install devices that are very hazardous to


the public.

 QUESTION:  Then all you'd have to do is go to


the Coast Guard and say, look what's happened, and then


they'd be explicit, if you're right.  And the other side


there would have a chance to argue to the Coast Guard that


you're not right. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Justice Breyer, that's cold


comfort.  They would hand us this brief that they've just


submitted saying that it's up to the jury to decide


whatever the jury wants. 


QUESTION:  Well, fine.  If that's the policy of


the Coast Guard, then I don't see why you should rely upon


them for preemption.


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, because Congress had a


different vision.  Congress was going with the rule of


Kelly, Kelly against Washington. 


QUESTION:  Well, why did Congress then say


minimum standards?  It didn't say the Coast Guard


standards are necessarily adequate.  It just said, Coast


Guard, set minimum standards.


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, the legislative history is


very explicit on that.  The boating associations and the


manufacturers associations had all kinds of very elaborate


standards of their own, and everybody said during these


hearings that is to be encouraged.  We want them to do


more of that.  The statute shouldn't stop that.

But there was no suggestion that the States could


intervene and impose their own standards and their own


requirements.  And in fact, in the Ray decision, this


Court said minimum standards under another similar statute


do not mean -- do not mean that the States can embroider


on and supplement those -- those standards. 


And after all, the preemption provision here


doesn't say anything about minimum standards or maximum


standards.  It says all requirements for boat safety


equipment are preempted unless there is an identical Coast


Guard regulation in place.  This is the rule of Kelly


against Washington which --


QUESTION:  Mr. Shapiro, do you cite Kelly


against Washington in your brief? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  We did not.  Plaintiffs cited it


in their brief.  It's 302 U.S.  And I'll give the Court


the cite.  I think it's critically important.  302 U.S. at


14 through 15. 


QUESTION:  It's critically important, but you


didn't even cite it. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, it's quoted in the cases


that we do cite.  It's quoted in the Ray decision.  It's a


-- it's an early precursor of Ray and in Locke.  I was


explaining it as -- as the background of Congress's


legislation here.

 And I'd like to suggest to the Court that it


makes a huge difference here that this is a case that


arises in the maritime context.  At a minimum, the


maritime context means there is no presumption against


preemption, as the court below held.  And because Congress


wanted to achieve uniformity --


QUESTION:  Well, I mean, that may be true if


you're talking about commercial boating, but it's not true


of recreational boating. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Oh, yes, it is.  We believe it is,


Your Honor, because this Court --


QUESTION:  Little motorboats? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  5-foot skiffs and little put-puts?


MR. SHAPIRO:  Since the '40s and the '50s, this


Court, and later in Foremost and in Sisson, this Court has


held that recreational boats fall squarely within the


maritime jurisdiction. 


QUESTION:  Even in New Hampshire? 


(Laughter.) 


MR. SHAPIRO:  I -- there may be some carve-out


for New Hampshire in this statute. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. SHAPIRO:  And I've tried to figure out the


reasons for that carve-out, and I've never -- I've never

understood those. 


But this is maritime context, and this lake --


the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has held


that is -- it's a navigable interstate body of water.


QUESTION:  Yes, because it -- it happens to lie


on the border between two States, but not every landlocked


lake is subject to -- to Coast Guard maritime


jurisdiction. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Oh, absolutely not.  It has to be


an interstate body of water. 


But since the 1850s, this Court has held that


interstate waterways are subject to the maritime


jurisdiction.


And this waterway, by the way, was constructed


by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  It's surrounded with


marinas that rent pleasure boats, and this is big


business, the pleasure boating business, on Dale Hollow


Lake. 


And because this is a maritime context, that


says a lot about the savings clause, because this Court


has held that in maritime cases, savings clauses should be


interpreted narrowly to avoid obstructing the carefully


constructed preemption provision in the statute and to


avoid making an end run around the Coast Guard's expert


supervision, which is what Congress wanted.

 And we go further and say that because the court


below was right in characterizing this as an admiralty


case, any conflict between Illinois law and Federal law is


just imaginary.  That's because Federal common law follows


Federal maritime jurisdiction, and there can't be --


QUESTION:  But you didn't argue that.  I mean,


in Illinois -- all through the Illinois State courts, the


assumption was that the -- the law to be applied, if you


could have a common law, would be Illinois common law, not


some Federal maritime common law.


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, the Illinois Supreme Court


agreed with us on this point.  They have two pages in


their opinion --


QUESTION:  They -- all they said is that the --


the preemptive force is different.  They did not say that


Illinois common law was displaced.  That is, if there is


State law to -- if there is law other than the Coast Guard


regulations to apply, it was Illinois State law all -- all


along.  And as far as I know, it wasn't until this Court


that you raised the question, never mind State law, the


Federal maritime law would control in any event.


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, we think this is an included


question.  It was certainly addressed by the court below.


The court below cited this Court's Jensen decision, which


is the leading maritime preemption decision.  And it was

using maritime analysis to support the preemption holding


that the court ultimately made.  Now, this was step number


one in our preemption argument below, but we're entitled


to elaborate it in this Court and cite additional cases.


QUESTION:  Well, why was the argument that


Illinois law is preempted, why was that at issue at all


if, as you say, there is no State law in this area?  It's


all Federal. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, we -- we proceeded to argue


in the alternative that under express preemption and under


a conflict preemption that -- that State law was


preempted.  But with a two-page discussion in this opinion


on maritime, I think it is an addressed and included


question.  And if the Court doesn't consider --


QUESTION:  Did you -- in your -- in the briefing


of this case in the State court, did you make the argument


Federal law covers the waterfront?  There is no State law


to apply?. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  We made the first part of the


argument.  We said Federal law covers the waterfront


because Congress conceived of this as a maritime question


and was preempting State law broadly, exerting its


traditional, under Kelly against Washington, the usual


Federal Government role over equipment installed on


motorboats.  And we said that this is an enclave of

Federal law.  And we cited this Court's Yamaha decision


and we cited the Foremost decision.  We cited admiralty


cases and we said it was an admiralty case. 


QUESTION:  But Yamaha said that this is an open


question, and it didn't resolve it. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Right, but our -- my point is that


we were citing this Court's admiralty decisions.  And then


the Illinois Supreme Court went further and cited a host


of additional admiralty decisions.  Now, when you have


that kind of discussion in a State court opinion of a


Federal law issue, this Court, I believe, can reach that


as an included question and it's an intertwined question. 


And let me suggest it is the easiest way to


resolve and the narrowest way to resolve this case because


it is propeller guard-specific.  It makes no aggressive


law regarding tort claims on -- on the land, and --


QUESTION:  But, Mr. Shapiro, the Solicitor


General disagrees with you on this point.


MR. SHAPIRO:  The Solicitor General hasn't


briefed this point, the maritime law point.


QUESTION:  I -- I thought his brief said he


thought they're wrong on the presumption going the other


way.  I'm pretty sure that's in his brief. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, I don't think --

action had been in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, instead of


where it was, you'd have a different result or you might


have a different result? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  I think you'd have the same


result, but you would have fewer reasons for reaching that


same result. 


QUESTION:  The argument you're making now would


not apply. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  It would not apply.  It would


apply to -- to Lake Michigan but not to Lake Geneva. 


Now, I'd like -- like to return to Justice


Kennedy's comment about the conflicting judgments among


State courts.  If -- if Illinois were to mandate propeller


guards and back up the judgment with millions of dollars


in damages, that would impose these devices on all the


people in the United States, and at everybody's estimate,


these are risky devices with serious problems.  And in the


next case in another State, we would be sued for


installing these devices. 


The Walt Disney World was sued.  They put a


little propeller guard on a bumper boat and they were sued


when a kid's arm got caught in the propeller guard.  So


sure as can be, if -- if one State mandates them, the next


State is going to penalize them. 


And the legislatures of the State -- this is the

worst and most shocking aspect of this theory.  The


legislatures of the States could not protect their


citizens against --


QUESTION:  I don't see that, Mr. Shapiro.  I


don't know why the Illinois State legislature couldn't say


that our State law is the Coast Guard's standards and


nothing else.  A State legislature could see that this


kind of result of a jury never happens again.  The State


would be free to say precisely that whatever the Coast


Guard includes is the law, and what they haven't included,


it can't be required.  The State legislature could enact


such a law.  I don't see why it couldn't. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  What it -- what it could not enact


is a law that says no boats coming into the State of


Illinois or California may be equipped with propeller


guards.  Why?  Because that's not identical with the Coast


Guard regulation. 


And yet, the juries in various States could be


imposing these devices.  People could be losing their


lives and boats --


QUESTION:  Why couldn't a State legislature say,


satisfaction of the minimum standards prescribed by the


Coast Guard excludes any other liability for design


defects? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Well --

 QUESTION:  Why couldn't the State legislature


say that? 


MR. SHAPIRO:  I think that that may well be a


safety standard in disguise, but it -- the State could not


do the thing that it really had to do which was to


prohibit boats using propeller guards.  If -- if juries in


various parts of the United States put pressure on


manufacturers to put propeller guards on their boats, the


legislature needs the power to say no, this can't come


into the -- can't come into the State.  But that is


clearly preempted under the SG's interpretation of the


statute.


And I think that is a true disservice to


federalism, to have these kinds of conflicting judgments,


and it shows the wisdom of Congress's architecture in this


statute, that the States may not impose requirements for


propeller guards unless and until the Coast Guard vets


these proposals, finds that they're safe, finds that they


satisfy Federal criteria of feasibility and safety, and


adopts the rule and a regulation. 


It's like FDA legislation, protect the public


against common law claims of this sort that could have


such serious adverse effects on the public. 


QUESTION:  Well, you -- you say that -- that in


the situation you -- where you have the conflicting jury

verdicts, which I agree is a problem, you go to the Coast


Guard and tell them that, and they just say, oh, that's


too bad.  We don't care.  They might not say that, of


course.  But -- but if they did say that, that's why


Congress insisted that you have this identical


requirement.  That's your view. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  But suppose they do just refuse to


have any requirement.  I mean, that's equally absurd to


me.  On the one hand, you point to one absurdity one way,


but it seems equally absurd to have no law in the area


where the Coast Guard just refuses to act. 


MR. SHAPIRO:  The -- there's a good reason for


refusing to act in this instance, and that is, these


devices are very hazardous.  You can't turn the boat


safely.  There's a danger of blunt trauma injury that is


worse than the propeller slices.  A surgeon can slice up


propeller slices occasionally, but the blunt trauma injury


from a propeller guard is lethal if it hits you in the


chest or in the head.


And it -- it -- the steering is interfered with. 


You have to double the horsepower of these engines once


you put a big bird cage around or a big circle around the


propeller guard.  There -- there are thousands of pounds


per square inch of pressure exerted on these propeller

guards, and they create a serious navigation hazard. 


And it -- it isn't just the committee that in


1990 concluded that these were dangerous.  These were 30


experts on safety appointed by the Secretary of


Transportation that assigned all these dangers and


feasibility problems. 


And this is exactly, by the way, what seven


courts have held who've looked on -- at propeller guards


on the merits.  They've held that these devices are not


feasible and that they're dangerous.  There's not a single


court in the United States that has said that these have


to be installed. 


And so, this is the problem, the real world


problem, of having individual juries listen to those who


lost before the administrative forum on propeller guards. 


Okay, we're going to start all over again in the court


system, and now we're going to get juries to start


commanding installation of propeller guards.  There's a


real world hazard, a danger for the public, and Congress


has wisely drafted this statute to protect us and our


children against that risk. 


Now, these devices clearly raise policy concerns


of nationwide significance and that's why the Coast Guard


had to consider these issues in proceedings around the


country that lasted for 18 months.  Many sectors of

society are affected by these devices, and Congress just


did not intend that individual juries were going to make


these decisions for the whole country.  This would be


extraterritorial regulation with a vengeance, just what


this Court said in Locke should not be done under State


law. 


Now, my friend also has argued in the brief that


safety is the goal of the Boat Safety Act, and that


uniformity is just a secondary concern.  But Congress did


pursue its safety agenda through a particular method, and


that was uniform standards for marine equipment.  Congress


wanted the whole Nation to benefit from safe and efficient


standards, and it wanted the whole Nation to be protected


against standards and requirements that represent risky


experiments.  And that's just what propeller guards are.


And that's why the Coast Guard said in 1991 that these


standards have to meet stringent Federal criteria before


they're imposed. 


And that does bring us back to congressional


intent because when Congress passed this preemption


provision, the States were starting to adopt requirements


for battery covers and for warning placards on boats and


for lines and anchors.  And Congress said, that's fine,


but we can't have 50 sets of these requirements.  We've


got to be uniform set of these requirements.  And it is

untenable to conclude that although the harbor master at


Belmont Harbor cannot compel the installation of propeller


guards, the Circuit Court of Cook County is perfectly free


to do that with a big threat of damages.  Both of these


are exercises of Illinois law and they're both preempted.


We accordingly urge this Court to affirm the


decision of the Illinois Supreme Court. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Shapiro. 


Ms. Brueckner, you have 3 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LESLIE A. BRUECKNER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. BRUECKNER:  Your Honor, the -- the maritime


argument was waived.  The reason the United States never


briefed it is that respondents didn't even raise it in


their opposition brief to this Court.  It was never raised


until they filed their brief on the merits.  This is not


the time or place to decide the issue raised by


respondent, particularly the Yamaha question that was


specifically left reserved in Justice Ginsburg's opinion. 


On the savings clause, their whole argument is


that the savings clause must be read simply to preserve


breach of warranty and negligent installation claims.  Not


only is this not supported by the language of the clause,


which is itself broad, but the legislative history of the


Boat Safety Act in the Senate report -- let's forget about

the Commandant for the time being.  The Senate report


states -- and I'm quoting from the blue brief at 32 --


that the purpose of this section to assure that in a


product liability suit mere compliance with the minimum


standards promulgated under the act will not be a complete


defense to liability.  This demonstrates that Congress had


in mind product liability actions just like this one.


Respondent also claims that these boats are --


are terribly -- that propeller guards are terribly


hazardous and the Coast Guard has found this.  Well, first


of all, the Coast Guard letter doesn't say anything about


the hazards of propeller guards. 


And contrary to Mr. Shapiro's contention, in


April 2001, the Coast Guard's advisory committee issued --


stated in its minutes a recommendation that the Coast


Guard actually require propeller guards as one of four


permitted options on boats exactly like this one.  This is


-- the cite is on page 11, footnote 14 of the yellow


brief.  So not only did the Coast Guard not find in 1990


that propeller guards are hazardous, but it's considering


requiring them on boats just like this one.


On the conflicting judgments point, Mr. Shapiro


raises the specter of conflicting jury verdicts in these


cases and Congress cannot possibly have intended that


result.  That's exactly the result that Congress permitted

in the context of motor vehicles where, absent a Federal


safety standard, the States are -- juries are permitted to


impose whatever liability they choose.  And even where


there's a minimum standard, under Geier, jury verdicts may


be permitted to go forward. 


But if -- and indeed there are conflicting jury


verdicts that arise, the Coast Guard can step into the


breach, and as Justice Ginsburg suggested, State


legislatures could pass a rule saying that no liability


could be imposed in cases like this one.


I would also point out on this conflicting jury


verdict problem that we are not seeking punitive damages


in this case.  Punitive damages are not available in


Illinois in a wrongful death action. 


Finally, I would note that the absence of a


regulation is itself reason to find no preemption here. 


This statute, as we read it, provides that common law


claims may be permitted to go forward unless there's a


conflict.  Here there's no regulation.  There's no formal


statement of agency purposes.  There's no articulated


reasons that our claim could possibly conflict with.


And finally, at the end of the day, we have a


victim here who would be left without any compensation


whatsoever if this Court holds that common law claims are


preempted.  We would urge this Court to permit our claims

Thank you. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Ms.


Brueckner.
