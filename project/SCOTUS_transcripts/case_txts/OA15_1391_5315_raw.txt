CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

  

 

 

 

 

argument first this morning in Case 15-1391, Expressions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hair Design v. Schneiderman. 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Gupta. 

 

              

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

This case is about whether the State may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminalize truthful speech that merchants believe is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their most effective way of communicating the hidden 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cost of credit cards to their customers. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

By design, New York's law suppresses the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

message that you pay more --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I -- I --

    

   

  

 

 

you're two groups of -- of Petitioners.  One wants to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just give a cash price without any information about the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surcharge, and the other, I thought, wanted to give two 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate prices.  So not everybody doesn't want to give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

truthful information about the surcharge. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  No -- well, they do, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They all want to do the same thing.  They -- they -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think what you're referring to is that some of them are

doing different things now. 

 

 

 

4 

            

One of the Petitioners, Expressions Hair 

 

 

 

 

 

Design, is engaging in dual pricing, they're charging 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two different prices, one for cash, one for credit, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are trying as hard as they can to describe that as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- as a discount so that they comply with the law. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The other Petitioners right now are 

 

 

 

 

 

refraining from dual pricing altogether, because they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't want to run the risk of -- of failing to comply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with this regime.  But if we win this case, all of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners would like to charge two different prices 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for cash or for credit, and they would like to be able 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to characterize the price difference as a surcharge for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

using a credit card. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's not what I 

  

 

 

 

 

understood, but your adversary can tell me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Gupta, what -- what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

speech precisely do you think is being restricted? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  The -- the message that when you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use a credit card, you're paying more, and to be more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precise, I think if you look at Joint Appendix 103 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through 104, you'll find there the supplemental 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declaration of Expressions Hair Design where they say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly what they'd like to do.  And if you look at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yellow brief, it's page 1 of the yellow brief, we have a

chart.  And what we'd like to do, ideally, is describe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

the pastrami sandwich as $10, and then tell you that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's going to cost a certain percentage more, 2 percent 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

more, to pay with a credit card. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I guess that's why I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

said like what speech precisely, and you said the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

message that you're going to pay more if you use a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit card. 

 

            

            

MR. GUPTA:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, you know, as -- this --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this statute is not written in terms of speech, it's --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's written in terms of imposing a surcharge.  And --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and let's say that somebody -- let's say that there is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merchant and the merchant charges the list price for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something as a dollar and the person comes up to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cash register and offers a dollar bill. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GUPTA:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and the cashier says, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

oh, no.  For you it's 95 cents because I impose a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surcharge for people who use credit cards; right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

law? 

            

MR. GUPTA:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now, would that violate this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GUPTA:  I -- you know, I don't know, and 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

what -- part of the difficulty is -- and the reason, we

have a vagueness challenge --

   

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You don't know?  How would 

  

  

 

 

 

 

it violate the law? 

 

 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  I don't think -- I don't think 

    

   

 

 

 

 

it would.  I don't think it would.  And certainly the 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

State hasn't taken that position --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You don't think it would. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GUPTA:  I don't think it would. 

    

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Even though you're 

  

 

 

 

describing something as a surcharge.  Because -- the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

reason it wouldn't violate the law is because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct is, you know -- it -- it fits the law, right, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that essentially you're not imposing a surcharge on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

credit card users.  Whatever you call it, however you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

describe it, you're not imposing a surcharge on credit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

card users. 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  Well, I think the way this law 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

works is that you can engage in precisely the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct.  You can charge the two different prices, one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for cash, one for credit, and what -- what runs afoul of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the law is describing the price difference one way as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surcharge versus a credit, and you know that --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  See, that's what you keep --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- you said that again --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  Right.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- and I think my 

   

  

 

 

 

7 

hypothetical was designed to show that that's just not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right. 

              

I mean, I can imagine ways in which you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

might say that this is restricting speech, but that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not it.  Because as long as the price listed is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

higher price, is the price that a credit card company 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to pay, as long as that's true, you can describe it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any which way you please.  And you can describe it in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms of impose -- of -- of imposing a surcharge or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charging credit card customers more, and it still is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to violate this law. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  I -- I don't think so, 

    

   

 

 

 

Justice Kagan, and I think in your hypothetical --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- it -- in your hypothetical, the merchant hasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

telegraphed to the consumer at the same time the two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prices, right?  That's not what our clients want to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engage in. 

 

            

If -- if New York wants to continue to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforce this statute against deceptive practices or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

false advertising, we have no problem with that.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is an as-applied challenge, and the merchants in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case want to engage in truthful speech.  They want to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclose more.  They want to --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  They want to do more.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

want to impose a surcharge. 

   

 

 

8 

            

            

MR. GUPTA:  No.  No --

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Then what's the problem 

  

 

 

 

 

with saying -- you -- you don't -- you're too young to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know what the OPA was. 

 

 

 

 

            

Breyer. 

MR. GUPTA:  I think -- I think so, Justice 

    

   

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's called the Office of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Price Administration. 

 

            

            

MR. GUPTA:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Ken Galbraith ran it for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

awhile.  And they would -- what they would do, he said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is they'd go around and they'd smell what the right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price was. 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  Mm-hmm. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And after they said that in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

World War II, you couldn't charge a higher price. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Would you have come in and said, Ken 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Galbraith says you can only charge $13 for this item. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It violates our free speech. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  Absolutely --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because we want to charge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

$15. 

            

MR. GUPTA:  Absolutely not, Justice Breyer.

MR. GUPTA:  And I agree, if you look at this

it, I want to know --

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GUPTA:  Right.

that says you are allowed to call it a surcharge, you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

just can't call it a discount.  And the enforcement --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't see that in the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  My statute that I'm reading says you can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charge a surcharge. 

   

            

            

discount. 

            

MR. GUPTA:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But you can charge a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Now, I know, Paul MacAvoy, I hate to bring 

   

   

 

 

 

 

up these long-gone names, but he was an economist with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whom I wrote a book.  And he would have said what you 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, that, well, a discount and a surcharge are the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

same thing economically. 

 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But we live in a world that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

not everybody is an economist, and many people think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's quite a different thing, and there are a lot of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

studies in this thing that the -- you know, that said it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was a different thing.  That's what they can't do. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  Certainly -- right.  Certainly 

  

  

 

 

 

consumers react to the way price information is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

communicated --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Not in the way -- you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the regular price.  If you go above the regular price, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a surcharge.  If you go below the regular price,

it's a discount. 

   

11 

            

MR. GUPTA:  But in this case, both sides 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree the way the regular price is -- is defined is in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relation to how you communicate that.  Look at page 28 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the red brief.  They define regular price based on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how it's communicated. 

 

 

              

I think both sides come to this case with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two propositions that they agree on.  We all agree that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the regulation of prices, the kind of price regulation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're talking about, Justice Breyer, is economic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct that doesn't implicate First Amendment concerns. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We also agree -- we also all agree and know from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Virginia Board that communicating price information to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consumers is protected by the First Amendment and is at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the heart of the commercial speech doctrine. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I go back to --

   

  

 

 

 

 

MR. GUPTA:  Plus --

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- Justice Kagan's 

  

 

 

 

hypothetical.  It doesn't address the situation where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

dual prices are posted, but it addresses a situation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

where there is a dual-price regime.  Some consumers are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

going to pay more; some consumers are going to pay less. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GUPTA:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And in her hypothetical, she 

  

 

 

 

 

 

says the sticker price is the higher price.  And then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

12 

when the cash purchaser comes to the cash register, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchaser gets a pleasant surprise.  No, you are going 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to be charged less. 

 

 

 

            

But I thought your argument was that this --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

if that is the correct interpretation of the statute, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and I don't really know what the statute means 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and we don't have a definitive interpretation.  But if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that is the correct interpretation of the statute, what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

New York State has done is to force the merchant to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say -- to post a particular sticker price -- namely, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

higher sticker price -- as opposed to the lower sticker 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price. 

            

So that is mandated speech.  Isn't that your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument? 

            

MR. GUPTA:  I think if New York -- it's not 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandated speech in the sense they haven't told us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precisely what to say. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, under that 

  

 

 

 

interpretation, if it's okay to post the higher price 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and nothing more, and if the higher price is the credit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

card price, they are -- they are forcing the merchant to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speak in a particular way. 

   

 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  I think what they are doing 

    

 

 

 

 

 

is -- they are -- they are forcing the merchant to speak 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a particular way in the sense that you have to

characterize the price difference a certain way in order 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to comply with the statute. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Gupta, this exchange --

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

I mean, I think that these are two very different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theories of what makes this a speech restriction.  And I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess the reason I asked my question was because Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alito's theory does not appear to be your theory, and I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to know which theory we're really talking about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

Justice Alito's theory is that when the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislation says you have to post the higher price, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that in itself is a restriction on speech.  And that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an interesting argument, and maybe he's right about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  I don't know. 

    

 

            

Now, your brief took a different position. 

   

 

 

 

 

Your brief essentially said the problem is that this --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this -- this legislation affects the way a cashier or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody in a store -- just affects -- it affects the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way they describe transactions generally, you know, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cashier is going to be worried that she can't say to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the customer, you charge more if you use a credit card. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I guess I wanted to know, which theory is your 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory? 

            

MR. GUPTA:  I think our theory is what you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

just described. 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The latter one. 

  

 

 

 

MR. GUPTA:  But I think Justice Alito is not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

wrong that if -- it would certainly implicate First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment concerns if the -- if the State were to say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here is how you have to display your prices.  But that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be -- it could be, theoretically, a disclosure 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

regime; right?  And that's what the solicitor general 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

has posited, a disclosure regime --

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counselor, can I --

   

  

 

 

I'm -- part of -- I'm a little bit like Justice Alito 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and less than Justice Kagan.  I'm not sure what you or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anybody is saying about this statute or what it means, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but not because it's necessarily vague.  I just don't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

see anything about speech in the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GUPTA:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The statute simply says, 

  

 

 

 

 

"No seller in any sales transaction may impose a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surcharge on a holder who elects to use a credit card in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lieu of payment by cash, check, or similar means."  To 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me, it's very simple:  One price for everything. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GUPTA:  Well, Justice Kagan --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You walk in and --

  

 

 

 

 

 

forget about -- I don't know where they get the discount 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from or that the statute permits that, because what it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says on its -- to me, on its plain terms is one price.

And you told Justice Breyer that that was okay. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

Certainly would be -- I'm hard-pressed to see if that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the interpretation given to what I view as the plain 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning of the statute, that that would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional. 

            

MR. GUPTA:  But this is not a statute that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

functions in a vacuum; right?  And in the other States 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that enacted statutes at the same time, some of them put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in their text a surcharge is okay; a surcharge is not 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  New York didn't. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  -- a discount is not okay. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

New York didn't, but it -- but everyone has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreed that it has been interpreted in parallel with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those statutes.  And --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, this is a really 

   

  

 

 

 

nice agreement, except the State below had two different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretations. 

            

MR. GUPTA:  But the -- but the State has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never wavered from its interpretation that framing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price difference as a -- as a discount is perfectly 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

permissible under this regime. 

 

 

 

            

And you don't have to take my word for it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and look only at the text of the statute.  You can look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the way it's been enforced.  So the statute was

enacted in the 1980s.  A few years thereafter, there was 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the first reported criminal prosecution under that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

statute. 

            

And in that case, a gas station owner had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the posted prices, cash and credit.  But the -- what --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what caused the criminal prosecution is that the cashier 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made the mistake of describing the price difference as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nickel more for using a credit card rather than a nickel 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

less for cash.  It was that speech and that speech only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that triggered the criminal prosecution.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor in that case and the judge all agreed that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the statute meant. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And you tell me that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's what the State is going to tell me, that if they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

post credit card price 2.10, cash price $2, that if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cash -- if the person comes to the cashier and gives 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them a credit card, the cashier is going to say, you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know you're paying a surcharge of 10 cents; you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

going -- you're going to be prosecuted for that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  Well, the State can try to run 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away from the enforcement history, but I think it would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be very difficult to run away from the most recent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement history.  The State went after 50 or so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merchants in 2008 and 2009.  There were sweeps.  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have, in the Joint Appendix, declarations from merchants

who were caught up in that sweep, lawyers, the trade 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

association head. 

 

17 

            

And what happened in all of those cases was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that somebody called up on the phone from the attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general's office pretending to be a customer, and they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, what are your prices?  And those merchants said, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, it costs, you know, say, $10 to buy the heating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

oil and then, you know, this many cents more to pay with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a credit card. 

 

 

            

And that was the only speech that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaged in.  They -- they disclosed their prices. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's nothing deceptive about that.  And they were --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they were -- they were targeted by the attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general's office.  And then they asked the attorney 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

general, how do we comply with this statute?  And you'll 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find that at Joint Appendix 107. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The attorney general's office didn't say, 

 

 

 

 

 

disclose the total credit card price.  They said, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to frame it as a discount.  You can charge more all 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you want. 

 

            

And I think that shows that this speech is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulating nothing --

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, does your --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  -- this statute is regulating 

  

 

 

 

 

 

nothing but speech. 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does your argument 

  

 

 

 

 

depend upon the fact that there is no difference from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the consumer's perspective if he sees this product is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

$100, come in and buy it, and then he gets to the cash 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

register and there's a surcharge, no, it's $103, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's $100, he goes to the cash register, pays cash, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they say, well, happy you, it's $97? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And is your argument that a consumer sees no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference in those two situations? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GUPTA:  No.  Our -- our --

the -- the State that that is -- could be to some extent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misleading as far as the consumer --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. GUPTA:  I think --

the only thing we are challenging is the application of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute to merchants who want to simultaneously 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prominently disclose both the cash price and the credit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

card price, but want to frame the credit card price as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surcharge.  Anything else is not within the scope of our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as-applied --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Under your -- under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

your argument -- I just want to understand.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

understand you say, well, that's -- it's not this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But under your argument, how would you analyze the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the hypothetical that I posed? 

   

 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  I think if the State wants to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a regime where they think it's a deceptive practice 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

because you aren't telling people the -- the higher 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price or the -- the price difference at the same time, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that people are hoodwinked or there's bait and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

switch, they are perfectly free to do that.  It's odd 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there's a criminal regime in this case, and false 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advertising law certainly makes it possible to do that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anyway.  But if the State wants to enforce this statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that way, we have no problem with that.  They can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue to do that. 

 

 

 

            

If you look at Joint Appendix 144, you'll 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see an example of a bait-and-switch scenario like that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

The odd thing there is that the State didn't invoke 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its Section 518, the no-surcharge statute.  They enacted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the false advertising statutes, which suggests that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute has something else in mind.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm going to say when I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

first read this statute without knowing anything about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the background with the Federal statute or reading the

briefs or the Second Circuit opinion, I interpreted it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

the way Justice Sotomayor did, that it mandates a single 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price.  Now, that may be a -- an uninformed 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation, but I feel somewhat uncomfortable about 

   

 

 

 

 

ruling on the constitutionality of this statute without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowing how the court of appeals, New York court of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals would interpret the statute. 

 

 

 

 

            

So why shouldn't we certify that question of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation to that court before we plunge into this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First Amendment issue? 

 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  Well, the State of New York 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't ask for certification below.  Believe it or not, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know more about the New York statute than you know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about any of these statutes.  And the other courts that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have confronted the Florida statute, the California 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, they had no problems striking them down without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an enforcement history.  They all have been understood 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to mean the same thing.  And -- and I think, you know, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what you said -- what this Court said in Sorrell is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs in a First Amendment challenge have a right 

   

   

 

 

 

 

to prompt adjudication despite ambiguities in State law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so this Court used to abstain in First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment challenges where there is some ambiguity in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State law.  I think the -- the modern trend in this 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's cases has been to take a crack at it.  And, you

know, you have the enforcement history.  You know what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute means on the ground.  If you had a content 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neutral statute and the State were enforcing it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistently in a content discriminatory way, you 

   

 

 

 

 

wouldn't say, well, we don't know what the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means, you can't challenge that. 

 

 

 

 

            

In effect, when you bring an as-applied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge, you're bringing a challenge not just some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

words in a statute book, but also to the way that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute is being enforced.  And the injunction in an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as-applied challenge would look the same whether you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceptualize that as a challenge to the statute as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

written or to the State's enforcement policy.  Either 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

way, we want an injunction that says --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, now, this is exactly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what's worrying me.  The State, you say, told some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merchants that they cannot say that they have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surcharge.  Is that what it is?  Is that the problem? 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GUPTA:  You can --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But they did say, you can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do exactly the same thing? 

 

 

 

 

            

charge --

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  Exactly.  They said you can 

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Did they say, do exactly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the same thing --

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. GUPTA:  Yes. 

  

 

22 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- or did they say you can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a discount? 

   

            

MR. GUPTA:  They said you can charge more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all you want. 

 

 

            

want. 

            

discount. 

            

discount? 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You can charge more all you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GUPTA:  You just have to call it a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Did they say call it a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GUPTA:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So what we are doing here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is we are taking all the principles which are important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a First Amendment case and we are going to apply them 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speedy determination not as applied, you know, across 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the board.  There are lots of protective things.  And we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are diving headlong into an area called price 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation. 

            

It is a form of price regulation, and price 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation goes on all over the place in regulatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agencies.  And so the word that I fear begins with an L 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and ends with an R; it's called Lockner.  And there we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go.

at price regulation that enforcers will sometimes say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the wrong thing.  Okay?  So that's a very general 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

question.  But if you want to know what's worrying me, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's it. 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  Justice Breyer, I understand the 

   

  

 

 

 

concern.  I think it's a serious concern, but it's not a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern at issue in this case.  And that's because this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not price regulation.  This is the regulation of how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prices are communicated.  And I think that the Joint --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the declaration in the Joint Appendix shows you that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

When the State says to someone, you can charge more all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you want, you just have to call it something different, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's not price regulation.  That's the regulation of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

how prices are communicated. 

 

 

 

            

And I think here's the test, Justice Breyer. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

If you want to figure out -- because we all agree that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Virginia Board is the law, right?  Communication of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

price information is protected by the First Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But we also all agree that price regulation is economic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct.  So you ask, can you come into compliance with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the law simply by changing what you say without changing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what you charge?  And that is the scenario here.  That's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly what the State told those merchants.  They said, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you don't have to change what you charge, charge the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same thing.  Change what you say.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Gupta, you're putting 

  

 

 

 

 

really a lot of emphasis on a few cases in which 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

prosecutors describe the law in a certain way.  But the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

law as written doesn't really do any of the things that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're saying.  I mean, Justice Alito is right.  The law 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

as written actually can be read -- and Justice Sotomayor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said this before -- as just requiring a single price. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now, that's something that none of the parties here say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but if you just look at the law, that's what the law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says. 

            

            

MR. GUPTA:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Let's take that out of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

picture.  Even then the law can say, the only thing that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are requiring is that you list the higher price. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's the only thing that we are requiring.  And then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can describe what you're doing any way you like. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You can use the word "surcharge."  You can use the word 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"more."  You can use the word "less."  You can use the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word "discount."  It doesn't matter.  So long as you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

list the higher price, you're in the clear.  And that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too, is very different from what you're saying, maybe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from what the prosecutor said.  But just the way you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read this law, it just doesn't give -- I mean, what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these prosecutors say don't match what the law says.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The law says, you know, this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

is all about listing, you know, conduct; what you can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charge. 

            

MR. GUPTA:  But the law also means what it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means on the ground.  And we have -- the State agrees we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a credible fear of prosecution if we -- if we say 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what we want to say.  So there's no dispute about that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Document 51 in the district court, they conceded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that if we say what we want to say, we could be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecuted tomorrow, that shows there's a case in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

controversy about whether we can be prosecuted for --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for truthful speech. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, New York is saying in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

its brief that that's not the case; that you can say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what you want to say; that you can call this a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surcharge; that you can communicate in the way you want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to communicate as long as your listed price is the -- is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the credit card price. 

 

 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  But that makes it impossible.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean, that makes it impossible to frame the price as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surcharge, because that -- that normalizes the credit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

card price.  It makes that the baseline price, and that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effectively defines away a surcharge.  And that's been 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the purpose of this --

law was unconstitutional as well. 

 

 

 

 

26 

            

MR. GUPTA:  I think the Federal law was 

    

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional, too.  We don't have to win that fight 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to win this case. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Were there any 

  

 

 

 

prosecutions under the Federal? 

 

 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  There were not.  And the reason 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

is that the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reserve Board and the consumer groups all opposed that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regime because they thought it hid the cost of credit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from consumers.  There was never any enforcement, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can look in the blue brief at pages 11 through 15. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We've tried to lay out how that regime worked, and I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think it is the way the Solicitor General has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

characterized it.  You cannot find any regulations from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the time that the Federal regime was in effect that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, all you have to do is list the highest, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit card price.  That would look like a disclosure 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

regime. 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  As far as discounts are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

concerned, is there some protection that the merchant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can offer a discount? 

   

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  That the merchant can offer a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

discount; in other words, can they do that under this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute?  Is that --

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  No. I thought that there 

   

  

 

 

 

27 

was some legislation that permitted --

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  There's Federal legislation that 

  

 

 

 

 

says that it is a violation of the statute to have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private ordering that forbids a discount and that's why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

what you had, Justice Ginsburg, were contract rules that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made it illegal for merchants to frame the price 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference as a surcharge.  Those contract rules were 

   

  

 

 

 

 

rescinded in 2013 in the face of antitrust scrutiny, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's what led to this litigation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

If there are no further questions --

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry.  You said 

  

  

 

 

 

something very interesting. 

 

 

            

            

MR. GUPTA:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You said if you take the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, if you understand the statute to just mean that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the listed price has to be the credit card price, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looks like a disclosure regime.  Could you explain that? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  Sure.  I think a disclosure 

    

   

  

 

regime would look very different.  It wouldn't be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hidden accidental disclosure regime.  It would tell you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly what it was requiring; right?  And you wouldn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have any confusion and then you would have to probably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analyze that under Zauderer, and you'd ask a few 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions:  Is it specifically priced -- precise that

merchants have some warning or guidance?  Is there some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence that it's furthering some anti-deception 

 

 

 

 

 

interest? 

            

We do math all the time.  We -- we know that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 

we can add the sale -- sales charge as a percentage of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the service charge on a restaurant menu.  Nobody thinks 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that that's a problem for consumers to do math.  So why 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this one place are they requiring the total price? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Could it be because they want to suppress the message 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that merchants want to get across?  Is it unjustified or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burdensome?  Is it impossible for merchants, if they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to frame only one price, to do it this way or is it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to dissuade them from getting their message 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

across --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

which I think centers around a merchant who, for 

   

   

 

 

 

 

example, wants to label a soda as costing $1.95 with a 5 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent credit card surcharge, and the question is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the State can require the merchant to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

specifically identify a price of $2.05 before charging a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

customer who wants to use a credit card that amount. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

A law like that is very similar to a law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that simply regulates pricing or requires a merchant to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

honor their offers to make or enter into a contract of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the sort that we normally wouldn't think is subject to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any First Amendment scrutiny.  We nevertheless think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that the requirement that everyone seems to agree is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed here is best viewed under this Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedence as a speech regulation because, in effect, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

it's prescribing how the merchant communicates an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise lawful pricing scheme. 

 

 

 

            

But to the extent that New York's law, like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal law, simply requires a disclosure in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

dollars-and-cents form of any higher credit card price 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in circumstances where the merchant has decided to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

display the lower cash price in dollars-and-cents form, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a perfectly valid consumer disclosure law under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

this Court's decision in Zauderer.  We --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Feigin, could you 

  

 

 

 

 

get more concrete for me?  Take the list of four ways

that they would like to advertise in the reply brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

            

Which ways do you think -- or would the New 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

York law potentially or actually make any of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct illegal? 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, I don't think I can 

   

   

  

 

 

 

answer that question as to the New York law.  I --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why? 

  

 

MR. FEIGIN:  Because I think we lack a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

definitive interpretation from the New York court of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals.  I think much of dispute between the parties, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the first 25 minutes of questioning revealed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involves what the New York law actually does under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular circumstances. 

 

              

I can answer that question on the assumption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the New York law tracks the former Federal law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which, the only thing the Federal law actually did once 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you trace through the definitional sections was to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require, as I said -- as I was saying earlier, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

disclosure in dollars-and-cents form of a higher credit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

card price when the merchant has decided to post a cash 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Fine.  So look at 

  

  

 

 

 

this -- if that's what this law means, which of these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

four ways of advertising would be permissible and which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be unpermissible?

MR. FEIGIN:  Option A, where it's a $10 cash 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

31 

price, $10.20 credit price, would be fine.  Option B, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where it's $10 cash price, 20 cents surcharge per item 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

added to credit card purchases, would not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permissible.  You'd have to actually disclose in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

dollars-and-cents form, it would be 10.20. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

say $10.20. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  10 -- you would have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  Correct.  And I'd like --

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that's regulating 

  

 

 

 

speech; it's not regulating price, because it's the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price whether -- I can do that math. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  The -- that is why we think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this is better viewed as a speech regulation under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court's precedence. 

 

 

            

But let me explain why I think it's a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable disclosure. 

 

            

right. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Finish this -- all 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  Option C, Your Honor, which is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

$10, 2 percent surcharge, would be the same as Option B, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you'd actually have to say $10.20.  And then Option D, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is $10.20, 20-cent discount for cash purchases, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fine because you're disclosing to the consumers the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

highest possible price that they would have to pay in

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and your 

  

 

 

 

 

understanding of why it is a speech regulation, it -- is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it affects the way you list prices; is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right? 

            

            

MR. FEIGIN:  That's right, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

So a law, for example, that simply required 

   

 

 

 

 

 

a merchant who made a particular representation that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

price of this item is $1.95 and required that merchant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to honor -- and that was all the merchant said, didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say anything about surcharges at all, and the law simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required the merchant to honor that price when the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consumer gets to the cash register, that's an economic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation.  That's just a regulation that is regulating 

   

  

 

 

 

 

pricing or contract offers, but the -- the law here, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think everyone agrees, does something a little bit more. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In Options B and C that I was just 

   

   

   

 

 

discussing with Justice Sotomayor, you can have a price 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

tag that does reveal a -- the existence of a surcharge 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

expressed as a mathematical formula and the law would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

say that's not good enough, you have to actually list it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a price. 

   

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- what is your position 

  

 

 

 

 

 

as to the constitutionality of prohibiting Options B and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

C in the pastrami sandwich example on --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, first of all, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I wouldn't characterize it as prohibiting Options B and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

C, but simply requiring an additional disclosure.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to finish off the math problem for the consumers and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell them that the credit card price is $10.20. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The reason that's permissible 

 

 

 

constitutionally under Zauderer is that -- I think it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

important to keep in mind the legislatures are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislating against a backdrop, whether there isn't 

   

 

 

 

 

necessarily any specific requirement at all to even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclose the existence of the surcharge.  And I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the two --

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's a very --

   

  

 

 

 

that's a very patronizing approach.  I mean, you're 

    

   

 

 

 

saying in B when it says it's $10 cash, it's 20 cents 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surcharge, that they've got to do the math and say, by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way, that's $10.20? 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  And let me explain why, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  I think there are two good reasons why that has 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be done.

cents, but I'll think about that while --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  I think there are two reasons 

    

 

 

 

 

 

why it's reasonable for a legislature to decide that if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's requiring --

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yeah, right. 

  

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  -- a disclosure of the facts 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that the credit card price is going to be higher, it can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require that disclosure to be made in dollars-and-cents 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

form rather than a mathematical formula. 

   

 

 

 

            

First, the price --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, no, I thought 

   

  

 

 

 

you were telling me that they -- that it's not enough. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Even if it's in cash, if they say that's a 20 -- 20-cent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surcharge, that violates the statute. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, if all they said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was $10 price and 20-cent surcharge --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

  

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  -- and they don't say $10.20 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit card price, that, as we understand it, would be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of the Federal statute. 

 

 

 

 

            

But let me please explain why. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now, if -- if that --

York statute, in your view, is that a violation of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First Amendment? 

 

35 

            

reasons. 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  It is not, and I think for two 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Even though this is 

  

 

 

 

 

truthful information. 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  All that's required -- Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor, it's not prohibiting them from saying what's in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Options B and C.  It's requiring a further disclosure in 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

dollars-and-cents form.  I think there are two reasons 

    

 

 

 

 

 

why Congress or the New York legislature could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permissibly require the disclosure to be made in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollars-and-cents form. 

 

            

First, that's the most easily digestible 

 

 

 

 

 

form in which people receive prices.  It allows for easy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comparison of prices and doesn't require the consumer to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complete a math problem. 

   

 

            

            

Second, I think this directly --

   

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Hold on -- now, hold 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on.  You're saying that the -- the American people are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too dumb to understand that if you say $10 plus a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20-cent surcharge, they can't figure out that that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$10.20. 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  And the second reason, Your

MR. FEIGIN:  Which is that there is -- which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that there is an administrability concern here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There's an --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  An administrability concern. 

  

 

 

 

Once you start allowing mathematical 

 

 

 

 

formulas, you can get into a debate about when the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formula becomes too complicated for your average 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consumer.  You can imagine --

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's too much to say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

$10 plus 20 -- I -- I suppose it's a mathematical 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

formula, but it's for second graders. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, let me see if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I can -- first of all --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, isn't the idea, 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr. Feigin, that if you said 32.46 plus 2 percent, then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you really are requiring people to do some work and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you'd rather just have them know that it's -- see, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't do it that fast. 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, you might 

  

 

 

 

 

 

also -- you can see that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I agree that 

    

 

 

 

percent -- that -- that's Point C, that's not B.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree that a percentage is more complicated.

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, you --

  

 

 

 

37 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But 20 cents and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

$10, that's not too complicated unless you're taking a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very patronizing and condescending view of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capabilities of the American consumer. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  I think, Your Honor, under 

    

 

 

 

 

Zauderer, Congress -- or the New York legislature is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to draw clear lines.  I think it becomes more 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complicated if you show up at the store and you want to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

buy 17 things than if you're just buying the one thing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that increases the complexity of the math problem, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it would be much harder to write a law that allows 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain formulas, but not certain other formulas. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You could imagine a store that says, if you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

buy an -- here are our prices in cash.  If you buy an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

item in credit, we're going to charge you a surcharge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equal to the -- a percentage that is the fifth digit of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pi. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, yes.  I -- I'll 

    

  

 

 

 

 

give you that --

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  There's a subset of the 

   

  

 

 

 

population --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- that takes a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

little longer to figure out.  But you're saying that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violates the law if it says $10 plus 20 cents.

MR. FEIGIN:  I think, Your Honor, they're 

    

 

 

 

 

38 

entitled to have a bright-line rule.  You could have a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

price that's a little bit -- that creates a harder math 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem of the sort that Justice Kagan supposed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And again, you could also be buying many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

items at once.  You could have only a certain amount of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money that you want to spend and have trouble figuring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out what you're going to be able to fit under that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

budget --

 

            

sorry. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could I -- I feel it -- I'm 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  -- and it makes for comparison 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

pricing much easier. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I ask you a different 

   

   

  

 

 

question?  It -- it does -- this does not look like a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclosure requirement.  It just -- I mean, one way to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand this is exactly what you said.  It -- it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires disclosure.  Whether everybody needs that 

  

 

 

 

 

disclosure, whether only a few people need that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

disclosure in the $10.20 case, but it requires 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclosure to make sure that everybody is on the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page in terms of knowing prices. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But if you look at the language of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, it just doesn't look like that.  And -- and if

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure. 

  

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  -- Mr. Chief Justice? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Your Honor, I think the best thing for the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court to do here is, the Federal law was clear.  I think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can use the Federal law as kind of a baseline for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussing the issue, remand to the Second Circuit and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow for the New York court of appeals to have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definitive interpretation of the law, because there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly some dispute about what the New York law does.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN C. WU 

 

 

 

 

 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WU:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The plain text of New York's statute refers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only to a pricing practice and not to any speech.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute prohibits a seller from imposing a surcharge on 

   

   

 

 

 

 

a customer who elects to use a credit card.

nearly all sellers do, the application of the statute is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

straightforward.  The seller may not add to its listed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prices and instead must adhere to those prices if a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

customer decides to pay by using a credit card. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I just ask you a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

preliminary question about the division of litigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority in New York State?  Does the attorney general 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or the solicitor general have the authority under New 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

York law to bind all of the district attorneys in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State to an interpretation of this statute?  And has the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney general issued a -- an official interpretation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

so that all of the district attorneys will be required 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to enforce this in the same way? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WU:  So the attorney general and the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

district attorneys are separate authorities under New 

 

 

 

 

 

 

York law.  In this case, however, the relevant district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorneys for the counties where these Petitioners are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

located are parties to this case --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.  But, see, that's a --

   

  

  

 

 

 

MR. WU:  -- and have expressed their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

endorsement. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  That's a problem for me. 

   

  

 

 

 

How many district attorneys are there in New York State? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

many.

JUSTICE ALITO:  There are many. 

  

 

 

 

41 

So you tell us how you interpret this, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how do we know how all of these other district attorneys 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are going to interpret the statute?  They may interpret 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it differently. 

 

            

MR. WU:  Well, I don't think fundamentally 

   

  

 

 

 

there should be a debate about the -- the statute here. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And -- and it's because a plain reading of the text here 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means reading what it means to impose a surcharge. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, you know, there does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

seem to have been a debate about what this statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means.  Because I look at some of this enforcement 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

history and I think -- I don't really understand why 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

this violates that law.  And, in fact, you've walked 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away from some of that enforcement history in your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefing and said, look, the cashier can call it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever she wants to call it as long as the listed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price is the credit card price.  But that is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contradicting some of this enforcement history where a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different understanding of this law was used. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

So how do we deal with that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. WU:  Justice Kagan, I disagree that we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

are walking away from the enforcement history here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

See, I think if you actually look at what the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement history looks like, especially from the

attorney general's office, that it confirms sort of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

plain reading of this statute in a single-price scheme. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the heating oil company example, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, is the clearest one.  In each of those cases, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when the investigator from our office called up and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked, what is your price, they were given a single 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollars-and-cents answer.  And on page 106 of the Joint 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix they asked Parkside Oil, how much is a gallon 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of oil?  And they said, $3.45. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

And it was only when the investigator said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'd like to pay by a credit card, that at that point the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

oil company representative said, I'm going to impose a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surcharge of an extra 5 cents per gallon set on top of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the previous price. 

 

 

            

And I think that pricing practice reflects 

   

 

 

 

 

the commonsense understanding of the word "surcharge," 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is an additional fee or charge on top of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

baseline that the seller itself has -- has established. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But under your view, if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the heating oil people had said, it's $103 if you pay by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit card; if you do not pay by credit card, pay by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cash, it's $100, that is lawful? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WU:  That's -- that's correct.  I mean, 

    

  

 

 

 

 

if the heating oil representative --

the pricing structure is communicated --

 

 

 

 

 

43 

            

            

            

MR. WU:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- in the speech. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. WU:  Well, I mean, let me respond in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

this way, which is, of course the definition or the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination of whether there's a surcharge will look 

   

 

 

 

 

 

back to the seller's original pricing practices, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the meaning of a surcharge, is a difference from 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

some previously conveyed price. 

 

 

 

            

But the First Amendment doesn't prohibit the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State from using a previously conveyed price as a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

baseline for a price regulation.  As -- as the United 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

States has acknowledged, a regulation that just said you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall adhere to your previously conveyed prices or even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

previously advertised prices is a perfectly 

   

 

 

 

understandable economic regulation that would be 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But suppose -- suppose 

  

 

 

 

 

in -- in the heating oil example they said, it's $103, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but cash is $100, and that's because we impose a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surcharge.  Would that be lawful? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. WU:  That -- that would be fine.  I take 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that to be similar to Justice Kagan's example about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$1 charge for a cup of coffee with -- with a -- with a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

description of it as a surcharge.  And the statute does

not prohibit that scheme because, at the end of the day, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the listed price, which is in that case conveyed over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the phone, is the same as the price charged to a credit

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is your answer to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reply brief examples the same as the solicitor general's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

office?  And do you have a concern the way it does that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute could be read more broadly? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WU:  So we -- our answers are the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as to the four examples there, and we do not think it is

York intended to carry out the same policies and same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose as the Federal statute that had just lapsed, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same history is present in all of the other States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that have adopted a similar surcharge issue. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Then why didn't New York --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I mean, New York adopted this against the backdrop of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot of consideration at the Federal level.  Why did it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not adopt the Federal definitions? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WU:  I can't answer that question 

    

 

 

 

 

because nothing in the legislative history explains why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they did not. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What did the other --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WU:  But --

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- the other States that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

45 

picked up after the Feds didn't renew the statute, what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did the other States do? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. WU:  At --

  

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did they do what New York 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

did or did they copy the Federal statute? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WU:  Well, the vast majority of them did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not adopt the Federal definition.  As far as I'm aware, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only Massachusetts adopted the Federal definitions.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there are some exceptions where some of the statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually have a separate definition of a surcharge, 

   

   

 

 

 

which is just the plain meaning definition that we have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted here, which is in addition to a previously 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclosed or regular price.  And so all of these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes are really -- should be, we think, read 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

similarly here. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if I had the authority 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to interpret the New York statute, which I really don't, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I saw that they copied part of a prior statute, but 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they deliberately omitted other parts of the prior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, I would be tempted to infer that they had a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason for omitting the definitions.  And that was that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they didn't want to be bound by that, so they wanted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something different. 

 

            

MR. GUPTA:  I don't think there's anything

in the history that would support that interpretation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46 

Justice Alito.  And I would just say part of the reason 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they may not have felt it necessary was because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just as the Federal statute originally did not have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these definitions for a period of many years, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature may have believed that the ordinary meaning 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a surcharge is obvious enough that they didn't need 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the clarifying definitions of the -- of the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute. 

            

finished? 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Go ahead.  Are you 

  

  

 

 

 

MR. WU:  Yes, sir. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Help me.  I may 

    

  

  

 

 

 

be the only one that needs this help, but I do have this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lockner problem. 

 

            

One, if this -- if I were a legislature --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

legislator, I would have voted against this statute.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

think it does hide the cost.  That has nothing to do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with this. 

 

            

Two, I think that the reason we're having so 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

much trouble is because it's so difficult, but not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impossible, to distinguish between surcharge and 

 

 

 

 

 

discount.  And if you want to distinguish -- and they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are different -- words are very helpful.  They're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidentiary.  But what we're after is not the words. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

They're evidentiary of something.  But that's all almost 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have. 

 

            

Three, the fact that you have the questions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

you've had and both sides of the bench have had such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trouble with this, to me, is strong evidence that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court should stay out of this under normal First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment standards.  Because if we don't, we are going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to discover all kinds of price regulation all over the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place that suffers to greater or lesser degrees from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this kind of problem, and you'll have judges all over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the country substituting for regulators and others in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to regulate.  That's where I'm coming from. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

Now, you tell me how to do it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. WU:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That is, you tell me, given 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent, et cetera, what should we overrule?  Or what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should we narrow?  If, as I believe is true, these 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulatory areas are areas that not normal First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment, "tough, you can't do it" principles apply --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weakened forms might because it applies everywhere in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense.  But it used to be rational basis.  It used to be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rational basis.  But water has flowed over that dam or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under that bridge or whatever, and so I want to know 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your best thinking on what you would do in terms of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to write a rule of law that would favor you.

MR. WU:  I'm going to give two responses to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

that.  I mean, the first goes back to the text of the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute and recognizes that this statute is not phrased 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in any way that touches on what we would ordinarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think of as a speech.  In contrast to, for example, the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute in the Milavetz case, which talked about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulating the advice that a -- that relief agency would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give to a potential client. 

   

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We're talking --

  

 

 

 

MR. WU:  This talks about the imposition of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a surcharge. 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I can't look at this 

    

 

 

 

 

statute and rely on its words or make a judgment on its 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words because nothing of what you're saying it applies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to is said on the face of this statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. WU:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're asking me to take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a lot of steps, which is start with the language of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, ignore it, and go to a Federal statute and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply its definitions.  How many of them, you haven't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite told me.  How you differ, you haven't quite told 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me.  And -- but I'm going to assume the Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definitions apply, even though none of them are used 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

So I'm -- I'm very confused why you're

starting your answer to Justice Breyer by saying, look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the statute and see what the words of the statute are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing. 

            

MR. WU:  Well, if I could get to that in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just one second and finish the answer to Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer's, because I think given the way the statute is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phrased, the easiest way to dispose of this case is to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize this as a direct price regulation that this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court in 44 Liquormart and other cases have held is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to First Amendment scrutiny. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it doesn't set a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

standing price.  It doesn't set any price at all.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lets the merchant set the price.  And the question is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how that price is described.  So I think it's quite 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different from OPA ceiling prices, which says you cannot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charge more than the ceiling price.  Here, the sky is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the limit as to what the -- the merchants can charge. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

New York is not regulating what the price of the goods 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are. 

            

MR. WU:  But the way to understand the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute -- and I think this answers Justice Sotomayor's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

question as well -- is that once the seller has chosen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that price, which I agree they have a free choice about, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

then its ability to change that price for someone who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uses a credit card is constrained.  And I think this is

easiest to understand in the scope of a single 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

50 

transaction.  You walk into a store, they give you a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

menu with a list of pries for their food.  Those prices 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are in large part unadorned by any conditions about when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those prices apply.  And you know, in the course of that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transaction, between when you sit down and when you pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the bill that those prices will be the prices charged to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you even if at the end of the transaction you take a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit card and pay for it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, I don't, because I 

   

  

 

 

 

know I have to pay sales tax. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

tax. 

            

MR. WU:  Well, you might have to pay sales 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And every -- and every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

State I have to figure out what that sales tax is and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I've got to do the math in my own head. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WU:  That's -- that's correct.  And --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

and there are a lot of price adjustments that sellers 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could impose.  You could have coupons, member discounts, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

et cetera.  But I think those actually support our point 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, because what do those price adjustments apply to? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And at the end of the day, New York's position under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary definition of a surcharge, is all of those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjustments apply to the regular or starting price --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price of a good or product. 

   

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

51 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, here's the narrow 

    

 

 

 

 

way in which this seems to affect communication, speech. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm a seller.  I set my prices.  I say I want to charge 

    

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

cash customers a dollar and I want to charge credit card 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

customers $1.05.  All right?  Now, if I put my list 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

price as $1.05 and then the cash customers get a happy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surprise, that seems fine.  But if I put my list price 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a dollar and then the credit card companies get a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not-so-happy surprise, that can't be done.  So it does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affect the way a seller communicates which price he's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to say is the regular price, is the list price. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So why isn't that a speech regulation?  Now, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you might say, as the solicitor general does, it is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speech regulation, but it's only a disclosure regulation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and subject to a lower standard.  But you're saying it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not a speech regulation at all.  And I want to know why, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

given that it is affecting which price you choose to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is your list price. 

 

 

 

            

MR. WU:  So even if it does affect what a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seller does in that case, it's only because the list 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price is being used as evidence to support whether an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposition -- whether a surcharge has been imposed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

later.  And it's perfectly permissible under the First 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment for conduct to be defined in relation to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

previous acts of speech.  You know, conduct can be

initiated evidence or carried out through speech and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52 

First Amendment doesn't bar a State from regulating it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in that way. 

 

 

            

And I'll just use a couple of examples that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think make this clear.  Under a statute that says the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seller shall adhere to a previously advertised price, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that regulation, which the United States says is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

economic regulation, would be susceptible to the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis.  If somebody wants to charge $100, they know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that what they have to do is list $100 in their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advertisements or in their stores.  They can't list $98 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or $95 or $90. 

 

 

 

            

And a similar example comes from this 

   

 

 

 

 

Court's decision in Rumsfeld v. Fare, which recognized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that part of determining whether law schools had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

improperly excluded military recruiters from campus 

 

 

 

 

 

might be looking at the contents of emails or notices or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other evidence of the underlying conduct of exclusion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And that's the only way that a seller's prices are being 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used here.  It's being used as the benchmark to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine whether the seller has engaged in the unlawful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct of increasing a previously disclosed price. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Now, why this is clear under the statute, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting back to Justice Sotomayor's question, is in part 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because of the posture of this case.  We have a set of

at the conduct that they want to engage in here, there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is no ambiguity about what they think is the baseline or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regular price.  All of them want to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But suppose that a 

  

 

 

 

 

business makes a point of its reputation is -- is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meeting all prices.  We meet prices.  And there is a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business that's very close to another State and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other State allows cash, has -- has an option where all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surcharges are permitted and surcharges are -- are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclosed.  Then the State -- the seller in this State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, you know, we will charge the lowest price, we will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meet the price, but we add 3 cents for credit cards. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And because that's difficult to enforce, all of our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prices are increased by 3 percent for everybody because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the difficulty of applying surcharges in some cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Is that valid? 

 

 

            

MR. WU:  I think it probably would be deemed 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be a credit card surcharge in that case.  Obviously, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

no court has addressed that specific question.  It's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented by any of the Petitioners here.  And I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean to be evasive about it.  I think that's an 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important point because in an as-applied challenge, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant question is whether the statute can be applied

to what the Petitioners want to do.  And none of them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54 

want to engage in these complicated pricing schemes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All of them say --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The question of Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Breyer says that -- that this is so complicated, doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that indicate the statute is vague? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WU:  It -- it does not, because under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the vagueness doctrine under the Due Process Clause, as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long as there are a core set of cases that people can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand, that's enough to sustain it.  And especially 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it is clear how it would apply in the -- in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context of the plaintiffs' own allegations. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And here again -- and this is clearest from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 101 and 102 of the Joint Appendix.  What the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners here want to do and what they will do the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moment the statute is invalidated is to list a single 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set of prices, a single set of prices for each of their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goods and services and then collect an additional man on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

top for -- for a surcharge. 

   

 

 

 

            

Now, it might be the case that other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners or other plaintiffs would engage in more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complicated pricing schemes.  But the proper way to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolve those questions is in future as-applied cases if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and when they arise.  And -- and one of the things that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we can say from the enforcement history is it's deeply

unclear whether those cases will arrive.  Sellers first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to engage in those pricing schemes --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So they hold this in an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

as-applied a challenge -- I hope your adversary will 

   

   

 

 

 

 

confirm this -- that they want to do these four things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's in the reply brief, one or the other.  If we say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these are okay, whatever else the law means we're not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reaching because this is an as-applied challenge.  If --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we say they're okay or the New York State court of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals say it's okay, it's okay; right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. WU:  Yes. I think that's --

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you're saying more 

  

 

 

 

 

than this.  You're saying this is how they advertise it, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but that there's a further disclosure law that when a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

customer calls up the gas station, the gas station can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do any one of these four things and potentially other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things, too; right? 

 

 

            

MR. WU:  I don't think that's our argument. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

And I should clarify I do think some of these schemes 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

are not okay in the sense that you couldn't impose a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit card surcharge under some of these boxes.  But if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm understanding your question correctly, we are not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm saying if we say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's okay.  I know you're not claiming it is.

MR. WU:  But -- but one point I want to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

56 

respond to is the idea that what somebody says over the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phone here can affect the underlying price structure.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, we treat the phone calls, including the phone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calls in the enforcement history here, as just evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of what the underlying prices are in the same way that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

printed placard itself, although an active 

 

 

 

 

 

communication, would itself be evidence of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying prices.  And there's no dispute here that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

when the heating oil representatives were describing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their company's prices, they were describing a price 

   

 

 

 

 

 

scheme that they had settled upon --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Does this apply --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Does this apply to all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

merchants?  Anybody who sells anything? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. WU:  It -- it does.  There are limited 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception for government entities who are not deemed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be sellers. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, suppose some kids 

    

 

 

 

 

have a lemonade stand or they're washing cars and they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say a glass of lemonade, $1 and then somebody comes up 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to them and says I'd like to buy that with a credit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

card.  It might happen today.  I have -- I have never 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

seen anybody younger than me buy anything with cash.

But that would be a violation if they put the $1 there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57 

on the assumption that everybody is going to pay cash 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for their lemonade.  These are tech savvy kids so they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can -- could process a credit card purchase if they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted to? 

 

            

MR. WU:  The statue has no exemption for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

kids selling lemonade. 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. WU:  I think -- I think prosecutorial 

    

   

 

 

 

discretion would almost certainly be exercised in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- in that situation. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You can think of examples 

  

 

 

 

 

 

which I can't.  In areas like energy, people who make 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

their own energy who use time-of-day metering, there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be lots of regulatory rules that affect how an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

energy company presents the pricing of this element or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that element included.  Now, if I think that in all 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

these areas the correct First Amendment standard is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rational basis, nothing stronger, how then do I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguish the cases which you've talked about how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- what you say in respect to price because after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all, even if it's just evidentiary, this statute does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affect what people say as to price.  So if in fact I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need a legal distinction here to get at what I think the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First Amendment is driving at, what's your best effort?

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. WU:  Well, they affect only what you say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58 

about price as an incident to preventing you from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaging a certain pricing practice in the first 

   

 

 

 

 

 

instance, and I think this is the distinction this Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has drawn in cases like Virginia State Board of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pharmacy.  I mean, that's a case about price 

    

   

 

 

 

advertisements, but the understanding there is that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advertisements are describing an underlying price that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be applied.  For instance, if a consumer walked 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

into a pharmacy and wanted to buy a prescription drug. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

And -- and this case is about that consumer transaction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The descriptions of the prices are 

 

 

 

 

 

incidental to the regulation of the underlying consumer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transaction and the price that the seller may impose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

And -- and I think the point about the other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations that may apply is also an important one in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- in a couple of respects.  I think the most 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

important point of these other regulations is that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demonstrate that there are multiple ways in which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature or Congress can address what happens to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

default or regular price, and they all operate in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tandem.  The legislature could, for instance, say, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't do a credit card surcharge as here.  They could 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

also say, you can increase your prices at a car rental

agency if you add an additional driver, or if you have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

car seat.  And all of these would operate on the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying price structure.  The starting point for all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of these, as we've argued in our brief, would be the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59 

seller's regular or baseline price. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

If we --

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If we -- if we agree with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government that this is because it affects how the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merchant characterizes his price, would you also take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the position that the government takes that it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justified as a disclosure law? 

   

 

 

            

MR. WU:  We -- we think that it can be, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and -- and in part that's because we agree with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government, with the Federal Government, about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compliance options under this statute. 

 

 

 

 

            

It is true under both the New York law and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal law that the way a seller complies with the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute is to display a dollars-and-cents price that it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

later charges the credit card customers. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you explain to me how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a disclosure requirement to suppress the actual 

   

 

 

 

 

 

cost of the credit card purchase? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WU:  Well, it's not suppressing the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

actual cost of the credit card purchase.  It's only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preventing -- well, I'll -- I'll say two things.

60 

            

At most it is preventing one way of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conveying a credit card price, but the better way to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at it, as the government explains, is that it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just requiring a different price -- the higher 

   

 

 

 

 

 

dollars-and-cents price for credit card customers to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

displayed. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Wu, you think, is this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not true, that the dual pricing scheme is legal; is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right? 

            

            

MR. WU:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That was something that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Second Circuit did not decide, said it was abstaining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on.  It seems to me that that's quite relevant to this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of whether this is a disclosure requirement. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Because if the dual pricing scheme is not legal, it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really hard to characterize this as a disclosure 

   

 

 

 

 

 

requirement. 

            

            

Would you agree with that? 

 

 

 

 

MR. WU:  I think that it would be.  But --

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but I think it's important to recognize also why the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Second Circuit abstained on this question.  It didn't so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it rejected our interpretation of the law which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would allow dual pricing.  It did so because it found 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the statute was readily susceptible to an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation that would allow dual pricing because of

the clear indications that New York intended to follow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61 

the Federal statute, and so it wouldn't adopt an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation that would raise constitutional problems. 

 

 

 

 

 

And although -- although we think this Court could adopt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our interpretation of the -- of the State law, it would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also be fair to recognize that there is no reason to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deviate from the Federal statute on this front. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But -- but I also want to respond to one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other point that Justice Ginsburg had raised, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether this suppresses information about credit card 

 

 

 

 

 

 

costs, and -- and it does not in this important sense: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nothing about the statute prevents a seller from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

educating consumers about credit card costs, informing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them about it, talking about it.  Many of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners here do do so.  Brooklyn Pharmacy, for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance, has told its customers not to use credit cards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because of the additional costs that they impose, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they remain free to do so under this statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And in an important sense, that speech is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually a better and more direct way of advocating 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about credit card costs than the mere imposition of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surcharge.

difficulty with that as a message about credit card 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

62 

costs is, one, it doesn't explain why the surcharge is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being imposed; two, it doesn't say that it's being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed because of a specific thing, there's a merchant 

   

   

 

 

 

 

interchange fee that credit card issuers charge; and, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three, it says nothing about the amount of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interchange fee.  A flat 3 percent fee actually that 

    

   

 

 

 

 

bears no relationship whatsoever to the actual costs, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which range from 1.1 to 2.7 percent, that sellers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually infer when they pay. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There is nothing about 

  

 

 

 

 

the scheme that addresses that.  The scheme has no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclosure requirement of what was your actual credit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

card charge versus what you're charging.  The scheme 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

does nothing to help that situation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

question. 

            

            

MR. WU:  If I could answer just this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure. 

  

 

 

MR. WU:  That's correct, but I think this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

supports our point.  The scheme does not affect anything 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that sellers may say about their credit card costs.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very narrow thing that it does is to put an imposition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a surcharge in the consumer transaction, and that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's the classic economic conduct regulation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.

Mr. Gupta, a minute. 

   

 

63 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GUPTA:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

The solicitor general agrees with us that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is a restriction of speech, but posits that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only thing that's left on the table is a disclosure 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rationale that New York abandoned in the courts below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and is barely pressing here, and the problem with that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that this is a criminal speech restriction.  And so 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if your merchant is faced with compliance, they've got 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to know, if -- if you think this is a disclosure regime, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what are we supposed to say?  And typically a disclosure 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

regime doesn't leave you in the dark about what you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to say.  The government tells you precisely what to say. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And Zauderer recognized this problem.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

said that there are serious constitutional problems if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have a disclosure regime that does not tell the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merchant precisely what to say. 

 

 

 

 

            

Zauderer isn't a free pass.  The government 

   

  

 

 

 

has hypothesized a regime that could exist, but if it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did exist, it would still be subject to some First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment scrutiny.  And you would have to ask of that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regime the question that Chief Justice Roberts asked, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is, do we think people are too dumb to do math and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

64 

why in this one context do we think that?  Could it be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it had something to do with suppressing the cost of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit cards. 

 

            

Thank you.


 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.


  

 

 

 

 

The case is submitted.


 

 

 

(Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the
