MR. KNEEDLER:  Excuse me.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You don't mention Union 
7  Pacific in your brief.  How can you be calling what 
8  you're doing setting your jurisdictional limits?  Didn't 
9  we say, in Union Pacific, that agencies can't do that? 
10
11
12
13  be able to establish claim processing rules.  That, I 
14  think, is a totally different question.  But why do you 
15
16
 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I was responding to --
17  first of all, the -- the Secretary's regulations have, 
18  from the outset, referred to these limitations as 
19  limitations on the board's jurisdiction.  This is --
20
21  promulgated --

23  think the amici is right.  You can't -- if they're 
24  jurisdictional, we've clearly said that equitable

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  And we -- and we 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what is good cause, 

if not some form of equitable tolling? 

 For example, in -- in the several cases that 

this Court has considered finding provisions to be 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  There is nothing incompatible 

1
2  clearly believe that equitable tolling does not apply. 
3  That would be fundamentally inconsistent. 
4
5

7  between a good cause -- a limited good cause extension 
8  and a jurisdictional rule. 
9
10
11  jurisdictional, the time for taking an appeal and the 
12  time for petitioning for certiorari are both 
13  jurisdictional, but both allow extensions for good 
14  cause.  In fact, this Court's decision in Bowles 
15
16
17  and, again, this is just a narrow question of good 
18  cause.  It in no way suggests that equitable tolling 
19  would be -- would be permitted. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

The narrow question is whether the Secretary 
permissibly construed the statute to allow a comparable 
good cause exception, where -- where something akin to 
an act of God would prevent the provider from actually 
appealing within the requisite period of time, just like 
the district court can extend the appeal period. 

involved the extension for good cause. 

 So the question here for the Secretary --

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I mean, there are a 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The -- the Court's 
1
2  decision in Henderson against Shinseki, that also 
3  involved an intra-agency appeal, and yet, we said that 
4  equitable tolling was permissible. 
5
6  number of differences there.  I think, technically, it 
7  was not intra-agency.  It was an appeal from 
8  the Board of Veterans Appeals to the Court of Veterans 
9  Appeals, which is a separate body.  It is not something 
10
11
 The VA was not given rulemaking authority 
12  over that, unlike here, where the board is under the 
13  Secretary's jurisdiction, and, in fact, she has adopted 
14  regulations that have been in place for 40 years, which 
15
16  limitation as jurisdictional. 
17
18  statute is not one comparable to a statute regulating 
19  benefits for veterans, to which there has always been a 
20
21
22  think you could do the same thing in the veterans' 
23  benefits context?  Because in Henderson, of course, we 
24  dropped a footnote saying that we weren't deciding

whether equitable tolling was available.  All we were 

 Also, very much unlike Henderson, this 

solicitude by Congress and the courts --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Kneedler, do you

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I think, in Henderson, 

1  saying was that this was a claims processing rule and 
2  not a jurisdictional rule. 
 Could the Secretary of Veterans Affairs then 
3
4  go on and say, okay, it's a claims processing rule, but 
still, we get to decide how much equitable tolling we 
5
6  want, and we're going to adopt a regulation, much like 
7  the one in this case, saying you can't come in after 3 
8  years?  Could you do that in Henderson? 
9
there would have been the problem that the rule, as I 
10
11  understand it, was a rule to -- for appealing to the 
12  Court, which was outside the -- the Secretary's 
13  rulemaking authority; whereas, here, this is a body 
14  within HHS over which the Secretary has rulemaking 
15
16
17  clearly had -- and she has very broad legislative 
18  rulemaking authority under this statute -- has the 
19  authority to adopt strict limitations, as she has done

For -- for -- in the first place, most 

nature of these providers, as this Court noted in the 

1  the sort of open-ended equitable tolling that the court 
2  of appeals has imposed on this program for the first 
3  time in 40 years is fundamentally inconsistent with a 
4  need for repose, especially given the sophisticated 
5
6  Your Home nursing home case --
7
8  trying to ask, Mr. Kneedler, was do you think it's a 
9  general principle of administrative law that, when there 
is a claims processing rule that -- that relates only to 
10
11 
internal agency process, that the agency gets to decide 
12 
how much, if any, equitable tolling to allow? 
13
14  believe that.

agency time limits are established by the agency itself, 
pursuant to regulation.  So if there had been no 
statutory 180-day limitation period here and the 
Secretary had adopted a regulation imposing that, then 
whether -- and the extent to which that provision would 
be open to extensions for good cause, for some degree of 
equitable tolling, whatever the factors, would be up to 
the Secretary in construing her own regulation --

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, as you say, we do 

1  true.  But are they really in a position to double-check 
2  the calculation when -- if it were true -- and I know 
3  you don't agree with this -- if it were true that 
4  information needed to make the calculation was 
5
6
7  not -- we do not agree with that.  And the findings by 
8  the district court in this case, which was the same 
9  district judge who sat in the Baystate case, disagreed 
10
11
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I understand that. 
12  But if that were the case, would their sophistication 
13  allow them to double-check this?  Or is this just 
14  something that is dependent on data that they cannot

18  matching of data between CMS and the Social Security

7  situations in which the provider would not know that,

Otherwise, a provider could come in -- as this Court

believe that this is a jurisdictional limitation imposed 
by the -- by Congress, interpreted by the Court to allow 
this narrow exception.  So we do not believe that --

would you be authorized to treat -- not to -- not to 
permit the action? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  We -- we believe the 

1  the -- the question? 
2
3  believe that the Secretary, in the interest of -- of 
4  finality, can impose that sort of limitation.  There's a

17  the Court was dealing with the jurisdictional time limit 
18  for an appeal, but there was a comparable -- there is a 
19  comparable statutory provision for the Court to extend 
that period for good cause.  It remains jurisdictional. 
20
21  That was the point in Bowles.  It was -- there was a 
22  question of whether the --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, if there is another 
23
24  statutory provision, then that -- then that statutory

instance in which we have found something to be a 
jurisdictional limitation and allowed the person or 
agency, subject to that limitation, to extend it?  I --
I had always thought that once you say it's

 MR. KNEEDLER:  As I said, in -- in Bowles,

this --

1  That's fine. 
2
 But when you just have a jurisdictional 180 
3  days, without any statutory provision for extension, if 
4  it's jurisdictional, I thought that's the end of the 
5
6
7  question is -- some time limitations have been 
8  understood to contain explicit -- excuse me, explicit or 
9  implicit authorizations for the tribunal concerned.  And 
10
11
12  jurisdictional time limitations? 
13
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, you don't need that 
14  label, do you, Mr. Kneedler?  You could do just as well 
15
16  better, as Justice Scalia is suggesting, with a claims 
17  processing label, as long as, with that label, comes the 
18  general rule that the agency gets to determine the 
19  extent of discretion as to late filings. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  This is a 
mandatory -- this is a mandatory -- even if 
nonjurisdictional, it is a mandatory limitation.  And 
the question is whether the statute contains an implicit 
authorization, whether the Secretary could permissibly 
construe it to allow for this narrow good cause 

with a claims processing label.  Maybe you could do 

14

that it's jurisdictional, is that there is a long 


 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, that is --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They have said it. 

MR. KNEEDLER:  -- that is -- that is 

1  exception comparable to the one for extending the 
2  time --
3
4  that approach, of course -- and I assume why you assert

7  this as jurisdictional.

 Here, we have a statute governing procedures

20
21
22  that's why I wonder what the basic underlying principle 
23  is.  I mean, I would have thought -- but I'm not sure 
24  what you think, that -- that the way to look at these 
25

correct.  But we -- but I think it's also important to 
recognize that the -- that this statute was enacted, the

 This Court has put a thumb on the scale 

 Both set almost identical deadlines for

different kinds of deadlines, one for providers and one 
for beneficiaries. 

1
2  against jurisdiction because of the hard consequences 
3  that follow from deeming a procedure jurisdictional.  In 
4  this case, the agency's regulation, no matter how old it 
5
6  intention to treat this as jurisdictional in two ways: 
7  One, by putting it in the -- in the provision of the 
8  statute that defines the board's jurisdiction.  But, 
9  secondly, Congress, in this statute, created two 
10
11 
12
13  administrative appeals.  It's 6 months for 
14  beneficiaries, 180 days for providers.  But there is a 
fundamental difference in the way Congress treated these 
15
16  two sets of deadlines, and the fundamental difference is 
17  that Congress explicitly gave the Secretary authority --
18  discretion, to extend the deadline for beneficiaries. 
19  It gave no such discretion to extend the -- the deadline 
20
21
22  limits that govern judicial review.  Discretion --
23
24  more than 3 years extension, that was adopted after 
25

notice and comment, and Congress amended this statute 

for providers. 

 And the same story plays out in the 60-day

2  3-year outside limit intact.  So if Congress really 
3  wanted there to be no leeway at all, then it should have 
4  done something about that regulation. 
5
6  entirely right.  Congress has amended the statute, in 
7  fact, eight times since the Secretary promulgated her 
8  regulation establishing a good cause requirement.  But 
9  this Court has, in recent years, been more careful about 
10
11
12  Cook County, what this Court said is that before it will 
13  find that Congress has acquiesced, there must be 
14  evidence that Congress was aware of the regulation and a 
15
16  place this regulation. 
17
18  leaves regulations in place for all sorts of reasons 
19  because somebody is using a parliamentary tactic, 
because Congress doesn't have one opinion or the other 
20
21  about whether the -- the regulation is right, because 
22  Congress didn't think of the problem. 
23
24  upon a high degree of proof before it will find 
25

clear signal that Congress meant to embrace or put in 

acquiescence, and that degree is not present here. 

 So, in recent years, this Court has insisted

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, but you have three --
3
4  the point that you make is right, that -- that you have 
specific language in the beneficiary part and not here; 
5
6  but you have the other way, the point that Justice 
7  Ginsburg made, the fact that the language here is --

2  government promulgated its regulation in a 
3  Chevron-eligible format.  But Chevron only applies if 
4  the statute is not clear, and here, we say that Congress

8  are quite different.  One provides discretion, and one

 MR. MANNING:  You're exactly right, Justice 
18  Breyer.  But Congress, in Section 299O of the 1972 Act, 
19  that enacted -- that created the PRRB, amended and 
20
21  prescribed the -- the beneficiary review provisions.  It 
22  incorporated, by reference, provisions that gave the 
23  Secretary express discretion to extend those deadlines.

 And so, in the same statute, what Congress

did was it set up two systems, one for beneficiaries and

merit deference in this case because the statute is

worded very differently, to mean the same thing, to mean 
5
6  that the Secretary has discretion whether Congress gives 
7  it or doesn't. 
 And I submit that that's a good reason to

19  history here -- you can't ignore it -- is that, from its 
inception, whether it's trying to disclaim it now or 
20

 MR. MANNING:  Well, you're right, 

 In the -- in the 2008 regulations that 

Secretary, CMS, and the board -- have all described this 

acknowledged that there was a question about whether the 
good cause exception was consistent with the 
characterization of the time limitation as 
jurisdictional, acknowledged that there was a split of 
authority on that, and suggested that the courts would 
have to resolve it.  This is not --

1
2  Justice Sotomayor.  But my question -- the question that 
3  that raises is this:  From the very beginning, this 
4  agency has -- all three of the agencies -- the 
5
6  provision as jurisdictional and non-waivable.  At the 
7  same time, they have tried to create this exception.

19  processing rules.  I could go on and on about the 
20
21
22  made earlier, which is, assuming we were to treat this 
23  as a mandatory claim processing rule, where does that

Now, the agency says that means no equitable

tolling. 

 In Irwin, this Court included among the 

with what the plaintiff could have done or not done, but 

1  tolling.  Assuming I'm willing to accept that, is 

2  equitable tolling the same as fraudulent concealment, 

3  which has been treated in the law, not as a -- as a 

4  necessary part of equitable tolling, which has to do 

5
6  with what a defendant has done or not done? 
7
 MR. MANNING:  Justice Sotomayor, this Court 
8  has said that, if a time limitation is jurisdictional, 
9  that limitation is absolute.  That includes no equitable

complaint presented one aspect of this concealment, 
which was a misleading aspect of the agency's actions 
here, where the agency said that matching on the basis 
of Social Security numbers was the best way to deal with 
this -- this matching of the data that my colleague from 
the government was -- was discussing. 

1  in -- in that case, the district judge there didn't 
2  say -- he said they didn't use the best available data. 
3  He didn't find any deliberate concealment. 
4
 MR. ROTH:  That's correct, Your Honor, and 
because the -- that issue was not before the court and 
5
6  it was not necessary for the court to make that finding 
7  for purposes of addressing that case. 
 I'm at the Joint Appendix at 2829, which is

18  the basis of Social Security numbers.  And that made an 
19  enormous difference with respect to how that -- how the 
20

than 3-plus years is because the statute permits it.  42 
15
16  U.S. Code 1395gg, which is not cited in the government's

 MR. ROTH:  That is true, Your Honor, and 

1  to any brief?

4

6  when nobody cited it. 
7
8  that -- that is correct.  But in citing 405.1885 and the 
9  reason that we're bringing it up, Your Honor, for the 
10

12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
 It wasn't, Your Honor.  That's why we are 
19
raising it here, Your Honor, because, under the 1395gg 
20
21  provision, they can't go back, and that's why they have 
22  their reopening regulation and that reopening regulation 
23  is an order from Congress. 
24
25

first time on rebuttal is that in the -- in the 
government's reply brief, they went out of their way to 
try to characterize the reasonableness of the Secretary, 
you can trust the Secretary here because the Secretary 
has said, look, after 3 years, we consider there to be 
finality, and we don't go back after the -- after the --
after the providers -- you know, except for fraud or 
similar fault, as if this had been a gift, an 
interpretation from the Secretary. 

 And what we have here, Your Honor, is that 
you have this concept at least arising from Congress; 

37
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  when you look at the 1395gg, you look at the appeals 
2  statute in 1395oo, is that you have an expectation from 
3  Congress that the providers within their 180 days will 
4  be able to know exactly what happened and why they were 
underpaid.  And here, of course, that underpayment was 
5
6  concealed. 
7
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that reopening -- is 
8  that reopening provision, the mysterious gg, is -- is 
9  that subject to equitable tolling, too? 
MR. ROTH:  The -- well, the --
10
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if not, why not? 
11
12
 MR. ROTH:  Well, 1395gg simply says that 
13  a -- that a -- that a provider and a beneficiary will 
14  not be subject to overpayment recoveries, if they were 
15
16
 And what we -- and whether it would be 
17  susceptible for equitable tolling is not before the 
18  Court at this point, but that rule at least is applied 
19  equally on both sides. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24
25

provider was underpaid because of its own fault, this 
case isn't about any -- any relaxation of that rule. 
Providers are on the hook for that. 

In other words, if -- if the -- if a 

without fault. 

 On the other hand, where a provider is 

underpaid because of the secretive conduct, the 

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Roth, I'm not certain 
about the extent of your argument, so let me -- let me 
try something. 

1  undisclosed and undetectable conduct of the Secretary, 
2  that is the -- that's an area where we would find that 
3  the very concept of equitable tolling is inherent in 
4  1395oo. 
5
6  notice.  That is -- and, again, that goes against this 
7  concept that it is jurisdictional.  It's a claims 
8  processing statute.  And here, Your Honor, the notice 
9  was defective.  When they issued --
10
11 
12 
13
14  passes a statute saying -- you know, there is 30 days to 
15
16  context now, as to administrative process, that Congress 
17  necessarily means that equitable tolling applies and 
18  that the agency cannot limit that equitable tolling? 
 MR. ROTH:  Yes, Your Honor, that, if the 
19
issue is the -- is the agency's own misconduct, that 
20
21  Congress would -- to -- to read that Congress intended 
22  in a situation under the -- like this under the Medicare 
23  Act, where we're talking about a procedural right to 
24  that -- to enforce a substantive right. 
25

do this, there is 60 days to do this, in the agency 

 Now, are you saying that any time Congress 

Official 

Remember, the trigger point in 1395oo is 

In other words, we have here providers who 

39
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  have provided services.  And under their agreement with 
2  the Secretary, they provide services, and they get paid 
3  for those services. 
4
 If there were an attempt to limit that 
payment, to cut off that payment because of agency 
5
6  misconduct, because of the expiration of a -- of a 
7  statute of limitations, we don't believe Congress ever 
8  intended that its payments would be cut off because of 
9  agency misconduct that caused a provider to miss -- to 
miss a deadline that caused the expiration of a statute 
10
11  of limitations. 
12
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm not sure how we can 
13  limit this to agency misconduct.  Suppose there is a 
14  computer glitch in a program, completely good faith, and 
15
16  information, and nobody knows about it.  That's not 
17  misconduct. 
18
19
20
21
22  equitable tolling in that case? 
23
24  case -- that -- that is a mistake.  That's an error. 
25

 MR. ROTH:  That's not misconduct. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- but --
MR. ROTH:  We would agree, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you would say no 

the computer just spits out the -- the wrong 

 MR. ROTH:  Well, that's not -- that -- this 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, that would be good 

40
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. ROTH:  That has never been good cause 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I don't know -- I 

MR. ROTH:  What's that? 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You mean to say that if 

1  cause.  It seems to me that would be good cause under 
2  the -- under the Secretary's rules. 
3
4  under Secretary's ruling, but -- potentially.  But that 
is not what -- that would be the level -- that would not 
5
6  be misconduct.  That would not trigger equitable 
7  tolling, as opposed to the facts of this case. 
8
9  don't know why it wouldn't. 
10
11
12  that happened, under the Secretary's rule, the Secretary 
13  would abuse its discretion in extending the time for 3 
14  years? 
15
16 
17
18
19  appeal? 
20
21
22  the time, Your Honor.  They can simply provide by 
23  administrative payment to -- to fix the problem.  They 
24  don't have to circle it through -- through an appeals 
process, if the government found out.  And, in fact, 
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes. 
 MR. ROTH:  Well, they don't have to extend 

MR. ROTH:  For -- excuse me?  For 

recovering -- for the --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes. 
 MR. ROTH:  -- for a provider to make an

Alderson Reporting Company

that you're talking about --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you're arguing for --

 MR. ROTH:  Right. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It is limited to 


1  Your Honor, there is another regulation.  It's 

2  unfortunately --

3
4  hard -- hard to see why this is -- you're saying that 

the equitable tolling rule -- the agency does have the 

5
6  3-year rule. 

7
8
9  misconduct? 

10
11 
12
13  in a way, for a narrower rule than what the 
14  government --
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21
22  what the Baystate court said it is.  It isn't deliberate 
23  concealment, but it is failure to use the best available 
24  data. 
25

the facts that you're talking about are addressed 
explicitly in 42 CFR 405.980.  And what the government 
has said in that regulation is that, when there has been 
clerical error, claims can be reopened indefinitely. 
That's another indefinite time period. 

MR. ROTH:  Well, Your Honor, let me say that 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, suppose it's just

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I just find it 


And I take it the argument you just presented

are already addressed for the Secretary's 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So what -- what 

 MR. ROTH:  Well, equitable tolling is 

 MR. ROTH:  Well, in this case, Your Honor --

1  is equitable tolling is tied to misconduct.  So just 
2  failure to use the best available data, not deliberate 
3  concealment, wouldn't make it. 
4
well, simply, if it was knowing use of bad data, in 
5
6  other words, if the government, as in this case, was 
7  aware that there was better data to be had, that would 
8  rise to the level of the kind of conduct that could be 
9  subject to equitable tolling; whereas, simple mistakes 
10
11  regulations --
12
13  circumstances trigger equitable tolling, in your view? 
14
15
16  case, Your Honor, because --
17
18  fact-finding turns out that the -- that there is no 
19  deliberate concealment, but there is merely a failure to 
20
21
 MR. ROTH:  Well, if we don't -- if we don't 
22  have that extra level of -- of that -- of that level of 
23  concealment, Your Honor, I don't think that we would 
24  have the misconduct that this Court has cited in the --
in the Bowen case, and before that, in -- in Irwin and

6  tolling. 
7
 MR. ROTH:  We -- we -- well, we've made that 
8  allegation in our complaint, Your Honor.  And we believe 
9  that -- that assuming those allegations to be true for 
10
11
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but I'm asking you, 
12  if you get past that hurdle, then we never -- we won't 
13  know that there is equitable tolling until we have tried 
14  out the question of the character of --

16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21 
22 
23 
24
25

MR. ROTH:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  If we --
if we get past this -- this -- this -- and there would 
be a remand, it would -- the burden then would be on the 
hospitals at that time to, in fact, show that equitable 
tolling could apply. 

The issue in this Court is whether it should 

foreclose permanently the availability of equitable 
tolling, even in the face of allegations of agency 
misconduct -- excuse me --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I'm not sure I 

understand this, Mr. Roth.  Are you saying that, in all 

44
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

those cases have focused on what happened to the 
claimant, and the claimant missed a deadline.  Holland, 
it was a deadline that was missed.  There wasn't 
misconduct on the other side. 

1  of our cases about the presumption in favor of equitable 
2  tolling, when we talk about equitable tolling, we are 
3  only talking about misconduct or fraud cases -- you 
4  know, as opposed to the case where it's just a person 
cannot possibly know the -- the information that would 
5
6  back up a claim and that we regard that as a good 
7  excuse? 
 MR. ROTH:  No, Your Honor.  Whether it was 
8
9  Henderson or -- or other cases, those cases recognize --
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16 
17
18  most of your argument was built on the presumption in 
19  favor of equitable tolling that we've recognized in 
20
 MR. ROTH:  Correct. 
21
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- and whether it applied to 
22
23  the agency context.  But now, you're saying that in the 
24  agency context, it's -- it's a different kind of 
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right. 
MR. ROTH:  And those were subject to 

equitable tolling. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well because I thought that 

those cases --

equitable tolling that we are talking about, a more

 MR. ROTH:  Well, the -- what -- the 

goes farther.  This case even goes farther than Bowen v. 

you know, assuming they have some authority here to 
write a rule, you want to say a 3-year absolute rule is 
not reasonable in this situation.  So what is? 

1  limited kind? 
2
3  equitable tolling rule that the Court has found in those 
4  other cases would certainly come into play.  This case 
5
6  City of New York because it has affirmative misconduct 
7  by the Secretary. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So what about -- then let's 
8
9  get back to the question I really meant to ask before --
10
11 
12 
13
 MR. ROTH:  Well --
14
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, you want to go back 
to the Civil War?  I mean, let's imagine you really have 
15
16  the strongest possible case.  All the records burned up, 
17  and it took 5 years for scientists to reproduce the 
18  records by putting charred pieces of paper together. 
19  Okay?  So you couldn't possibly bring your claim until 
they finished.  That's a pretty equitable claim.  5 
20
21  years okay?  10?  What is the -- 100?  I mean, what? 
 MR. ROTH:  Well, Your Honor, in this 
22
23  instance, the -- the question of how to limit a 
24  circumstance where a provider is not getting paid --
gotten paid the amount promised by Congress, one way 
25

46
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 But recall here, Your Honor, that the 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But what I hear you saying 

1  to -- to limit that is by time. 
2
3  Secretary could eliminate this issue entirely by simply 
4  being more transparent.  This issue arises --
5
6  is go back to the Revolutionary War.  If it took 100 
7  years to put the papers together, you're saying no time 
8  limit at all is -- is the only reasonable solution 
9  because there are too many weird cases or unusual cases 
or misconduct cases.  You've got to have some exception 
10
11 
in there forever. 
12
13
14  your position, I just want to know. 
15
16 
17 
18 
19
20
21  the agency's own determination some weight? 
 MR. ROTH:  The agency's own determination? 
22
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  They'll come in and 
23
24  say, I don't care what the cause is, there isn't cause 
here because we weren't that awful.  And now, does the 
25

because, in order to -- to prevail in equitable tolling, 
we would have to show that the providers here were 
diligent, and that's a self-limiting factor. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  And by the way, do 
we -- are you supposed to, in such circumstances, give 

 MR. ROTH:  Well, if --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that right?  If that is 

MR. ROTH:  That is -- that is the position 

47
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. ROTH:  If the Secretary here decided to 

in, you can come in and look at our data, but after 3 
years, the time limit is over, I think that's a rule 
that could exist, Your Honor. 

1  judge give them some weight? 
2
3  attack head-on this concept of equitable tolling and 
4  deal with this question of finality straight up and 
say -- you know, here -- here is how we think that --
5
6  that finality should be -- should be handled, even in 
7  the -- even in the context of secretarial misconduct, 
8  by, for example, saying within the 3-year period any 
9  provider who feels that we've misrepresented data, come 
10
11 
12 
13
14  arbitrary and capricious review under Chevron? 
15
16 
17 
18
19  assuming that there might be equitable tolling, here, is 
it -- is it 10 years later?  And there was this Baystate 
20
21  case going on.  You -- you didn't file immediately after 
22  that litigation was instituted.  You waited until those 
23  plaintiffs won their case. 
24
25

 You waited till there was a decision of the 
lower court.  So it seems to me you -- you said there's 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, subject to 

MR. ROTH:  It -- subject, of course, to 

arbitrary and capricious review on that.  But the 
point --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why in your case, even 

48
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. ROTH:  Well, the complaint was filed, 

Your Honor, in Baystate after we brought our 

1  a requirement of diligence.  Why -- why didn't you have 
2  to file when you were first on notice, which you would 
3  have been from the complaint filed in the Baystate case? 
4
5
6  administrative appeal.  We brought our administrative 
7  appeal soon after the board -- the administrative board 
8  rendered its decision.  That was the first public 
9  pronouncement that there were flaws with the data. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17
 So, Your Honor, diligence, of course, will 
18  be an issue if we -- on remand if we get -- if we get 
19  that opportunity.  But this -- but the -- but the case 
here arose after the board issued its decision in the 
20
21  Baystate -- in the Baystate case. 
22
23  discussion earlier about whether the board has viewed 
24  its own jurisdiction as limited in some way.  And the --
the fact of the matter is that -- that the board here --
25

There were some providers who had an inkling 
that some days might have been missed here or there, but 
there was no sense in the provider community that that 
arose from a systematic effort by the government to 
miscount and then fail to disclose that it, in fact, 
miscounted and had misrepresented how it had counted the 
days. 

 And there was a -- and there was a 

49
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

And in that case, the -- the Secretary didn't leave it 
there. 

1  and I focus on the Bradford case in particular.  In the 
2  Bradford case, the board itself made a determination 
3  that equitable tolling should apply in another time 
4  limit within the -- within the Medicare Act. 
That case then goes up to appeal in the 
5
6  Western District of Pennsylvania, and the -- and the 
7  court says, you know what, we think equitable tolling 
8  should apply, reversing the Secretary, who had reversed 
9  the board's finding that equitable tolling should apply. 
10
11 
12
 They petitioned for -- for the court to 
13  revisit its determination, which the court did and 
14  affirmed its decision with respect to the application of 
15
16
17  didn't seek an appeal.  It allowed the case to go back 
18  to the board, and it -- and it -- and it allowed the 
19  case to go forward, with that deadline having been 
20
21  as somehow some kind of consistent view, it's not. 
22
23  determinations going back for those 37 years that the 
24  good cause regulation has been in place because it is 
that good cause regulation that -- that forced the --
25

equitable tolled.  So when the government portrays this 

equitable tolling. 

 At that point, the Secretary abandoned -- it 

 This board has engaged in equitable 

50
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  the board to have to deal with these equitable questions 
2  about whether -- whether or not the -- whether or not 
3  the -- the claim should be considered timely, even 
4  though the deadline had to be -- had to be extended. 
The -- the facts that we have here, Your 
5
6  Honor, is that this is really an unprecedented case. 
7  This is an unprecedented case in Medicare, that we have 
8  the agency that says it was doing one thing in a Federal 
9  Register document and actually did something different, 
that then spent years trying to avoid, as was laid out 
10
11 
in the Southwest Consulting amicus brief, avoid having 
those facts come to -- come to -- come to the attention 
12 
13 
of the providers. 
14
15
16  level, because there are -- there will always be, in 
17  Medicare, a lead case.  This is what we saw in the Cape 
18  Cod case.  There, you had a case that resulted in what 
19  looked to be billions of dollars of payments to every 
single hospital in the country as a result of one 
20
21  district court decision and one court of appeals 
22  decision. 
23
24  misconduct of the Secretary in this kind of case will 
not -- will not -- will not flood the judiciary or the 
25

from this, either at the board or at the Federal court 

 There will not be floodgates that result

8  involving 4,000 cost years and 450 hospitals, those 
9  probably mostly, if not entirely, or for the most part 
relate to -- to this case.  And depending on how this 
10
11 
case unfolds, those cases will all presumably fall into

so they can look at the underlying access to the data

preventing them from being able to get access.

the cost years have to be closed. 

1  by this Court in the Your Home case.  There, the Court 
2  made clear that it was a matter of grace, not statutory 
3  compulsion, that the Secretary allowed for any reopening 
4  at all of past cost reports. 
This sort of claim of new evidence, for 
5
6  whatever reason it wasn't available, could be raised 
7  under that.  But this Court held in -- in Your Home, 
8  that a denial of a reopening was not even appealable to 
9  the board at all or subject to judicial review for 
10
11 
12
 And the Court specifically pointed out that 
13  to allow administrative and judicial review of a denial 
14  of reopening would circumvent the very 180-day 
15
16
17  up with another way of circumventing that 180-day 
18  limitation by superimposing, for the first time in 40 
19  years, an open-ended equitable tolling regime in this 
20
21  recalculate payment years back to 1987.  The only reason 
22  it goes back no further is that's when the DSH payments

situation.  The Respondents here are seeking to 

 DSH payments, by the way, go to 80 percent 

of hospitals.  It's not some limited category.  And what 

limitation that we have at issue here. 

 What Respondents are trying to do is to come

complaint, I'm not in a position to spend time refuting 
5
6  them here.  We have a footnote in our reply brief that 
7  refers to the government's summary judgment motion in 
8  which the allegations of misconduct are -- are

19  regulation that provides for coming in within 3 years to

21  valid.  That's what this regulation does.  And we think 
22  there is no plausible argument at this late date in the 
23  Medicare program to suggest that a 3-year limitation 
24  on -- on revisiting of closed cost reports is arbitrary 
25

I would like to say that -- that whatever 
label one attaches, jurisdiction, claims processing, 
mandating, it's absolutely clear that, from the outset 
of this program, the Secretary understood and 
implemented the 180-day time limit as limiting the 
board's authority.  It says an appeal shall be dismissed 
if it's not filed within 180 days.  No extension shall 
be granted if requested after -- after 3 years. 

and capricious under -- under this Court's decisions. 

 That 3 years -- Respondent has conceded a 

address matters of fraud or anything else would be 

55

 And if we're wrong, as I said, about the 


 Just one side comment on this Bradford 

appeal -- if the Secretary has no authority to do even 

1
2  validity of the Secretary's narrow good cause 

3  regulation, which simply parallels what's in 

4  jurisdictional provisions -- for example, notices of 

5
6  that, then the result is the same, there is no broad 
7  equitable tolling. 
8
9  opinion, that did not involve the 180-day limitation. 
That involved a regulatory provision.  The Secretary's 
10
11 
consistent position has been, as we cite in the brief, 
that the 180-day limitation is not subject to any 
12 
13 
equitable extensions at all because the board is not an 
equitable body.  And the Medicare program, like the tax 
14 
program in Brockamp, is not one in which equities are 
15
16 
taken into account.  You need absolute rules. 
17
18  to make, but they can -- they can lead to widespread 
19  delayed litigation, as the Baystate litigation shows, 
requiring calling of witnesses -- in this case, 20 years 
20
21  ago -- what happened 15 or 20 years ago.  You would have 
22  a hospital-by-hospital determination of when did the 
23  hospital know or have reason to know what happened. 
24
25

 Allegations of fraud or concealment are easy 

 And we think that that's -- could be chaotic 

in a program like this.
