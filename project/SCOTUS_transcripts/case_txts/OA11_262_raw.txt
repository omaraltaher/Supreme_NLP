CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

next in Case 11-262, Reichle v. Howards. 

Mr. Gallagher. 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN R. GALLAGHER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. GALLAGHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

The issue before the Court today is whether 
Secret Service agents who are prepared to take a bullet 
for the Vice President must also be prepared to take a 
retaliatory arrest lawsuit, even when they have probable 
cause to make an arrest.  Respondent in this case seeks 
personal money damages against two U.S. Secret Service 
agents who arrested him, allegedly with a retaliatory 
motive, after he lied to them about whether he touched 
Vice President Cheney. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There's just a little bit 

of noise in the courtroom, and I'm -- I have a little 
bit of difficulty hearing your very opening statement. 

MR. GALLAGHER:  Sure. 
The Respondent in this case seeks personal 

money damages against three -- against two --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.  Yes.

MR. GALLAGHER:  -- U.S. Secret Service 

agents who arrested him, allegedly with a retaliatory 
motive, after he lied to them about whether he touched 
Vice President Cheney.  There are three reasons why 
these agents should not be held personally liable. 

First, the absence of probable cause should 

be a required element of a retaliatory arrest claim. 
Thus, this Court is called upon to answer the question 
that it left open in Hartman v. Moore. 

Second, U.S. Secret Service agents acting in 

their protective capacity should be entitled to a 
qualified immunity when they make an arrest with 
probable cause.  Indeed, to view it any other way would 
be to subject Secret Service agents to the potential of 
retaliatory arrest claims based upon a mere allegation 
of retaliatory animus, something this Court has 
steadfastly refused to do, and for good reason:  Because 
retaliatory animus is easy to allege and hard to 
disprove. 

And, third, regardless of whether this Court 
decides to extend the Hartman rule, the law in 2006, at 
the time of the arrest was not clearly established, thus 
entitling the agents to qualified immunity. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was the probable --

understand --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was the probable 
cause?  What was the probable cause for the arrest? 

MR. GALLAGHER:  Justice Ginsburg, the Tenth 

Circuit found that the probable cause that -- that 
underlies its opinion was a 10001 -- a 1001 violation, 
lying to a Federal agent. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Explain that to me. 

That's a false statement to a government officer, but 
that's not the reason -- 1001 wasn't the reason that 
these officers had to arrest.  They -- there was a 
question of assaulting the Vice President, and I think 
that the charge that eventually was made in the State 
court was harassment.  So, there's no indication that 
these officers had 1001 anywhere in their minds. 

MR. GALLAGHER:  Well, two points, Justice 
Ginsburg:  First of all, under Devenpeck, officers are 
not required to give all of the reasons behind an 
arrest.  But, second, and I think perhaps more 
importantly in this case, when Agent Reichle contacted 
Mr. Howards and made the arrest, Mr. Howards had lied to 
him.  That was relevant to a Secret Service agent's 
assessment of the risk of the situation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do they have to give -- at 
least when you stop a car, the test is whether there was

probable cause, not whether that was the reason that the 
officer stopped the car. 

MR. GALLAGHER:  That's correct, 

Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  There was a broken 

taillight.  There existed probable cause, whether that 
was the basis on which he acted or not.  Now -- is it 
any different when --

MR. GALLAGHER:  I don't think it's any 

different --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  With respect to an arrest? 
MR. GALLAGHER:  Yes, with respect to an 

arrest.  This is – 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So long as they have good 

reason for an arrest, it doesn't matter. 

MR. GALLAGHER:  Absolutely.  That's an 

objective --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That -- we've never held 

that in respect to a claim that the real reason the 
police arrested was retaliation against, for example, a 
picket sign having an unpopular point of view or a 
statement having an unpopular point of view.  That is, 
this Court has never held that it overcomes an arrest 
where there's a claim of retaliatory First Amendment 
action; is that right?

MR. GALLAGHER:  That's right, and --
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  And what you're 
saying is your first reason is that we should say that. 
And the -- the question I wanted to ask you there is, 
you make a very strong case where the President and Vice 
President are involved, the need to protect them, but 
the rule that you there adopt is a rule that will apply 
to every police officer, anyone who arrests anyone 
anywhere in the country, and no matter how clear it is 
that the motive was retaliation against a point of view, 
that individual will be protected from a Bivens action. 
So, it sounds as if your first claim -- the 
remedy sweeps well beyond the need that you sketch.  And 
so, I'd like your response to that. 

MR. GALLAGHER:  Justice Breyer, I think it 
has to do with the determination in the Tenth Circuit 
and the fact that the -- the Tenth Circuit's decision to 
extend Devenpeck to these facts was not the subject of a 
cross-appeal.  So, the issue that you -- you posit is 
not an issue that's before the Court.  It was --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I understand that.  I'm 
just saying if I agree with you on your first that if 
there is a probable cause for an arrest, then wouldn't I 
have to say there is no retaliatory First Amendment 
claim when a border officer chases into Arizona a person

with whom he politically disagrees, and there are 14 
bishops who will say he cared about nothing but his 
political disagreement?  And there's nothing to the 
contrary, and he says:  Oh, I happened to notice -- at 
trial -- that when he left he reached out and snatched a 
$5 bill that was in the till.  And so, I had probable 
cause to arrest him. 

End of case.  Now, that sounds very 

far-reaching, and I don't know that I'm prepared to do 
that.  So, therefore, is there another way you might win 
your case, or should I do that? 

MR. GALLAGHER:  Well, let me answer both of 

those questions.  What you've outlined is essentially 
footnote 10 from the Hartman case.  That's the footnote 
that says what do you do if the -- if the person that 
initiated the prosecution says, I did it for a -- a 
retaliatory reason?  And the Court side-stepped that 
issue. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 
MR. GALLAGHER:  Yes. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  And, of course, Hartman 

dealt with prosecutions.  But people all the time don't 
arrest others.  Policemen frequently don't arrest people 
for everything they might arrest them for.  I mean 
jaywalking, to take an example.  Or all kinds of

things where they just normally don't arrest somebody. 
You might -- or I'm sure you didn't, but I might 
sometimes have driven 60 miles an hour in a 55-mile 
zone.  And I shouldn't even admit this.  I hope I get 
away with it. 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE BREYER:  But -- but you see, it's 

different arrests and prosecutions. 

MR. GALLAGHER:  Well, I – it certainly, 

it's different, but the Devenpeck standard --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it different?  You --

you acknowledge that prosecutors always prosecute, that 
they never exercise discretion and say, oh, what the 
heck, you know? 

MR. GALLAGHER:  Certainly, Your Honor. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  All the time.  All the 

time.  I don't know that it's any less frequent than --
than an officer deciding not to arrest. 

MR. GALLAGHER:  And Justice --

Justice Breyer, I think that the difficulty with your 
hypothetical is, especially with regard to Secret 
Service agents, who perform -- when they're engaging in 
their protective functions, they're essentially --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, that --
MR. GALLAGHER:  -- in the public eye.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's exactly what 

Justice Breyer is saying.  Okay?  Which is, as I 
understand it -- and there's some literature that talks 
about should we be treating misdemeanor arrests 
different than felony arrests, because there's less 
discretion that an officer would have with respect to 
arresting someone for a felony than for misdemeanors or 
criminal fines, because like jaywalking, policemen don't 
arrest you for jaywalking unless they're either on a 
ticket binge or because there's something about you that 
they don't like. 

MR. GALLAGHER:  Sure. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, if that something 

about you they don't like is that you're wearing an 
antiwar armband, are we going to let that plaintiff not 
recover, because somehow we need to protect police 
officers so much, in the discretionary use of this vast 
power they have to arrest that we're going to permit 
them to trample the First Amendment, essentially? 
Or are we going to say, in the normal 

situation there is a First Amendment claim, even with 
probable cause, if you can prove that it's the 
motivating factor for the arrest; but we treat Secret 
Service differently? 

And I think that was the point

Justice Breyer's getting to, and the one I'm most 
interested in. 

MR. GALLAGHER:  Okay. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If we don't extend. 
Hartman, how do we in a principled way deal with the 
unique needs of the Secret Service? 

MR. GALLAGHER:  Let me -- let me briefly 
address the first half of the question, and then I'll 
address the second half.  The first half, when --
Justice Sotomayor, when you suggest that police officers 
could trample on the First Amendment, it's important to 
remember we still have probable cause as the -- as the 
principal picture here. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If you're jaywalking, 

there's probable cause. 

MR. GALLAGHER:  But probable cause is the 
Fourth Amendment standard specified by the Framers of 
the Constitution. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But -- but what does it 
have to do with violating the First Amendment?  Meaning, 
if police officers have discretion and they would not 
otherwise arrest you except for their dislike of your 
speech, that's a violation of your right to free speech, 
isn't it? 

MR. GALLAGHER:  Well, I'm not sure that that

is exactly the case.  Again it gets back to this 
footnote 10 in Hartman, which -- which, there -- Hartman 
can be read two different ways.  It can be read as 
saying that the elements of the constitutional tort 
itself require the absence of probable cause, or it can 
be read as saying the elements of the cause of action. 
But let me -- let me address the second question. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We can go to that 

question later. 

MR. GALLAGHER:  Yes.  And the second 

question has to do with Secret Service agents, because 
Secret Service agents, unlike police officers performing 
law enforcement functions, when Secret Service agents are 
acting in a protective capacity, they are protecting our 
Nation's leaders and they are doing so in a very public 
way, and they are also doing so in a way that is 
essentially a free speech zone. 

Virtually everyone that a Secret Service 

agent encounters when he's protecting the President or 
the Vice President can allege that they're engaged in 
free speech.  So, for Secret Service agents in 
particular, they -- they can legitimately evaluate what 
someone is saying in order to determine a particular 
threat level.  And because of that, Secret Service 
agents have a similar sort of complexity of causation to 

Alderson Reporting Company

the -- the situation addressed in the Hartman case. 

Now, in Hartman, clearly it was a one -- it 

was a two-individual causation situation, but with 
regard to Secret Service agents, the causation is 
similarly complex because Secret Service agents can 
legitimately take into account what someone is saying in 
order to determine a threat level. 

Regardless of whether the Court decides to 
extend the Hartman case, it's absolutely clear that the 
law in 2006, in June of 2006 when the agents made this 
arrest, was not clearly established.  The Hartman case 
was handed down in early 2006.  It had only been on the 
books about 3 months when the arrest was made.  For that 
reason, Secret Service agents should be entitled to a 
qualified immunity in this case because the law was not 
clearly established. 

With regard to the -- the formulation of 
qualified immunity that we are asking for, we believe 
that it is important for Secret Service agents acting in 
this protective capacity to have the requisite breathing 
room in order to make decisions in life-or-death or 
imminent-threat situations.  In fact, the qualified 
immunity that we're advocating is particularly important 
at the margins, particularly important in situations 
where it's not clear what a Secret Service agent can do

or should do, where a Secret Service agent has to make a 
snap decision in order to determine whether someone's a 
threat and then act appropriately. 

The Court in the Atwater case noted that the 

object of -- of the Court's cases has been to draw 
standards sufficiently clear and simple to be applied 
with a fair prospect of surviving judicial 
second-guessing, months and even years after the -- the 
arrests are made. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You're not suggesting 

absolute immunity? 

MR. GALLAGHER:  No, we are suggesting a 

qualified immunity that's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's a different kind 

of qualified immunity? 

MR. GALLAGHER:  It's certainly different 
from the Harlow type of qualified immunity.  It is an 
immunity that is contingent upon having -- contingent 
upon the Secret Service agent being -- acting in a 
protective capacity and having probable cause to make 
the arrest.  But, certainly, once the immunity attaches, 
it would be -- it would be full immunity from a claim. 

The Court noted earlier this term, in 

Ryburn v. Huff case, that judges should be cautious 
about second-guessing a police officer's assessment made

on the scene of the danger presented by a particular 
situation.  We think that this case aptly demonstrates a 
situation in which Secret Service agents made very --
very difficult decisions on the spot, and they should 
not be second-guessed by the Court. 

Finally, with regard to the -- whether 

qualified immunity is -- was clearly established in June 
of 2006, the Ninth Circuit -- the primary case relied 
upon by the Tenth Circuit was the Skoog case.  The Skoog 
case was the case that the Tenth Circuit relied upon in 
holding that Hartman should not be extended. 

It's important, though, when you review the 

Skoog case to -- to read the entire case, because the 
Skoog court, after concluding that -- that Hartman 
should not be extended, still proceeded with the 
qualified immunity analysis to determine whether the law 
was clearly established at the time of the incident. 
And what the Skoog case concluded was -- it looked at --
it looked at the nature of the right. 

And, you know, we know from the 

Anderson v. Creighton case that this Court has said it's 
important when focusing on constitutional rights not to 
look at the 30,000-foot level, not to look at the high 
level, but to look at the contours of the right.  And 
that's what the Skoog case did.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Srinivasan. 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN 
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

I'd like to start off addressing the Secret 

Service in particular because that's the principal 
focus, although I take the point that there are 
questions about applying the rule in a broader context. 
But I think understanding why the rule makes sense in 
the context of Secret Service agents and law enforcement 
officers who are performing similar protective functions 
would help inform why it makes sense to broaden the rule 
as well.  What the Secret Service --

I'll pick up on the point that Petitioners' 

counsel was making, which is that it's legitimate in 
this context for Secret Service agents to take into 
account expressive activity in determining whether the 
circumstances warrant a discretionary exercise of the 
power to arrest. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I assume you would 

include U.S. marshals?

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Yes. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  F.B.I. agents?  So, 

you're talking about protective details. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's correct.  And that's 

why I wouldn't limit it to the Secret Service in 
particular.  I think what happens in a lot of these 
contexts is that it's natural for these individuals to 
encounter First Amendment activity by the public, and 
it's legitimate for them to react to First Amendment 
activity in deciding whether the circumstances warrant 
an arrest. 

And the problem arises because it's very 

difficult to distinguish between, on one hand, a 
legitimate consideration of expressive activity as 
evidencing the sort of threat that warrants a response 
from an illegitimate consideration of expressive 
activity borne of a motive to suppress a viewpoint. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does your rule apply 

regardless of the degree of animus that the agent is 
alleged to have had as to the particular view being 
expressed? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  I think it would, 

Justice Kennedy, because we would have an 
across-the-board, no-probable-cause requirement of the 
kind that the Court applied in the retaliatory

prosecution context in Hartman. 

Now, I think your -- the question of the 

degree of animus asserted by the agent on the scene is 
exactly why these are complicated factual questions. 
Those kinds of allegations can be made, and then you're 
going to have a trial where the agent is on the stand, 
and the jury is going to have a very difficult time, and 
the agent is going to have a difficult time explaining 
why it is that he acted legitimately based on expressive 
activity because he felt that there was a threat to the 
person he was trying to protect, as opposed to 
explaining that he didn't act in order to suppress the 
viewpoint that was being asserted. 

These kinds of allegations can often be 

made.  And, in fact, they can even be manufactured at 
the scene by an intelligent person who's going to be the 
subject of an arrest.  And I think that complicated 
question of causation is exactly why it makes sense to 
apply in this context the same objective screening in 
the form of a no-probable-cause requirement in Hartman 
to this context of retaliatory arrest. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why is there any difference 
if -- when ordinary policemen are policing an authorized 
demonstration --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- in front of this Court 

or anywhere for that matter?  The people making the 
demonstration have -- have the same motivation and can 
make the same assertion of, oh, the only reason you 
arrested me was because you didn't like what I was --
what I was talking about.  So, why should that situation 
be different? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's correct, 

Justice Scalia, and that was going to be my next point. 
Once we understand why it is that it makes sense to 
apply this rule in the context of officers who engage in 
this sort of critical public protective functions of the 
Secret Service, I think we understand why it also makes 
sense to apply it in other situations, because law 
enforcement can legitimately take into account 
expressive activity when they're engaged in functions 
such as crowd control. 

And in those contexts as well, it's going to 

be difficult to disaggregate the legitimate 
consideration of expressive activity as evidencing a 
threat --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Illegitimate?  You just --
MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- from an illegitimate 

desire to suppress a viewpoint.  Sorry.

word "crowd control."  And I take it, in saying the word 
"crowd control," you are making a distinction. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  I'm making a --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you want -- do you want 
the same rule of automatic, you know, immunity -- it's 
sort of automatic immunity -- when crowd control isn't 
at issue, where there's a history of persecution of an 
individual by a particular officer, da, da, da?  I mean, 
you know, we can make up cases. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Did you want it absolutely 

across the board, or are you going to start making 
distinctions? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  I -- I would not draw a 

distinction, Justice Breyer.  Of course, there's going 
to be factual situations --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I agree with you 

about the crowd control. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Yes. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  I see that.  I see that 
problem.  I see the problem of protecting people in 
public life; I see the problem in protecting the 
President. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I think --

that that's a particular problem where views are likely 
to be evidentiary -- unpopular views actually are, 
unfortunately, but how far do you extend it?  You say 
extend it to everything.  To jaywalking, to 
persecutions, to, you know -- that's what's making me a 
little nervous. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Right, and I can understand 
the basis for the nervousness.  I guess the question for 
the Court is whether the benefits of having an 
administrable across-the-board rule outweigh the costs 
of trying to forge some sort exceptions to deal with 
extreme hypotheticals.  And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you have a sense of 
how many of these First Amendment retaliatory claims in 
those jurisdictions that permit them -- I know they're 
more limited -- how many of these cases arise? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  We do.  We've done --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And with what frequency? 
MR. SRINIVASAN:  We've done an unscientific 
search, but to use the same time frame of reference that 
the Court used in Hartman, which is looking back 
25 years, if you do a sort of standard Westlaw search, 
what you'll see is there's roughly a hundred court of 
appeals cases and 450 or so district court cases 
where --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And how many arrests are 

22

there a year? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  I don't know. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's -- a non-felony. 

I'm sure it's in the millions. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  It's -- the -- I'm sure 

there are scores and scores of arrests.  That's correct. 
And, of course, all we're talking about is the cases 
that get to the point where you have an opinion that can 
be -- that can be found.  And there's the obvious point 
that, depending on what the Court does here, you may see 
a proliferation of -- of those claims.  And we certainly 
hope that wouldn't be the case. 

But I think on -- in -- on the question of 

whether it makes sense to have an across-the-board rule, 
I guess I would echo what Petitioners' counsel was 
suggesting, which is you can have the same set of 
considerations in the retaliatory prosecution context 
because prosecutors do act with -- by hypothesis, with 
illicit motives in some situations. 

And the Court considered whether the 

benefits of having an across-the-board rule outweigh the 
costs of forging an exception to deal with extreme 
circumstances.  And what the Court said was:  We want to 
have a rule that's designed to deal with the mine run of

cases; we don't want to have a rule that has an 
exceptional-circumstances exception because in that --
at that point, there will be a great deal of litigation 
concerning what cases fit within of the exception and 
what cases don't. 

And what the Court said was that's rather 

like designing a retirement plan to deal with the 
possibility that someone might win the lottery.  That's 
in footnote 10 of Hartman.  And I think similar 
considerations would weigh -- counsel in favor of 
applying an across-the-board objective, 
no-probable-cause screen in this context as well.  And I 
think it's important to understand that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even though this -- I 

think in Hartman, Justice Souter gave two specific 
reasons, neither of which apply in this context.  I 
mean, this is -- it's the prosecutor who institutes the 
charges, but the suit is not against the prosecutor, who 
would be absolutely immune.  So, that is not in this 
picture.  Here we have one officer. 

So, it would certainly be an extension of 
Hartman because the reason that Hartman gave for the 
rule was tied to -- very much tied to prosecution rather 
than arrest. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I -- with respect,

Justice Ginsburg, I think this case is of a piece with 
Hartman in two relevant respects.  Your Honor is quite 
correct that Justice Souter's opinion focused on the 
fact that you have two individuals in play.  You can 
have that situation here, but we don't base it on that. 

What the opinion was getting to was that 

that creates complex issues of causation in the 
prosecution context.  And I think it was the complex 
causation that really drove the need to have an 
objective across-the-board rule. 

You have the same kind of complex causation 
problem here, for the reasons that I've explained, which 
is that it's extremely difficult to disentangle a 
legitimate desire to act -- to suppress danger, of which 
speech is evidence, from an illegitimate desire to 
suppress a viewpoint. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You might apply the same 

immunity for selective enforcement based on race? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  The same immunity? 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes. 
MR. SRINIVASAN:  No.  The -- they -- I think 

the Court's decision in Whren, for example, supposes 
that even though you have probable cause, you can have 
an equal protection claim if the proof could be made --
and this is very important.  In the equal protection

context, including for race, there is a different 
objective screen in place, and it's a stringent 
objective screen that this Court announced in Armstrong, 
which is that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'm aware of the 

reservation in Whren.  Why should there be a difference 
in the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection and First 
Amendment speech? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I think part -- part 

of the reason is this, that in -- with the First 
Amendment, expressive activity can legitimately be taken 
into account precisely because it can manifest a danger, 
whereas with race in the ordinary case, I think the 
reason why we have these principles in the race context 
is it's ordinarily not a relevant consideration. 
And the Armstrong rule is designed to 

distinguish between circumstances in -- in which race 
was the motivation and in which race wasn't the 
motivation.  And it serves that purpose well.  But it 
doesn't work so well in this context, because here First 
Amendment activity can legitimately be taken into 
account; when, as in this case, a Secret Service agent 
overhears an individual say that he's going to ask the 
Vice President how many babies he's killed, it makes all 
the sense in the world for the Secret Service to focus

their attention on that person. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what about for 

crowd control?  You want to extend it to crowd control 
as well.  What difference does the First Amendment make 
there? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I think it's -- the 
nature, intensity, and vehemence with which the First 
Amendment activity is being engaged in can inform an 
officer on whether the circumstances present the kind of 
danger that warrants a law enforcement response. 

So, I -- and when a law enforcement officer 

does that, he's going to be subject to potential 
liability if an individual says:  Look, you weren't 
reacting against me because of the way I was expressing 
my views; you were acting -- reacting against me because 
you disagree with my views and you wanted to suppress 
them. 

And that's a very hard thing to disentangle. 
And it not only has that problem at the back end, but it 
results in a problem at the front end as well, because 
what happens at the front end is that officers at the 
very outer margins might have in the back of their mind 
a concern that if they acted based on their best 
intuitions about what kind of law enforcement response 
is warranted, they might later be subject to suit based

on a mistaken assumption and potentially an ability to 
convince a jury that they were acting based on an 
illegitimate desire to suppress a viewpoint rather than 
on a legitimate desire --

JUSTICE BREYER:  How many cases -- you might 
know this; you might have information on how many cases 
over 5 years or whatever period there actually have been 
against Federal protective officials of retaliatory 
First Amendment activity. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  I -- I don't know --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It would be in the 

Department, wouldn't it?  Do they keep track? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  It's potentially there, but 

I just -- I don't have the answer at my disposal, 
Justice Breyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Do we know that this is not 

unique, the one before us? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, these -- certainly, 

we know that these kinds of interactions arise with some 
frequency.  I think there was some publicity surrounding 
the --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But when you looked up your 
research for this, did you find any other case in which 
anyone had ever asserted a First Amendment claim of 
retaliation for an arrest?

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, against a Federal --
MR. SRINIVASAN:  In this --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Against a Federal 

protective official. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  No, I -- candidly, I didn't 
-- we didn't conduct a search with that object in mind. 
So, I can't give you an answer one way -- one way or the 
other. 

I did want to make one additional point, 

Justice Ginsburg, in response to the question you posed 
about the applicability of Hartman, which is that at one 
level it applies, the rule should apply, because the 
same concern with complex causation is at issue here at 
well -- as well. 

But the other way to think about the 

applicability of Hartman is to -- is to put these cases 
on a spectrum.  On one end, you have what the Court in 
Hartman identified as a standard retaliation case, of 
which the Court identified public employment as the 
archetypal example.  And on the other end, you have 
retaliatory prosecution, where the Court thought that 
there were sufficient concerns about complicated 
causation that it made sense to have an across-the-board 
objective rule.

Now, the question could be where does 

retaliatory arrest fit within that spectrum?  Is it on 
the retaliatory prosecution side or is it on the public 
employment side?  And for a couple of reasons, I think 
it fits decidedly within the retaliatory prosecution 
side. 

One is the one I've given, which is that 

speech can legitimately be taken into account.  And so, 
it creates complex causation.  But the other one is in 
some sense the flip side of that, which is that in the 
-- in public employment context, the standard fact 
pattern is going to involve a long-term relationship 
between an employer and an employee, during which time 
there's been no adverse action; the employee then 
engages in some sort of expressive activity, in the 
aftermath of which the employer undertakes some adverse 
action such as a termination. 

Now, in that context it makes sense to infer 

that there may well be an illegitimate speech --
speech-suppressive motivation at work, because you have 
in some sense a control period in the interactions 
between the employer and the employee that pre-dated the 
expressive activity. 

That's not the case when you're dealing with 
law enforcement.  In the law enforcement context in the

main, this is a one-time interaction between an officer 
and a suspect, the arrestee.  You don't have the prior 
relationship that acts as a control.  And so, you have 
to ask the question whether, based on that one-time 
relationship, is there a basis for inferring that a 
speech-suppressive motivation was at work? 

And here, because it can be legitimate for 

an officer to take into account speech in deciding 
whether this situation is the kind of one in which a law 
enforcement response is warranted, it makes sense, 
unlike in the public employment context, to apply the 
same objective across-the-board screen in the form of a 
no-probable-cause requirement that you have in 
prosecutions. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I go back to the 

probable cause, the question I asked before?  It's not 
like the taillight.  1001 came up in court.  I -- this 
situation may well have warranted probable cause for 
assault, probable cause for harassment.  But where did 
-- but the 1001 was not the -- was in no one's mind.  It 
does seem quite strange. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  It was not, Your Honor.  Of 

course, that's exactly what happens in the Fourth 
Amendment context.  That's -- that was the issue before 
the Court in Devenpeck, and the Court explained in

Devenpeck why it makes sense to have an objective 
probable cause inquiry rather than a subjective one. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But doesn't it matter 
that it's something that comes up only in court; it's 
not something that -- I mean, why wasn't the natural --
well, one would expect probable cause to arrest because 
it was an assault or harassment -- the actual charges 
that were made? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  I don't know the reason 

that a -- I don't know the precise contours of the 
harassment charges in State court that were made.  I 
think that they mapped on in some measure to the 
assault, the assault that was suspected by the -- by 
Officer Reichle, who effected the arrest. 

Now, I think the concern with importing some 

sort of subjective probable cause dimension into the 
inquiry -- if you asked, you know, what offense did the 
officer in fact have in mind, it's the same concerns 
that drove the Court to apply an objective rule in 
Devenpeck, including, for example, that you would have 
dis-uniformity, in that similarly situated individuals 
would be treated differently based purely on what 
happens to have been in an officer's mind. 

Thank you.

Mr. Lane. 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. LANE 
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

32

MR. LANE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

I think what we have here is a solution 

being offered by the Government, and now we have to go 
find the problem.  And I think that's what 
Justice Breyer's question was directed at here. 

I have done, not a scientific search, but I 
can take credit for a little bit of science involved in 
determining how many such cases arise.  And at page 13 
of our brief, we cite in footnote 8 that a search with 
no time limitations whatsoever going back in LEXIS with 
the words "Bivens" or "1983," "retaliatory arrest," not 
limited to protective details, shows 15 reported Federal 
appellate cases, with no time limitations whatsoever. 

So, we have a solution, but we really don't 
have a problem.  The only Secret Service case that this 
Court has ever heard that I'm aware of involving 
anything remotely like this is Hunter v. Bryant.  So, 
this is not a significant problem. 

This also factually is probably not the best 

case for them to be making their argument that we need 
some sort of special rules that apply to the Secret

Service, given the facts of this case, where Mr. Howards 
by all accounts walked over to the Vice President, 
looked at him and said:  "I just want you to know I 
think your policies in Iraq are disgusting." 

There is a dispute at that point whether he 
gently patted him on the arm -- not a crime -- or tapped 
him on the shoulder -- again, not a crime -- or --

JUSTICE BREYER:  There's no --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's an assault, isn't 

it? 

MR. LANE:  I'm sorry. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  All it takes for an assault 

is an unwanted touching. 

MR. LANE:  Well, incidental contact is not 

an assault, and everyone on the Mall --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not incidental if you 
reach out and touch somebody on the shoulder or the arm. 

MR. LANE:  Well, the problem is that the 

Vice President was on the Mall having contact with 
numerous people, shaking their hands, letting them pat 
him on the back, telling him what a great job he's 
doing. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's fine, and he didn't 
-- he doubtless didn't consider those contacts hostile. 
But when somebody tells you "I think your policies are

disgusting" --

MR. LANE:  And then --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, just don't tell me 
that it's -- it's not a crime.  It is an assault if it's 
an unwanted touching. 

MR. LANE:  Well, under Colorado law, he was 

charged with harassment, and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what you've 
described is not when the person was arrested, right? 

MR. LANE:  That's correct. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The person was 

arrested later, when approached by the Secret Service 
agent, lied about whether he touched the Vice President; 
at that time, in a non-protected area, was carrying a 
bag, right? 

MR. LANE:  Correct. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And wandering 

around.  Turns out that he was looking for his son.  But 
if you're the Secret Service agent, you see somebody who 
said your policies are disgusting, that person touches 
the Vice President, he -- he lies to you.  He 
comes back, he's carrying a bag and he's wondering --
wandering around, do you think it's reasonable at

I'll try my best to cut right to it.

multifaceted is because I'm trying to capture what might 
have been going through the Secret Service agent's mind 
at the time. 

MR. LANE:  Well, that's -- that is part of 

the point I have to make here, all right?  In this 
Court's jurisprudence on Fourth Amendment issues, what 
is going on in the agent's mind is irrelevant.  The 
issue is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what would be 
going in a reasonable Secret Service's agent's mind at 
the time. 

MR. LANE:  Right.  First level of inquiry, 
was there a Fourth Amendment violation?  No, according 
to the Tenth Circuit.  We then have got to shift gears 
if we're going to do a First Amendment analysis.  And is 
this a retaliatory arrest or not? 

We have got to look into the subjective mind 
of the agent.  That's where Justice Ginsburg's questions 
I think take on great import for this discussion, 
because, as she correctly pointed out, the agents on

scene never said in deposition, they have never claimed 
anywhere, that they arrested Mr. Howards on a 1001 
violation. 

The agents on scene in deposition said we 
arrested him because of the way he approached the Vice 
President -- not a crime -- and his demeanor.  We 
thought it might be an assault.  That later morphed into 
a State charge of harassment.  Nobody ever said 1001 
formed any basis whatsoever. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but they did say --

and also you've left out that one of the agents 
overheard him say he was going to ask the Vice President 
how many babies he killed that day. 

MR. LANE:  Right. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So, their job is to 

protect the Vice President. 

MR. LANE:  Absolutely. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's their job. 
MR. LANE:  Correct. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  And it's a very emotional 

subject. 

MR. LANE:  Absolutely. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  And if something happens to 
the President, nobody's going to say, oh, you know, what 
were you doing?  And the whole country is in mourning.

MR. LANE:  Correct. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  We understand that.  And, 
therefore, it's a matter of concern that the -- if you 
have a rule of law that says to the agents, when you 
hear someone who says how many babies are you going to 
kill that day, I'm going to ask the Vice President, I'm 
going to touch him, I am going to then tell them a lie 
when they ask me if I touched him -- that's cause for 
concern. 

MR. LANE:  Absolutely. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Now, if there's a 
lawsuit, the agency will say we just can't do it.  We 
can't do it.  We can't use that as a basis for stopping 
that individual. 

MR. LANE:  Well, that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  All that poses a problem. 

Now, you're -- and I -- I think -- I recognize it as 
a problem.  I'm not saying I have the solution. 

MR. LANE:  Well, I think you hit on the 

solution as part of the problem you just expressed, and 
that is, can they stop this individual?  And the answer 
is "absolutely yes."  They have every arrow in their 
quiver, under Terry v. Ohio.  They can stop him if they 
perceive a threat.  They can force him to open up his 
opaque bag.  They can force him to show them what's in

the box inside the opaque bag.  They can pat him down. 
They can wand him with a metal-detecting wand.  They can 
assure themselves --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it wouldn't be a 

violation of the First Amendment if they only did that 
because they didn't like the ideas he was expressing? 

MR. LANE:  They are allowed --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wouldn't that be a 

violation of the First Amendment? 

MR. LANE:  They are allowed to take 

reasonable steps under Terry, under every conceivable 
case that this Court's ever decided. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even though they're doing 
it for -- they do it for a racial reason, would that be 
okay? 

MR. LANE:  No.  No.  What I'm saying --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course not.  I don't see 
how your -- your First Amendment exception doesn't apply 
to those things as well as to --
MR. LANE:  It would. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- to the arrest. 
MR. LANE:  It would.  If he could prove that 
they did a Terry stop on him in retaliation for his free 
speech and it was motivated -- and I know this -- Your 
Honor's feelings about intent -- intent-motivated

constitutional torts. 

But if he could prove that the Terry stop 
was motivated by -- in an effort to punish him for his 
free speech, yes, that would be a cause of action as 
well. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, what you have, 

under your theory, a person should put on his car a 
bumper sticker that says "I hate the police" and then 
every time they're pulled over, they will have --
certainly a plausible case is you violated my First 
Amendment rights.  It's not because I was going 60 miles 
an hour; it's because of my bumper sticker. 

MR. LANE:  Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And the police 

officer -- at that point, he says, you know, I can't 
give a ticket to this guy without being hauled into 
court on personal liability because he's got a credible 
case that it was for First Amendment grounds. 

MR. LANE:  Well, I think we can look at 
the -- as I've said, the arrows in the quiver of the 
Court to weed out those kinds of cases. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  You've 
already got the officer in court.  I mean, you get a 
speeding ticket, and most times they don't show up 
because they have got other things to do.  Now he's got

to show up in district court, in State court, to defend 
against this. 

MR. LANE:  Well, I mean, litigious 

plaintiffs are a consistent problem across the board 
under many contexts.  And there's really -- you know, 
there's almost nothing that can be done.  This Court has 
taken steps to cut back prison litigation that's 
frivolous, things of that nature. 

But, yes, if -- the heightened pleading 

standard this Court enunciated in Iqbal:  You can't just 
come up with conclusory allegations. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  Well, 

this --

MR. LANE:  You have to have facts in support 

that that's why they stopped me, because of my bumper 
sticker. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that -- is that a 

case that you could state? 

MR. LANE:  That would be --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  He pulled me over, 

he gave me a speeding ticket, but the only reason he 
picked me out is because I had a bumper sticker saying 
"I hate the police." 

MR. LANE:  Well --

trial? 

MR. LANE:  No, that doesn't necessarily go 

to trial.  That's a conclusion, first of all --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why doesn't it go to 

trial?  And -- well, does it go -- I mean, do you get 
depose the police officer?  You know, why did you stop 
him?  Did you stop anybody else for going 65 miles an 
hour that day? 

MR. LANE:  Well, I mean, these evidentiary 

questions have to be first of all supported in a 
pleading with heightened scrutiny under Iqbal. 
Conclusions are not simply enough.  You have --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not a conclusion.  I 

mean, if -- if he didn't have the bumper sticker and you 
asserted in the pleading he stopped me because he knows 
I hate the police, that's a conclusion.  But if you have 
the bumper sticker, he says, you know, I had the bumper 
sticker, and that's why he stopped me. 

MR. LANE:  Well, let me give the flip side 

of that and say if the police officer did stop him 
because of the bumper sticker, he should go to trial. 
He should be held accountable for that. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, the only way you 

can find out is you put in the evidence -- here's the 
bumper sticker -- and you put the police officer on the

stand --

MR. LANE:  Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- and you say, why 

did you do it? 

MR. LANE:  Under --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And then all of a 

sudden -- I don't know why everybody doesn't have a 
bumper sticker. 

MR. LANE:  Theoretically, every single 

person who has ever been arrested for any crime could 
raise a first amendment retaliation lawsuit.  Every 
convicted murderer doing time throughout this country 
could do that.  They don't, however.  There is -- there 
is not a rush to the courthouse of retaliatory arrest 
claims because the pleading requirements are heightened. 
Qualified immunity for over a hundred years has 
protected the Secret Service.  They've been protecting 
the executive branch --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, say, though, that in 

the case of the President, what you're hearing is, as 
you well know, that the combination of disparate 
political views and risk is unlike other situations. 
And I don't know if they can prove it or you could prove 
the contrary, but that's -- that's a claim.  And I can't 
say there's nothing to it.

So, let me suggest to you another arrow 

which – I’ll ask you what you think of this arrow, and 
the answer's going to be not much, but I'm interested 
in hearing --

MR. LANE:  Go ahead. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- your reason. 
MR. LANE:  I'm ready. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  In -- in Hartman, Justice 

Ginsburg and I dissent. 

MR. LANE:  Yes. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  And we referred to a D.C. 
Circuit case.  And in the D.C. Circuit, it said -- it 
talked about rare cases "where strong motive evidence 
combines with weak probable cause to support a finding 
that the prosecution would not have occurred but for 
the ... animus."  Now, so far, you think "fine." 

But suppose you were to say because of the 

factors that have just been mentioned where the 
President's at stake, the courts -- where his life is at 
stake, the President's -- the courts will not infer once 
probable cause exists that it's weak.  And the courts 
will not infer from the simple presence of political 
disagreement that the motive of retaliation is strong, 
which in fact would produce a very limited extension of 
Hartman to the case of protecting the President of the

United States. 

And now, I know you're not going to agree 
with that, and I'm trying it out and I'm not saying I 
agree with it, but I want to see what you -- how you 
react. 

MR. LANE:  Well, let's take a look at the 
facts of this case.  The Tenth Circuit found there was 
probable cause for a 1001 violation.  But was there 
probable cause -- is there a great body of 
circumstantial evidence surrounding this case that would 
point to probable cause which should be considered in 
deciding how this case proceeds?  We have the agent in 
charge of the protective detail, Agent Lee, standing 8 
inches away from Vice President Cheney when this entire 
encounter occurs.  Agent Lee testified he saw no crime 
committed.  We had numerous agents --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me. 
MR. LANE:  Yes, Your Honor. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's go past that for a 

second.  What was it that the arresting agent said or 
did that showed the animus?  Meaning, because that 
another officer actually saw it and understood himself 
what he thought doesn't mean that this agent who was 
told that there had been a touching had that 
information.

MR. LANE:  The evidence --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, I know collective 

knowledge is a theory in a lot of cases, but let's deal 
with the facts of this case.  What's the animus? 

MR. LANE:  Well, there were discrete First 
Amendment episodes that occurred in the context of this 
case.  One was testified to by Mr. Howards in his 
deposition, that when he first of all was approached by 
Agent Reichle, Agent Reichle said, "I want to talk to 
you," and flashed his badge, and Mr. Howards declined 
the invitation to talk to Agent Reichle.  That, 
according to Mr. Howards, angered Agent Reichle.  That 
is a First Amendment significant event in and of itself. 

Steve Howards testified that he then was 
asked by Agent Reichle:  We want to talk to you about 
assaulting the Vice President.  And his response was:  I 
didn't assault the Vice President; I merely criticized 
his policies in Iraq, and if you don't want him 
criticized publicly he should stay in his undisclosed 
location.  Or words to that effect. 

Again, Mr. Howards testified that angered 

Agent Reichle.  At that point, the cuffs went on.  And I 
think that is circumstantial evidence in support of the 
animus for what -- what was going on.  Agent Reichle was 
on notice as to what Howards had said to the Vice

President --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How does all of that 
prove your point of animus in light of the undisputed 
fact that he lied about touching the Vice President? 

MR. LANE:  Well, again --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that's the --
MR. LANE:  -- lying to the Vice President is 
what we look at on a Fourth Amendment analysis, because 
what's in Reichle's actual mind under Devenpeck is 
irrelevant.  So, yes, there was probable cause, but was 
Reichle himself directing his animus at Mr. Howards and 
arrested him?  We have to look into what was actually in 
his mind, and that was not in his mind.  A 1001 
violation was not in his mind.  We looked -- what was in 
his mind?  And we've already said what was in his mind 
is he approached the Vice President, he criticized him 
publicly --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You do understand that 
this case is inviting the questions the Chief Justice 
asked, which -- and which -- as Justice Breyer and some 
of us are concerned about, which is what your adversary 
has described as First Amendment voicing is going to be 
a part of many, many arrests. 

MR. LANE:  Absolutely. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do we draw a line

outside of the one that you proposed by your 
adversaries, that probable cause is the line? 

MR. LANE:  Well, that line --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That doesn't enmesh the 
police in a constant barrage of claims that just because 
they angered a police officer, that's why they were 
arrested. 

MR. LANE:  Well, first of all, there has not 

been this constant barrage.  Hartman has only applied 
until -- I mean, this Court decided Hartman in 2006 for 
retaliatory prosecutions.  There has not been a run on 
the courthouse on retaliatory arrests --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Would you --
MR. LANE:  -- either before Hartman or 

after. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Would you acknowledge that 

the Secret Service faces a different situation from 
ordinary police officers in conducting their daily 
activities, in that Secret Service agents may 
legitimately take into account First Amendment activity 
by someone who is in the vicinity of the President or 
the Vice President in assessing the degree of danger the 
person presents? 

MR. LANE:  This may not help my case, but 

I'll go further than that and I'll say any police

officer has an absolute right to listen to what any 
protester is saying and consider what is being said in 
terms of assessing the level of threat that that 
protester poses. 

But as I said in this case, they had every 
right to stop Mr. Howards, to do a Terry stop on him, 
because they were concerned about him.  And reasonable 
cause for concern under Terry is the standard.  You 
don't need probable cause to pat someone down under 
Terry.  It's simply if a reasonable officer would be 
concerned. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Again, I don't understand 

why you -- why you say that they're immune from the 
charge of First Amendment retaliation for that but not 
immune from the charge of First Amendment -- I mean --

MR. LANE:  I'm not --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If you say they're doing it 
on First Amendment grounds for the one, they're doing it 
on the First Amendment grounds for the other.  Why is 
either one okay? 

MR. LANE:  I'm not saying that they're 

immune on a Terry pat down if it's done in retaliation 
for free speech.  I'm simply saying that would make it a 
much more difficult case for any protester to go to a --
to go to court and say the only reason he patted me down

is in retaliation for my free speech. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So, then putting it 

in their point of view, I just what he actually said. 
He was very angry, your client.  I mean, judging what he 
said -- there were a lot of swear words and so forth --
he was pretty angry at this whole situation. 

So, you're a Secret Service agent, and you 

hear him say -- speak like this -- he has every right to 
speak like that.  I mean people do.  I understand that. 
But now he's also thinking that -- I'm nervous about 
this.  The President is here, the Vice President, 
whatever --

MR. LANE:  Sure. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- same thing -- and I've 
got to do my job.  So -- and nobody's going to say, ho, 
ho, First -- whatever if is -- if somebody is hurt. 

MR. LANE:  I agree with that. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, he has also lied about 

whether he touched the President. 

MR. LANE:  So --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And he has also been 

talking about the President killing people.

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So, what is he 

supposed to do in your view? 

MR. LANE:  He's supposed to -- if he -- if 
he has reasonable cause to believe Steve Howards is a 
threat --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, it is in this 

situation --

MR. LANE:  Okay. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  But this situation, I've --

I'm pretty --

MR. LANE:  Right.  Then he pats him down. 

He opens the bag --

MR. LANE:  Then they monitor him, and they 

watch him, and -- and that's all.

that place. 

MR. LANE:  There is no probable cause to 

believe he has committed a crime at that point.

Amendment analysis and not the Fourth Amendment analysis 
at this point.  First Amendment analysis --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But they didn't 

arrest him -- they didn't arrest until after he lied, 
right? 

MR. LANE:  But it was never in their minds. 
They testified.  That didn't have anything to do -- that 
is the Tenth Circuit's post hoc rationale under 
Devenbeck, which -- Devenpeck -- which says you -- if 
there's any objective probable cause that the Tenth 
Circuit or this Court or any other court can concoct, 
post hoc, even though it wasn't in the officer's mind, 
that's good enough to arrest somebody.  That's -- that 
probable cause.  All right? 

But in First Amendment analysis, it can't be 
an objective standard.  There -- objective standards are 
clean, they are nice, they -- they create bright lines. 
But when we are looking at a First Amendment violation, 
we have to got to be able to get into subjective intent 
of the officer at -- on the scene. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And when you say that, that 

means that almost all of these cases have to go to 
trial --

MR. LANE:  No, they don't. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- before a jury.

Well, how are -- how can they be stopped before they go 
to trial? 

MR. LANE:  Because if -- first of all, as 

I've said, Iqbal requires heightened pleading, not just 
conclusions.  We have the summary judgment standard. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I engaged in First Amendment 

-- I engaged in First Amendment activity. 

MR. LANE:  We have a summary judgment 

standard, where -- and, in fact, in Butz, this Court 
held that a firm application of rules of civil procedure 
will always prevent frivolous claims and meritless 
litigation from occurring in situations exactly like 
this.  And that's true.  A firm application of the rules 
of civil procedure, a summary judgment standard, which 
is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, summary 

judgment, that's -- you've already been in court for a 
long time when you're talking about summary judgment. 

MR. LANE:  There's no easy way out of this, 
unfortunately.  Frequently, when you're talking about --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, there is an 

easy way out of it.  We could agree with the --

(Laughter.)

easy way out of the First Amendment as well.  I mean,

this Court has decided some incredibly difficulty cases. 
Snyder v. Phelps, authored by Your Honor, very difficult 
case.  Could it be side-stepped, by -- you know, 
somebody steps off a curb and is thereby jaywalking? 
Are we limiting --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  One thing about your 

analysis that concerns me is that you seem to have a 
very black-and-white view of what's going on in the 
officer's mind:  Did you stop -- did you arrest him 
because of retaliation or was it because of legitimate 
security? 

And I suspect that the people engaged in 

this type of thing have intuition.  I mean, they don't 
sit there and say, well, let's see; is it because he 
says he didn't like the war in Iraq, or is because he's 
wandering around, looks like he's looking for something, 
with a -- with a bag?  I mean, I assume they sort have 
experience and they calculate all this in and say I've 
got to do something.  And how do you parse those 
different motivations? 

MR. LANE:  Well, what I say about that 

is that -- and, again, I know this is not an answer that 
you're probably going to like, because this means a 
trial is involved, but this is what juries do on a daily 
basis throughout this country, in every criminal case.

What is the subjective intent of the defendant?  In 
every civil case, is this an intentional act, a knowing 
act, a reckless act, a negligent act?  That's what 
juries do. 

And if there's enough evidence to get this 

case to trial -- and I would posit it that in this case, 
where you have agent after agent after agent who saw the 
encounter up close and personal with the Vice President 
and Mr. Howards, none of whom saw any evidence of any 
criminal activity by Mr. Howards, all of whom let Mr. 
Howards walk away from the scene, that's good evidence 
that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  One reason that I, 

in fact, don't like the answer is because what the agent 
is now going to have to factor -- in addition to the 
hostility of the views, the touching of the Vice 
President, the lying about it, the wandering around with 
the bag -- is in the back of his mind, you know, if I'm 
wrong, I may be held personally liable in damages for 
taking some action that some jury somewhere is going to 
say was based on retaliation rather than my obligation 
to protect the Vice President. 

MR. LANE:  Well, I mean, theoretically yes, 

that could be a problem.  And I am quite certain that 
certain civil litigants -- just as in criminal cases,

people are wrongly accused of things that they didn't 
do, they end up in a trial, and sometimes juries get the 
wrong results and an injustice occurs. 

We can't fix all those problems when it's 
not really a significant problem.  There are no run on 
the courtrooms around the land of these kinds of cases 
arising.  We don't need to have any rules that 
specifically pertain to the Secret Service when, to my 
knowledge, this Court has had one Secret Service case in 
its entire history, and there are 15 appellate reported 
Federal decisions regarding retaliatory arrests, 
period --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Which -- is there a record 
of retaliatory arrests by Secret Service agents against 
people who say things that are critical of the President 
and the Vice President? 

MR. LANE:  The only way I know to look for 

that is on Westlaw or LEXIS.  And Mr. Srinivasan 
indicated that they found 100 or 400 cases.  We did a 
search like that.  We came up with the same number.  We 
dug down into those cases.  And in terms of actual 
litigated retaliatory arrest cases, we found 15 total. 
That's not scientific, but that's the best I've got for 
you at this point. 

And I don't know if there is a repository of

where we can find that or not.  But this -- and I 
started this argument by saying this is a solution in 
search of a problem.  The Secret Service has adequately 
done their jobs beautifully over -- for over a century. 
And there is no reason to put some different rule down 
on the Secret Service. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, we lost a couple of 

Presidents, didn't we? 
(Laughter.) 
MR. LANE:  Well, they're doing the best they 
can.  I mean, that's -- I understand that.  But it is --
it is a serious, serious issue to curtail the First 
Amendment. 

Consider the situation where you actually 

do -- and I believe this is that case -- you have Secret 
Service agents who deserve to be taken to a trial 
because they have gone out of their way to punish 
someone for their free speech. 

What do you do about those guys? 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's ambivalent.  I 

mean, suppose it turns out you have this trial.  We know 
what words were spoken.  Get to the trial; it turns out 
Reichle is a strong opponent of the war in Vietnam. 
Then, end of trial, right? 

MR. LANE:  You know, that would be a fact to

be considered by the jury.  I could lose this trial when 
we go back, if we get a trial.  That's what -- that's 
what jury trials are all about, Justice Ginsburg. 
And I'm not saying that I have to show 

evidence to this Court that I'm going to win the trial 
before I win this case.  The issue simply is, can we 
sacrifice the First Amendment?  You know, does a 
litterbug lose their right to have First Amendment free 
speech, does a jaywalker lose their right to have First 
Amendment free speech because probable cause exists to 
believe they've committed some offense?  And you'll have 
officers ostensibly enforcing litter laws and jaywalking 
laws and blocking-the-sidewalk laws, and First Amendment 
is essentially evaded. 

A hundred years of jurisprudence, courageous 

jurisprudence, many times by this Court, goes by the 
boards because somebody is a litterbug.  I just don't 
see that as the solution to this problem, and I also 
don't see that the Secret Service needs some enhanced 
protection from this Court when this has never been and 
is not now any kind of a serious problem. 

The status quo is Mount Healthy.  It has 

worked for decades, and it should continue to work.  And 
if these agents get tagged in this case, maybe they 
deserved to get tagged in this case, because the First

Amendment is extremely important.  And I don't denigrate 
the job of law enforcement or these agents in any way. 

I'm simply saying that when the First 

Amendment is at stake, I think -- and the law has been 
working just fine throughout decades, to extend the no 
probable cause in Hartman to on-street encounters where 
there is no complex causation chain, where the main 
actor in Hartman was immune completely from lawsuit --
the prosecutor in Hartman could not be sued under any 
circumstances, nor could the prosecutor in Hartman be 
questioned in deposition under our traditions.  We don't 
question prosecutors in depositions about why they made 
decisions to go ahead and prosecute.  So, this Court 
stepped back in Hartman and said that's a different 
story. 

But on-street encounters -- if you extend 

the no-probable-cause requirement to on-street 
encounters, any rogue police officer, or Secret Service 
agent, who wants to can ostensibly enforce any number of 
legal violations -- 1 mile an hour over the speed limit, 
you're going to jail allegedly for going 1 mile an hour 
over the speed limit; or under Atwater, for not wearing 
a seat belt -- when the real reason is your bumper 
sticker. 

If you can prove that, they should go to
