 (10:12 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-479, Safford 
Unifed School District v. Redding.

 Mr. Wright.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W. WRIGHT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. WRIGHT:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court:

 The search of Savana Redding in this case 

was constitutional because Mr. Wilson had reason to 
suspect that she possessed contraband which posed a 
health and safety risk.  Therefore, searching any place 
where she might be reasonably hiding that contraband was 
constitutionally permissible.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Any place, even 

though he had perhaps no reasonable suspicion to suspect 
that she was hiding the contraband in her underwear?

 MR. WRIGHT:  Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, 

as long as he had reason to suspect, which we believe 
the evidence does show, he was entitled to search any 
place where the contraband might be reasonably hidden.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Any place?  I mean, 

prison inmates, for example, are subject to much more

intrusive searches.  Are you suggesting that would have 
been justified in this case?

 MR. WRIGHT:  No, Your Honor.  I'm -- I'm 

suggesting that where it might be reasonably hidden is 
based on an administrator's experience and certainly is 
proven out by the reported cases that we've cite in the 
reply on pages 8 and 9, which are that students often 
will secrete items in and under their clothing.  That is 
not an uncommon thing to happen, although these kind of 
intrusive searches are rare.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But I -- I think you're 
really caught in -- in a dilemma here.  Your answer 
suggests that you would not have allowed a cavity search 
in this case.

 MR. WRIGHT:  That's correct, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But people have been known 
to secrete contraband in -- in bodily cavities.  What is 
the -- what is the principle under which you would allow 
a strip search but disallow a cavity search?

 MR. WRIGHT:  The principle is, Your Honor, 
is that the common experience with schoolchildren, as --
as school officials have a relation to schoolchildren, 
is such that they might hide things, and they do hide 
things, in and under their clothing.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was there --

MR. WRIGHT:  But --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was there prior 

experience in this particular school?  Were there prior 
occasions on which students had been strip-searched and 
contraband found?

 MR. WRIGHT:  Your Honor, I don't know, and 
that's not in the record, but I can tell that you that 
that would not be the threshold requirement under this 
Court's prior rulings to justify the search.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you -- I thought your 

answer to Justice Scalia was that in the -- in the 
school's experience, children do hide contraband in 
their underwear but not in their body cavities.

 MR. WRIGHT:  Yes, Your Honor.  To be more 

specific, in the nationwide school experience, based on 
the reported cases that we see, which are contained in 
the reply at pages 8 and 9, we find that they hide them 
in and under clothing, but I don't know of any case of 
which I'm aware where there would be items secreted in 
body cavities.

 And I -- and I feel, Your Honor, that that 

is a bright-line area because that -- that is -- that is 
something that the Court can clearly say is off limits. 
And --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Let me ask you about

another bright-line rule that I think you're assuming. 
You -- you said in the course of describing the 
justification for this search that one -- one of the 
points of justification was that there was a health and 
safety risk.  And I assume from the way you put it that 
you are grouping every drug, prescription or over the 
counter, as posing a health and safety risk; is that 
correct?

 MR. WRIGHT:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why -- why should we accept 
that -- that blanket assumption?  I mean, at some point 
it gets silly.  Having -- having an aspirin tablet does 
not present a health and safety risk, and yet that's an 
over-the-counter drug, and presumably you would have 
gone through the same search for -- for an aspirin that 
was conducted here.

 MR. WRIGHT:  For the very same reasons this 
Court noted in T.L.O. 25 years ago, Your Honor, and that 
is that the school officials have deemed, in their 
judgment, that this is an important rule with regard to 
health and safety.  So --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Oh, and I agree with you, 
and I -- I don't have any question with this kind of a, 
let's say, a -- a broad swath of judicial hands-off in 
determining what is a risk and what isn't.  But at some

point it becomes sufficiently questionable that I do 
think we have to raise it.  And if your rule would 
criminalize -- I shouldn't say "criminalize" -- would 
put aspirin in the contraband category and justify the 
kind of search that went on here, I think we've reached 
the questionable point.  And I -- my question to you now 
is, why haven't we?

 MR. WRIGHT:  Well, Your Honor, if -- if an 

administrator in their judgment, in their reasonable 
judgment, believes that any -- any drug poses a 
potential health and safety risk, because they have the 
custodial and tutelary responsibilities for those kids 
-- and it's not like a criminal issue where they're 
trying to prosecute; this is a case where they're trying 
to protect -- because they have those kinds of 
obligations to provide for the safety of children, to 
provide an orderly educational environment, it is best 
for this Court to defer to their judgment when they 
believe that certain rules are important and not 
second-guess those rules.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Had it been --
MR. WRIGHT:  So long --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Had it been the case that, 
as I recall, someone had -- well, students were popping 
ibuprofen, weren't they?

MR. WRIGHT:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I guess they might pop 

aspirin as well.  I'm not aware that one gets a high on 
either one of those.  Somebody in -- in the school had 
gotten almost fatally ill about a year before this 
incident; isn't that right?

 MR. WRIGHT:  Precisely, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  On over-the-counter drugs.
 MR. WRIGHT:  On a prescription medication 

that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  A prescription, not over-

the-counter.

 MR. WRIGHT:  -- that a student brought to 

school and that a student ingested, another student 
ingested, and then was airlifted out in an ICU in a 
near-fatal experience.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was --
MR. WRIGHT:  But just 7 days --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was -- what was the 

drug involved in that case?

 MR. WRIGHT:  I don't know, Your Honor, and 

it's not in the record.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it certainly was not 

ibuprofen?

Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said it was a 

prescription drug.

 MR. WRIGHT:  It was a prescription drug. 

And -- and 7 days before this event, Your Honor, just 7 
days before, the student informant Romero had taken a 
prescription drug.  Again, I don't know what the type of 
drug was, but he became violently ill, which caused he 
and his mother to come talk to the administrator.  So we 
had those two recent events.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but he -- he was not 

the one who identified Redding.  It was her classmate.

 MR. WRIGHT:  Her friend Marissa Glines, yes, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And on that classmate's 
say-so -- was the classmate ever asked, well, when did 
you get this pill?  Where did she give it to you?

 MR. WRIGHT:  Where -- the question, where 

did this pill come from, was asked by the administrator.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I mean, what place.  I 

mean, the child is caught with the pills.  She blames it 
on her classmate.  She says:  She gave them to me.  Did 
the school ever bother to ask when in time she gave 
them, where in location she gave them?

 MR. WRIGHT:  No, but that's clear from the

record, Your Honor.  The reason for that is Jordan 
Romero said to Mr. Wilson that morning:  I just received 
this pill from Marissa Glines.  The plan is that a group 
of these kids are going to take these pills at noon.  So 
it's contemporaneous.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's contemporaneous 
with the -- with the student who blamed the other child. 
I'm asking if there's any link other than one child 
caught with the pills blurts out that it was someone 
else?  The tip from the young man had nothing to do with 
Redding; it had to do with Glines.

 MR. WRIGHT:  But the tip from the young man 
goes to Glines, and the young man's tip becomes reliable 
when Glines produces the fistful of pills that he said 
she would have, plus other pills.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Maybe it becomes reliable 

as to her, but it has nothing to do with Redding.

 MR. WRIGHT:  But, Your Honor, then it ties 
in with the -- with the contraband -- excuse me -- the 
planner that was laid open before Mr. Wilson when he 
subsequently searches Savana Redding, and she admits to 
him that that was her planner, but she denies any 
knowledge of the contents.  So did Marissa Glines.  So

what particular pills it was searching for?

 MR. WRIGHT:  Not --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did it know that -- what --

what the threat was was ibuprofen or aspirin or -- or 
some prescription drug?

 MR. WRIGHT:  Not comprehensively, Your 

Honor.  What they knew was there was IBU 400s in an OTC 
pill that was later identified.  But he also knew there 
was a variety of pills.  What Mr. Wilson did not know --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How did he know it was an 

OTC pill?

 MR. WRIGHT:  Because he --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just by looking at it?
 MR. WRIGHT:  -- called poison control.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.
 MR. WRIGHT:  And -- and once that was 

assessed --

--

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What was in it?  Did he say 

MR. WRIGHT:  It was Naprosyn 200 milligrams.
 And -- and, Your Honor, what -- that's a 

good point because what Mr. Wilson doesn't know is what 
other pills might be out there.  He knows there's a 
variety of pills, but he doesn't know of what type.  He 
doesn't know what amount.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Have you ever made -- has 

your side of the case ever made the argument that it 
needs this sort of blanket classification rule, any drug 
over the counter or prescription, because when a, a pill 
is found, they're not pharmacists, they don't know what 
it is, and therefore they've got to have a blanket rule 
or they simply cannot act effectively?  I did not see 
that argument in the briefs.  Has that argument been 
raised at any point?

 MR. WRIGHT:  Precisely, Your Honor.  We have 
argued that our administrators are not pharmacologically 
trained?

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Where did you argue it?  I 

mean, I want to know whether that argument is in the 
case.

 MR. WRIGHT:  It's in the briefs.

it.  Do you remember a page?  Do you have a page

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay, I'll go back.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In the case, this case, 
the school nurse -- the pills were given to the school 
nurse and she identified what they were.

 MR. WRIGHT:  Precisely.  And she called 

poison control to figure that out, though, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Mr. Wright, could I ask 
you this question.  There may be an issue as to what the 
assistant principal could reasonably infer from the 
facts that were known by him, whether he could 
reasonably infer facts that would create a reasonable 
suspicion that there were drugs hidden in the 
plaintiff's undergarments.  Is that a question for --
for the finder of fact in a case like this, so that it 
can't be -- there can't be summary judgment for either 
side unless no reasonable factfinder could find to the 
contrary?

 MR. WRIGHT:  The problem with that is, Your 
Honor, it wouldn't comport with the notion that we need 
to shield administrators from lawsuits and legal 
liability.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  No, not on the question of 
qualified immunity.  On the issue of whether there is a 
Fourth Amendment violation.

factual determination, as to whether he could reasonably 
suspect that the pills would be there?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Right.
 MR. WRIGHT:  I think -- I think it could 

lend itself to that, Your Honor, but I would prefer that 
the Court -- we would ask the Court and it's our 
position that the Court would lay down a bright line 
rule such that it wouldn't end up in a factual dispute, 
and that bright line rule is this.  Once you had reason 
to suspect a student is possessing any contraband that 
poses a health and safety risk, then searching any place 
where that contraband may reasonably be found is 
constitutional, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Any contraband, like the 

black marker pencil that -- that astounded me.  That was 
contraband in that school, wasn't it, a black marker 
pencil?

 MR. WRIGHT:  Well, for sniffing.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, is that what they do?
 MR. WRIGHT:  It's a permanent marker.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They sniff them?
 MR. WRIGHT:  Well, that's the -- I mean, I'm 

a school lawyer.  That's what kids do, Your Honor, 
unfortunately, Your Honor.  But --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Really? 

14 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

MR. WRIGHT:  But the point was is that the 
rule -- the rule, Your Honor, is -- is grounded in the 
notion that when there's a health and safety risk 
because these people are charged and tasked with the 
responsibility to keep these kids safe, they have to 
have the opportunity to act flexibly, immediately, and 
effectively when they're dealing with these risks.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there has to be -- I 
mean, some -- the stark difference between this case and 
T.L.O., in addition to the intrusiveness of the search, 
was there was a teacher said:  I caught those girls; 
they were smoking in the bathroom.  Here we have nothing 
but this Glines identifying her classmate.  And nothing 
is done to check her veracity, nothing is done to follow 
up on it at all.  And the search is quite different from 
the search of a purse that doesn't touch the child's 
person.

 MR. WRIGHT:  Your Honor seems to be 

concerned about the reliability of the tip in this case. 
Your Honor, I would submit to you to that student tips 
are the very thing that officials rely on probably the 
most.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But an official could 

follow up to see whether this child -- whether there is 
a basis for what she said.  But there were no questions

asked at all.

 MR. WRIGHT:  There was additional 

corroborating evidence, Your Honor.  There was -- there 
was suspicion by direct implication and there was 
suspicion by circumstantial corroboration.  These two 
kids could, in Mr. Wilson's mind -- he believed that 
they were working together to conceal other types of 
contraband.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the school could keep 
records on its students, like the police keep records on 
confidential informants.  So if -- unless this student 
had a proven record of having accurately ratted out a 
certain number of classmates in the past, she couldn't 
be believed.

 MR. WRIGHT:  Except that, Your Honor, 

there's a different incentive here.  Students can be 
disciplined if they -- if they tell tales.  And so if 
she tells a lie she faces the risk of discipline.  In 
addition to that, there was evidence that these kids 
were friends, and he had reason to rely on that.  He had 
reason based on their association at the opening dance. 
He had reason to believe that because --

distinguishing a strip search from a cavity search. 
What would you require before you would allow a cavity 
search?

 MR. WRIGHT:  Nothing at all.  A bright line 

rule.  I would not allow it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No cavity search in school, 

no matter what?

 MR. WRIGHT:  We're not even clinically 

trained to do that, Your Honor.  I would submit that if 
a child has something stuffed up one of their cavities 
-- and I assume we mean private parts, the very private 
parts -- that the first thing to do would be to send 
them to the hospital.  I mean, we just don't have that 
clinical training.

for saying that, I guess, is just sort of the practical 
one, we don't know how to do that type of thing.  So far 
as the legal principle on the basis of which you 
justified this search, you could justify that search, 
too, couldn't you?

 MR. WRIGHT:  On the legal basis I could see 

that, Your Honor.  I could see that result.  But 
practically --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But if -- if we hold in 
your favor in this case and the next school district 
says, all right, we're going to have classes in body 
cavity searches, then there would be no legal basis, if 
we accept your principle, for saying that's out of 
bounds as a matter of the Fourth Amendment; isn't that 
correct?

 MR. WRIGHT:  I see your concern.  That's to 
be left up to the local governments, Your Honor.  As you 
have mentioned, this Court has mentioned, in Ingraham 
and Wright --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  So it would not -- it would 

not be out of bounds under the Fourth Amendment?

in the Ninth Circuit in border search cases a body 
cavity search can be conducted without a warrant?  I 
thought a warrant was required under the Ninth Circuit 
rule.  I could ask the government.

 MR. WRIGHT:  I just know that there has been 
concern expressed over body cavity searches, even in the 
prisoner environment and even in the border environment. 
I can say to this Court you will not restrict or in any 
way inhibit the discretion of an administrator by saying 
you can't go there on a body cavity search, nor would 
they want to, nor are they clinically trained to.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can I ask just a 
follow-up on your answer to Justice Kennedy's earlier 
question about whether the informant was subject to 
civil suit.  When you said no, did you mean she hadn't 
been sued or that she could not be sued?

 MR. WRIGHT:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  That 

she had not been sued.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There's one aspect of 

this considering the reasonableness of the school 
administrator's behavior.  In addition to not following 
up with Glines, after Redding was searched and nothing 
was found, she was put in a chair outside the vice 
principal's office for over 2 hours and her mother

wasn't called.  What was the reason for that 
humiliating, putting her in that humiliating situation?

 MR. WRIGHT:  Your Honor, that is not a 

matter of the record, but the inference is that the --
that the investigation was still ongoing because there 
was a group of kids, and at that time the administrator 
was making efforts to try to make sure that he had 
gathered all the drugs that might be on campus.  And in 
any event that wouldn't --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But how were they 

investigating her when they did nothing but put her in a 
chair outside the vice principal's office?

 MR. WRIGHT:  Well, Your Honor, I can see 

where it might have been more reasonable in that sense 
to have let her go back to class, but it certainly is 
not a standard that would affect the constitutionality .

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I assume a school can 

assign a student to study hall.  That's not considered a 
government seizure.  Isn't that an obvious part of the 
parental supervision that a school exercises, sit here 
and stay there.

 MR. WRIGHT:  That's exactly right, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Schools do that all the 

time, don't they?

MR. WRIGHT:  Yes.  In fact, there was a 
Ninth Circuit on the docket at the time, the Smith 
versus McLaughlin case, where the plaintiff argued the 
very thing, that she was detained for hours.  And the 
court recognized there -- I believe there was a 
concurrence by Judge Kozinski -- that that's entirely 
appropriate, that's where they are.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When was the -- when 

was she detained there in relation to the lunchtime 
period, which was when the other student had said that 
all the kids were going to take these pills?

 MR. WRIGHT:  I believe it went through the 

lunchtime period, Your Honor, the detainment.

 In addition, Your Honor, I would like to 

point out also that trying to restrict any more the rule 
that I've laid out, as the United States Government has 
suggested, respectfully, would cause more problems.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But aren't there things 

here that are a little extreme?  I mean, if she's to be 
believed, then she was really naked, and the two 
administrators deny that, but you have to take her side 
of the facts.  So taking her side of the facts, why 
couldn't the school administrators just do what they 
said they did?  That is, you leave her in her underwear, 
tell her:  Go shake her underwear.  No reason to do any

more than that.  Or if she is really embarrassed about 
that, say:  Go put on a swimming suit, you know.  Shake 
the swimming suit, no problem.  People see you at the 
beach all the time.  Or call your mother.

 I mean, you know, we can think of another --
a number of things that seem a lot less restrictive than 
her version of what went on here.

 MR. WRIGHT:  May I offer two principles?
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
 MR. WRIGHT:  First, this Court has 

recognized that the least intrusive means is not a 
threshold prerequisite to a constitutional --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I know, but I mean, here 

she is embarrassed if -- if what she says happened 
happened.  There seems no reason for that, and it seems 
so easy.  Put on your gym clothes, okay?  I mean, she 
does that every day.  It is just such obvious 
alternatives to having her be really naked.

 MR. WRIGHT:  Very true.
 JUSTICE BREYER:
 So that's what I -- I don't see any basis 
for saying to the school administrator, you know, you 
can do that.  You can just turn her naked.  I mean, it 
just embarrasses her.  What's the need for it?

did -- she did have her underpants on and her brassiere 
still on.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I know, but she says in the 

record that they went further and required her to be 
partly naked beyond just her underwear.  They say --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I suppose you could 

say that about any strip search, couldn't you:  That 
there is never a need for a strip search?  You could 
always give the -- you know, the suspected felon, you 
know:  Here, change into this suit.  And -- and we 
haven't adopted some such rule, have we?

 MR. WRIGHT:  No, Your Honor.  You have 

specifically said the fact that other reasonable 
alternatives are available doesn't mean that the 
alternative that was used or the actual search that was 
done was unreasonable.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So that was my 

question.  My question was:  Why wasn't it?  I wasn't 
asking about the law.  I was asking:  Why didn't they 
choose one of these alternatives?

 MR. WRIGHT:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  I don't 
-- I can't answer that question for Mr. Wilson, but I'm 
sure that in the heat of the moment that that issue 
wasn't thought through.  And, of course, he wasn't 
involved in the search because he's a male.  Only the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. 

 Mr. O'Neil.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID O'NEIL
 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING REVERSAL
 MR. O'NEIL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 Intrusive body searches in the school 

context implicate fundamentally different expectations 
of privacy than other -- other kinds of searches.  For 
that reason, they require greater justification under 
the Fourth Amendment.

 In the government's view, the best way to 

give effect to that greater showing is to adhere to the 
basic reasonable suspicion standard of T.L.O., but to 
elaborate on that standard in two ways.  First --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Before you get 

started, do we have to reach the underlying merits or 
can we just decide the qualified immunity issue?

 MR. O'NEIL:  The government agrees with the 

parties and all amici in this case that this Court 

24 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

should address the substantive Fourth Amendment issue.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Should -- should, 

but must?

 MR. O'NEIL:  This Court could decide the 

case on qualified immunity grounds alone.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, one of the defendants 

doesn't have qualified immunity.

 MR. O'NEIL:  That's exactly right, Justice 

Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So don't we have to, for 

that defendant at least, decide the constitutional 
question?

 MR. O'NEIL:  Well, this Court could remand 
on Monell grounds for a hearing on that, which was not 
addressed in --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What would be, Mr. 

O'Neil, the basis for the Monell claim?  That would be 
against the school district?

 MR. O'NEIL:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What would the plaintiff 

have to show to establish a claim under Monell?

 MR. O'NEIL:  The plaintiff would have to 

show that this search was conducted pursuant to a -- an 
official policy or that the vice principal was a person 
who was acting with that authority.  There are a number

of grounds that -- that the plaintiff could establish 
the Monell claim on the basis of, but in this case the 
Ninth Circuit did not address that.  And, therefore, we 
believe that this Court should not review in the first 
instance, but if the Court were inclined to remand on 
that ground to allow the Ninth Circuit to address it 
before this Court reaches that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You -- you criticized the 
Ninth Circuit in your brief for having a sliding scale 
standard, which is a bad thing in your view.  But it 
seems to me that your standard comes close to that.  You 
call yours a differential level standard or something 
like that?

 MR. O'NEIL:  No, Justice Kennedy.  Our 

standard is one of greater specificity in the 
information, not a standard that rises and falls 
depending on the level of intrusiveness.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you have to, under 

your standard, have reason -- a reasonable suspicion 
specifically that -- that the student is hiding the 
contraband in the student's underwear?

 MR. O'NEIL:  That's correct, Justice Scalia.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, if -- if you have a 

reasonable suspicion that the student has drugs and you 
search every other place, you search in the student's

pack, you search the student's outer garments, and you 
have a reasonable suspicion that the student has drugs, 
don't you have, after conducting all these other 
searches, a reasonable suspicion that she has drugs in 
her underpants?

 MR. O'NEIL:  No, Justice Scalia, we believe 

that you don't --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right.
 MR. O'NEIL:  -- without -- without --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Your logic fails me.
 MR. O'NEIL:  Well, Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you reasonably 

suspect the student has drugs.  You've searched 
everywhere else.  By God, the drugs must be in her 
underpants.

 MR. O'NEIL:  Well, Justice Scalia, you 

posited that the teacher began the search with 
reasonable suspicion.  And in that case, if you searched 
the obvious places like a wallet, a pocket, a desk, a 
locker, and you didn't find it in those places, the 
logical conclusion would not be that it must be in the 
student's underwear, but perhaps that the information 
that you had --

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- putting things in their 

underwear.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That sounds to me 
like the sliding scale that you reject from the Ninth 
Circuit.

 MR. O'NEIL:  No, because we believe that 

where you have reasonable suspicion that there is 
contraband in the underwear, then you could go directly 
to that location, and you wouldn't have to work from the 
outside in.  But, Justice Scalia, it takes --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, surely not.  You 
are saying if you have reasonable suspicion that it's in 
the underwear, you shouldn't even bother searching the 
pack or the pockets.  You should go straight to the 
underwear.  That can't be right.

 MR. O'NEIL:  Well, to take T.L.O. as an 

example, Justice Scalia, in that case the Court believed 
that there was reasonable suspicion that the student had 
cigarettes in her purse because that was the obvious 
place to find them.  Now, if the -- if the school 
principal in that case had searched the purse, searched 
the student's pocket, searched the locker, searched the 
desk, I don't think this Court would have said that 
there was reasonable suspicion to believe that the 
cigarettes were in --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, what specifically do 

you think is missing here?  They need -- the school 
needed to have a direct statement from Marissa Glines 
that -- that Redding had the -- had the pills in her 
undergarments; is that correct.

 MR. O'NEIL:  The particularized suspicion 

could come from information from students that reliably 
adverted to the location of the contraband.  That's the 
--

JUSTICE ALITO:  But you have to have direct 

evidence that the -- the -- it can't be based on 
inferences?

 MR. O'NEIL:  No --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that the distinction you 
are drawing?  The location has to be supported by direct 
evidence.  Somebody has to say that that's where it is.
 MR. O'NEIL:  No, Justice Alito.  We believe 
that if teachers were aware of the general practice and 
it was common knowledge that students did hide 
contraband in this way and -- that would be relevant to 
the totality of the circumstances in determining whether 
this student was following that practice.

 But we don't believe that the examples that 

were provided in Petitioners' reply brief establish 
anything like that practice.  Petitioners cite 8 cases

over the course of approximately 30 years in which 
contraband was found in those locations.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But you are -- you are 

saying basically there is -- there is no general 
understanding that people carry ibuprofen in -- in their 
undergarments.

 MR. O'NEIL:  That is -- that is true.  There 

was no experience at this school.  There was no 
reasonable -- no reason to suspect that based on 
experience in the world.  And, in fact, by the time the 
officials had conducted their -- this search, they had 
searched Marissa, who was Respondent's friend.  And they 
had conducted a search of her pockets and her wallet and 
they had found pills in her pockets and her wallet.  But 
they had not found pills in her underwear.

 So even if that had been a suspicion that 
one might have had even before beginning the search, 
they certainly wouldn't have had that suspicion by the 
time --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But if your --

accepting your argument that there may be no reasonable 
suspicion based on Marissa saying this is the person who 
gave me the drugs, does the fact that she said kids are 
going to -- the kids are going to take these drugs at 
lunchtime, a specific time, does that present a

difference in the level of concern that the school 
should have?

 MR. O'NEIL:  We believe that the schools may 

take seriously any information they receive and must 
take seriously any information they receive about the 
presence of prescription pills on campus.  And the fact 
that the teacher believed that these pills were going to 
be consumed at lunch as part of an event that obviously 
wasn't simply intended to get rid of the students' 
headaches, we believe that that would give rise to 
reasonable suspicion to initiate some search.
 But we believe that without some 

particularized suspicion or some specific indication 
that this, the location, was a likely one to contain the 
drugs, that this search was excessively intrusive.  And 
this is not a new standard.  This is essentially the 
same standard this Court adopted in the Montoya De 
Hernandez case for intrusive body searches in other 
contexts.  It has proved workable in that context and we 
believe that it would prove workable here.

 We believe that it is also better than the 
alternatives of a higher level of suspicion, which does 
not bear any necessary logical correlation to the 
likelihood that the --

specifically that Savana Redding has pills someplace on 
her person and she's going to distribute them at lunch 
in the cafeteria, would this be a different case?

 MR. O'NEIL:  It may well, Justice Alito.  In 

that circumstance it would likely be the reasonable 
thing for the teacher --

JUSTICE ALITO:  What is the difference 

between that situation and this situation?  The 
differences are slight.  Wouldn't that at least be a 
question that has to be decided by the trier of fact?
 MR. O'NEIL:  That may present a triable 

issue.  Here --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  That 

wouldn't -- that wouldn't satisfy the test you've just 
given us.  I thought you said there had to be specific 
indication that she was carrying it in her 
undergarments.  And what Justice Alito posed was not 
that, just specific indication that she had it on her 
person.  Is that enough?  Do you want to revise your 
test so it's not just specific indication that it's in 
her undergarments, but specific indication that it's on 
her person?  That's enough?

 MR. O'NEIL:  No, Justice Scalia.  We believe 

that there must be information beyond that.  And I may 
have misspoke, and I think the answer to that question

is that in that circumstance, a teacher would almost 
certainly ask, well, where on her person is it?  And if 
the student doesn't know, then, yes, Justice Scalia, 
that would not satisfy the standard that we would urge 
this Court to adopt.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, the student says, 
she has -- she has crack someplace on her person, and 
she's going to distribute it to kids during the lunch 
hour, and so they search her -- her garments, and they 
don't find it.  And you're saying that they cannot then 
go ahead and search her undergarments --

MR. O'NEIL:  The nature of the contraband --
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- because --
MR. O'NEIL:  The nature of the contraband 
could be relevant in the totality of the circumstances 
to the suspicion that the student has -- is hiding it in 
some illicit place as -- Justice Souter, as you noted, 
certainly there is no practice anywhere, that I'm aware 
of, of hiding ibuprofen in underwear.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So there is a sliding scale 

for the dangerousness of what you're looking for?

 MR. O'NEIL:  No.  It simply means that it's 
relevant to whether in the totality of the circumstances 
that school official could have reasonably suspected 
that the student was hiding it.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How is a school 

administrator supposed to know?  Marissa says:  She gave 
me these pills.  What are they?  I don't know.  And so 
how is the -- if it depends whether it's a dangerous 
drug like crack or a relatively -- not harmless, but a 
different one like ibuprofen, the search depends on 
that, how is the school administrator supposed to know?

 MR. O'NEIL:  My point was simply with a drug 

like crack there is a more common understanding that a 
drug like that can be hidden in a student's -- in 
underwear.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So what is the 

school administrator supposed to know when he sees a 
white pill and doesn't know if it's something terribly 
harmful, even deadly, or if it's prescription strength 
ibuprofen?  You say in the former case he can search 
undergarments, in the latter case he can't.  So how is 
the administrator supposed to know what he's dealing 
with?

 MR. O'NEIL:  Well, we believe that, as I 

said, school administrators have to take seriously all 
medication like this on campus.  My point was simply 
that where a particular type of contraband is known to 
be carried in a certain way, that can be relevant to the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, your 
answer to me was they have to take it seriously.  My 
question to you is, what is the administrator supposed 
to do?  He sees a white pill; nobody can tell him what 
it is.  Is he allowed at that point to search the 
undergarments or not?

 MR. O'NEIL:  No.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  He's not?
 MR. O'NEIL:  He is not.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Even if it turns out 

to be -- you know, I don't know, some very deadly drug?
 MR. O'NEIL:  Mr. Chief Justice, we do not 
believe that this Court should get in the business of 
deciding that searches are okay for, for example, 
heroin, but not okay for cocaine.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's what you just 

told us we should do, in answer to Justice Alito's 
question.

 MR. O'NEIL:  No, I simply -- the point was 

simply that if there is some common understanding that a 
type of contraband is generally secreted in a certain 
way, and the example is crack, and there is a known 
understanding that crack can be hidden in that way, that 
that would be relevant to the totality of the 
circumstances.

Official - Subject to Final Review 

JUSTICE SOUTER:  And I don't see why your 

answer might not be different if, under the Chief 
Justice's question, he didn't know it was ibuprofen. 
All he knew was that it was a white pill.  He's not a 
pharmacologist, he doesn't know what's in it.  Wouldn't 
the reasonableness of the -- wouldn't the scope of 
reasonable search at least potentially be greater for 
the undifferentiated white pill than for the known 
ibuprofen?

 MR. O'NEIL:  It may, Justice Souter, but I 

think that the question would be whether the school 
official has some reason to believe, based on a 
practice, that -- that pills, for example, are hidden in 
a student's -- can be hidden in a student's underwear. 
Again, the example was crack, and that is a situation 
where there is an understanding that that is -- can be a 
place in which suspects will hide that type of item.

 But, again, there was no indication in this 
case whatsoever and no basis for the school official to 
suspect that that was a likely location.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 MR. O'NEIL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Wolf.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM B. WOLF
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

36

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

MR. WOLF:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 We agree with the Federal Government that 
before conducting an intrusive strip search a school 
needs to have location-specific information.  And while 
this case can begin and end with that well-accepted 
proposition, it's also important to recognize that a 
school needs greater -- a greater degree of suspicion to 
conduct a strip search than to conduct an ordinary 
backpack search.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't think the 
case can begin and end with that because we have the 
separate issue of qualified immunity.  Can we take that 
off the table?

 I mean, we have got six to five in the Ninth 

Circuit, disagreement throughout in this case, and yet 
you say the rule is so clearly established that you can 
make these school officials personally liable.

 MR. WOLF:  Your Honor, I don't think a head 
count of the judges is the standard by which this Court 
measures qualified immunity.  That's what this Court, 
you know, held, for instance, in Groh v. Ramirez.  But I 
do understand that it sort of gives one pause.

 It says:  Well, what did they miss here? 

And what they missed here is that this search violated

the clearly established point that in order to conduct 
an intrusive search of one's body, the searching 
official needs to at least reasonably believe that the 
object is located underneath the undergarments.  The 
Fourth Amendment does not account -- it does not 
countenance the rummaging on or around a 13-year-old 
girl's naked body --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if --
MR. WOLF:  -- without any suspicion.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if what Marissa 

has is heroin?  The school administrator recognizes 
heroin.  She says:  This is what the student gave me? 
Search the undergarments or not?

 MR. WOLF:  The nature of the infraction --
no.  The nature of the infraction, as T.L.O. would put 
it, is a nonstarter in this case, because we don't even 
have the suspicion to get underneath Savana's 
undergarments, even if you had -- regardless of the 
substance.

 Now, in T.L.O., the question was whether 
there were drugs to be found.  There was marijuana in 
that case.  And this Court set a relatively low 
standard, that you need more than a hunch, and you need 
particularized suspicion.  Now, that's where the Court 
set the balance for ordinary searches for drugs.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm not quite sure where 

we are in your answer to the question of the Chief 
Justice's question.  He asked you a hypothetical case. 
And you said that's a nonstarter because in this case. 
And the hypothetical is that there is a very 
dangerous drug, meth, that's going to be distributed and 
consumed that afternoon.

 Does that make a difference in the 

permissibility of the search and the reasonableness of 
the search and the scope of the search?

 MR. WOLF:  No, it does not.  It does not in 
this case, because without a suspicion that you're going 
to find the object --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you don't mind our 
judging this case as if they were searching for meth?

 MR. WOLF:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's the way -- we 

should -- we should judge this case as though they were 
searching -- the fact that it was -- is it ibuprofen, 
have I got that?  The fact that it was ibuprofen is 
irrelevant; we can consider this case as if it were 
meth?

 MR. WOLF:  I think we all understand that 
this -- that this case, you know, involves ibuprofen. 
But our argument --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't think I understand 
that based on your answer.  I'm -- I'm asking you -- you 
said that the nature of the drug makes no difference, 
It's a nonstarter.

 MR. WOLF:  Not in in this case, correct.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Insofar as the rule that 

we -- that's because in this case you don't think 
there's a reasonable suspicion to begin with.  But that 
doesn't answer the hypothetical.  We're trying to 
announce a rule.  And your rule, your submission, as I 
understand you and as I understood the government, is 
that the nature of the substance they're searching for 
is irrelevant.

 MR. WOLF:  I think it's irrelevant when 

you're making distinctions between drugs.  If -- if the 
question is whether you can strip search a child for 
gum, for instance, because that might prohibit school 
policy, I would --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So that goes back to my 

earlier proposition that you don't mind our deciding the 
case as if this were a search for meth that was going to 
be consumed at noon?

 MR. WOLF:  That's correct, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Thank you.

was no suspicion -- and I think Justice Alito was 
perhaps getting to this -- there was no suspicion that 
these objects were going to be found inside Savana's 
undergarments.  And without that suspicion you cannot 
conduct such an intrusive search.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, to play the devil's 
advocate on that, why couldn't the assistant principal 
reason as follows:  that he has information from -- from 
Ms. Glines that Ms. Redding has drugs.  He has 
information from another student that drugs are going to 
be consumed during the lunch hour.  Putting those two 
together, he reaches the -- he suspects that the person 
who has the drugs has the drugs on his or her person so 
that they can be distributed at lunch.  And then having 
searched every other part of -- having searched Ms. 
Redding's outer garments, what's left are her 
undergarments.  So therefore there's a reasonable 
suspicion that the drugs are -- are located there.

 MR. WOLF:  Justice Alito --
JUSTICE ALITO:  What's wrong with that?
 MR. WOLF:  Justice Alito, I don't think that 

accurately describes the record.  Even if it did, it 
wouldn't satisfy this Court's standard.  Two things 
about the record:  one, I think the hypothetical 
supposed that she had drugs, and in fact what the record

reveals is that it was allegedly Savana provided these 
drugs at some point.  It's not that she currently had 
them on her.

 Second, that they searched every other part, 
and it's an important -- it's an important point in this 
case.  Where did Marissa have her planner?  It was in 
the desk.  Did they search the desk here?  No.  We know 
that.  It's not in the record, as Mr. Wright said, but 
they have lockers in the school.  Did they search any 
locker?  No.

 Can students keep drugs anywhere else on 

school grounds?  Perhaps, probably so.  Did they search 
everywhere?  They absolutely did not.  But I want to get 
back to the legal answer, too, which is that this Court 
said in T.L.O., and it's on page 342 of T.L.O., that a 
search is reasonable only when there are reasonable 
grounds for believing that it will turn up evidence. 
There were no reasonable grounds for believing that this 
search would turn up evidence, none at all.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're saying the whole 

search, not just the search of the undergarments. 
You're saying they couldn't even have searched her 
backpack, right?

 MR. WOLF:  I think they could have searched 

her backpack.  And what --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?
 MR. WOLF:  What that speaks to is the low 
degree of the suspicion and the nonspecific suspicion 
that's needed to conduct an ordinary search.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you want a sliding 

scale?

 MR. WOLF:  It's not a sliding scale, Your 
Honor.  This is a two-step framework, and that is it. 
We have ordinary searches, backpacks, pencil cases, book 
bags, that kind of thing; and then you have a search 
where you require a 13-year-old girl to take off her --
take off her pants, take off her shirt, move around her 
bra so she reveals her breasts, and the same thing with 
her underpants to reveal her pelvic area.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I think there's a 
dispute in the record about that.  So -- so we have, I 
mean you would have the right to prove your version, 
obviously.  But suppose you fail to prove that and that 
the jury or judge, or whoever is deciding this fact, 
concludes the school board's right on that; all they did 
was ask her to strip to her underwear, period.  Nobody 
saw anything else.

 Now, what's your view of that one?  I mean, 

let's also imagine that this is sufficient to prove --
to -- what happened was Marissa opens a planner, and in

the planner there's some small knives, a cigarette 
lighter, and a cigarette.  And who gave you the planner? 
Well, Savana gave it to me.  And they find some pills. 
Let's imagine those pills are cocaine or something like 
meth or something.  And she says well, where did you get 
those?  Savana gave them to me.

 Okay.  That seems to be possibly reasonable 
suspicion to think Savana has some of these pills.  And 
they're going to distribute them at lunchtime.  At that 
point they go look, whatever they did here.  But then 
they bring Savana in to the nurse and the nurse and the 
female official say:  All right, Savana, strip to your 
underclothes and shake your underclothes.  That's what 
happens, period.

 Now, is that latter part a violation of the 

Fourth Amendment?

 MR. WOLF:  It is, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Because?
 MR. WOLF:  It is because that is an 

intrusive, traumatic search.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  But it would be 

okay to say, change into a swimming suit or your gym 
clothes?  Hey, your gym clothes are in the locker, 
they're about the same size, shape; go do that.

they asked Savana to go into the other room and to 
change where you're not revealing your body to 
any government official.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, they didn't -- she 

didn't reveal her body beyond her underclothes.  She --
that's the hypothetical that I'm trying to work out 
here, because I'm not certain.
 MR. WOLF:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm trying to work out why 

is this a major thing to say strip down to your 
underclothes, which children do when they change for 
gym, they do fairly frequently, not to -- you know, and 
there are only two women there.  Is -- how bad is this, 
underclothes?  That's what I'm trying to get at.  I'm 
asking because I don't know.
 MR. WOLF:  Right.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Wolf, one thing 

should be clarified.  I don't think there's any dispute 
what was done in the case of both of these girls.  It 
wasn't just that they were stripped to their underwear. 
They were asked to shake their bra out, to -- to shake, 
stretch the top of their pants and shake that out. 
There's no dispute, factual dispute about that, is 
there?

 MR. WOLF:  There is none at all.

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I thought there was, 
because I thought on page 135 of the record the official 
said they didn't see her naked, and so I thought that 
there was --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There was no dispute that 

they asked her to shake her pants and her bra.  Nobody 
said that they touched -- the school officials didn't 
touch her, that's a given.  But they did ask her to 
shake out her underwear.

 MR. WOLF:  That's right, Justice Ginsburg. 

Everybody --

JUSTICE BREYER:  My question -- my question 

has to do with accepting --
MR. WOLF:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  What they said on page 135 
of the record, and this is a genuine problem I'm having. 
I'm trying to figure out, if that's so, and to repeat it 
-- you heard what I said, there's no reason to repeat 
it.

 MR. WOLF:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  I want to know why 
that search, if that's what happened, would violate the 
Fourth Amendment, assuming reasonable suspicion to think 
she possessed meth or cocaine at that time.

the Fourth Amendment, and the question is why.  Because 
even that slightly less invasive search still implicates 
legitimate and serious implications of privacy.  The 
National Association of Social Workers, for instance, 
filed an amicus brief in this case, and what they showed 
is that -- or they cited studies showing that when a 
child undergoes a strip search -- and Justice Breyer, 
your -- your hypothetical involves a strip search --
that that produces long-lasting and traumatic 
consequences for a 13-year-old child.

 Now, why does that matter?  Because the 

Fourth Amendment requires a balancing.  On one side you 
have legitimate expectations of privacy, and on the 
other side you have the governmental need to conduct 
that search.  So --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe the psychologists --

"strip search" has a lot of meanings.  And do the 
psychologists focus on the situation with the child 
involved, you know, this is an -- my hypothetical, is 
that what they're talking about?

 MR. WOLF:  I believe it is, Your -- Justice 

Breyer.  And I believe that we cite such a study in --
in our brief, the red brief, where we say that it 
doesn't require a student to take off his or her 
undergarments so long as the shirt and the pants are

taken off, that that produces trauma.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Let me -- let me just, not 
so much change the facts, but -- but emphasize a couple 
of different aspects of the facts.

 Assuming Justice Breyer's hypothetical of a 
moment ago and assuming the following thought process on 
the part of the principal -- I -- strike that.

 I will vary the facts in one way.  Let's 

assume, following your categorical rule that the -- the 
principal doesn't know whether it's ibuprofen or not. 
He just knows that there's a pill and one of the other 
kids said this person has got pills on -- on her person. 
The principal says, I know as a matter of reliable fact 
that one student got sick, violently sick, within the 
past week or so on some pill; we don't know exactly what 
it was.  We also know within a reasonable period of time 
from where we are now that there have been kids who died 
from ingesting dangerous drugs.  I've got suspicion that 
some drug is on this kid's person.  My thought process 
is I would rather have the kid embarrassed by a strip 
search, if we can't find anything short of that, than to 
have some other kids dead because the stuff is 
distributed at lunchtime and things go awry.

 Is that the basis?  Is that thought process, 

that reasoning, the basis for a -- a reasonable strip

search?

 MR. WOLF:  And to make sure I understand, 

it's that there's reasonable belief -- there's a 
reasonable belief that a student has drugs on his or her 
person?

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  That's right.
 MR. WOLF:  And by his or her person, 

presumably it could be the pockets or it could be in the 
backpack that he or she is holding?

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Somewhere between the 

surface of the clothes and -- and the body.

 MR. WOLF:  Right.  And in that instance it 

still would not be appropriate.  There needs to be 
suspicion that the object is located underneath the 
clothing.  And if that isn't there, then you can't 
search there.  Now that should be --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  You -- you say that the --
the point of my question, this is what I'd like you to 
focus on -- you're entirely right, I would accept that 
argument and I think that argument is entirely right, if 
the stakes are lower.  If the risk of a mistake is going 
to be less traumatic.  In the hypo that I gave, the risk 
of the mistake may well be violent sickness or death. 
And the thought process in the principal's mind is, the

better embarrassment than violent sickness or death. 
What's wrong with that reasoning under the Fourth 
Amendment?

 MR. WOLF:  Well, I mean, to start, that's 
not what T.L.O. said.  T.L.O. said that there needs to 
be a reasonable --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  I'm -- I'm saying it.
 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  We -- We've got a new case.
 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  And I'm saying to you, why 
isn't that a -- a reasonable thought process within the 
concept of Fourth Amendment reasonableness?

 MR. WOLF:  Because in order to conduct that 
intrusive search, it seems like it that case you would 
have to be doing guesswork, if you will, about where 
those pills are located.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  You've got reasonable 

suspicion that they are somewhere on the person.

 MR. WOLF:  That's right.  And presumably, if 

they're -- if it doesn't show up in a pocket search, 
then you can do a strip search; and if you don't find it 
in the strip search, you could do a body cavity search; 
and if it's not in the body cavity search --

mind, why isn't it reasonable?  In other words, there --
there is a sliding scale of risk which is inherent in my 
hypo, and why isn't that a sound basis for a -- a Fourth 
Amendment analysis?

 MR. WOLF:  Because -- it all comes back to 
the balancing of the Fourth Amendment.  And here, where 
you're conducting a traumatic search without a belief 
that you're going to find it underneath the 
undergarments, it --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  I don't have a belief; I 
simply have a reasonable suspicion.  That's what I've 
got all along the way.  And it seems to me, when -- when 
you take the position that you -- you were taking, you 
are saying, better to have the risk of violent sickness 
or death than the risk of embarrassment.  Isn't that 
what you're saying?

 MR. WOLF:  No, it's not what I'm saying, 
Your Honor.  There are many things that -- that this 
principal could -- or the assistant principal could have 
done here that would have mitigated any risk, and at the 
same time not caused the trauma of -- the trauma 
associated with a strip search.  Sit the child down --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Some search is -- is 

reasonable, I take it?

JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right.  Now the -- we 
get to the point as in prior hypos, in which it does --
they find nothing in the pockets.  They find nothing in 
the pocket book or other garments.  The only thing 
that's left is a strip search, and that's where you draw 
the line.  Why do you draw the line there, on the risk 
analysis?

 MR. WOLF:  Well, the hypothetical supposes 

they have searched everywhere.  And I suppose if you 
have -- if you are certain that somebody possesses a 
drug and you have searched everywhere, perhaps you have 
generated location-specific information.  I would 
readily agree to that.

 But in this case, they certainly did not 

search everywhere.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you agree with Mr. 
O'Neil when he said if the drug had been cocaine, and 
it's well known that cocaine is carried in underwear, 
that then this would not run afoul of the Fourth 
Amendment?  He gave an example of a drug where there was 
a custom of carrying it in a certain way.

 MR. WOLF:  Right.  I think if it were 

readily known that this student had previously been 
suspected of -- to use the term that's used in the court 
of appeal cases -- "crotching" that drug, well, then,

perhaps that would have been appropriate.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It has to be that 
student.  It can't be that it's customary among 
students?

 MR. WOLF:  And it may be that if this 

becomes so customary, that that somehow differently 
calibrates the equation here, but it -- it's sort of 
strange credulity to think that you would have loose 
pills concealed against a student's genitalia.  That's 
what you'd have to think was the custom here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  As -- as I understand your 
- your presentation, you qualify as a strip search any 
search that requires the outer garments to be taken off. 
So it didn't really matter whether they required her to 
shake out her bra or stretch the elastic of her 
underwear?

 MR. WOLF:  It certainly added to the trauma 

-- trauma, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But is a strip search and 

-- impermissible along the lines you say, to require the 
student to even take off the outer garments?

 MR. WOLF:  That's -- that's right.  That's 
what the studies say, and that seems like a reasonable 
calibration to me.  You know, anything --

with -- with your answers to Justice Kennedy, you are 
saying it's unreasonable to take off the outer garments 
even if your suspicion, reasonable suspicion for 
justifying the preliminary search is that the student 
has heroin?

 MR. WOLF:  Without any location-specific 
information, that's correct, and anything else would 
send a shudder down the spines of little boys and girls 
around this country.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, let me ask you this 

about spine shuddering.
 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let's go back to Justice 

Souter's question.  We assume that there's meth, 
something very dangerous, going to be smoked at noon, 
there's very strong suspicion of this student.  The 
assistant principal says I'm going to give you a choice: 
we're going to engage in an intrusive search, same sex 
people, like what went on here; or we're going to call 
the local police department, we'll have probable cause 
to book you and they will search you at the jail house. 
Which do you choose?

 Would the school administrators be violating 

their duty if they did that?

police officers?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  They give the student the 

choice.  They say we'll do it here with a nurse right 
here, where you know everybody, and there's nothing 
wrong' or we'll call the police, and they'll do it down 
at the police station.

 MR. WOLF:  I don't think that would violate 

the Fourth Amendment, Justice Kennedy.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Which -- which would be 
the less traumatic of the two choices for the student?

 MR. WOLF:  Well I'm not sure that there's a 

lesser or more traumatic.  Both -- both are fairly 
traumatic.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But wouldn't the 

police --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You think it's less 
traumatic, or it might be less traumatic to have 
uniformed police officers take the person to the police 
station and conduct the search there?

 MR. WOLF:  Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You want us to decide the 
case on the fact that that's probably less traumatic for 
the student?

 MR. WOLF:  I'm saying both are remarkably

the other.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The police would require 

probable cause, wouldn't they, not just suspicion?
 MR. WOLF:  They would require probable 

cause.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In the hypothetical wasn't 

there a probable cause?

 MR. WOLF:  Well if there's probable cause 

and they want to call the police officers in, then they 
can do that.  But that's not what happened here.  What 
this school official did was act on nothing more than a 
hunch, if that, that Savana was currently concealing 
Ibuprofen pills underneath her underpants for other's 
oral consumption.  I mean there's a certain ick factor 
to this.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you've made 

that point several times.  In fact the issue here covers 
the brassier as well, which doesn't seem as outlandish 
as the underpants, right?

the prison context, the rules are different.  They are 
different, because this Court has --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maybe I'm -- maybe 

I'm not articulating this.  You keep focusing on the 
fact that it's unlikely that the pills would be 
concealed in her underpants.  That doesn't go to the 
brassiere at all.

 MR. WOLF:  Well it -- the brassiere I think 

as well.  I mean there -- there was nothing in this 
record that even the principal or assistant principal 
said I suspect that it was there.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It's not like you have any 
studies on this.  But I mean, I hate to tell you, but it 
seems to me like a logical thing when an adolescent 
child has some pills or something, they know people are 
looking for them, they will stick them in their 
underwear.  I'm not saying everyone would, but I mean, 
somebody who thinks that that's a fairly normal idea for 
some adolescent with some illegal drugs to think of, I 
don't think he's totally out to lunch, is he?

 MR. WOLF:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you have any studies on 

this?  I doubt it.

 MR. WOLF:  No, but neither -- neither do 

they.

JUSTICE BREYER:  So what am I supposed to 
do?  In my experience when I was 8 or 10 or 12 years 
old, you know, we did take our clothes off once a day, 
we changed for gym, okay?  And in my experience, too, 
people did sometimes stick things in my underwear --

(Laughter.)
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Or not my underwear. 

Whatever.  Whatever.  I was the one who did it?  I don't 
know.  I mean, I don't think it's beyond human 
experience, not beyond human experience.

 MR. WOLF:  Yes, but the "not beyond human 

experience" --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what are they 

supposed to do?

 MR. WOLF:  But the "not beyond human 

experience" standard is not the standard that governs 
whether the Fourth Amendment is violated.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, but it's supposed 

to be what's reasonable.

 MR. WOLF:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And a teacher is there 

thinking what's reasonable?  And I've already got the 
thing sort of away from -- I see your point.  I'm not

supposed to say, look, school -- school officials who 
think that children could hide things in their underwear 
when they know they're not supposed to have them, is 
that school official really unreasonable except in a 
special case?  That's what's bothering me.

 MR. WRIGHT:  Well, it -- it is unreasonable, 

and at the end of the day, it has to be unreasonable. 
To think that -- for school officials to think that this 
student was hiding -- this honor student was hiding 
pills underneath her undergarments based on nothing in 
the record that supports that, not a single thing.  What 
does the school official know?  That there was an 
accusation that Savana had provided pills at an unknown 
time and at an unknown location, that Savana's backpack 
search yielded nothing, not only pills, but no suspicion 
that she possessed pills underneath her undergarments.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that a question of law or 

is that a question that goes to the trier of fact, 
whether you could infer reasonable suspicion about the 
presence of the pills in those locations?

 MR. WOLF:  That seems like a factual 

question to me, Justice Alito.  I mean, there's nothing 
in the record to -- to indicate otherwise.  And we 
haven't moved for summary judgment here, but all 
inferences are resolved in our favor when Petitioners

have moved for summary judgment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is probable cause a jury 

question too?

 MR. WOLF:  Whether something rises to the 

level of probable cause?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, probable cause in the 
ordinary criminal investigation cases.  Is that a jury 
question?

 MR. WOLF:  It strikes me as a factual 

question, Your Honor, that may or may not -- I -- I 
don't know the answer to that --

JUSTICE ALITO:  In a 1983 action, wouldn't 

it be a jury question?

 MR. WOLF:  I think in this case it certainly 
is a jury question, without anything else in the record 
that that -- that that is a reasonable inference, and 
without it being self-evident -- and I would actually 
argue that it was self-evident that those pills were not 
located there and that that's not a reasonable 
inference.

 But if there is some doubt about that -- and 
I was hearing some doubt from Justice Breyer and perhaps 
other members of this Court -- well, that strikes me as 
a factual question.  And if that's a factual question to 
be resolved by a jury, there must be a principle behind

that, which is that if it is not a reasonable inference 
that those objects were located there, then it would be 
an unreasonable search.  And if that's true, then 
qualified immunity, at least at this stage, was properly 
denied.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think it's a 

question.  You can -- even -- even in a 1983 action, I 
don't think the courts allow a jury to decide whether 
there was probable cause for an officer's search or 
seizure.  That's new to me.

 MR. WOLF:  Well, whether something was a 
reasonable inference or not, it might strike one as a 
reasonable inference --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did the Ninth Circuit --
MR. WOLF:  -- and another as not a 

reasonable inference.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did the Ninth Circuit 

treat this as a jury question?  I'm looking at page 38a. 
They were quite definite that that was a Fourth 
Amendment violation.

 MR. WOLF:  Right, because for the Ninth 

Circuit, this -- it was self-evident to the Ninth 
Circuit that the --
inference.  And without that reasonable inference, there 
was no reason to treat it as a jury question, but if 

that there was not a reasonable

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Wolf.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W. WRIGHT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. WRIGHT:  Thank you, Your Honor.
 The reality is that we've gotten past the 

reasonable at its inception prong, and we're now on the 
scope.  And I think everyone concedes that.  And, as to 
the scope, I can tell you that if they found uncut 
heroin or small-caliber bullets in this case, they would 
have to reach the same results.  And that is 
unacceptable in the school setting.  There's too much at 
risk here when you're talking about the custodial and 
tutelary responsibilities this Court has time and again 
recognized as the most important elements in upholding 
the three search cases, student search cases, that this 
Court has upheld.

 The other thing about the government's 

proposal is -- is really troubling.  It's because they 
do not justify why they would pass a rule that would so 
much stunt the administrator's discretion to respond,

even in the most serious situations that confront the 
health and safety of kids.  These -- these principles 
are principles that have been restated by this Court. 
You need the flexibility to act immediately and 
effectively to keep kids safe.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Unless the people feel 

differently.

 MR. WRIGHT:  That's right.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Some school districts have 

rules against --

MR. WRIGHT:  Absolutely.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- simply forbidding strip 

searches on any -- right?

 MR. WRIGHT:  There is an amicus brief that 

cites 189 school districts which have substantially 
limited strip searches, which proves the Ingraham v. 
Wright theory, which is that it will be taken care of at 
the local level.

 But administrators, for now, need a 

bright-line rule.  And as to the scope, that bright-line 
rule is if you have reason to suspect that a student is 
processing contraband that poses a health and safety 
risk, then searching any place where that contraband may 
be reasonably hidden is constitutionally permissible. 
And in any event, Mr. Wilson in this case certainly

could have believed that the Constitution permitted it, 
Mr. Chief Justice, and so immunity is a foregone 
conclusion in my opinion.

 But I would ask the Court to rule on the 
constitutional question in the affirmative because it 
would further the interests of judicial economy.  There 
would not be any more Federal action in this case.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, there would. 

There's a Monell claim against the school district 
because there is no qualified immunity.

 MR. WRIGHT:  That's correct, Your Honor, but 

if you ruled in the affirmative on the constitutional 
question --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.
 MR. WRIGHT:  -- the case is over.
 The additional issue, Justice Alito, on the 

factual question is I understand you're not talking 
about immunity, but the reality is we've got to be able 
to make decisions, and if we get sued on factual 
questions because somebody questions whether or not it's 
reasonable for us to search where contraband may be 
reasonably located, then we're going to end up in court 
anyway on those factual questions, which is going to --
you know, deter officials from acting immediately and 
effectively in those situations.  So, I do not think it

law that this search was constitutional.
