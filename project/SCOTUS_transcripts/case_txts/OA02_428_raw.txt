CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 02-428, Dastar Corporation versus Twentieth


Century Fox Film Corporation.


Mr. Gerber.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. GERBER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. GERBER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


Dastar discovered that an old TV show made by


Time Inc. was in the public domain because Fox neglected


to renew the copyright.  Dastar adapted the public domain


show at considerable expense to make it into a war


narrative as opposed to Eisenhower's story.  Dastar's


product did not refer to Time Inc.  Dastar's product also


did not refer to respondents who had their own competitive


video of the same TV show.


QUESTION:  Of the same what?


MR. GERBER:  TV show.


Because of the latter, that is, the omission of


credits to respondents, and the finding that Dastar acted


willfully in omitting those credits, the lower court


awarded $1.6 million, substantially in excess of the


$850,000 total gross of Dastar, in order to deter it.

 The lower courts departed from the Lanham Act in


a very expansionary way in our view in six separate


dimensions.


QUESTION:  Can we go back to your statement?  As


I -- as I understood it, it wasn't the omission of Fox,


but the addition of your people.  In other words, it


wasn't the failure to give credit to respondents, but it


was petitioner's taking credit for it that was what the


lower courts thought was wrong.


MR. GERBER:  Taking the lower courts in


ascending order, on page 53a of the cert petition, the


language is that the court finds that defendant's failure


to identify the television series and the book is


misleading to the public.  And then at the Ninth Circuit


level, on page 3a of the petition, the language is that 

Dastar copied, et cetera, and marketed it without


attribution to Fox.


Neither court, Justice Ginsburg, examined


Dastar's credits, affirmative credits, for accuracy, for


whether they registered with the consumers, for


misleadingness or falsity in any way.  I would suggest


that the record indeed is that it was the omission of


credits for their competitors that was, in fact, the basis


for the double award.


QUESTION:  This is a failure -- this is a

failure to attribute case then?


MR. GERBER:  Yes, it is, Your Honor.


Our first and most sweeping point --


QUESTION:  But may I just point out on 3a, it --


the quote -- you left out the first clause I think. 


They -- they labeled the -- the resulting product with a


different name and marketed it without attribution.


MR. GERBER:  Oh, yes.  That's a reference to


changing the title of the work.  The entire phrase -- and


pardon my truncation of it -- on page 3a is that Dastar


copied substantially the entire Crusade in Europe series


created by Twentieth Century Fox, labeled the resulting


product with a different name, and marketed it without


attribution.  The name Dastar put on it, instead of


Crusade in Europe, was World War II Campaigns in Europe. 

And you will, I believe, see that in neither


opinion does either court take a look at the credits on


Dastar's product and conclude that they were in any way


misleading, nor does the court examine them at all.


Our first --


QUESTION:  Counsel, would -- would the new


Dastar video qualify as a derivative work that would


deserve copyright protection on its own?


MR. GERBER:  Yes, yes.  The --


QUESTION:  And is that issue being litigated?

 MR. GERBER:  No, it isn't.


QUESTION:  No.  Thank you.


MR. GERBER:  Our -- our most sweeping statutory


point is, while not necessary for this opinion


certainly -- this case, certainly would dispose of it,


that the current version of the governing statute, Lanham


Act 43(a)(1)(A), does not recognize reverse passing off at


all.  The judicial interpretations of the Lanham Act,


under which this claim was born, were under a prior


version that was substantially amended in 1988, and while


no court has construed the '88 language, we think that the


natural and plain meaning of it is that it encompasses


only forward passing off.


QUESTION:  Only what kind of passing?


MR. GERBER:  Forward passing off.


QUESTION:  What is forward passing off?  It


sounds like a football game.


MR. GERBER:  It's not football, Your Honor.


(Laughter.)


MR. GERBER:  It is the standard type of


trademark or trade dress infringement in which the


wrongdoer -- let's call it Brand X -- utilizes the mark


Rolex -- of usually a well-recognized company and puts


that mark on its product.


QUESTION:  Is it some kind of affirmative

misrepresentation?


MR. GERBER:  In forward passing off?


QUESTION:  Mm-hmm.


MR. GERBER:  I -- I --


QUESTION:  To -- to get some kind of liability


under the Lanham Act under a reverse passing off theory.


MR. GERBER:  If I may first distinguish reverse


passing off and then come back to Your Honor's question.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. GERBER:  Reverse passing off, in contrast,


is where Brand X for some reason -- the commercial


motivation is often hard to discern -- gets a legitimate


Rolex, removes the Rolex name and puts the Brand X name on


it.  Instead of passing its goods off as Rolex, it's


passing Rolex's goods off as its own.


I'm sorry, Justice O'Connor, I --


QUESTION:  Well, it's -- it's related to this. 


This is a so-called reverse passing off theory that the


Ninth Circuit is relying on.  Right?


MR. GERBER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And do you say there is no such thing


at all or do you acknowledge that there could be some


Lanham Act violation if there were some kind of


affirmative misrepresentation?


MR. GERBER:  Both.  Our -- our most ambitious

argument is none at all, and we do have as a less


ambitious argument the second.


QUESTION:  Indeed, the Solicitor General would


urge that we -- we not take the broader view.  Right?


MR. GERBER:  I don't believe so, from the


Solicitor General's brief.  And let me --


QUESTION:  Okay.  Well, we'll find out in a


minute.


(Laughter.)


MR. GERBER:  Yes.  I -- our view, which I


believe is shared by the Solicitor General, is that under


the particular statute in issue in this case, subsection


(a)(1)(A), reverse passing off is a no.


QUESTION:  Where -- where is that?  Let's --


let's look at the statute and talk about it. 

MR. GERBER:  It's on -- it's on page 2 of the


cert petition.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. GERBER:  And if I may present our most


sweeping argument, the language in particular in (a)(1)(A)


requires a designation as to the origin, sponsorship, or


approval of Dastar's goods by another person.  So that


would naturally cover the situation in which Dastar's


goods had the name of another person such as Fox on them,


but it would not cover the situation in which Dastar's

goods had its own name on them because of the by another


person language.  When Fox's name is on Dastar's goods --


and that is the normal passing off, forward passing off --


there is a designation that Fox sponsored Dastar's goods


or approved it or was the origin of it.  But you can --


QUESTION:  Now, I mean, that's -- that's one


reading of that.  I mean, you could say -- and maybe --


maybe it's the more natural reading -- that as to the


origin by another person means that some other person


originated it.  But it could mean as to the origin by


another person, if I represent that I originated it, okay,


when in fact another person originated it, I would be


making a misrepresentation as to the origin by another


person because I'm denying that that other person


originated it.  I'm saying that I did. 


Wouldn't that be a 

misrepresentation as to the origin by another person?


MR. GERBER:  I don't think -- the -- the latter


principle that Your Honor stated I think would be correct,


but I would suggest that it's not illustrated by the


example.


I think Your Honor is perhaps looking at the as


to language here.  And in our view what that means is that


a representation by Dastar that Fox did sponsor Dastar's


work or that Fox did not sponsor Dastar's work would be


covered.

 QUESTION:  Yes, either it did or did not. 


Either it did or did not.


MR. GERBER:  But neither of -- both of those are


in contrast to reverse passing off in which the offending


party is putting its own name on the work.  So that


doesn't help.


And the -- the other argument -- the other


construction, which is the only competitor on the table


here by respondents to --


QUESTION:  Well, excuse me.  Before you get


on --


MR. GERBER:  Excuse me, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  When -- when you put your own name on


it, aren't you denying that it was originated by somebody


else?


MR. GERBER:  You're not stating that it was


originated by another person, and that is the statutory


requirement.


QUESTION:  You're -- you're stating that it was


not.  You're saying that it was not originated by another


person.  And that seems to me it could be interpreted as


being a misrepresentation as to the origin by another


person.


MR. GERBER:  Well, I --

saying I did it.  Nobody else did it.  You -- you made


a -- well --


MR. GERBER:  Pardon me.  I -- I would rely on


the statutory distinction.  It's one thing to make a


representation that the wrongdoer is the originator, with


whatever implications that may have, and another to make a


misrepresentation which -- which seems down the middle of


the alley of the statutory language, that another person,


Fox, originated the work.


QUESTION:  Well, and is this affected at all by


the fact that the copyright had expired?  This was in the


public domain.


MR. GERBER:  Well --


QUESTION:  Is there some -- how does that affect


it? 


Can you put your own name on something that's now in 

the public domain?


MR. GERBER:  That, separate and apart from the


most sweeping argument we have, really goes to a number of


other attacks on what the lower court did.  The short


answer is you can if it is not likely --


QUESTION:  Mr. Gerber, I'd like to go back to


what the lower court did because I don't think that you


were accurate when you said in the view of the lower


court, this was a non-attribution case.  I'm looking at


page 53, and the court indeed does start out by saying

that defendants failed to identify the series, but then


there's a semicolon, and it goes on to say --


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  Where -- where is this? 


At what page -- what page are we on?


QUESTION:  53 -- 53a of the petition.


I'm questioning Mr. Gerber's characterization


that this case is simply a non-attribution one because


after the semicolon, it says why that was a problem. 


It's -- it gives the false impression that the series


contains only the work of those listed in the credits.  So


that was the problem that was central for the district


court, not simply a non-attribution, but an incorrect


attribution.  And I don't see how you can ignore that


clear statement by the district court.


MR. GERBER: 


Well, in the district court, if 

one is talking about the -- the wheat and the chaff, on


page 31a in which the district court introduces its


lengthy discussion, the statement is that the lawsuit is


based on defendant's distribution of a video series, which


plaintiffs claim is an infringement of the protected


material found in the book, and is an appropriation of the


television series, Crusade in Europe, without proper


credit.


Now, the reason I think that is the correct


interpretation of what the district court was doing --

 QUESTION:  Without proper credit could mean


improper credit, but when the court is developing that


point in full, it says there are two things.  It was the


failure to identify.  Why was that a violation of the


Lanham Act in the court's view?  Because it gave the false


impression that only those listed --


MR. GERBER:  Yes.  I would suggest that without


proper credit means what it says.  It doesn't mean


improper credit.  It means that the proper credits were


not affixed.


And then, of course, when you look at the Ninth


Circuit -- Circuit --


QUESTION:  It was an improper attribution case,


not simply a non-attribution case.  I'm simply questioning


your original characterization which I do not think pays 

attention to what the district court, in fact, said.


MR. GERBER:  I understand, Justice Ginsburg, but


again I would urge that without proper credit, that


phrase, is not a statement that there were improper


credits.  It's a statement that the proper credits were


absent.  And I would add that whatever ambiguity may lurk


in the district court's findings, it's quite clear that at


the Ninth Circuit level, which, of course, is what this


Court is reviewing, the case is a non-attribution case.


QUESTION:  The Ninth Circuit had a rather quick,

unpublished opinion --


MR. GERBER:  Correct.


QUESTION:  -- in this case.


MR. GERBER:  We agree with that.


QUESTION:  So it didn't tell us very much.


(Laughter.)


MR. GERBER:  If -- if I may turn just for a


moment to some of the -- to the question 2, the remedies


issue.  Here we would urge that the statutory language and


legislative intent, to the extent that it is pertinent,


coalesce.  Subject to the principles of equity, means


subject to the principles of equity.


This Court, while the Lanham Act was being


debated, applied equitable principles in an intellectual


property case to define the circumstances under which 

profits may be disgorged.  That's the Sheldon case.  And


it said equitable disgorgement of profits is permissible


only for restitutionary purposes, only to restore to


plaintiff something that he has lost.  That by definition


precludes a purely deterrent award which is not


restitutionary in the slightest.


If the Court has no further questions, I would


like to reserve my remaining time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Gerber.


Mr. Garre, we'll hear from you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. GARRE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The petitioner in this case did not make any


false designation as to the origin of its good, a


videotaped series on World War II, when it put its own


label on that good.  Petitioner manufactured the good at


issue in this case, the video series.  It produced it and


it and it distributed it to consumers.  Under this Court's


decisions interpreting the Lanham Act and under the Lanham


Act itself, petitioner is, therefore, the origin of the


good at issue at this case and is the source of that good


in the way that this Court has used that term. 

In 1990, Congress addressed the question of


artistic attribution and it addressed it in the -- in the


context of the copyright laws.  And it --


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  Before you go on,


suppose -- suppose they hadn't edited the -- the prior


Crusade in Europe thing at all.  They had not done


anything to it, didn't have a -- a new introduction,


didn't have the little snippets of addition that they had. 


However, they did, indeed, make the copies and they --


they made the -- the plastic cassette in which it was

inserted and so forth.


Would you take the position that -- that they


were the origin of that -- of that product and therefore


could represent that it was their product?


MR. GARRE:  We -- we would take that position,


Justice Scalia, and I think that -- that would be


consistent with the way this Court has consistently


interpreted the term origin, if you look at the Wal-Mart


case, the Qualitex case, and going back to the concurring


decisions in the Two Pesos, which is to refer to the


source of production or manufacture.


QUESTION:  Production not in the Hollywood sense


of production.


MR. GARRE:  Absolutely, and --


QUESTION: 


Production in the sense of I made 

this -- this physical article.


MR. GARRE:  That's correct, Justice Scalia.  And


that's -- of course, we encourage the intellectual


property laws, and this Court's decisions encourage firms


to go out and copy goods that come into the public domain. 


In the Court's recent TrafFix case --


QUESTION:  That's what this was, in the public


domain, was it not?


MR. GARRE:  That's correct.  The television --


QUESTION:  Do you think that this Dastar product

could have been copyrightable as a derivative work on its


own?


MR. GARRE:  We do think that it could be


copyrightable as a derivative work to the extent that it's


not subject to copyright protection.  Of course, the --


the original television series was subject to a copyright,


but that copyright expired in 1977 because respondent,


Twentieth Century Fox, failed to renew it.  And of course,


if -- if the respondent had renew it, one suspects that we


wouldn't be here today arguing about the -- an expansive


interpretation of the Lanham Act.


Now, Congress has addressed the -- the question


of artistic rights of attribution.  It did so in the


context of the copyright laws, and it did so very


carefully. 


It limited -- it recognized specific rights of 

artistic attribution in 1990, but it limited those rights


to a small class of visual arts, made them personal to the


author of those works, and limited the duration of the


life -- limited the duration of the -- the rights to the


life of the author.


In this case, the Ninth Circuit recognized a


general right of artistic attribution that is not limited


in time, that applies to a work, an audiovisual work, that


Congress specifically exempted from the scope of its 1990


legislation and that is not personal to the author of the

work, which in this case was Time Inc. who initially

QUESTION:  Now, is there -- is there no -- I


understand you're saying I say I produced this, all it


means is I produced this physical object.  But suppose in

this physical object.  That is, I'm using produced in the


Hollywood sense now.  Is there -- is there -- when in fact


I didn't.  I just did a little bit and most of it was done


by Fox.


MR. GARRE:  Well --


QUESTION:  Is there no remedy for that?  Because


that's what they say occurred here.  They -- they wouldn't


mind your just saying, you know, I -- I am the maker of 

this cassette or of this disk.  They wouldn't mind that. 


But -- but what happened was that on the disk it said I am


the artistic producer of this thing.  That's what they're


complaining about.  Now, is there no remedy for that when


they weren't?


MR. GARRE:  Two responses.  First, when they


labeled a good that they manufactured and produced as


their own good, they didn't make any false designation of


origin within the meaning of section (a)(1)(A) of the 


Lanham Act.

 Now, as we've discussed in our brief, section


(a)(1)(B) of the Lanham Act, which the respondents in this


case have never invoked and the courts below didn't


address, isn't limited to false designations of origin. 


It applies to false designations that misrepresent the


nature or qualities or characteristics of a good.


So the second type of description that Your


Honor characterized conceivably could fall within the


scope of section (a)(1)(B), but of course section


(a)(1)(B) was not raised in this case and it's also


limited to the context of commercial advertising and


protection.


The purpose of the Lanham Act and the trademark


laws -- and this is made clear in the definition of


trademark that appears at 15 U.S.C. 1127, is to ensure 

that firms identify and distinguish their goods in order


to prevent consumer confusion as to the source of goods.


QUESTION:  There isn't any general Federal


anti-lying law --


MR. GARRE:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- that you could get these people --


(Laughter.)


MR. GARRE:  No.  There's -- there's another


source, Justice Scalia, and we've mentioned in note 7 of


our brief, the Federal Trade Commission Act gives the

Federal Trade Commission authority to go out and address


deceptive or unfair trade practices.  But that statute too


isn't limited to false designations of origin.  Origin


doesn't even appear in that -- in that statute.  Origin


has --


QUESTION:  If I -- if I just read the -- the


label on the videotape and it says Campaigns in Europe and


it's identical to Crusades in Europe, and I want to sue


under (B) because I've just bought something that


duplicated what I bought last week, does the label


constitute commercial advertising or promotion?


MR. GARRE:  We haven't addressed that issue,


Justice Kennedy, and -- and there is some varying case law


on that.  I think most courts would probably answer that


question in the negative. 


Most courts have interpreted 

section (a)(1)(B) to refer to advertising in the print


ad --


QUESTION:  Well, then (B) doesn't -- doesn't


help and if -- if --


MR. GARRE:  Well, of course --


QUESTION:  -- in the case I put, the -- the hope


you hold out for us under (B) isn't -- isn't very


promising unless you're talking about sitting and reading


what comes on in -- in --


MR. GARRE:  Of course, advertising is often --

 QUESTION:  -- in the credits which no one ever


reads.


(Laughter.)


MR. GARRE:  Advertising is often associated with


the sale of products, but more importantly, (a)(1)(A) is


addressed -- it's intended to ensure that consumers can


look at a product and identify the source of that product


so if they do have complaints about the product, they can


go to that person.  And notably, in this case, no consumer


who has ever purchased petitioner's videos has registered


any complaint along the lines that Your Honor is


suggesting.  And if --


QUESTION:  Well, I'm -- I'm supposing a case,


and I thought you had indicated that (B) might cover it,


but there has to be some advertising other than what's 

on -- on the label.


MR. GARRE:  Under section (a)(1)(B), that's


correct, but I think that the important distinction


between (a)(1)(B) and (a)(1)(A) in this case with respect


to origin is that -- is that (a)(1)(A) is limited to


false designations of origin or as to sponsorship or


approval, and -- and the latter two elements, sponsorship


or approval, aren't addressed in -- in this case. 


(a)(1)(B) is much broader and -- and would include the


types of other representations that Your Honor is

concerned about.


And of course, all this we think goes back to


the notion that respondents seek artistic attribution for


their product.


QUESTION:  May I -- on that score, may I go back


to your answer to Justice O'Connor's question about the --


the possibility of copyright as derivative work?  Would


that copyright cover not only the new material, but all


the original material that they incorporated in?


MR. GARRE:  I believe that the copyright would


cover the new material.  And of course, the --


QUESTION:  So -- so that if they -- if they did


that, if they got that copyright, they then couldn't turn


around and sue for copyright infringement when the


original Crusade in Europe was -- was marketed by the 

others.


MR. GARRE:  I -- I think that's right.  We


haven't addressed that --


QUESTION:  Okay.  Okay.


MR. GARRE:  -- question in detail in our brief.


QUESTION:  But your -- in that case your -- your


understanding is that it's only the new material that


would be subject to copyright.


MR. GARRE:  Under the derivative work.


QUESTION:  Yes.

 MR. GARRE:  I believe that that's true.


But we think it's also important that when a


consumer buys the product in this case, a video -- a


package of videotapes on World War II, the consumer


doesn't purchase the intellectual property on those tapes. 


And that's the purpose of the FBI warning that appears at


the very beginning of -- of the tape.  The consumer


purchases a videotape series package and a copy of that


which it can view at home.  Nothing in the Lanham Act,


which is not an artistic credit statute, required the


petitioner in this case to provide any attribution to the


true creator of the television series that petitioner


initially copied.


QUESTION:  Or prevented him from -- prevented


them from making a misattribution. 
 You have to add that. 

MR. GARRE:  Well, we -- we think that -- that's


true with respect to authorship because we don't think


authorship or -- or the concept of invention is covered by


(a)(1)(A).


And, of course, the notion of attribution that


respondents would urge this Court to adopt this case would


have to apply to other types of goods like the sign stand


in the TrafFix case.  No one in TrafFix suggested that


petitioner could go out and reverse engineer and copy the


sign stand which had entered the public domain.  But that

when it did that, it had to go and give credit to


Marketing Displays, the firm that initially had the -- the


patent on that, or to the original inventor himself,


Robert Sarkisian.


Now --


QUESTION:  Mr. Garre, before you finish, there


was a reference in your brief that I didn't follow.  It


cropped up in another brief too, and it had -- it was a


reference to the Berne Convention.  Could you -- what is


the relevance of that international treaty to this -- to


this case?


MR. GARRE:  May I answer that question?


QUESTION:  Briefly.


MR. GARRE:  It is relevant in that it's an


international convention that -- that covers copyrights, 

but we explain our brief it -- we don't think that it


affects the analysis in this case because it -- as -- as


the Berne Convention Implementation Act states, it doesn't


expand or reduce existing rights under -- under domestic


law.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Garre.


MR. GARRE:  Thank you.


QUESTION:  Ms. Cendali, we'll hear from you.


QUESTION:  It's still too high.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DALE M. CENDALI


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MS. CENDALI:  Italians.


Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:


This is not a case about copying.  It's a case


about deception.  No one is disputing that someone has the


right to copy works when they're no longer protected by


copyright or patent, but as this Court has long recognized


in decisions like Bonita Boats, Sears, and Compco, that


doesn't give you the right to create consumer confusion in


how you label such works.


This, I should correct, is not a case about a


work that's actually in the public domain.  Since the


Ninth Circuit decision, as we've explained in our brief,


we retried the work for hire issue. 


The district court 

once again affirmed her previous summary judgment decision


that the work was work for hire.  So the underlying book


by General Eisenhower is, in fact, still protected by


copyright, though they intend to appeal.


In any case, here Dastar violated the Lanham Act


by advertising, packaging, titling, and crediting Crusade


in Europe in a manner intentionally designed to give the


false impression that it was an original product


originally created by it.  And Dastar knew, moreover, that


consumer confusion was likely.  Norman Andersen, Dastar's

President, admitted that a consumer would not be happy to


have purchased a copy of Campaigns if he or she already


had a copy of Crusade.


QUESTION:  But the -- the issue is whether the


Lanham Act creates a cause of action with respect to that


particular unhappiness.  What do you respond to the


contention that the word origin in this provision simply


means who manufactured it, not whose -- whose idea it was?


And to put it in -- it applies in a patent


context as -- as well.  You know these -- these vise grips


that you can have a pliers that will hold on automatically


until you release it.  Suppose the patent has -- has


expired on that, and I produce an identical copy of -- of


the vise grip and I sell it and I say, you know,


manufactured by Scalia. 


Do I have to say, oh, but it's 

not my idea?  I want you to know that, you know, Mr. Vise


Grip is the guy that -- that originally did it.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  I don't have to say that, do I?


MS. CENDALI:  Absolutely not, Your Honor, and


we're not urging that, but --


QUESTION:  And what if I say, and moreover it


was my original idea?  Would there be a cause of action


under the Lanham Act?


MS. CENDALI:  Yes, that would --

QUESTION:  Oh, my.


(Laughter.)


MS. CENDALI:  If you hold yourself out falsely


as the inventor of a product when you are not, that


creates liability under the Lanham Act.


QUESTION:  Why?  What does -- what does that


have to do with -- all right.  I don't see it.


QUESTION:  Why is it -- I mean, why is it Lanham


Act rather than Copyright Act?


MS. CENDALI:  Well, the Copyright Act just deals


with copying, people making copies of something and


selling it. 


The Lanham Act deals with deception, and 

that's what -- that's what this is.  It's not just that


they made the copies, but by crediting themselves as the


creator of Campaigns in Europe, they were able to jump


start their video business and to be able to then get all


the good will associated with that product and say, look,


we can make these videos --


QUESTION:  No.  I -- I realize that, but you


say, well, the Copyright Act is concerned with copying. 


It's -- it's concerned basically with -- with copying a


certain intellectual content.  That's what's -- that's

what they're trying to protect.


MS. CENDALI:  That's right.


QUESTION:  The Lanham Act, I thought, was not


trying to protect intellectual content.  It doesn't have


to.  There's another statute there.  The Lanham Act, I


thought, wanted to make it clear -- wanted producers to


make it clear who is at fault if somebody buys the product


and doesn't like it.  There's no deception here about


that, is there?  They know they're going to go to Dastar


and raise the devil if -- if they don't like it.  Isn't


that the point of the Lanham Act?


MS. CENDALI:  No, Your Honor.  For one thing, if


they don't like the content and they go to Dastar, they'll


have no one to talk to.


With regard to the purposes of the Lanham Act, 

as this Court has made clear in Inwood and in Qualitex --


QUESTION:  No, but they will have somebody to


talk to.  Dastar will say -- I'm assuming they are honest


people, and they will say, well, yes, we did that.  You --


MS. CENDALI:  But --


QUESTION:  -- you don't like the fact that we


copied this other stuff and said it was ours?  We're the


ones to blame.


MS. CENDALI:  But the purposes of the Lanham


Act, as this Court has made clear numerous occasions,

most -- very recently in Qualitex, is to let consumers be


able to know when they're getting a product, if they want


to get -- if they like it, they want to get other things


from that product -- from that supplier, they can.


QUESTION:  Dastar knows who to plagiarize.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  When -- when I see the Dastar name,


I'm getting good stuff.


(Laughter.)


MS. CENDALI:  Well -- well, Your Honor, you just


don't know whether the next person they plagiarize is


going to be as good as Twentieth Century Fox --


QUESTION:  That's why I'm relying -- yes, but


I'm relying on them.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  They -- they knew who to copy the


first time.  It seems to me that is just as much a -- a


guarantee that they'll know who to copy the next time, as


if they had made it themselves.


MS. CENDALI:  Well, the other problem with it,


beyond the fact that they are deprived, because you have


no idea whether the next time they copy will be as good as


the first time, you're also depriving the consumer of the


ability to end up buying two of the same product, a very


real possibility that they would recognize.

 QUESTION:  That's right, and they -- and they


can go to -- and they can go to Dastar and raise the


devil.  They said, you didn't tell us that you copied that


other thing.  We'll never buy Dastar again.  But they know


exactly who to blame.


MS. CENDALI:  They don't know who to blame


because if someone buys Campaigns and Crusade, they will


not know who cheated them.  They will not be able to tell. 


The products are lodged with the Court.  The Court can


look at them.  If you bought them both, if I bought my dad


one for Christmas and another one for him for his


birthday, he's not going to be happy to find he has


2 hours of the same -- two copies of the same 7-hour


videotape.  And in page 205 of the record, it's clear that


there are 7 hours of content in that.


QUESTION:  But the same point.  Why can't he sue


or you sue Dastar?


MS. CENDALI:  You wouldn't know who to sue.  And


maybe he also would think --


QUESTION:  You sue the person you bought it


from.


MS. CENDALI:  But it could have been Fox.  He


wouldn't have known who was the one telling the truth. 


Moreover, he also wouldn't know -- maybe he would think,


you know what?

 QUESTION:  Well, he can sue -- he can sue them


both and find out.


(Laughter.)


MS. CENDALI:  I don't know if that's -- that's


the -- the best way the law should deal with it.  Going


back to Justice Scalia's question, though, about origin,


there's nothing in the Lanham Act to suggest that Congress


wanted to limit the word origin to just the manufacture of


a product.


Now, in Justice Stevens' concurring opinion in


Two Pesos, he specifically noted that the term origin has


expanded over time from its original roots as denoting


geographic origin, a concept that's now in (a)(1)(B) of


the Lanham Act, to encompass origin of both source and


manufacture. 


So just by this Court's own opinion, source 

is something different from manufacture.


What is source?  Going back to Justice O'Connor


writing for the Court in Feist, in talking about origin,


originator, author, the common reading of what --


QUESTION:  Yes, but there is -- there is a sort


of an ambiguity or at least a debate over what the source


is.  I think your Traficante -- the -- the sign that stood


up well in the wind -- what obligation did the -- did the


second manufacturer have to say the idea was somebody


else's?

 MS. CENDALI:  Absolutely none.  They could --


QUESTION:  Why not?  Why isn't it the same case?


MS. CENDALI:  It's not at all the same case. 


But when you're -- because you're simply selling a


physical product -- if all Dastar did here was sell


Crusade in Europe as Crusade in Europe, it would be a


totally different case.  But what they did here is they


held themselves out as the maker of it, as the creator of


it.


QUESTION:  No, but they didn't hold themselves


out as the people who took all the pictures.  A lot of


them were secondhand pictures, you know, taken by news


photographers and all sorts of people.


MS. CENDALI:  They held themselves out by


putting their names and only their names on the credits, 

by -- by having a special thanks to the National Archives


right before their names, when they admitted they had no


contact -- contact with the National Archives with regard


to creating these products, by putting only a '95


copyright notice on it, by -- by listing only themselves


as producers.  The only conclusion one can reach --


QUESTION:  I don't -- I don't readily see the


difference between that and the sign situation.  The sign


manufacturer wants everybody to think what a brilliant


builder of signs he is.  He has a lot of other models in

his catalog.


MS. CENDALI:  But the sign manufacturer -- when


we deal with products, we don't normally think, when you


have a product, that someone is saying I invented this. 


We're accustomed to lots of people selling similar


products.  The commercial context is very different.


QUESTION:  Is what you're -- is what you're


saying that when you buy the books or the videotape,


you're buying it because you think it's going to be


different and you're disappointed when you find out that


it isn't.  With -- with TrafFix you know if it's a sign


that stands in the wind that --


MS. CENDALI:  Well, you're right, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  But that goes again to what I --


Justice Souter's initial line of questioning. 

I -- I


really think it's the major problem in the case for me.


QUESTION:  Yes, and --


QUESTION:  What you do is you sue the seller


Dastar -- Dastar -- for misrepresenting.


MS. CENDALI:  But --


QUESTION:  And -- and that Fox is not the


injured person.


MS. CENDALI:  I maybe can help you on that, Your

Act does not provide a cause of action for consumers.  So


if you -- if you posit the idea that consumers need to --


can sue Dastar if they're disgruntled, they cannot do that


under the Lanham Act.  The Lanham Act provides -- it's

 QUESTION:  I realize.


QUESTION:  Well, you know, I -- I -- this just


totally ignores the fact that it was in the public domain. 


I mean, of course, they had a right to copy it.  Why


didn't Fox renew the copyright if they wanted to do that?


MS. CENDALI:  Your Honor, they had --


QUESTION:  You wouldn't have all this trouble if


they had renewed the copyright.


MS. CENDALI:  There's -- there's no issue if


they simply copied it as Crusade in Europe and sold it as


Crusade in Europe.  There -- we would not be here on a


Lanham Act cause of action.  Our problem is, as we said in


our complaint at -- at paragraphs 12 and 22 I believe,


what they did was that they held themselves out as the


producers.


QUESTION:  No, but isn't the --


QUESTION:  Does someone have a right to go in


and take part of a previous work that's now in the public


domain and add original work to it and reissue it under


their name and get a derivative copyright for at least the


new part?  Now, is that authorized?


MS. CENDALI:  Yes, they absolutely can do


that --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. CENDALI:  -- but when you have a case like

this which is two courts have found it was a bodily


appropriation.  The only things they changed were to --


QUESTION:  -- the State court, we're talking


about the district court and the court of appeals in a --


MS. CENDALI:  That's right.


QUESTION:  -- a jurisdiction that has taken a


rather extreme view of what the Lanham Act protects. 


That's what we're reviewing.  I mean, there -- it -- it's


a means, it seems to me, of expanding copyright


protection.


MS. CENDALI:  Your Honor, I -- I really don't


think so because, again, they could have copied.  The


problem isn't with the copying.  The problem was the


taking credit for themselves.  Going back to the


misattribution point on page 21 of the cert petition and 

Justice -- Judge Cooper's description of her own summary


judgment decision, she says, by bodily appropriating the


Crusade series and falsely identifying themselves as


producers of Campaigns --


QUESTION:  How does the phrase, bodily


appropriation, fit into the Lanham Act?


MS. CENDALI:  I think it's designed as a -- as a


tool in reverse passing off cases where you're dealing


with products to help assess how similar those -- those


products are.

 To go back to --


QUESTION:  Certainly there's nothing like that


in the Lanham Act itself.


MS. CENDALI:  No, but -- but what it's trying to


do is to find a way of getting at the reverse passing off


problem.  The Lanham Act doesn't provide a particular way


of establishing confusion, deception, or --


QUESTION:  But what it -- what the Ninth Circuit


theory seems to me to do is to equate the likelihood of


consumer confusion with bodily appropriation.  Now, in --


in the case of the traffic sign, once there was no more


protection under law for that, some other manufacturer can


come in and sell it and produce it and that's a bodily


appropriation, all right, but it wasn't treated as


producing consumer confusion. 
 Why should this? 

MS. CENDALI:  I don't think it -- there would be


liability for TrafFix under the Ninth Circuit test because


it's not just bodily appropriation, but it's


misattribution.  And as I say, when you're just simply


saying I manufactured the product, you're not


misattributing it.  If Dastar said, Dastar -- I


manufactured and distributed this product, that would not


be reverse passing off.  They are allowed to credit


themselves for what they did.  They just cannot credit


themselves for what they didn't do.

 QUESTION:  What -- Ms. Cendali, how far back do


you go?  I mean, my problem with your interpretation of


the word origin -- it seems to me a very good cut-off


point means origin means who's selling it, who -- who


produced the physical thing.  Now, you -- you don't want


to limit it to that.  You want to say it also includes


what the physical thing contains if it's a -- if it's an


intellectual matter.


But why do you cut it off at the last copyright


owner?  I mean, suppose the cassette contained Carmen


Jones.  Okay?  Why -- why -- would I have to identify not


only whoever was the author of the derivative work, Carmen


Jones, Harry Belafonte -- I don't know who did it.  Would


I also have to identify Bizet as -- as the, you know,


the -- the author of the original idea, plus the unknown 

Frenchman who wrote the novel from whom Bizet got the --


got the idea?


MS. CENDALI:  Absolutely not, Your Honor. 


There --


QUESTION:  Why not?


MS. CENDALI:  Because --


QUESTION:  Why -- why do you arbitrarily say,


you know, you go back to the last copyright owner?


MS. CENDALI:  It has nothing to do with who is


the copyright owner or not.  It's distinct from copyright.

The issue is and the only issue a court needs to decide in


these cases is does the person claiming a credit for


themselves --


QUESTION:  Right.


MS. CENDALI:  -- was that accurate.  So if the


person --


QUESTION:  Okay.  But may I ask what difference


would it make if the person claiming the credit, instead


of claiming for himself, said, developed by an unknown


genius --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  -- when he knows it was developed by


you?  That would be equally misleading.  And would it be


covered?


it.


MS. CENDALI:  I'm -- I'm sorry. 


If --

QUESTION:  The representation is not I developed


MS. CENDALI:  Right.


QUESTION:  I know you developed it.  What I --


what I represent is it was developed by a brilliant third


party whose name I'm not going to disclose.  Would that be


also actionable?


MS. CENDALI:  I don't think so, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Why not?  It's the same -- it's the


same impact on you.  It fails to give you credit for what

you did.


MS. CENDALI:  But again, the issue isn't giving


us credit.  The -- the danger here is them taking the


credit, them taking it --


QUESTION:  Well, but what does it matter whether


they take the credit for themselves or -- or for Thomas


Edison or some third party that everybody assumes really


is the genius here?  It's false in both cases.


MS. CENDALI:  You're -- you're right.  If -- if


I understand what you're saying is if someone mislabels a


product in a false way as to what the origin of that


product is --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. CENDALI:  -- that is -- that I believe is


actionable under the Lanham Act, and I think it should be. 

QUESTION:  Even you didn't have a copyright. 


And that would apply even if you had no copyright on the


product, just -- just --


MS. CENDALI:  Copyright really has nothing to do


with -- with this case.  They're separate causes of action


for separate purposes --


QUESTION:  Does it have to be a deliberate or


could be a mistake?  Suppose the person thought the third


party did it and he was wrong.  He said this was really


written by William Shakespeare and it was written by Joe

Smith.  Would that also be actionable?


MS. CENDALI:  If it was -- if it was a mistake,


it may be false or misleading, but there wouldn't be


any -- the damage is likely to be very different if there


was a mistake.


QUESTION:  Why wouldn't the damage be exactly


the same?  You didn't get credit for something you


developed.


MS. CENDALI:  But again, it's not the -- to go


back, Your Honor, it's not the giving us credit.  It's


simply the injury lies from someone taking the credit for


themselves, for a company such as Dastar with no


experience in the video business to suddenly in 3 months,


at the investment of $4,000, be able to produce a 7-hour


video tape that it can represent to the world and use to 

jump start its video business and sell 150 other boxed


sets in competition with our client.


QUESTION:  Well, that's certainly -- it may be


unfair competition, but I'm not sure that it has anything


to do with confusion.


Let me -- may I ask you a different kind of


question?  I thought, in answer to a question I put to you


earlier, that you might be suggesting -- you did not come


out and say it, but I thought you might be suggesting that


there would be a different kind of analysis, depending on

whether we were talking about an object like the sign on


the two springs, on the one hand, and an object with


intellectual content on the other.


You said to me -- I -- I said, you know, they --


if they don't like what they get, they will know that


Dastar is to blame.  And your answer was, no, they won't 


because they won't know whether Dastar copied or Fox or


Fox copied Dastar.  And therefore Fox will suffer because


there is confusion and Fox will get hurt.  And -- and that


seems to be a distinction based on the fact that you're


buying intellectual content as opposed simply to buying a


sign that either stays up or it doesn't stay up.  Is -- is


that an argument that -- that you would make?


MS. CENDALI:  Well, yes, in part, in the sense


that certainly when someone buys a creative work knowing 

the author is important to the person.  If you like a Tom


Clancy novel, you'll buy another Tom Clancy novel.


QUESTION:  No, but I mean, that's important to


me, but I thought your argument was that the original


producer is -- is, in fact, going to be hurt by the


confusion because maybe the original producer will be


blamed for the fact that there are these two identical


intellectual products on the market.


MS. CENDALI:  Yes.  That's exactly right.


QUESTION:  All right.  Now, what happens in the

case -- what would happen in the case in -- in which we --


we start out with -- with Fox marketing its -- its series


and they call it Crusade in Europe, just -- just as


they -- they labeled the original TV program, and Dastar


comes out with a -- with a series which is identical to


it, again, copyright has expired?  Dastar comes out with a


series that is identical to it and calls it War and simply


says at the bottom of -- of the cassette, cassette


manufactured by Dastar.  Is there a Lanham Act violation


then?  There is no claim that Dastar produced anything. 


Is there a Lanham Act violation then?


MS. CENDALI:  There would not be a false


designation of origin claim under (a)(1)(A).  It's --


because -- because Dastar is not representing itself to be


the -- the creator. 


It's accurately just simply listing 

itself --


QUESTION:  But the consumer would be just as mad


and -- I suppose, and there would be a danger even in the


second case of Fox being blamed for the identity of these


two products.


MS. CENDALI:  But there might -- there would be,


however, I believe in that scenario a claim under


(a)(1)(B) of the Lanham Act for falsely describing the


nature of the product.  As -- as the cases cited in our


brief --

 QUESTION:  No, but in my second example, they


didn't falsely describe it.  They just said, cassette


produced by Dastar.


MS. CENDALI:  Only -- that was true from the


purposes of origin, and I'm saying there wouldn't be an


origin claim.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. CENDALI:  But with regard to the title, for


the reasons discussed in the Second Circuit cases, the new


American Library cases, when someone comes up with a


creative work, and puts a title on it, inherent in that


use is the idea that -- that this --


QUESTION:  Any change in title is therefore a


deception.


MS. CENDALI: 


It -- it -- that's what those 

cases said, so to the --


QUESTION:  It's a deception in the sense that


it's an implicit denial of the identity.


MS. CENDALI:  That's right --


QUESTION:  Yes, okay.


MS. CENDALI:  -- and so therefore, I think that


would be a separate issue.  And that's why as consumers,


we all know when we look at a book and we check to see,


you know, if it was the same Agatha Christie book


published under a different title.  And that's an example

where disclaimers are not very difficult for people to


deal with in -- in reality, and something that consumers


all can expect.


QUESTION:  Ms. Cendali, could you describe to us


precisely what it is that Dastar could represent?  It has


this cassette that it's selling, and you said that they


can't say produced by Dastar and not say Fox.  What


exactly could they say?  You don't question that they


could copy word for word what's in the public domain.  In


packaging it, what could they say?


MS. CENDALI:  Probably the easiest thing for


them to have done would have been to have copied it down


to the last iota of the frame and simply called it and


said, manufactured and distributed by Dastar.  That would


not have been a problem under the Lanham Act or the -- or 

the Copyright Act if -- but for the fact that the work is


not truly in public domain.


If they had want -- they could have also said,


new credits created by Dastar.  They could have accurately


credited themselves for that.


They could have chosen not to credit anybody. 


There's no requirement of credit.


Or they could have given credit to everyone. 


They could have listed the original creditors and they


could have -- creators, and they could have added their

name on it.


All of these things they could have done which


would have protected the consumer.  The consumer would


have known what he or she was getting and also not usurped


for themselves unjustly in an unjust enrichment way the


good will to which they do not deserve.  This is --


QUESTION:  You haven't had time to address the


damages aspect of it, and if you're right that what went


wrong here was not the copying -- they were free to


copy --


MS. CENDALI:  Absolutely, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Then -- and the only thing that was


wrong was that they -- the attribution of creator.


MS. CENDALI:  The misattribution, yes, Your


Honor.


QUESTION:  Why should they get the profits of


Dastar when -- when all they did wrong -- I mean, did --


copying the pages, copying the cassettes was fine.  It


seems to me to -- to have that large disgorgement of


damages is a misfit.


MS. CENDALI:  For several reasons, Your Honor. 


First, the -- what they -- the disgorgement is the normal


remedy in cases like this because it's very difficult to


establish actual damages of -- of any type.


The statute is premised and works this way.

You -- you establish your entitlement to profits.  In


other words, the plaintiff just simply, once they show


liability, needs to show what their -- that they are --


what the sales were, and then the burden is on Dastar to


come forward and establish what -- what deductions should


be from that.  Deductions have included the ability to


argue apportionment, that only some of the sales should be


attributed to the infringement, for example.


QUESTION:  Yes, but can I interrupt with --


with -- you got double profits in this case, didn't you?


MS. CENDALI:  Yes, we did.  The court had --


QUESTION:  And wasn't the theory of that to


deter new violations, which I find strange when there's an


injunction against new violations.


MS. CENDALI: 


No, but -- but the issue here is 

the -- they -- this was undisputed.  This was the first of


150 videos.  And as Judge Posner in the Louis Vuitton


opinion, discussed in our brief, discusses the enhanced


damages, and, in fact, damages of any type, are


particularly proper in cases such as this where there's a


risk of surreptitious infringement.  And it's not easy to


detect reverse passing off.


You could easily have a situation where someone


would rather -- a rational, economic actor would rather


lose the profits on a particular item if -- if they can

get their entire stream of -- of business going forward. 


This is just such a case because this was their first


video.  They -- they were able to use this to get instant


legitimacy in the video business, and get -- the injury to


us isn't just with regard to this product, but the injury


for us is the entire future diversion of sales that


they've been able to get by suddenly using Twentieth


Century Fox's work to march into the video business and


get profits time immemorial.


That is why Congress has enacted the kind of


damages provisions it has under the Lanham Act which I


think are singularly suited for just this type of case


where it's difficult to show actual damages in any given


way.


I'll note, though, that the court in our case 

did specifically find that we did suffer actual damages


and they did not appeal from that.  The -- the record


is -- is clear and they're bound with it, that we lost


sales and that we also lost good will.  They have not


appealed from that.  The court did not quantify that in


any way, but the court then went on to award us profits


and, in her discretion, to award us double profits.  She


was using her discretion.  She could have awarded treble


profits, but she chose in the -- in the principles of


equity to make a rational decision as befitting the facts

of this case.


And I -- she also had the opportunity, after a


damages trial, to see the demeanor in each of everyone of


the witnesses and to assess the credibility of their


various statements, and I'm sure she factored that into


her analysis as well.


And I think that the award should be upheld and


we hope that the Court will affirm summary judgment.  I


note that even though the Ninth Circuit opinion was -- was


short, given the fact it was a summary unpublished


opinion, my understanding is that this Court has de novo


review and has the ability, if it so chooses, to affirm


the district court's opinion on any fact in the record.


We think that the record amply supports the fact


that there was reverse passing off here. 


It is a cause of 

action.  I'm not aware of any court to ever suggest a


reading of the Lanham Act that reads reverse passing off


out of the Lanham Act the way that the Solicitor General


and Dastar urges here.  I'm not aware of a single court to


ever make that suggestion.  It just doesn't make sense in


light of the plain language of the Lanham Act.  It doesn't


make sense in light of the fact that, as this Court again


has recognized in Two Pesos, the '88 amendments were only


designed to codify existing law.  They weren't entitled --


intended to make any change, and there was absolutely no

suggestion anywhere that anyone ever thought that reverse

QUESTION:  Did the disclaimer or the


acknowledgement have to be on the package or just in the


forewords -- or on the film, just in the screen credits?


MS. CENDALI:  The disclaimer -- I'm sorry, Your


Honor.


QUESTION:  If -- if Dastar had done what you say


they're required to do, would it have sufficed if they put


the information just on the screen credits, or does it


have to be on the package that the consumer buys?


MS. CENDALI:  Well, I think it -- probably on


the package the consumer buys it should have said,


manufactured and distributed by Dastar.


QUESTION: 


But -- and if it's not on the 

package, then there's --


MS. CENDALI:  And --


QUESTION:  -- then there's a cause of action


even if it's on the screen credits?


MS. CENDALI:  No.  I think that if the


credits -- if our credits are on the inside and not on the


outside, they wouldn't need to put a disclaimer probably


on the -- on the outside.  In other words --


QUESTION:  But the buyer doesn't -- the buyer


has already bought it by the -- I mean, the screen

(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  No one -- no one looks at --


MS. CENDALI:  Well, that -- well, that's why the


outer packaging has to be correct.  All I'm saying is that


if they simply put on the outer packaging manufactured and


distributed by Dastar, they wouldn't need to have a


disclaimer.  If on -- if on the inside they were doing


something different, or if they --


QUESTION:  Again, I -- I'm bothered.  It doesn't


seem to me this is for the protection of the consumer at


all.  I -- I understand what you're telling me about the


act.


MS. CENDALI: 


Well, again, you know, as this 

Court in Qualitex and other decisions have said, a


consumer -- and Colgate-Palmolive -- has the right to know


when they buy something, even if it's a capricious reason,


you know, who they're getting it from and they should have


the right to base their future purchasing decisions based


on accurate information.  Here Dastar took that right from


the consumer.  A consumer, if they liked Campaigns in


Europe, they may go out --


QUESTION:  Yes, but if that's right, there's a


duty to disclose the true producer then.  That's your

position.


MS. CENDALI:  No.  You would think it could be,


but it doesn't have to be.


QUESTION:  Well, if you're saying they have a


right to know that, there must be a duty to disclose.


MS. CENDALI:  No.  Only that they had the right


not to know what's false.  In other words, the law could


go so far --


QUESTION:  Well, that's a very lesser right than


the one you were just describing --


MS. CENDALI:  I appreciate that, but -- but


at -- at a minimum a consumer should not have false


information.


And again, as I come back to where I started,


that's what this is about. 


These videos have been lodged 

with the Court.  I invite the Court to -- to look at them. 


And you will see how deceptive they are on the inside and


on the outside and how going back to the -- my -- the


father getting the -- the Christmas and birthday presents


that are identical, which is a very real possibility, that


is not a happy situation for the consumer.  Congress put


in the competitor the -- the private attorney general role


to stop it.


And I note, moreover, that this was very


targeted act -- misconduct on their part.  Before they

released Campaigns in Europe, they saw in a video catalog


that Crusade in Europe in a boxed set was for sale.  They


didn't care.  They targeted the competition and they


continued.


Thank you.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Cendali.


Mr. Gerber, you have 5 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. GERBER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. GERBER:  I have two short points.


Number one, Ms. Cendali contends that there is


no textual support in the section of the Lanham Act at


issue, 41(a)(1)(A), supporting our and the SG's


interpretation of origin and excluding the authorship


concept.  I would suggest that she's wrong.


The textual support is the word origin.  Unlike


the Copyright Act, which uses the word author, the Patent


Act, which uses the word inventor, the Lanham Act uses a


different word and the word is origin.  And that is


completely in accord with this Court's jurisprudence.  I


think perhaps as Justice Souter had suggested, the -- the


purpose from a policy perspective is to render efficient


purchasing decisions, as this Court stated in Qualitex.


QUESTION:  And you -- you would stand by that


for forward --

 MR. GERBER:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  -- causes of action --


MR. GERBER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- as well as -- as well as reverse.


MR. GERBER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  So that if I sold a cassette that I


physical manufactured and I advertised it as being Carmen


Jones, the original MGM production, and in fact it was The


Capitol Steps, there wouldn't be any -- there wouldn't be


any Lanham Act cause of action.


MR. GERBER:  I think that is forward passing


off.  I may be --


QUESTION:  That's what I'm saying.  That's


forward passing off, and you would say that since origin


means what you say it means, I've manufactured the piece 

of plastic, there's no -- there's no cause of action under


the Lanham Act.


MR. GERBER:  Oh, excuse me.  Yes.


QUESTION:  I mean, he who says A must say B,


right?


MR. GERBER:  The -- the answer under the


specific, myopic section we're looking at that it is


correct.  That would not be assertable.


It would be redressable under, arguably,


subsection (B) and we may differ from the SG with respect

to commercial advertising and promotion and whether a


point of sale labeling qualifies.


And under a lot of consumer protection statutes


in the States as well as the Federal Trade Act, the -- the


second point that I promised responds, I believe, to


Justice O'Connor.  I wanted to add to the answer to the


question yes, this would be a copyrightable derivative


work, the observation that the copyright defines proper


credits for derivative works.  It tells owners of


derivative works who may be designated as the copyright


proprietor, and the law there is that the owner of a


derivative work, such as Dastar, may use its name.  It


doesn't have to refer to the names of owners of


preexisting works.  So what we have with the suggestion of


respondents is a kind of dual series of credits, proper 

credits under the Copyright Act, and then authorial


credits.


I -- I would suggest another example in response


to Justice Scalia's question, it can become quite


burdensome.  You know, for a very highly complex,


iterative product like a car, you might have 300 pages of


credits in the owner's manual before you even get to how


do you turn on the key under the alternative universe of


credits that is completely different from the derivative


work credits required by the Copyright Act.

 Unless the Court has further questions, then --


QUESTION:  Well, if you have a minute, would you


address Ms. Cendali's argument that there is significance


when a product has intellectual content and there is


duplication because then the confusion may very well,


indeed, redound to the -- to the original -- to the


originator of the product?  The consumer doesn't know who


to blame, so the originator of the product may well be


hurt.  What is your response to that argument?


MR. GERBER:  I'm not sure I -- I'm recalling the


example completely.  If I get it, the consumer does know


who to blame.  It has the --


QUESTION:  No.  Her -- her point is you got --


you got two sets of videos out.  One has got Dastar on it


saying, in effect, it's ours. 


The other one has got 

Crusade in Europe saying Fox.  The consumer is mad because


the consumer has both.  The consumer doesn't know who to


blame, so the consumer blames both.  What's the response


to that argument?


MR. GERBER:  I'm not sure I will buy into that


consequence.  Where both parties state their names as


manufacturer, the consumer could be quite happy.  He could


say Dastar's cost one-fifth of what Fox's did and


recommend it to all of his friends.  So while there might


be confusion in the literal sense, it might actually be


56 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005 

salutary.  And the efficiency of that type of consumer


decision is really what putting the name of the


manufacturer on enables the consumer to do.  It renders


the transactions efficient.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Gerber.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:56 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
