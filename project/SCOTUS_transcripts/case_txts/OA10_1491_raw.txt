(10:02 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 10-1491, Kiobel v. Royal 
Dutch Petroleum. 

Mr. Hoffman. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL HOFFMAN 
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. HOFFMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The principal issue before this Court is the 

narrow issue of whether a corporation can ever be held 
liable for violating fundamental human rights norms 
under the Alien Tort Statute.  Under Respondents' view, 
even if these corporations had jointly operated torture 
centers with the military dictatorship in Nigeria to 
detain, torture, and kill all opponents of Shell's 
operations in Ogoni, the victims would have no claim. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But, counsel, for me, the 

case turns in large part on this:  Page 17 of the red 
brief says, "International law does not recognize 
corporate responsibility for the alleged offenses here"; 
and the -- one of the -- the amicus brief for Chevron 
saying "No other nation in the world permits its court 
to exercise universal civil jurisdiction over alleged

extraterritorial human rights abuses to which the nation 
has no connection." 

And in reading through the briefs, I was 
trying to find the best authority you have to refute 
that proposition, or are you going to say that that 
proposition is irrelevant? 

MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, there -- there are a 

couple of questions within that. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And it's -- it involves 

your whole argument, of course. 

MR. HOFFMAN:  It does.  Yes. 
(Laughter.) 
MR. HOFFMAN:  And -- and let me start by 
saying that the international human rights norms that 
are at the basis of this case for the plaintiffs --
crimes against humanity, torture, prolonged arbitrary 
detention, and extrajudicial executions -- all of those 
human rights norms are defined by actions.  They're not 
defined by whether the perpetrator is a human being or a 
corporation or another kind of entity. 

And so, I think that the -- the Respondents 
are wrong when they say that international law does not 
extend to -- to those kinds of acts.  They do -- it 
does.  And the United States agrees with that position. 

What they have tried to -- to conflate is 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

the question about whether international law -- the 
international law norms apply to a corporation or a 
person with whether there's a -- an international 
consensus with respect to how those norms should be 
enforced, particularly within domestic civil 
jurisdiction as opposed to criminal jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But in -- in the area of 
international criminal law, which is just analogous, I 
recognize, there is a distinction made between 
individuals and corporations. 

MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, there's a distinction 

made within the jurisdiction of certain modern 
international criminal tribunals.  And Respondents take 
their position too far in this, because what they've 
said is that the fact that corporations can't be found 
liable criminally under the International Criminal 
Court, for example, means that the norms, the underlying 
norms -- genocide, crimes against humanity, and war 
crimes when it comes to the International Criminal 
Court -- don't apply to corporations. 

And that's clear -- that clearly is wrong because 

the United Kingdom and Netherlands, for example, the two 
home countries of -- of these corporations has passed 
domestic implementing legislation that imposes criminal 
penalties for violations of those very norms.  So,

there's no question that it can be done. 

What the most important -- I think one of 

the most important principles in this case is that 
international law, from the time of the Founders to 
today, uses domestic tribunals, domestic courts, and 
domestic legislation, as the primary engines to enforce 
international law. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Hoffman --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You began by --

by --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Hoffman, I -- I 

thought that Justice Kennedy asked you, is there another 
nation that has a counterpart to 1350 that imposes civil 
liability on corporations for violations of customary 
international law, where the conduct occurred abroad, 
the harmed person is employed, and the defendant is not 
a U.S. resident? 

MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, the -- there are two 

parts to -- to my answer to that.  One is that the Alien 
Tort Statute is a -- is a unique way of enforcing the 
law of nations, in terms of the way that the Founders 
married tort law and violations of the law of nations. 

In the international human rights amicus 
brief, the amicus brief of international human rights 
organizations, at pages 18 to 22, there's a whole series

of cases where the domestic courts and domestic 
legislation of various states around the world have 
addressed those kinds of issues.  And so, there isn't an 
exact analogue to the Alien Tort Statute, but there's no 
question that domestic legislation and domestic courts 
have taken on these kinds of issues. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, there's no particular 

connection between the events here and the United 
States.  So, I think the question is whether there's any 
other country in the world where these plaintiffs could 
have brought these claims against the Respondents. 

MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, let me address the -- I 

think this comes under the general rubric of 
extraterritoriality. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Is there a yes or no answer 

to that question or not? 

MR. HOFFMAN:  I believe that they -- that 

the answer to that would be "yes." 
JUSTICE ALITO:  Where? 
MR. HOFFMAN:  I think that they could be 

brought in Holland or the United Kingdom for events in 
Nigeria.  I think that the cases that are discussed as 
those --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Any other country other than 

the country of the citizenship of the defendants?

MR. HOFFMAN:  I don't know if this precise 

case could be brought.  I know that the -- we have a 
principle of transitory torts, and so, one -- and I 
believe other countries have that principle as well. 
So, in terms of the underlying tort action, we have 
plaintiffs who are U.S. residents and were U.S. 
residents when they filed this case.  They found a 
tortfeasor within the United States that they believe 
was responsible for these torts.  And from Mostyn v. 
Fabrigas and before, Mostyn v. Fabrigas being the 1774 
case by Lord Mansfield talking about transitory torts, 
the courts clearly have the jurisdiction to adjudicate 
those kinds of tort claims. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If -- if there is no 

other country where this suit could have been brought, 
regardless of what American domestic law provides, isn't 
it a legitimate concern that allowing the suit itself 
contravenes international law? 

MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, that -- that issue has 
been raised in a number of the briefs.  I would say two 
things:  One is that that doesn't really go to the 
question about whether corporations can be categorically 
excluded from Alien Tort Statute coverage, which is 
really the issue that -- that was decided by the court 
below and which was the question presented here.

Extraterritoriality has to do with a different kind of 
issue.  I would argue that -- I mean, we've obviously 
argued that that's an issue that ought to be briefed on 
its own. 

But there is no international law principle 

that I am aware of, and I think it would need to be 
proved, that says that the United States Congress was 
disempowered at its founding from providing these kinds 
of tort remedies.  And it was clear from the founding 
that the Founders at least believed that this statute 
would be extraterritorial. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it was 

motivated, I gather, by assaults on ambassadors here 
within the United States. 

MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, it was motivated by the 

Marbois incident and a similar incident to -- with 
regard to a Dutch ambassador in New York at the time of 
the Constitutional Convention.  But if -- if the Court 
looked to the Bradford incident -- the incident about 
which Attorney General Bradford expressed his opinion in 
1795, which was an opinion that this Court found very 
important in terms of interpreting the Alien Tort 
Statute, the Bradford opinion had to do with an assault 
on the British colony in Sierra Leone.  And so, it was 
not only extraterritorial in the sense of piracy, and I

think everybody agrees that -- that this statute was 
intended to deal with piracy and maritime-related 
violations of the law of nations. 

It -- the Bradford opinion there said, even 
though U.S. criminal jurisdiction was limited, the civil 
jurisdiction under the Alien Tort Statute provided that 
the corporation that -- whose property was attacked 
within the territory of Sierra Leone --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Have all the judges who have 
interpreted that opinion interpreted it the way you just 
did? 

MR. HOFFMAN:  The Bradford opinion? 
JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes. 
MR. HOFFMAN:  I'm not sure in which sense. 

I mean, the -- yes, the -- I think that the Bradford 
opinion has been used --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what did -- how did 

Judge Kavanaugh interpret that on the D.C. Circuit? 
MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, I think -- I don't 

recall specifically.  I know that there has been some 
controversy about whether that was an attack in the high 
seas.  I know there's some scholarship about that.  What 
I would suggest to the Court, if the Court went back to 
the original documents that the -- that were sent to 
Attorney General Bradford which -- from the British 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

government, I think the Court would find that -- that 
this attack actually took place in the territory of 
Sierra Leone. 

And so, one of the reasons that we've 

suggested that -- that -- that the extraterritoriality 
issue deserves full treatment if the Court is troubled 
by it, in a case where there is full briefing, because 
in this case it was raised by the -- by -- by the 
Respondents' amici largely, although the Respondents 
have raised it, and there -- the historians that have 
expressed opinions on corporate liability and others 
that would be interested in this question have not been 
able to put the other side before the Court. 

And I think there's a very -- there are 

very --

JUSTICE ALITO:  The first statement – the first 

sentence in your brief in the statement of the case is really 
striking:  "This case was filed ... by twelve Nigerian 
plaintiffs who alleged ... that Respondents aided and abetted the 
human rights violations committed against them by the 
Abacha dictatorship ... in Nigeria between 1992 and 
1995."  What does a case like that -- what business does 
a case like that have in the courts of the United 
States? 

MR. HOFFMAN:  Well --

JUSTICE ALITO:  There's no connection to the 

United States whatsoever. 

The Alien Tort Statute was enacted, it seems 

to be -- there seems to be a consensus, to prevent the 
United States -- to prevent international tension, to --
and -- does this -- this kind of a lawsuit only creates 
international tension. 

MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, the Alien -- if I could 

start with the second part first.  The Alien Tort 
Statute certainly was passed to do that but also as an 
expression of the Nation's commitment to international 
law, I think primarily as a -- as a statement of this 
country's commitment to international law as a new 
member of the community of nations.  And if -- if you 
look at the incidents like the Marbois incident --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you really that think the 

first Congress wanted victims of the French Revolution 
to be able to sue in -- in the court -- to sue French 
defendants in the courts of the United States? 

MR. HOFFMAN:  I think that what -- I think 
the question would have been, is there a law of nations 
violation?  For example, in the Marbois incident, say 
the -- Marbois was -- was attacked by Longchamps outside 
the United States, but Longchamps came to take refuge in 
the United States, and the French government said you

have somebody living in your country that has attacked 
our ambassador in violation of the law of nations. 

I think the United States -- I think the 

same principle -- the United States would have wanted to 
do something for the French government in response to 
that because it would have been giving refuge to someone 
who had violated the law of nations.  And -- and the 
same principle has been applied in the modern era to --
to giving no safe haven to torturers and others. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That sounds --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Hoffman, could I --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That sounds very much 

like Filartiga.  And I thought that -- that Sosa 
accepted that Filartiga would be a viable action under 
the Tort Claims Act.  So, I thought what we were talking 
about today, the question was, is it only individual 
defendants or are corporate defendants also liable? 

MR. HOFFMAN:  A lot of the 

extraterritoriality issues would apply to the cases that 
this Court endorsed in Sosa. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I agree that we can 

assume that Filartiga is a binding and important 
precedent, it’s the Second Circuit.  But in that case, 
the only place they could sue was in the United States. 
He was an individual.  He was walking down the streets

of New York, and the victim saw him walking down the 
streets of New York and brought the suit. 

In this case, the corporations have 

residences and presence in many other countries where 
they have much more -- many more contacts than here. 
MR. HOFFMAN:  And those issues, generally 
speaking, are resolved by other doctrines, rather than 
an exclusion of corporations categorically from the 
statute. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You went -- can I go back 

to -- are you finished with that answer?  Because I want 
you to finish. 

MR. HOFFMAN:  I was -- the only thing I was 
going to add to that is that a doctrine like forum non 
conveniens or personal jurisdiction would deal with the 
issues about whether this is the most appropriate forum. 
And those doctrines apply whether it's an Alien Tort 
Statute case or it's a -- a common law tort case. 

These plaintiffs could bring this case in 

State court.  What the Alien Tort Statute does is 
provide a Federal forum when these torts are in 
violation of the law of nations.  And that's really what 
it -- what the Founders intended and what -- and what it 
does. 

I'm sorry.

clarification on the first question that Justice Kennedy

ahead.  You want to reserve your time.  I can find the 
answer --

MR. HOFFMAN:  Okay.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The court of appeals erred in its 

categorical ruling that a corporation may never be held 
liable under the Alien Tort Statute regardless of the 
nature of the norm, the locus of the wrong, or the 
involvement of the state. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Kneedler, could you 
explain to me the -- the difference between respondeat 
superior liability and corporate liability?  In -- in

the briefs, there seems to be an assumption that 
respondeat superior liability is -- is permissible, and 
the only issue is whether corporate liability is.  Is 
there a difference between the two doctrines? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I think the difference 
is really a matter of degree.  I mean, under respondeat 
superior liability, a corporation is normally 
responsible, liable for the acts of its agents. 

Judge Posner, in the Seventh Circuit Flomo 

decision, suggested that in the nature -- in this 
category of cases, assuming that the ATS would allow a 
common law cause of action for conduct in another 
country, that maybe there should be more limited 
respondeat superior principles because the action would 
occur in circumstances were the corporation sought to be 
held liable may not have much -- much control over it. 

Where the corporation itself is liable --

and this would be true in criminal law and presumably in 
-- in tort law -- would usually require some action by 
those responsible for running the corporation or high 
enough up the chain of command --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Kneedler, when 

you --

MR. KNEEDLER:  -- that policy --

MR. KNEEDLER:  I'm sorry. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  When you say in your brief 

that we should look at this as a remedial question, as a 
question of enforcement, do you say that because you're 
thinking of this as a vicarious liability case?  In 
other words, there's an individual person who clearly 
has violated a norm of international law, and then the 
question of whether to hold the corporation liable is an 
enforcement question.  Or would you say that it's also 
an enforcement question when we're talking about direct 
corporate liability? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I think it's both. 

Particularly the latter, but I think the former as well. 
As Mr. Hoffman said, international law norms proscribe 
certain conduct, but the enforcement of that is left to 
each nation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but -- but I find it 

difficult to understand why we -- we would not hold 
foreign sovereigns liable under this Act, that they're 
excluded despite -- despite its language; and yet, we 
cannot inquire whether persons other than sovereigns are 
covered.  What is -- what is the distinction between the 
two? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, with respect to 

sovereigns, a sovereign could not be held liable for --

at least for conduct outside the United States, because 
of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.  That's --
that's what this Court held in the Amerada Hess case. 
Within the United States, if the foreign sovereign 
committed a tort, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, 
subject to certain limitations, would allow --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I think, Mr. Kneedler --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  This is more specific than 
the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.  It deals with a 
much more narrow category of case.  And I do not think 
that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act would be 
interpreted to eliminate the sovereign's liability, if 
indeed this statute provided for it. 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, the court in Amerada 
Hess did hold that, that -- and it made an important --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes. 
MR. KNEEDLER:  It made a point that is 

important to this case as well.  It said that while the 
Alien Tort Statute identifies who the plaintiff must 
be -- the plaintiff must be an alien -- it does not 
identify who the defendant may be, and that if there are 
limitations on who the defendant may be from other 
sources of law, and foreign sovereign immunity would be 
one of them, then the suit could not go forward against 
the foreign sovereign.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Kneedler, in Sosa, 
and this is the footnote 20, we said that the question 
of whether you were a state actor or not a state actor 
might be relevant to the question of whether there was a 
substantive norm that applied to you. 

And I guess the question here is why that 
same analysis doesn't apply to the question of whether 
there is corporate liability?  In other words, is there 
a substantive norm that applied to corporations?  Maybe 
there is; maybe there isn't.  But that that's the 
question, as opposed to what you suggest in your brief, 
that really we should just think of this as a question 
of enforcement, which is entirely up to Federal common 
law.  And I guess the question is why think of it as 
enforcement rather than as a substantive obligation? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, first looking at 

footnote 20 in -- in Sosa, it -- what the footnote says, 
that a related consideration, meaning related to whether 
the particular norm satisfies the criteria in Sosa, is 
whether international law extends the scope of liability 
for a violation of a given norm to the perpetrator being 
sued.  If the defendant is a private actor such as a 
corporation or individual --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, I'm not saying footnote 

20 --

MR. KNEEDLER:  Right. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  It addressed a different 

question, but it's an analogous question.  If the 
question of whether non-state actors are part of the 
substantive obligation question, why, too, isn't the 
question of whether international law extends to 
corporations? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Because the state 

actor aspect of it goes to the question of the conduct. 
Does the conduct itself violate the norm? 

I think it's a -- but beyond that, it's 
enforcement.  I think it's important to bear in mind 
that the Alien Tort Statute uses the word "tort."  And 
it's --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it -- I didn't 

understand the point you just made, that the sovereign 
immunity part goes to?  To the conduct? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it goes to whether the 

defendant can be sued, the sovereign immunity does. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why doesn't the corporate 

thing go precisely to the same question? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Because there is no 

independent prohibition in international law or domestic 
law against suing a corporation the way there is for a 
foreign sovereign.  To the contrary --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But whether -- I'm

sorry. 

MR. KNEEDLER:  I was just going to say, to 

the contrary, at the time the Alien Tort Statute was 
adopted, corporations could be held liable.  This 
Court's decision in Chandler recently surveyed the --
the law, and corporations could be held liable in tort. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But under 

international law, it is critically pertinent who's --
who's undertaking the conduct that is alleged to violate 
international norms.  If an individual private group 
seizes a ship, it's piracy.  If the navy does it, it's 
not.  Governmental torture violates international norms. 
Private conduct does not. 

So, why doesn't the -- why isn't the same 
pertinence -- your argument seems to be that all you 
need to do is find an event, torture, piracy, whatever, 
and then it's up to the domestic law whether or not 
particular entities can be sued. 

MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I think that's correct, 

and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  As a statement of 

your position. 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it doesn't work

when you're talking about state -- whether it's a state 
conducting the illegal conduct or somebody else.  So, 
why -- that's not up to the domestic --

MR. KNEEDLER:  No, because that goes to the 
definition of the norm.  But if we -- if we take -- if 
we take the Alien Tort Statute, in 1907, the Attorney 
General concluded that an irrigation company could be 
sued for violating a treaty.  If we take the examples 
that gave rise to the Alien Tort Statute, if a process 
serving company -- if one of its agents went into an 
ambassador's house and tried to serve process, that was 
a criminal violation at the time. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you go much -- you go 
much further.  Suppose an American corporation commits 
human trafficking with U.S. citizens in the United 
States.  Under your view, the U.S. corporation could be 
sued in any country in the world, and it would -- and 
that would have no international consequences.  We don't 
look to the international consequences at all. 
That's -- that's the view of the Government of the 
United States, as I understand. 

MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  The question of 

extraterritorial application is distinct from the 
question of whether a corporation can be held liable. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So -- so, why -- why 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

23 

then -- you want to answer in your brief and -- this 
question, I find impossibly difficult, maybe highly 
fact-dependent.  There is no United States Supreme Court 
of the World.  There is no way of getting unified law on 
the points of whether when we interpret a common law 
Federal -- a system of Federal common law to decide 
whether a corporation can be defendant in every – a 
defendant in a certain kind of case.  Every other country 
could do the same.  And there's no way of resolving it.  All 
right? 

So, I find that a difficult question.  I 

don't know why that's in this case.  I would have 
thought the question in this case is, can a private 
actor be sued for certain violations of -- of 
substantive criminal law?  The answer is "yes."  Okay? 
Genocide, for example. 

And then the question is -- a corporation is 
a private actor, and is there any reason why, just like 
any other private actor, a corporation couldn't be sued 
for genocide?  And there the answer is I don't know, but 
I'll find out when the other side argues.  You see? 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE BREYER:  So, I -- I think this is 

unnecessarily complicated.  They made a -- a categorical 
rule.  They said never sue a corporation.  I seem to

JUSTICE BREYER:  You know?  I mean -- so --
so, why isn't that -- why are we going into -- I mean, 
you have good reason for doing it, and I want to hear 
why. 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, our -- our position is 

straightforward.  Just as you said, the question of 
whether a corporation can be held liable we think should 
be based on the fact that the ATS refers to torts.  And 
in applying -- this question we think is not 
complicated. 

In -- in fashioning Federal common law to 
decide whether there should be a common law cause of 
action, the ATS's reference to tort law, I think, 
directs the Court to domestic tort law, and the question 
of whether a corporation can be held liable under 
domestic tort law.  And it clearly can be.  It could be 
at the time this statute was enacted, and it can be 
today.

Mr. Kneedler.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

I'd like to begin with the answer to 

Justice Kennedy's first question.  Justice Kennedy 
asked, and Justice Breyer renewed the question, is there 
any source in customary international law throughout the 
world that holds corporations liable for the human 
rights offenses alleged here? 

And the answer is there is none. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  You say there is not a 

case.  That's a different matter. 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Not a case --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but that's a different 

matter because you can have a principle that applies 
even though there isn't a case.  And the principle that 
here would apply is what I said, Pirates, Incorporated. 
Do you think in the 18th century if they brought 
Pirates, Incorporated, and we get all their gold, and 
Blackbeard gets up and he says, oh, it isn't me; it's 
the corporation -- do you think that they would have 
then said:  Oh, I see, it's a corporation.  Good-bye. 
Go home. 

(Laughter.) 
MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Breyer, yes, the

corporation would not be liable. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Well, what 

source have you for --

MS. SULLIVAN:  The corporation would not be 

liable. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What source have you for 

that proposition? 

MS. SULLIVAN:  The -- look to Justice Story 

in U.S. v. Smith, cited in the Respondents' brief at 
footnote 12.  It looks to piracy.  And piracy is 
allowed -- in rem actions.  You could seize the ship 
with which the piracy was committed, as you could later 
slave trading ships.  But you could not seize another 
ship, and you could not seize the assets of the 
corporation.  So, piracy --

JUSTICE BREYER:  You couldn't seize another 
person other than Blackbeard.  That's why -- if the ship 
is owned by a corporation, and they sue the corporation 
in 18 -- 17 whenever it was -- '96 or something, what 
reason do we have to think that the corporation would 
have lost -- I mean, would have won? 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, let's be clear 

that Sosa referred to specific norms.  So, the answer to 
Pirates, Inc., does not determine the answer in this 
case, which is about whether corporations can commit

post-Nuremberg human rights offenses. 

A given norm must be applicable to a 

corporation.  So, even if I gave you Pirates, Inc., it 
wouldn't decide this case.  But in fact Pirates, Inc., 
was not suable; it was the ship that could be seized. 
But to answer Your Honor's question about 

the genocide convention, and perhaps I could go back.  I 
want to be very clear:  We're not arguing there needs to 
be an international adjudicated case finding a 
corporation liable in order for Petitioners to win, but 
they have failed to show anything in the conventions, 
the non-binding treaties engaged in by multiple nations. 
They've failed to show anything in custom or practice. 

They failed --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Ms. Sullivan, I think 
that that's mostly because all of these are written to 
prohibit certain acts, and they don't talk about the 
actors.  So, if I could, you know, draw an analogy, it's 
as if somebody came and said, you know, this -- this 
norm of international law does not apply to Norwegians. 
And you -- well, there's no case about Norwegians, and 
it doesn't specifically say "Norwegians."  But, of 
course, it applies to Norwegians because it prevents 
everybody from committing a certain kind of act. 

MS. SULLIVAN:  But, Justice Kagan,

international law does speak to who may be liable, which 
you correctly identified as a substantive question, not 
a question of enforcement.  And international law holds 
corporations liable for some international law 
violations.  Look to the convention on the suppression 
of the financing of terrorism, which speaks about legal 
entities, or the convention on bribery of public 
officials, which speaks about legal persons. 

But the human rights offenses here do not 

arise from conventions like those, which allow corporate 
liability.  To the contrary.  The human rights offenses 
here arise from conventions that speak to individual 
liability.  The liability of individuals. 

And, Justice Breyer, in precise answer to 
your question about the convention on genocide, if you 
look to the Chevron brief on page 20 -- this is the 
amicus brief of Chevron filed by Professor Goldsmith. 
On page 20, it quotes in full the relevant passage from 
the genocide convention, article IV. 

I'm sorry.  There are many briefs, but 

perhaps if I could read it to Your Honors, I'll read it 
in full. 

It says that "persons committing genocide or 
any of the other acts enumerated in article III shall be 
punished, whether they are constitutionally responsible

rulers, public officials or private individuals." 

And, Justice Kagan, all the other relevant 

conventions also speak about natural persons.  The 
convention against torture speaks about "him," not "it." 
And when Congress -- in the one time it implemented the 
conventions that are the source of the human rights 
offenses that are alleged here, Congress, in the Torture 
Victim Protection Act, said that the suit may be brought 
against individuals.  And it expressly declined to use 
the term "persons," which could embrace corporations. 

And we --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You're getting ahead 

of yourself.  We haven't --

(Laughter.) 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We haven't decided 

that question just yet. 
(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But this statute doesn't 
use the word "individual," and it doesn't use the word 
"person."  As far as a corporate entity is concerned, a 
corporate -- a corporation could sue, could be a 
plaintiff under the Alien Tort Statute, could it not? 

There's no --
MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Ginsburg, a 

corporation could sue if it were an alien, and if you

decided "alien" embraced corporations.  And, of course, 
the Attorney General Bradford opinion from 1795, which I 
agree with the Chief Justice, extended -- and with 
Justice Alito -- did not extend to conduct in other 
countries; it extended only to conduct on the high seas. 
But Bradford -- the Bradford opinion, if you 
give it any credit, only establishes that a corporation 
may be a plaintiff.  It does not speak to the question 
here, which is whether a corporation may be a defendant. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Sullivan, take an 

example that has all the extraterritoriality aspects of 
this case removed from it.  Let's assume that the French 
ambassador is assaulted or attacked in some way in the 
United States and that that attack is by a corporate 
agent.  Would we say that the corporation there cannot 
be sued under the Alien Tort Statute? 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  You would 
say that because there is no assaulting ambassador norm 
that applies to corporations. 

I just want to go back and --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, could you explain that 

to me?  We would have to sue the person individually. 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Exactly.  Exactly. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And what -- so, this goes 
back to Justice Breyer's question.  Where do you find

that in international law?  Where -- where does it say, 
when the French ambassador is sued in the United States 
by a corporate agent, we can't sue the corporation? 
MS. SULLIVAN:  The burden rests on the 
Petitioners to show that the norm is established by 
international law, not on us to show that corporate 
liability is anchored --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Congress could -- could 

pass a statute to that effect. 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Could absolutely. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes. 
MS. SULLIVAN:  Congress tomorrow, 

Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The issue is whether this 

did it or not. 

MS. SULLIVAN:  This did not.  And what 
international law has not established -- not just 
through cases, Justice Breyer, but through any source, 
convention or custom.  If you look to the jurisdictional 
statutes of the ICC, the Rome Statute --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You don't -- of course, one 
could bring an ATS suit against the individual.  Is that 
right? 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Yes, Your Honor.

law and mostly other countries' law would hold the 
corporation liable for the individual's act.  Isn't that 
right?  That's a general principle of law. 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Kagan, let's be clear 
to separate two very different causes of action.  There 
is no country -- and to answer Justice Ginsburg's first 
question, there is no country in the world that provides 
a civil cause of action against a corporation under 
their domestic law for a violation of the law of 
nations.  In Mr. Hoffman's hypothetical, if there were a 
suit in England or in the Netherlands, it would be for 
assault and battery, wrongful death, or --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Sullivan that would be 
true against an individual as well.  The ATS is just a 
unique statute.  It's unique against individuals, and 
it's unique against corporations.  That doesn't answer 
the question that you're here to address, which is 
whether corporations are meaningfully different from 
individuals. 

MS. SULLIVAN:  They are meaningfully 

different from individuals under international law, 
which is the crucial choice of law question you need to 
answer here.  The crucial question that's at the 
threshold is which law determines whether corporations 
are liable?

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well you're right on 

that point.  What about slavery?  Genocide -- I see your 
point in the Goldsmith brief.  But what about slavery? 
That seems like contrary to international law norms, 
basic law norms, it could be committed by an individual. 
And why, if it could be committed by an individual, 
could it not also be committed by a corporation in 
violation of an international norm? 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Let me be clear.  The 

question is not "could" --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  I know, but the 

way --

MS. SULLIVAN:  -- international law apply. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  I've read the reason why, 
as you point out in your briefs, the corporations are 
different in many countries as if they're not moral 
persons.  And I have in my mind filled in the blanks on 
that, and I think I know what it refers to.  All right. 
That's the rationale that kept them out of some of these 
treaties. 

And now the question would be, all right, 

are they always kept out no matter what?  And I'm 
bringing up the two counterexamples I think were fairly 
strong, was Pirates, Inc., but that's a joke example, 
and the other -- although it's a point.  And the other

is slavery.  What about -- what about that one? 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Corporate liability, even for 

norms on which the international community agrees --
torture, genocide, piracy, slavery -- corporate 
liability is a substantive norm that is established by 
international law.  And the nations of the world, for 
various reasons, have treated individuals and 
corporations differently. 

And, Justice Kennedy, over and over and over 
again, as not just the Respondents' brief at page 17 but 
the U.K./Netherlands brief -- two of our most important 
allies filed a brief in support of Respondents, saying, 
at pages 11 through 15, there is no international norm 
applicable to corporations for violations of the human 
rights offenses here. 

Now, the international community has many 

reasons for this.  In 1998, when the Rome statute 
established the ICC, the signatories actually discussed 
whether to have criminal liability for corporations; and 
as the Scheffer amicus brief in support of Petitioners 
points out, at page 18, they actually also discussed 
civil liability for corporations, and the nations of the 
world who created the ICC, one of the most important 
modern instruments for bringing about human rights 
prosecutions, declined to embrace --

corporations. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you tell me why you 

think they did that?  I mean, for us, the -- respondeat 
superior is so simple.  Why isn’t it a big deal in 
international law? 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Well, Justice Kennedy, 

there's many reasons.  For one, a corporation involves 
many innocent stakeholders beyond the perpetrators.  And 
the regime established at Nuremberg, if it established 
nothing else, established that it is individuals who are 
liable for human rights offenses.  It pierced the notion 
of hiding behind a state abstract entity, and it held 
individuals, including individual businessmen, from 
Alfred Krupp to 28 officials indicted from the I.G. 
Farben firm.  But Nuremberg was about individual 
liability. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What happened to I.G. 

Farben?  I thought that it was dissolved and its assets 
taken. 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  I.G. 
Farben was dissolved by the Control Council Law Number 9 
in 1945.  It was a political act.  It preceded any of 
the tribunals, either international or national.  It was

not until later that year that the international 
military tribunal began.  It prosecuted no corporations. 

When the Allies prosecuted perpetrators of 

the Nazi horrors in later cases, they prosecuted, again, 
only individual officers, not any corporations. 

There are two amicus briefs on the Nuremberg 
history, one in support of Petitioners filed by Jennifer 
Green and one in support of neither party filed by 
Jonathan Massey.  Both of them agree on one proposition, 
and that is that no corporation was prosecuted by either 
the international military tribunal in 1945 and '46 nor 
in any of the subsequent U.S. tribunals.  In fact, in 
U.S. v. --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there's no -- there 

was no civil liability adjudicated in Nuremberg.  It was 
about criminal. 

MS. SULLIVAN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

And to answer your question, when I.G. Farben was 
dissolved, it was part of denazification, 
decartelization, and the destruction of the Nazi war 
machine of which I.G. Farben was an integral part.  It 
was practically viewed as an enemy state in and of 
itself. 

That is a -- so, the precedent of Nuremberg, 

like the precedent of the ICTY, the ICTR, the ICC, all

exclude liability for corporations, even for the most 
heinous offenses of the modern era.  They focus 
liability, rather, on corporate officers. 

And, Justice Kagan, we don't dispute that 

corporate officers can be held to account for these 
offenses, assuming, Justice Alito, that we don't have 
concerns about extraterritoriality --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, if that's --
MS. SULLIVAN:  -- even as to individuals. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  If that is true -- let me 
just take you back to this question of separating out 
direct corporate liability from vicarious corporate 
liability, because it's clear if -- one question is, is 
there a substantive international law obligation? 

But there's another question which would not 

be an international law question, which is a remedial 
question.  Remedies are addressed by common law rather 
than -- American common law rather than by international 
law. 

So, why shouldn't we look at the vicarious 
liability question as essentially a question about the 
scope of the appropriate remedy once an international 
law violation has been found? 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Kagan, you should 

look at questions of corporate liability.  Like

questions of aiding and abetting liability.  Like 
questions of individual private liability as opposed to 
state actor liability.  You should look at all of those 
questions as substantive questions answered by 
international law.  And that's because footnote 20 of 
Sosa says you look to whether international law extends 
liability to the perpetrator being sued. 

You can't just find an act out there and fan 

out to anyone in the entire world, including consumers 
pumping gas in Ohio, and say there's been an act of --
an international law violation. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the question of who can be 

sued --

MS. SULLIVAN:  It's a question of who. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  --
MS. SULLIVAN:  It's not. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  The question of who has an 

is a remedial question. 

obligation is a substantive question. 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Respectfully, Justice Kagan, 

we disagree.  The question of who may be sued is 
fundamentally part of the question of whether there has 
been a tort committed in violation of the law of 
nations.  It would read the verb "committed" out of the 
statute, if you just said find a violation of the law of 
nations anywhere and then apply it to whoever you want.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But in my example, the tort 
in violation of the law nations has been committed.  It 
has been committed by the corporate agent.  And the 
question then is, can one hold the corporation 
responsible for that tort?  And that seems to be a 
question of enforcement, of remedy; not of substantive 
international law. 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Kagan, we 
respectfully disagree.  That is a question of 
substantive law.  Think about a domestic analogy.  Look 
to the Restatement of Conflicts.  You would ask 
whether -- you would not look to foreign law to 
determine a question of respondeat superior or 
contribution or indemnity.  You would not look to 
foreign law to determine whether, in the words of the 
Restatement, one person is liable for the tort of the 
other. 

You would look to the law of the place of 

misconduct or the place of where the corporation is 
headquartered.  We -- foreign law determines in this 
case whether you had can have civil remedies rather than 
criminal.  We concede that the ATS allows a civil remedy 
where the world would impose only criminal liability. 

That's because civil liability versus 

criminal liability -- that's a matter of remedy.  So

would be the amount of damages.  So would be the choice 
of compensatory or punitive damages. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If you look --
MS. SULLIVAN:  Those are matters of remedy 

for domestic law to decide. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If you look to the law of 
the place where the corporation is headquartered, well, 
suppose that has a typical respondeat superior liability 
that says corporations are liable for the acts of their 
agents.  So -- and most -- correct me if I'm wrong, I 
think most countries in the world have such a notion, 
that corporate -- corporations are responsible for the 
acts of their agents.  So, how does the -- looking to the 
law where the corporation is headquartered, where does 
that get you when that country has the very same law 
that we do, that, yes, corporations are liable for the 
acts of their agents? 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Ginsburg, 

respectfully, we don't think the world is all of one 
when it comes to issues of corporate responsibility for 
the acts of its agents.  If you look at the ICJ --
sorry.  If you look at the Rome statute, the Rome 
statute itself has very particular sections about when 
an -- a corporate superior is liable for the actions of 
a corporate inferior.  It looks to a knowledge and

deliberate indifference standard. 

Not every nation of the world agrees on what 
standard must -- there must be for even attributing the 
agent's act at the bottom of the corporate hierarchy to 
a senior officer, much less to the corporation as an 
entity. 

In answer to your question about -- earlier 
about respondeat superior, Justice Kagan, the only way a 
corporation can do anything is through the acts of human 
beings; thus, there's always the question, when it comes 
to corporate liability, to ask how to attribute the 
action of the human beings who work for the corporation 
to the corporation.  And we respectfully submit that 
Sosa footnote 20 commits that question, as does the ATS 
itself, to international law. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well --
MS. SULLIVAN:  Yes? 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- I wonder if you don't 

concede away too much when you say, well, there's a 
difference in substance and -- and remedy and questions 
of jury trial, damages, and so forth.  That's domestic. 

Those were the concerns that the U.K. and 
the Netherlands addressed in their brief as saying why 
corporations shouldn't be liable for acts committed on 
foreign -- foreign territories.  Those -- that was the

whole reasoning of -- of the U.K. brief. 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Kennedy, I agree 

completely, and let me be very clear on one thing.  I've 
addressed only step one of Sosa, which is, does 
international law provide for a specific universal and 
obligatory norm of corporate liability?  It does not. 
In fact, it refutes it.  The Rome statute rejected 
liability for corporations.  The jurisdictional statutes 
of the ICTY and the ICTR apply jurisdiction only to 
natural persons.  The international community at step 
one has rejected it. 

But, Justice Kennedy, it's very important 
that Sosa puts a second screen into your inquiry.  You 
must ask, at the second step, even if international law 
had provided any source of corporate liability, which it 
does not, you would still have to ask -- footnote 30 of 
Sosa says it's a higher bar -- should Federal common 
law, should Federal common law now embrace these kinds 
of actions?  And the answer is "no." 

Even if you found this were a question of 

domestic remedy, we think you cannot.  This is a 
question of substance.  But even if this were a question 
of -- domestic remedy, you should not find liability for 
corporations for the same reasons you rejected corporate 
liability in Malesko.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Sullivan, and I'm -- in 

Sosa, as I understand it, it's all about what is the 
conduct that falls under this law of nations.  It is not 
about who is the actor subject to that law.  Sosa is 
dealing with what kinds of conduct come within the Alien 
Tort Statute.  It -- it doesn't consider the question of 
what actor; that wasn't before the Court.  What was 
before the Court is what kind of activity violates, is 
contrary to, the law of nations. 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Ginsburg, 

respectfully we disagree and so do all the courts of 
appeals who have addressed the question of aiding and 
abetting liability.  Every court of appeals, save one, 
including the Ninth Circuit and the D.C. Circuit, which 
disagreed with us on the outcome, said that the question 
of whether international law permits liability for 
aiding and abetting is to be determined by international 
law.  The second --

JUSTICE BREYER:  You could -- you could --

first, maybe you addressed this case.  There was a case 
called Skinner v. East India Company. 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  That was 

under English tort law, 1666. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  All right.  So, it's 

-- now, what -- what I'm thinking of is if you go

through the rationale is you find some instances where 
individuals could, in fact, violate an international law 
norm, and then you find a lack of a reason why a 
corporation couldn't do the same.  Now, in that kind of 
category, could the Court say we're interpreting Federal 
common law here to determine who can be sued under this 
statute?  That's the remedial part. 
MS. SULLIVAN:  You may --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And we're -- and so, what 

we're saying is that there is a -- in certain 
circumstances, there could be a suit against your 
corporation.  You'd have to be careful because you 
recognize that by creating a -- a suit against your 
corporation, you're saying every country in the world 
can do the same.  And -- and, therefore -- but maybe 
there are instances of like, universal jurisdiction 
recognized under international law where you could be 
pretty certain no harm would be done by that. 

And so, what I'm thinking of is -- is a way 

of enforcing it. 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Breyer, first we 
disagree that the question of who may be sued is a 
question of enforcement.  We think that bridge --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I see.  Yes. 
MS. SULLIVAN:  -- was crossed in Sosa.  And

as I was saying to Justice Ginsburg, in all the cases 
that hold, all the courts of appeals agree that who may 
be liable, just primary actors or also aiders and 
abetters, is determined by international law is a 
question of substance.  So, we disagree with the 
premise.  But to answer Your Honor's question, the 
Federal common law still should not fly in the face of 
Congress, and I think the important question in your 
hypothetical is who is the "you"? 

As Justice Scalia just pointed out, Congress 

could amend the ATS tomorrow to provide for a Federal 
common -- a Federal statutory cause of action against 
corporations.  But the one time Congress spoke to the 
very question at issue here, it held the diametric 
opposite.  Congress in the TVPA rejected corporate 
liability by choosing the term "individuals" rather than 
"persons." 

And I realize, Mr. Chief Justice, that's the 

next case, but we think there's -- really the answer 
that the TVPA excludes corporations is compelled, and 
the U.S. agrees. 

So, Your Honor, the question is not what 
should Federal courts do in the abstract; it's what 
should Federal courts do when there is exact statutory 
decisionmaking by the political branches that has gone

the other way.  In maritime law, in Miles v. Apex, you 
didn't -- you didn't decide to go contrary to the 
Congress in the Jones Act; you said if there's a Jones 
Act statutory statement about wrongful death, we should 
follow it in Federal common law. 

Similarly here, even if the international 

community thought there was anything to corporate 
liability -- which it doesn't.  It disagrees.  Our two 
allies the U.K. and Netherlands disagree, and Germany 
has filed a brief saying it also disagrees with the ATS 
as it has been applied.  Even if there was international 
consensus, you would still have to ask, should the 
Federal courts, through free-form Federal common law 
making, do the opposite of what Congress is saying? 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, we know the way to do 

it.  I mean, in Skinner, even if it was English common 
law, the court reasons -- it says the taking of the ship 
on the high seas was "odious and punishable by all laws 
of God and man."  So, we -- could you not say, where an 
action is forbidden by the international law, and it is 
punishable or -- by all laws of God and man, in such a 
circumstance there being no reason to deny corporate 
liability here, even under the moral person rule, it --
we interpret the Federal common law to permit that 
remedy?

MS. SULLIVAN:  Well, Your Honor, the ATS has 

47

language that says the tort must be committed in 
violation of the law of nations.  And so, although, 
Justice Ginsburg, it doesn't specify who may be the 
defendants, it does point us to the law of nations to 
figure out what the law of nations thinks about who may 
be the defendants.  And the law of nations is uniform. 
It rejects corporate liability.  It rejects corporate 
liability. 

So, to find a Federal common law cause of 

action here is to fly in the face of both the 
international community, with all the foreign policy 
consequences Justice Kennedy referred to earlier, if as 
Mr. -- as the Chief Justice said earlier, the point of 
the ATS was to stop war, by making sure there was a 
forum for the Marbois incident so that France wouldn't 
think it had to go to war on us to stop the offense to 
its sovereignty.  But it will it provoke war to go out 
ahead of the international community, foiling the 
purpose of the ATS. 

But also -- and this is --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Sullivan, could I take 

you back to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I assume the United 

States has taken that into account.  I mean, for you

to -- representing the corporations to say what is in the 
interests of the United States, when the United States 
representative told us they think that individuals and 
corporations are both subject to suit. 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Well, Your Honor, 

respectfully, we -- we accept that the United States 
here before you today doesn't speak to the foreign --
foreign policy consequences of this kind of ATS 
liability, and we haven't even gotten to the alternative 
ground Justice Alito and the Chief Justice referred to 
earlier, which is Charming Betsy canon says don't 
lightly construe your law to offend international law. 
But just back to the -- the United States, I 
respectfully suggest you should look to the TVPA, rather 
than simply to what the United States says here today. 
And the TVPA, which is Congress interpreting --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the TVPA is one 

limited statute dealing with one particular category of 
offense, and it was specifically meant to supplement, 
not to supplant, the ATS.  So, between those two things, 
the fact that it's limited to torture and that there was 
no design to supplant the ATS, I guess I think that if 
your best shot is the TVPA, that's a -- that's a weak 
one.

of many sources, Your Honor. 

Just to go back to the key point about 

international community, the international community --
Justice Breyer says don't just look for adjudicated 
opinions, but every convention for every international 
tribunal excludes corporations. 

Look to the U.N. process.  The Petitioners 

make a great deal out of a U.N. process that's taken 
place since 2007.  We cite the U.N. special 
representative, saying I have looked at the 
international human rights instruments that are out 
there, and I find no basis --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  If I asked you --
MS. SULLIVAN:  That's the U.N., not 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You said the international 

community draws this line.  And as far as I can see, the 
international sources are simply silent as to this 
question.  So, if I said to you, Ms. Sullivan, I want to 
go back and read the best thing you have saying that the 
international law sources draw this line, what do I 
read?

MS. SULLIVAN:  Read, first of all, the Rome 

statute, 1998, and the legislative history of it, 
reports --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the Rome statute is 
different because the Rome statute is about criminal 
liability.  And we know that the Rome statute was meant 
to complement many -- many international states' laws 
which in fact do not hold corporations criminally liable 
domestically. 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Read -- but the Rome statute 
also rejected civil liability.  That's in the Scheffer 
brief.  The Scheffer amicus brief.  He was our 
representative there, and he said civil liability was 
considered but rejected. 

So, the Rome statute rejected either 

corporate or criminal liability for corporations under 
the new ICC.  The ICC -- the ICTY, the convention 
against torture itself, and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought they rejected 

civil liability for everyone.  It wasn't limited to 
corporations. 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, we 
don't -- we agree that there's no civil liability for 
human rights offenses.  The answer to Justice Alito's

in the world that provides for civil liability for human 
rights violations?  The answer is, no, there is no other 
nation in the world that provides an ATS. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, but that's for 

individuals as well as for corporations. 

MS. SULLIVAN:  That's correct, but for --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I ask you this --
MS. SULLIVAN:  -- human rights violations. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.  Is there an Article 

III source of jurisdiction for a lawsuit like this? 

MS. SULLIVAN:  None other than the ATS, Your 

Honor.  If -- there --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what's the 

constitutional basis for a lawsuit like this, where an 
alien is suing an alien? 

MS. SULLIVAN:  The -- well, there's no alien 
diversity jurisdiction.  So -- because an alien is suing 
an alien.  And there's a good argument you could dispose 
of this case, but not all the other ATS cases, by simply 
holding there's no alien diversity jurisdiction here, 
and the ATS can't have been viewed as displacing 
Congress's intent to limit jurisdiction at the time. 
That would dispose of this case and other cases 
involving foreign corporations sued by foreign 
plaintiffs, cases likes Talisman and Nestle and Rio

Tinto. 

But we respectfully urge you to reach a 
broader ruling, which is that corporate liability is 
foreclosed both by the uniform practice, the uniform 
practice, not just adjudications, of the nations of the 
world --

JUSTICE BREYER:  You're -- now you're 

beginning one additional thing, that the corporate rule 
that you're about to cite shows that many people believe 
there shouldn't be a remedy against a corporation 
because they're not moral persons.  Why does it show 
that the corporation couldn't violate the substantive 
rule? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Please. 
MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, we do not urge a 
rule of corporate impunity here.  Corporate officers are 
liable for human rights violations and for those they 
direct among their employees.  There can also be suits 
under State law or the domestic laws of nations, but 
there may not be ATS Federal common law causes of action 
against corporations. 

Thank you, Your Honor.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL HOFFMAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. HOFFMAN:  Let me just make a few 

quick --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  For all the reasons 

Justice Kagan mentioned, that the TVPA is not a limiting 
source and can be viewed as a supplemental source, but 
there does appear to be a little bit of incongruity, 
that aliens can sue corporations for acts against other 
aliens, but American citizens under the TVPA might not 
be able to sue corporations. 

How do we deal with that incongruity? 
MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, there are a number of --

of differences between the TVPA and -- and the Alien 
Tort Statute apart from that.  I mean, for example, the 
Alien Tort Statute applies to a much broader range of 
international human rights violations.  Congress decided 
to legislate in those areas for the reasons that it 
decided to do that. 

The one thing that's clear, as Justice Kagan 

said, is that the Torture Victim Protection Act was 
designed to establish or to make even stronger the 
Filartiga precedent and shield it from analyses that 
challenged its bases, and was -- was not intended to 
restrict the Alien Tort Statute in any way.

And obviously, the next case will discuss in 
greater detail whether the TVPA applies to corporations 
or not.  If -- I don't know. 

If I could just make a couple of additional 

points. 

If -- if it was true that international law 
barred corporate liability, then our friends the United 
Kingdom and the Netherlands have violated international 
law by passing legislation that imposes criminal 
liability on corporations for violating genocide, crimes 
against humanity, and war crimes. 

And I think that brief makes it pretty clear 

that whatever they're saying, if -- if the Alien Tort 
Statute is a domestic enforcement of international law, 
then their views don't apply. 

And -- and this is a tort statute.  That's 
what -- there was a meaning to torts.  Skinner's case, 
for example, was a tort not only under English common 
law; it was -- it was a tort in violation of the law of 
nations.  It was robbery on the sea.  The law of nations 
was incorporated in English common law, just as it was 
in the founding in our country and, under the Paquete 
Habana, is still part of our land -- the law of our 
land. 

"Tort" meant to the founders "tort

remedies."  It meant -- it meant that the means of 
enforcement would be done by the common law.  That's all 
that was available then.  It's all that's available now. 

And -- and international law places no 

restriction on the way domestic jurisdictions enforce 
international law.  There is a general principle law of 
corporate civil liability for all of the things that we 
allege in this case. 

In every legal system in the world, one can 

get redress for this kind of thing.  Countries don't 
necessarily call it a violation of the law of nations. 
They didn't fashion the statute the way our Founders did 
for the reasons that they did --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  In every 

nation in the world, you can get redress for this sort 
of thing, but I thought you told us earlier that there 
was no place where this suit could be brought --

MR. HOFFMAN:  No, no.  If --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In other words, a 

suit by an alien against another alien for conduct that 
takes place overseas. 

MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, what I'm suggesting -- I 

don't know whether in every domestic jurisdiction, the 
extraterritoriality issue is taken in the same way. 

What I'm suggesting is that, for these kinds

of acts, you can get redress against a corporation 
within every legal system.  Now, not every legal 
system -- I don't know every legal system with respect 
to the extraterritoriality issue. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that just gets 

back to your basic submission, which is you define the 
international norm based on the act rather than the 
entire issue that's going to be litigated, which 
includes both remedy and actor. 

MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, what -- what -- what we 

would suggest is that international law does not 
distinguish with respect to actor, at least in -- with 
respect to these four norms, if we're going by a 
norm-by-norm basis.  These -- these norms are defined in 
ways that human beings and corporations can violate. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's your position --
MR. HOFFMAN:  Could -- could it --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's your position on 

aiding and abetting?  Is that -- is that a matter of our 
domestic law or would we track international law on 
that? 

MR. HOFFMAN:  The lower courts have treated 
it in different ways.  I think that most of the courts 
now have found that aiding and abetting is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't care about the

courts.  I care about you.  What's your position on 
aiding and abetting? 

MR. HOFFMAN:  I think that -- I think that 

aiding and abetting could be viewed as a conduct 
regulating norm, that it actually applies to the things 
that can be done to violate the norm.  And, therefore, 
international law would apply to that. 

I think my -- my time is up. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
The case is submitted. 
(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
