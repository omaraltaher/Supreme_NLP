P R O C E E D I N G S 

(10:02 a.m.) 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

3

first this morning in Case 11-159, Astrue v. Capato. 

Mr. Miller. 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER 
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. MILLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The Social Security Administration has 
reasonably interpreted the Social Security Act to 
provide that, as a general rule, a person seeking to 
establish eligibility for child survivor benefits must 
show that he or she would have been able to inherit 
personal property from the decedent under applicable 
State intestacy law.  That interpretation is supported 
by the text, structure, and history of the Act, and it 
comports with principles of federalism because it defers 
to State law on the determination of family status, 
which is a traditional subject of State regulation. 
It's reasonable and entitled to deference under Chevron. 

Now, the textual arguments in this case 

involve the interaction of three provisions of the Act. 
And the first is section 402(d)(1), which is the basic 
benefits-granting provision.  And that says that under 

Alderson Reporting Company

certain conditions, the child of a wage earner is 
entitled to benefits.  And that provision has a 
cross-reference to a definition of "child" in section 
416(e) of the Act.  And 416(e), which is reprinted at 
page 4a of the appendix to our brief, says that the term 
"child" means (1) the child or legally adopted child of 
an individual, (2) a stepchild under certain cases, and 
(3) a person who is the grandchild or stepgrandchild of 
an individual. 

Now, I think the one thing that's 

immediately apparent from looking at that provision is 
that under anyone's reading, it's a little bit confusing 
because it uses the word "child" twice to mean two 
different things.  That is, the first "child" is broader 
than the second, because the first one includes the 
second as well as adopted child, stepchild, and so 
forth. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose a State legislature 
got the crazy idea that children born to married people 
during the time of the marriage shouldn't inherit under 
State intestacy law.  Would that mean that they would be 
ineligible for survivors' benefits? 

MR. MILLER:  Not necessarily, because if 
somebody doesn't qualify under -- and I should say at 
the outset that that is unlike the law of any State

either in 1939 or today. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But what if they did -- what 

if they did that? 

MR. MILLER:  There -- there are two 

alternative mechanisms that Congress added to the 
statute in the 1960s to allow children who lack 
intestacy rights to establish their eligibility.  Those 
are 416(h)(2)(B) and 416(h)(3).  And 416(h)(3) says that 
an applicant who is the son or daughter of an insured 
individual but is not a child under -- under paragraph 
(A), which is the reference to State intestacy law, 
shall nevertheless be deemed to be a child if there was 
an acknowledgment in writing that the child was -- that 
the applicant was the son or daughter, or there was a 
court decree for support.  So, I think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Those are -- those are 

obviously meant to deal with -- with children whose 
parents are not married. 

MR. MILLER:  That's right.  And the reason 

for that is that, in fact, under the law of every State, 
both in 1939 and today, children whose parents are 
married do have State -- do have intestacy rights.  But 
I think what the provision I just referred to 
illustrates is that the term "child" in this statute is 
a legal term of art, because if you were just looking at

the ordinary meaning of the word "child," the concept of 
an applicant who is a son or daughter but is not a 
child, would be completely nonsensical. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Maybe it means something 

else.  Maybe it means that to the Congress that 
initially enacted the predecessor of this provision a 
child was a child.  They knew what a child was.  And the 
type of child that I mentioned earlier was a child. 
There wasn't a need for any definition of that.  And 
they -- they never had any inkling about the situation 
that has arisen in this case, just as they had no 
inkling that any State would go off and take away 
intestacy rights for children born to married people 
during the course of their marriage. 

MR. MILLER:  Well, I mean, I think -- I 

think those are probably accurate factual claims about 
what Congress was thinking, but had Congress wanted --
the way that Congress chose to make sure that the 
children of married parents could establish their 
eligibility was by looking to State intestacy law, 
because Congress knew that under State intestacy law, 
those children had such rights. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Isn't there something 

sort of bizarre about your reading, because Congress in 
the (e) section sets up very specific definitions about

stepchildren and grandchildren and even 
stepgrandchildren in which State intestacy law is not 
referenced?  But you're saying that as to the largest 
category, the category in which 90 percent of people are 
going to get benefits, there Congress sent us all off to 
State law. 

MR. MILLER:  Well, it -- that's -- that's 
what section 416(h) says.  Section 416(h) sets out a 
rule --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, suppose I'm not so 

convinced that (h) is as clear as you think it is, 
because there are two sentences of -- of section (h). 
I'm just asking you to provide a reason why Congress 
would have specified everything about what -- how you 
get benefits for stepchildren and grandchildren and 
stepchildren, but not for the main category of people at 
issue. 

MR. MILLER:  Well, I think -- I think it's 
because with respect to the main category of people at 
issue, the question Congress was asking is:  What is the 
class of people who are likely to have a sufficiently 
close relationship to the insured person such that it 
would be appropriate to provide benefits to replace the 
loss of support that they would likely be getting during 
the person's life?  And if you look at what is the body

of law that defines that class of people who have a 
close relationship with someone, it's State intestacy 
law.  And State intestacy law sets out sort of clear, 
easy-to-apply rules for the distribution of estates. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, they don't 

always do --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Miller, there's one 

provision in (h) that's puzzling, and maybe you can tell 
me what it means.  It's at (h)(2)(A), and it's the last 
sentence of (A).  It says:  "Applicants who according to 
State law would have the same status relative to taking 
intestate personal property as a child ... shall be 
deemed such."  What person is that referring to? 
Someone who is not a child but has the same status as a 
child? 

MR. MILLER:  That -- that's right.  The 

first sentence sets out the general rule that you look 
to State law for the definition of "child."  And the 
second sentence says that people who do not have the 
status of children but nonetheless have the inheritance 
rights of children shall be deemed children.  And as a 
practical matter, the people that that applies to are 
people who have been equitably adopted. 

There's a doctrine in the law of many States 

where you have an adoption -- or you have an agreement

to adopt, but not yet a completed legal adoption.  In 
that circumstance, the would-be adoptee does not have 
the status of a child for all purposes or even 
necessarily for all inheritance law purposes, but can 
take property from the adopting parents.  So, that's who 
would be covered by that sentence, and that's now 
addressed in the regulations at --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Anyone else or just that 

category? 

MR. MILLER:  I think -- I think that is 

the -- the most likely category that it would apply to. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm sorry.  Go ahead. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You said earlier 

that the State intestacy law provides clear rules, but I 
assume that's not always the case, particularly with all 
this new technological advancement.  There must be 
situations where you can't tell what State intestacy law 
provides.  And what does the Social Security 
Administration do in that case? 

MR. MILLER:  The Social Security 

Administration tries to apply State law.  And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  My hypothetical 

is that there's no clear answer.  I mean, let's take a 
situation where this type of reproduction is -- is new,

and the State legislatures haven't had a chance to 
decide whether they want to recognize the offspring for 
State intestacy law or not.  What would SSA do? 

MR. MILLER:  Well, the SSA does the best 
that it can to figure out what the State law is, and 
then on review in the district court, you know, the 
district court is able to review that.  And there have 
been cases in which district courts have certified 
questions to State courts.  And I think actually the 
fact that there are those difficult questions that can 
come up in some of the cases, particularly involving 
assisted reproductive technology, really illustrates one 
of the virtues of leaving it to the States rather than, 
as Respondent would have it, effectively forcing SSA and 
then the Federal courts on review of its decisions to 
create a sort of Federal common law of parentage to 
resolve all of those very difficult questions. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There was in my memory, 

and it's been a while, that some States, if not all --
and that's what I was going to ask you -- basically deem 
any child born during the marriage to be a child of the 
marriage, whether it's a biological child or not, so 
that if a mother has had a relationship outside of 
marriage, the married parent's still responsible for 
that child.

That would take care of, I think, a great 
number, wouldn't it, of the new technology births that 
occur without perhaps the input of one of -- the 
biological input of one of the parents? 

MR. MILLER:  That -- that's right.  And, in 

fact, there are statutes in a number of States 
addressing the question of when a -- yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes.  My question was, 
do all States have similar rulings?  And for those that 
don't, what happens to a child that's been born with, as 
Justice Roberts said, as the Chief said, with new 
technology?  What happens to that child in terms of 
their definition -- of whether they'll be considered a 
child for Social Security purposes? 

MR. MILLER:  I -- I can't speak with 

certainty to all of the States, but I believe that that 
is the -- the general rule.  So, I'm not aware of any --
any States where, when you have a married couple using 
donor -- donor sperm, that the child would not be 
deemed the child of the husband. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  My impression is that, I'm 
not sure it's by statute, but just by judicial decision, 
a child born in the marriage is a child of the marriage 
unless -- unless the child is repudiated by -- by the 
father.

MR. MILLER:  I believe that is -- that is 

the general rule.  And I think one thing that that 
illustrates, of course, is that Respondents' definition, 
which is also the court of appeals' definition, of what 
a child is and the definition that they urge the Court 
to apply in 416 is the biological child of married 
parents. 

And not only is the -- does the "married" 

part of that not comport with the ordinary understanding 
of "child," because of course in ordinary usage whether 
somebody is a child doesn't depend on whether their 
parents are married, but the biological part also does 
not comport with legal usage because, both in 1939 and 
today, there are many cases in which biological 
parentage is not determinative of legal parentage, both 
for the reason that we were just talking about and then 
also for -- another example is when you have an 
adoption; a child who has been adopted by somebody else 
is no longer legally the child of his biological 
parents. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you tell me if -- if 

the Capato twins are both found to be -- be children 
within the meaning of the Act, will they meet the 
dependency or the deemed dependency requirements?  Or is 
that a back-up argument that you have?  Or --

MR. MILLER:  We -- that -- that would be a 

question for the agency to address in the first 
instance.  The agency has not addressed that question in 
the administrative process here.  So, we are not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It -- it was addressed in 

the Ninth -- in the Ninth Circuit decision, wasn't it? 
MR. MILLER:  That's right.  And the Ninth 

Circuit read the dependency provision of the Act to say 
that any legitimate child is deemed to be dependent, and 
it then conducted an examination of legitimacy under 
California law. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You don't have a position 
on that here?  Or -- you want that to be elaborated more 
by the agency? 

MR. MILLER:  That -- that's right.  I mean, 
I -- what I will say is, just speaking in general terms 
about dependency, the statute creates a number of 
presumptions that allow basically any -- any natural 
child, any child under the -- that first -- that second 
child in 416(e)(1), anyone who fits into that category 
is deemed to be dependent.  So, it doesn't necessarily 
turn on -- on factual dependency, which is obviously not 
present in --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Rebuttable presumption 

or irrebuttable?

MR. MILLER:  The presumption in favor of 
dependency for anyone who qualifies is irrebuttable. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you rely only on that 

-- on that definition. 

The section is entitled "Old-age and 

survivors insurance benefit payments," and it also 
provides in (d) that a child is entitled to the benefits 
if, among other things, (C) was dependent upon such 
individual, (i) if such individual is living at the time 
that the application was filed, (ii) if such individual 
has died at the time of death, or (iii) if such 
individual had a period of disability, et cetera, et 
cetera. 

It seems to me -- is the word "survivor" 
used anywhere in the text of this statute except in 
the -- in the heading of this section? 

MR. MILLER:  I don't -- it doesn't appear in 
any of the -- the operative definitional provisions, but 
I would certainly agree with you that it is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  We use titles to determine 

the meaning of ambiguous provisions later, don't we? 
MR. MILLER:  Yes, and I certainly would --

would agree with the -- the idea that it is difficult to 
describe someone as a survivor who was not alive at the 
time that -- or not --

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Nor would -- nor would he 
meet the requirements of (C), would he?  Would he meet 
any of the requirements of (C)?  Of (d)(1)(C). 

MR. MILLER:  The dependency requirement is 
defined in 402(d)(3) and -- which unfortunately is not 
reproduced in the appendix, but which has the effect of 
making anyone who qualifies under 416(h) be deemed 
dependent.  Now, we don't think that the children in 
this case qualify under 416(h).  So, there's no -- not 
even any need to reach the dependency question there. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Then what does -- what does 

(d)(1)(C) do if it's all washed out by --

MR. MILLER:  Well, the dependency 

requirement is something that people who don't qualify 
under 416(h), people who are adopted children or 
stepchildren or grandchildren, may in some cases have to 
make an individualized determination of actual 
dependency. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it doesn’s say – it 
says every child as defined in 416(e) has to meet that 
requirement.  If such -- such child, the one defined in (e). 

MR. MILLER:  Right, but then -- but then 

402(d)(3) says a child shall be deemed dependent under 
certain circumstances that effectively track the 416(h) 
analysis.  And I -- I would refer you on that point to

the agency's regulations defining dependency, which are 
404.361, which say that any natural child -- which is 
the term the agency uses for that second child in 
416(e) -- any natural child is deemed dependent.  Now --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I ask --

Justice Scalia said that the statute is ambiguous.  Is 
that your position?  Is it your position that the 
definition of "child" is ambiguous and that we have to 
give the agency deference, or is it your position that, 
in context, it's unambiguous and even if the Social 
Security Administration wanted to extend benefits, it 
couldn't, in the circumstances of this case? 

MR. MILLER:  I think that when the statute 

was initially enacted in 1939 with more or less the same 
structure of these provisions as we have now, it might 
at that time have been ambiguous.  But the agency 
adopted an interpretation that is, again, in structure 
materially identical to its current interpretation in 
1940, and it has adhered to it ever since.  And Congress 
has amended the statute with the understanding that that 
was the interpretation, that everybody had to go through 
State law to qualify. 

And I think in light of that history, at 

this point -- and Congress's ratification of that 
understanding, at this point the best view is that it is

unambiguous and clearly resolves the question in favor 
of the interpretation set out in the agency's 
regulations. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Miller, could I take you 

back to 416(e)?  I take it that you don't contest that 
for purposes of deciding the -- which stepchildren get 
benefits and which grandchildren get benefits, we're 
just looking to Federal law, that we don't look to State 
law on those questions; is that correct? 

MR. MILLER:  Yes, because those terms do not 
appear in 416(h).  There's -- there's no instruction in 
the statute that those terms be defined by reference to 
State law, as there is with respect to "child." 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And, you know, I'm looking 
at some of these, the grandchildren one, for example. 
It says a person who is the grandchild, but only if, 
blah, blah, blah.  It seems to have just sort of an 
understanding of what a grandchild is.  In other words, 
it's not really defining a grandchild here; it's 
limiting a class of grandchildren with a pre-existing 
understanding of what a grandchild is.  And so, I'm 
wondering, if that's true of grandchildren, why isn't it 
also true of children? 

MR. MILLER:  Well, I should say two things 

about that, then.  The first is, specifically with

respect to grandchildren, the agency's -- the agency 
defines a grandchild as the child, within the meaning of 
the statute, of a child.  And that's set out in the 
regulations at 404.358. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry, the child of a 

child.  The child -- what kind of child? 

MR. MILLER:  Well, somebody -- somebody who 

would qualify under 416(h) as a child. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Oh, so, for grandchildren, 

the agency is also looking to State law? 

MR. MILLER:  Indirectly.  I mean, a 

grandchild is not expressly defined in the Act, but 
somebody who qualifies either under State law or you can 
also qualify as a stepchild or adopted child of someone 
who qualifies as a child in that same sense. 

But -- I mean, again, the lack of a -- what's 

significant, I think, is the lack of any other provision 
in the statute that tells you how to define 
"grandchild."  I mean, the -- the run of cases that 
Congress was concerned about involved children, and for 
-- in explaining to the agency how to deal with those 
cases, Congress gave explicit guidance, and that's to 
look to State law, in 416(h). 

Now, Respondent makes much of the fact that 
the benefits-granting provision, 402(d), has an express

cross-reference to the definition in 416(e) but doesn't 
cross-reference the definition in 416(h). 

And I think there are two problems with that 

argument, the first of which is that 416(h) by its own 
terms says that it applies for purposes of this 
subchapter, that is throughout all of the parts of the 
Act that we're talking about here.  So, effectively 
416(h) incorporates itself into the 416(e) definition, 
and there's no need for an express cross-reference. 
The second point about that is that the 

structure of the definitions here is very similar to the 
structure of the definitions used in defining other 
family relationships that are eligible for benefits. 
So, under 402, some of the other subsections of 402, 
there are benefits for the wife or husband or widow or 
widower of an insured person.  And just to take the 
benefits for a wife as an example, in 402(b) the statute 
says that the "wife (as defined in section 416(b) of 
this title)" under certain circumstances can get 
benefits. 

If you look at the definition in 416(b) of 
"wife," it's very much like the definition in 416(e). 
It says, "the term 'wife' means the wife of an 
individual," and then it has some limitations.  So, if 
you were to --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Could you -- go ahead and

finish. 

MR. MILLER:  If you were to take 

Respondents' approach, you would just stop there and 
apply some sort of Federal standard of figuring out 
whether people are married or not.  But in fact 416(h), 
in paragraph (1) of 416(h), says an applicant is the 
wife or husband or widow or widower of an insured person 
if the State courts would regard them as being married. 

So -- and in the 1939 Act, all of those 

references to State law for wives and widows and 
children were all combined in one paragraph, so it was 
even clearer that that was how the statute worked, that 
you look to State law for defining all these family 
relationships. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Counsel, I now have in 

front of me (h)(3).  I don't see how it has anything to 
do with whether the child was dependent under (d)(1)(C). 
Why do you think it has something to do with that? 

MR. MILLER:  I'm sorry.  The -- the 
definition of dependency is in -- is in(d)(3), 
402(d)(3), not -- if you're -- 402(d)(3) says a child 
shall be deemed dependent upon his father unless at such 
time such individual was not living with or contributing 
to the support of such child and the child is neither

the legitimate nor adopted child of the individual.  So, 
the effect of that is anyone who is a legitimate child 
is deemed dependent under 402(d)(3). 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, unless such 

individual was not living with or contributing to the 
support of such child -- which is certainly the case 
here; the child had not yet been born -- and other 
qualifications.  The principal condition does not exist. 
Shall be deemed dependent upon his father or adopting 
father unless at such time such individual, mother or 
father or adopted father was not living with or 
contributing to the support of such child.  How does 
that alter the dependency requirement of (d)(1)(C)? 
MR. MILLER:  Well, because the child is 

deemed dependent unless he was -- I mean, again, 
since -- to be clear, we -- we think that the children 
in this case do not -- are not eligible for child status 
because they don't meet the requirements of 416(h). 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that may well be. 
MR. MILLER:  And --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If that is ambiguous, why 
doesn't -- why doesn't (d)(1)(C), despite -- what is it 
(h)(3) or whatever the 3 we're -- we've been playing 
with here -- despite (d)(3), despite that, it seems to 
me that they don't meet that requirement.

MR. MILLER:  That -- that might well be the 
case.  Our position is simply that that's not an issue 
that the agency has addressed and that would be a matter 
for the agency to resolve in the first instance if this 
Court were to disagree with us on the definition of 
"child." 

I referred a minute ago to the 1939 Act and 
the structure of that Act, and I think that that's very 
instructive because, again, the way that the provisions 
were arranged in the 1939 Act, as we set out in our 
brief, were the same for present purposes as they are 
today.  And Congress, when it amended the Act in the 
1960s to allow certain nonmarital children to be 
eligible for child status, recognized that that was the 
case, recognized the commission's interpretation that 
everybody had to go through 416(h) and establish their 
eligibility under State law, and then chose to make 
express exceptions to the requirement of State law for 
those children.  No such exception applies here. 

If I could reserve the remainder of my time. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Mr. Miller. 

Mr. Rothfeld.

MR. ROTHFELD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

If I can, I'll start with a question that 

Justice Sotomayor asked about the ambiguity or not of the 
statute, and we think that in fact the statute is not 
ambiguous at all.  We think that it unambiguously 
dictates the reading that we advance.  And it's useful, 
I think, in addressing the case to recognize that it 
presents essentially two issues.  One is whether all of 
the categories of applicants for child survivor benefits 
that are defined to be children in the statutory 
definition of "child," section 416, qualify for child 
benefits without reference to State law, as we submit. 

If they do, then the second question is 
whether the children in this case, the Capato twins, 
fall within one of the categories of children so 
defined.  And we think that they very clearly do. 

Congress said expressly that every child as 
defined by 416(e) shall receive benefits so long as they 
satisfy certain criteria that are not at issue in this 
case.  Section 416(e), to which Congress has expressly 
directed us in determining who is a child eligible for 
these benefits, defines a child to be (1) a child or 
adopted child, (2) a stepchild --

tell me what purpose 416(h) serves in this statute --

MR. ROTHFELD:  We think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- given that you 

believe that 416(e) is self-sufficient unto itself? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  We think subsection 416(e) is 

sufficient as to the children defined to be a child 
within that statute. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  As the child who should 

receive.  So, what's the purpose of (h)? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  And our understanding of who 

falls within section 416(e), (e)(1), definition of 
"child," is the natural child, the biological child of 
married parents.  There are, of course --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, the -- a child who 
was born during marriage but is not a biological child 
wouldn't qualify? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  No -- well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even though they qualify 

under State law as a child? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, as to the question of 

what (h) is designed to accomplish, we think that 
Congress enacted (h) for children whose parentage or 
parental relationships were unclear, which would 
principally have been children who were born outside of 
marriage, as to whom there was no presumption --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, would this -- let's 

assume Ms. Capato remarried but used her deceased 
husband's sperm to -- to birth two children.  They're 
the biological children of the Capatos.  Would they 
qualify for survivor benefits even though she's now 
remarried? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I think that's an 

interesting and more difficult question than what we 
have here.  I think that the answer may well be "yes," 
and I think that the -- situations like that can arise 
really in -- outside of the IVF context.  That's a 
related situation. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's -- you see, 
a situation like that is what is making me uncomfortable 
because I don't see the words "biological" in the 
statute.  I don't see the word "marriage" directly 
when -- within the definition of "child."  So, where do 
I draw them from?  Where do I come --

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, let me answer both of 

those questions.  As to where marriage comes from, I 
think from a number of sources.  One is the point that 
was raised by Justice Alito and Justice Kagan, that at 
the time Congress enacted the statute in 1939, the 
overwhelming majority of children in the United States, 
more than 90 percent -- it was actually more than 95

percent -- were the children of married parents.  And 
so, when Congress --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That would be true 

under State intestate law. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, simply as to what 

Congress had in mind when it said a child is a child --
and you asked where marriage comes from in the 
statute -- I think when Congress said a child is a 
child, as I think Justice Alito's question suggested, it 
would have had in mind the paradigm of a child at that 
time, which was the children --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the words -- you say 

this is plain meaning.  It says the child of a wage 
earner, an individual; a child -- it seems to me you are 
importing the term "married," because someone can be the 
undisputed child of a wage earner who is unmarried.  So, 
it's not a question of disputed versus undisputed.  A 
wage earner can have a child, undisputed that the wage 
earner is the parent, but the wage earner is not married. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, let me say two things 

about that.  And, first, to continue the question of 
where marriage comes from, there is a textual reference 
to marriage which appears in section 416(h)(2)(B), the 
companion to the intestacy provision upon which the 
Government relies.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I thought we weren't 
supposed to look to (h) at all.  I mean, your thesis is 
(e) covers it --

MR. ROTHFELD:  But --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- and there's no reason 

to refer to (h). 

MR. ROTHFELD:  But I think (h) reflects what 

Congress had in mind in the statutory definition, 
because in the provision that I'm referring to, Congress 
said that if the parents went through a form of marriage 
that was defective in some sense, nevertheless the child 
would be deemed to be a child, which tells us that 
marriage (a) was a significant part of what constitutes 
childness as defined --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't -- I don't -- look, 
when Congress says "child," "child" means child, and the 
mere fact that Congress wrote that at an age when most 
children were indeed children of married people doesn't 
change the word "child."  I mean, we don't go back and 
say -- Congress often uses words that go beyond what --
what their immediate concern is, and here they used the 
word "child." 

MR. ROTHFELD:  But --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You want us to probe their 

mind and say, well, since 90 percent of all children

were children of married people, that's what they must 
have meant by "child."  I just don't think that follows 
at all.  "Child" means child. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  If I may, Your Honor, 

Congress wrote a Federal definition of "child," and as 
Mr. Miller acknowledged in his opening argument, when 
Congress defined "child," it defined "child" to include 
a number of things.  The first thing that it defined was 
a child is a child or adopted child and stepchild, 
grandchild, stepgrandchild.  Congress used the word 
"child" to have a particular meaning, because it said a 
child is a child and other things.  The other things 
that it mentioned were --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Rothfeld, I guess 
the question is, when it says a child is a child, does 
it mean a child is a child born in wedlock or a child is 
just a child?  And we know that Congress knew how to 
distinguish between the two because Congress 
distinguished between the two in this very Act in the 
dependency provisions.  It talks about the legitimate 
child of such individual.  Well, here it didn't add that 
word.  It just said "the child." 

MR. ROTHFELD:  But -- and I think the reason 

it did that, I mean, as -- again, as Mr. Miller said, 
Congress used the "child" in two senses.  It used the

word "child" in the generic sense:  Everyone who 
qualifies for child benefits is a child.  So, it said 
"child" is, in that sense, a child, adopted child, 
stepchild, so forth. 

In the dependency section, Congress is 

referring to all children, all children in that -- in 
the generic sense, everybody who qualifies for benefits 
as a child.  And, therefore, Congress had to distinguish 
between what we say it meant when it said a child is a 
child, natural child of married parents --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Are there any other statutes 
that you can point to around this time which support the 
notion that when people said "child" they meant child 
within a legal marriage? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  I can't point to specifically 

that, because I think it was clear when Congress used 
the word "child" that that's what they had in mind as a 
generic matter.  As I suggested, when --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry.  You can't point 

to anything because it's so clear? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  In a sense, that's right.  If 
everyone knew what the word meant -- the word "child" was 
used to define, I think, the category that people would 
have had in mind when they thought of a child in the legal 
sense.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Rothfeld, don't you 

run into a problem?  Perhaps not in 1939, but since then 
this Court has had a number of decisions that deal with 
the distinction between children born in and out of 
wedlock, and in some of those cases, it has held that 
the distinction between the two is unconstitutional, 
that there are no illegitimate children.  All children 
are legitimate, whatever their parents may be. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  That is true.  But I think 

the question is, what was the intent of Congress when it 
wrote this statute in 1939? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but if we are going 

to apply those equal protection decisions to this 
statute --

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, that -- that may 

suggest that an unfavorable application of the statute 
to children born out of wedlock would be 
unconstitutional.  But the question of whether or not 
Congress intended to provide benefits to these 
children --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I suppose the question 

is aren't you at the very least getting us into a 
situation where we should interpret the statute the 
Government's way because of constitutional avoidance 
concerns? 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

31

MR. ROTHFELD:  I think that the contrary is 

true.  I think that you should interpret it our way 
because the Government's application sort of disfavors 
children who are born through, you know -- through 
assisted means by its incorporation of State law in 
favor of --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, it disfavors children 

who are born after the father has died, which is in 
accord with the title of the statute:  survivors 
benefits. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  But --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's issue here -- what's 

at issue here is not whether children that have been 
born through artificial insemination get benefits.  It's 
whether children who are born after the father's death 
get -- get benefits. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  But I think -- I suspect the 
reason that Mr. Miller was resisting your questions on 
that point is there is no question that children who are 
born -- who are, quote, conceived naturally in the marriage 
and are born after the father's death are deemed to be 
dependents and receive benefits.  That has been the 
consistent position of the agency, and we think that 
that's clearly right.  So, I don't think that the fact 
the child was born after death says dispositively that

they were not dependent upon --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm interested as to 

what your definition of "child" is.  Is it just a 
biological offspring?  Is it limited to a biological 
offspring born of a particular marriage, but in what 
context?  Because we go back to Justice Ginsburg's 
question of what happens if the -- if the decedent is 
the mother.  There's no question that she bore this 
child.  Married or unmarried, does it matter? 

Does marriage matter only if it's the father 

that's the decedent?  What is your --
MR. ROTHFELD:  We think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If there is a sperm 

donor, does any offspring that sperm donor have qualify? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  No, we -- we think not, 

because what we think what Congress had in mind when it said 
in the first part of clause (1) of the definition of 
child is the child, the natural child -- and I use 
natural as distinct from adopted child or stepchild who 
are dealt with separately in the statute, which is why 
we think it is clear that Congress was there talking 
about natural children, biological children -- the 
natural children of married parents, which we -- as I 
say, the reason we think --

unmarried who bears a child, this child is not 
automatically covered. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  We think that as Congress 
wrote the statute in 1939, that's correct, and that 
child would then have been referred to the intestacy 
provision upon which the Government relies, and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Oh, so there are 

situations in which you think those provisions should 
govern. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Yes.  Absolutely.  We think 

that those provisions were added as an additive 
provision as a mechanism for children who do not qualify 
for the definition to be deemed a child. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This is what was not 
clear to me.  So, you're -- you're not arguing that 
"child" has just one natural meaning. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  We -- we argue that Congress 

used the word "child" --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In whatever meaning you 

could give it. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  We -- I wouldn't say that.  I 
think that when Congress said a child is a child, which 
is the provision of the statute we were referring to, 
it was distinguishing the child from the adopted child and 
stepchild, and we think they were doing it in the 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

context of marriage because (a) that was the paradigm of 
family relationships at the time; (b) we think the 
reason -- what Congress was very concerned with 
accomplishing in the statute was guaranteeing certainty 
in the -- in parentage and the parental relationship. 

And it set up a system of -- because in 1939 

there were no genetic paternity tests, there was no --
it was impossible to be absolutely, scientifically 
certain as to who the -- at least as to who the father was, 
Congress set up a series of proxies to establish whether 
or not the applicant for child benefits was in fact the 
child. 

The principal one of those was the marital 

relationship because in 1939, as I think 
Justice Scalia's question suggested, there was a very 
strong, virtually per se conclusive presumption that a 
child born in marriage was the biological natural child 
of both the father and mother, of the married couple. 
And so, the existence of the marriage was a way of 
establishing in 1939 dispositively that the child was 
the child of the parents, the child of the survivor --
of the insured whose eligibility for benefits are being 
invoked here. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Rothfeld, I'm curious 
why you didn't argue a different theory, which is that

(e) refers to all biological children whether in 
marriage or outside of marriage, and then (h) is set up 
for cases in which biological status is contested. 

I mean, what would you think of that theory? 
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I -- we would certainly 

embrace it if the Court were --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why didn't you argue 

it? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  I think -- we think that we 
are arguing essentially a -- sort of a subset of that 
theory.  Our sense of what Congress was up to was that 
it wanted to assure certainty, as I just said in 
response to the previous question, in establishing 
parentage.  And the principal way in 1939 that Congress 
could do that was by (a) invoking existence of a 
parental relationship which established sort of as a per 
se matter that the children born within the marriage 
were the children of each of the married -- each member 
of the married couple. 

For parents -- children who did not fall 

into that category, there was this additive provision, 
section (h), which provided a mechanism for doing it, 
and establishing that State intestacy law would 
recognize this child as the child of -- typically it was 
going to be the paternity that was contested -- the

child of the father, (h) established a mechanism for 
doing that.  So, I think that we are getting to the same 
place --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if --
MR. ROTHFELD:  -- that your question 

suggests. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if the children 
-- well, I don't want -- the Capato twins were conceived 
4 years after of the death in this case?  Would your 
argument be the same? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  I think that our argument 

would be the same, but as a practical matter, almost all 
of these cases involve children who were born relatively 
soon after. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why is that?  Why 
would they all involve children born relatively soon 
after? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  They don't necessarily have 

to, but I think the practical reason why they do is that 
it's often the case that the surviving mother has 
children to produce a family sibling for an already 
existing child as was -- as was the case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, there's no 

reason it couldn't take place 4 years after. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  There is no reason.  That's

correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, what happens if 

the biological mother remarries or something and then 
goes through this process?  Does the child get double 
survivor benefits or --

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, it --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Which -- I assume 

you would argue that in that case the child is eligible 
through two different routes. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Potentially, that's correct. 
There are rules in the Act that prevent double recovery 
of survivor benefits.  And so, I don't think that would 
be an issue that would arise here.  But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Rothfeld, these 
children were born 18 months after the insured wage 
earner died.  If we look to other categories of 
children, say, stepchildren -- and there is also one for 
adopted children.  For stepchildren, they qualify only 
if they had that status no less than 9 months before the 
wage earner died, and adopted children is also a 
limitation.  The stepchild and the adopted child --
there could never be any question of being born 
18 months later.  They wouldn't qualify.  There's --
there is a time limit for the other children.  And if 
Congress had thought about this problem, maybe it would

have put a time limit on this, too. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I think that the 
question that the Court has to confront here is, 
Congress wrote a Federal definition of the word "child." 
And it was -- sort of the first question in the case, I 
think, is whether we are correct in our understanding 
that, when Congress wrote this definition, all 
applicants for child survivor benefits who fall within 
that category, those defined categories, qualify. 

And then we have -- if the answer to that is 

"yes," and so children as defined in clause (1) of the 
definition, which we think that the Capato children do, 
whether or not all children so defined qualify for 
benefits without regard to State intestacy law.  If we 
are right about that, then that raises the question what 
is the meaning of "child" in the -- in the statute?  And 
we think that --

JUSTICE BREYER:  The question is what -- you 

haven't mentioned the text that suggests you're not 
right, which is right in (h) which says:  In determining 
whether an applicant is a child of an insured, the 
Commissioner shall apply such law as intestacy law. 

Okay?  That's what it says.  Now, how do you 

get out of that? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Because --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because you say, well, 

there's an implicit exception. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  No, no.  That's not what we 

-- 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You're saying that that 

doesn't apply.  And so, I've listened carefully to your 
reasons for saying why (h) doesn't apply when its 
language seems to say it does apply, and I'm not sure of 
why it doesn't apply.  I mean --

MR. ROTHFELD:  Because --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose that two parents 

have lived together for 6 years and 4 months in State X, 
and they have a child.  Fine.  The father dies.  Were 
they married?  They never went through a ceremony.  Is 
there a common law marriage?  Might it depend on the 
State?  Do you know the answer in every State?  My 
answer is:  You don't know.  And I don't know.  And, 
therefore, we have to look to the law of the State in 
order to see whether that (e) is satisfied.  Now, we 
have to look to it to decide if they're married.  Even 
you say that. 

So, what Congress did is it found a pretty 
good shorthand way of saying where you look.  We're not 
going to worry about 6 years and 2 months; we're just 
going to look at their intestacy law.  That's, as I read

it, what it seems to say. 

Now, I have been listening to you , 
and I don't see how you're going to save us from 
even worse problems, particularly when I started looking 
at the state of the artificial insemination and so 
forth, and every State has a dozen different variations. 
There are uniform acts.  There are things you have to 
acknowledge in writing.  It's a very complicated 
subject.  And -- and that's why I am rather hesitant to 
read it the way you want.  But I want you to reply to 
that. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, the answer to the first 
sentence of section (h), if that were the only thing in 
the statute, I think that you would be right, but 
there's a second sentence to (h), which says in -- in 
applying State intestacy law, the -- the Commissioner is 
supposed to look at the status of an applicant and 
determine whether or not the status of the applicant is 
the same as that of a child.  And if so, the applicant 
is deemed --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where is that sentence? 
MR. ROTHFELD:  That appears in -- it's --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it the bottom of the 

paragraph? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  It's the bottom of the 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

41 

paragraph. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It says, "Applicants who 

according to such law would have the same status 
relative to taking intestate property as a child or a 
parent shall be deemed such." 

MR. ROTHFELD:  And that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So? 
MR. ROTHFELD:  But as a child.  Why does it 
-- it requires a comparison to someone who is a child. 
"Child" is defined in section (h).  If -- if -- I think 
the problem with the Government's interpretation of the 
first sentence of that -- of section (h) is that it 
makes the -- the statute circular. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I haven't found the 

sentence you're talking about.  Where is it? 

JUSTICE BREYER:  At the bottom of the paragraph. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Bottom of what?  Page what? 
MR. ROTHFELD:  It is at page 9a of the --

the appendix to the Government's brief. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's sort of like a -- you 
say there is no board of tax -- sorry.  I won't get into 
that.  But -- because they used the word "deemed."  Is 
that right? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well --

argument there. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  That's our explanation of 

what Congress was up to in the statute. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, all right. 
MR. ROTHFELD:  It --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 
MR. ROTHFELD:  It was an additive provision 
that says that if you are the same -- and I think this 
is an important point, Justice Breyer.  If you are the 
same as a child, you are deemed to have child status. 

You can't --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But then, Mr. Rothfeld, why can't 

one just say, well, first sentence, who is a child?  Look 
to State law.  Second sentence, when State law treats 
other people as children, you should treat them as other 
-- as children, too.  So, the two sentences can cohere 
fine.  For children, look to State law, and also look to 
State law to see who they treat just like children. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  But I -- I think that is not 

a plausible reading of -- of the text, Justice Kagan. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  The obvious practical thing 

is --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why not? 
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- is that -- that, you 
know, once you get beyond this and the child wasn't

even -- if he's conceived -- or what the father could 
do, couldn't he just write a note and say this is my 
child even if it's conceived later, and then wouldn't he 
fall within one of these other exceptions, the exception 
for being acknowledged? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  He -- he would not.  The 
father here did in fact write such a note, but I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  He has acknowledged in 

writing that the applicant is his son or daughter.  What 
about that one? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  I -- I think that the problem 

is that that has to be during the life of the father. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  Does it?  It doesn't say 
it.  I mean, it seemed to me easier to work with that 
one than the one you're trying to work with.  But I -- I 
don't know.  You're the -- but -- but anyway, what I'm 
worried about here --

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I -- well, I don't want 

to argue against my position, Justice Breyer, but --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, I know. 
(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  What I'm actually 

worried about and want you to address is I just -- if we 
were to adopt what you said, what they're concerned 
about is many different applicants coming back later.

That's what State intestacy is concerned about.  And you 
don't really know who their parents is.  Another thing 
is there are already children who are eating up all of 
the money.  And then some new person shows up, and you 
have to take the money away from the other children in 
order to give it to this new child.  And all the time, 
you don't know if that's what the parent who is dead 
really wanted. 

And so, that's why the States have gone into 
all kinds of writing requirements.  And -- and you want 
us to sort of -- applying this old law to new 
technology, just overlook those complications. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, Congress wrote a 

Federal definition of "child," and it's not an 
extraordinary thing for Congress to write a statute that 
has language that applies in certain circumstances, and 
the world changes.  New developments require application 
of the statutory text to those new developments. 

If our reading of the statute is correct --

if what we think that Congress had in mind when it wrote 
this statute was that it wanted to set in place 
categories of applicants for child benefits as to whom 
parentage in a relevant sense could be determined with 
certainty, and it did that by focusing on the status of 
the marital relationship between the parents, and it did

it by providing an alternative basis in section (h) --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, that would be fine 
if the statute said what you claim it says.  It says a 
child is a child of a wage earner.  And you'd have to 
import these things that Congress didn't say to get to 
what you claim is the plain meaning.  But what do you do 
with the sentence in (h)(2)(A) that says "in determining 
whether an applicant is a child of an insured individual 
for purposes of this subchapter"?  The subchapter is not 
for purposes of (h), but for purposes of the entire 
subchapter, which would include (e). 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Right.  And I think actually 

that is a helpful point for us, Justice Ginsburg, 
because in determining whether an applicant is a child 
for purposes of the subchapter, it's referring to the 
use of the word "child" in the generic sense, in the 
sense -- when -- when Congress said a child is defined 
to include people who fall in these various categories 
of children.  So, everybody --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But how could it do that 

when the rest of the sentence says, "to determine 
whether an applicant is a child for purposes of this 
subchapter, the Commissioner shall apply the State law 
of intestacy"? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  But I -- I think that -- that

these two sentences have to be read together as 
accomplishing the same thing.  What I think what the --
it's saying that in making the determination whether or 
not a child qualifies for child benefits, that the 
Commissioner -- applicants who according to such law 
would have the same status relative to taking intestate 
personal property as a child shall be deemed such. 

I think one can't apply the statute without 

knowing who a child is, because it -- it is directing 
the Commissioner to engage in a comparison.  It's 
directing the Commissioner to say:  Does this applicant 
have the same status as a child? 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that's exactly right, 
Mr. Rothfeld.  But you have two choices.  In the second 
sentence, you do have two groups, and one has to be 
compared to the other, which is children.  The question 
is, are children described by the first sentence of 
that, or are children described by the (e) section? 

So, you're just reading the first sentence 
out of the statute and saying that the second sentence 
totally subsumes the first sentence, and we have to go 
back to (e). 

But the first sentence exists.  And it says: 
Who are children?  Children are who they are under State 
law.

MR. ROTHFELD:  No, and I -- I think that 

what it's telling the Commissioner to do is to determine 
whether or not -- when an applicant who does not fall 
within one of the defined categories in section (e) 
applies for benefits, the Commissioner is to determine 
whether or not that child has the same status relative 
to State law as the child as defined in the definitional 
section. 

The Congress -- as I say, Congress said 

expressly that a child as defined in section 416(e) of 
the statute qualifies for benefits.  And so, I think it 
establishes a Federal standard as to what -- what a 
child is for purposes of the Act. 

The Court has to determine what that 
standard means to apply to any particular child. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, under 

Chevron, you lose if the statute is ambiguous.  Is there 
any reason we shouldn't conclude based on the last hour 
that it's at least ambiguous? 

(Laughter.) 
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's a mess.

MR. ROTHFELD:  I think the problem is that 

we are dealing with new technologies that Congress

didn't -- wasn't anticipating at the time.  I think --
one of the questions that was suggested to my friend, 
Mr. Miller, by Justice Alito, I think, that if the child 
who is the -- in 1939, who is the child of married 
parents, natural child of married parents, sought 
benefits under this statute and they were denied because 
some State developed an aberrant law of intestacy and 
said that such child would not qualify, would not be 
deemed to be the child of their parents, I think that 
that would have been regarded as a clear misreading of 
the statute. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How -- do you think that 

Congress thought of either of these situations as real 
possibilities?  Do you really think that the 1939 
Congress, or even the one that passed the later statute, 
ever thought that a State would disinherit a naturally 
born -- all naturally born children -- or that children 
could be born 18 months, 4 years, 50 years later? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They weren't thinking of 

either. 

So, the question becomes, given the language 
of (h) that says define "child" this way throughout the 
subchapter, why shouldn't we give that directive its 
plain meaning?

That's really the argument that you have to 

49

convince us of. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, if we have to convince 
you not to give the statute its plain reading, then we 
will -- not going to prevail.  I certainly recognize 
that -- that plain meaning has to control.  And as I 
suggested at the outset, the reason we think we prevail 
is that the plain meaning of this statute as was written 
in 1939, as it would have been understood by the 1939 
Congress that adopted it, was that the natural children 
of married parents, the paradigm of the situation of the 
child at that time, would fall into this category.  Now, 
it is certainly true, as you say --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's because every 

State law recognized them as such as well, correct? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  And every State law -- and I 
would put it the other way:  Every State law recognized 
them as such because that was the way in which children 
were understood -- the meaning of the term "child" was 
understood at the time.  And --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, if we're going back 

to 1939 understanding, wasn't it also understood that 
the marriage ends when a parent dies?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, there wouldn't be --

a child that's born 18 months after the father died 
wouldn't be considered a child of a marriage because the 
marriage would have ended. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I think that one has to 
look at what Congress at the time -- I guess I would put 
it this way:  If -- if the Court were to accept our view 
that Congress had in mind the children of married 
parents, the question is whether any particular child 
falls in the box Congress would have regarded as the 
marital box or the non-married box. 

Situations like this simply could not have 
arisen in 1939.  Congress would not have specifically – 
as Justice Sotomayor said, Congress would not have 
specifically had in mind, contemplated, the question of 
posthumous conception because --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Rothfeld, I know that 

the Government didn't rely on it, but just to satisfy my 
curiosity, how -- how can this child satisfy the 
requirements of (d)(1)(C), with regard to dependency 
upon the father? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  I guess two responses to 

that.  One, as Mr. Miller said, this -- that issue was 
remanded to be addressed by --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand.  But --

MR. ROTHFELD:  But the answer --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that is connected with 

this other issue. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  The answer -- the answer why 

we think -- and if I may, Mr. Chief Justice, answer. 

The reason that we think we would prevail on 

that question is because, as Mr. Miller said, Congress 
created a -- an irrebuttable presumption that the child 
of -- the legitimate child of -- of a parent is deemed 
to have been dependent upon that parent at the time of 
the parent's death.  And that --

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. MILLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
Since 1940, the Social Security 

Administration has consistently interpreted the Act to 
require all natural children to establish their 
eligibility under 416(h), either by establishing that 
they can inherit under State law or by showing that they 
qualify under one of the express exceptions --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Miller, what do you 

think is wrong with the alternative theory that -- that 
I suggested, that (e) is all biological children in a 
marriage, not in a marriage, doesn't matter; and that 
(h) is designed to deal with situations in which 
biological status is contested? 

MR. MILLER:  Well, I -- the principal 

problem with that, I think, is that it lacks -- it's not 
supported by the text of what 416(h) says. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But why do you think that? 

What would you point to in (h) that is inconsistent with 
the theory that I just gave you? 

MR. MILLER:  I would point to (h)(2)(B) and 
(h)(3), both of which are -- are the exceptions to allow 
people to qualify when they can't establish State 
intestacy rights, and both of which refer to someone who 
is the son or daughter of the insured person but is not, 
and is not deemed to be, the child. 

So, if biological parentage were -- were 

what was determinative under (e), and if you only looked 
at (h) when there was some question about biological 
parentage, it would -- the idea of someone who is a son 
or daughter but isn't a child would make no sense. 

And so, to give effect to those meanings --

to give effect to those provisions, to give them

meaning, 416(h) has to have broader application than 
just in cases of disputed biological parentage.  It is 
in fact the gateway through which everyone has to pass, 
and that's how the -- the agency has -- has so regarded 
it. 

The final point I would make is simply that, 

even if the statute were silent on whether to look to 
State law, it would be appropriate for the Court to 
hesitate, I think, before creating what in effect is a 
body of Federal common law about parental status.  Here, 
of course, there's an express textual command the 
other way.  And it would be particularly inappropriate 
to create, as Respondents are urging, a Federal rule 
that goes well beyond what any State would allow in the 
context of --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Why doesn't the last 
sentence of -- what is it -- (h)(2)(A) show that 
Congress had in mind a certain idea of a category of 
people who were indisputably children?  I don't see how 
you can get around that, because it says what you're 
looking for under State law is to determine whether 
someone has the same status relative to taking intestate 
personal property as a child. 

MR. MILLER:  I think the answer to that is 
the one suggested by Justice Kagan a few minutes ago,

and that is that you have to read the first and second 
sentences together.  And the first sentence sets up a 
general rule that you're looking to State law, and then 
the second is about people who would have the same 
status as children under State law.  So, that the basic 
background definition in either case is coming from 
State law. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So, if the person is a 

child -- you have applicants who according to State law 
had the same status as a child, a person has that status 
because the person is a child, and the person is deemed 
to be a child, it seems very clear that that shows that 
(h) -- that this provision is directed to people that 
Congress in 1939 did not think fell within this paradigm 
of a child. 

MR. MILLER:  The -- well, the second --

maybe, I may be misunderstanding you, but our view of 
what the second sentence does is that it covers people 
who are not treated as children, who are not children 
under State law but nonetheless have the inheritance 
rights of children.  So, principally the -- in the case 
of equitable adoption, those people would have the 
status of children. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Mr. Miller, Mr. Rothfeld.
