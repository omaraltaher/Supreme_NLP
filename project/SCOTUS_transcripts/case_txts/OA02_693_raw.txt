          CHIEF JUSTICE  REHNQUIST:   We'll hear  argument

first this morning in No. 02-693, John Lamie v. the United

States Trustee.

          Mr. Goldstein.

           ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:   Mr. Chief  Justice, and may  it

please the Court:

          The parties to this case agree on one thing, and

that  is  that  section  330(a)  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code

contains a mistake of some  kind.  Now, we disagree  about

what the mistake is, but there clearly is one. 

          The  United  States  Trustee,  for  all  of  its

rhetoric  about the  statute's plain  text, actually  says

that  the  statute contains  two  errors in  two different

places,   but   the   list    of   compensable   providers

inadvertently  includes a  reference  to the  attorney and

that the  statute's so-called  payees' list  inadvertently

omits the necessary conjunction or. 

          We say there  was a different mistake,  that the

payees'  list inadvertently  omits  the  reference to  the

debtor's  attorney,  and our  reading  of the  two  is the

superior one.  It is  the one that's most consistent  with

the -- the structure of  the statute as a whole,  with the

past bankruptcy  practice, with  the legislative  history,

and frankly, with common sense. 

          QUESTION:  Mr. Goldstein, who's covered  by fees

available for a professional person employed under section

327 or 1103?

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That would  be an attorney who's

retained by a trustee, and according to the  U.S. Trustee,

it would  also  be an  attorney retained  by  a debtor  in

possession in a chapter 11 case.

          The -- 

          QUESTION:  But not chapter 7.

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:   That's correct.  The  reason --

and  let me  take you  through the  statutory scheme,  and

perhaps  I should take  you --  everyone to the  text, and

it's in the blue brief at page 2a of the appendix.

          QUESTION:     That's,  obviously,   of  critical

importance.   One piece  of background information please.

Could the chapter  11 court  have authorized the  debtor's

attorney to do this work?  I mean, how does  that work?  I

-- and I  -- I do agree that  the chapter 7 --  the -- the

debtor's attorney really is often required to do some very

important things to get the  chapter 7 filed.  But  if the

-- if it's an 11 first, as this one was, could the chapter

11 court have authorized the work to be done?

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:   According to the  U.S. Trustee,

no.  Let  me, if I could, just  step back and put  this in

context.    This  is  a  converted case,  just  like,  for

example, the Hartford  Underwriters case this Court  had a

few terms ago.   And so I  take it the question  might be,

look, if they were a debtor's attorney at one point -- and

we all  agree that  for the  chapter 11  proceedings, they

clearly  were authorized to be paid  under 330(a) -- could

that authorization have continued?  And I think the answer

is  no   because  at  some  point  there  will  be  a  fee

application and the fee application  will be under 330(a),

and  what  will happen  is exactly  what happened  in this

case.   The U.S. Trustee or  the objector will  say, look,

for the period that it was a chapter 7, there's a -- a gap

in the statute.

          QUESTION:   Even if  you tell  the court  in the

chapter 11 proceeding, we're going to go to 7 and we  need

the debtor to do  some work, the -- the court  just has no

power to authorize that work I guess is your position.

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Oh, no, no, no.  Our position is

to the contrary.  The  U.S. Trustee's position is that  it

-- they're  without  power.   I  think it's  an  important

point.

          We view the structure of  the statute to operate

just  as it  has for --  the Bankruptcy  Code has  for 100

years,  and  that  is,  that  the  bankruptcy court  is  a

gatekeeper.  It has to decide, in what are now the literal

terms of the statute, whether the services of the debtor's

attorney are both necessary and beneficial to the estate.

          The position of  the U.S.  Trustee is that  even

when the services are both necessary and beneficial to the

estate --  that is  to say,  even when  they produce  more

money  for the creditors, which is  the whole point, after

all  --  you still  can't  perform  the  services  and  be

compensable --

          QUESTION:   Well, why can't the -- I mean, their

argument is the trustee can  do it.  The trustee's  object

is the maximize the -- the value for the estate and so on,

and -- and  therefore there's no built-in  conflict there.

Why isn't that a way out of this drafting mess?

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:   Because  there are  things that

the  Bankruptcy  Code  assigns  as responsibility  to  the

debtor,  not the trustee.   And second, the provision that

-- and so let me -- let me separate --

          QUESTION:   No, but is there any conflict in the

trustee  saying,  look, you  can do  these things  for the

debtor and I'll pay you?

          MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.   Let  me take you  to the

relevant  statutory provision.   This one  is in  the gray

brief in the appendix.  That's 327(e).  There is a passing

suggestion in  the Government's  brief --  and, Mr.  Chief

Justice, that  is at 1a  of the gray  brief.  It's  at the

bottom.  There is a suggestion by the U.S. Trustee that if

the debtor's attorney  really needs  to do something,  the

trustee's lawyer will hire the  debtor's lawyer, and so it

all will work out in the end, and I take it that's a point

you're picking up. 

          The statute is much more limited than that.   It

says the trustee,  with the  court's approval, may  employ

for a specified  special purpose, other than  to represent

the  trustee, and it goes on  to say, an attorney that has

represented the debtor. 

          The way  this works  -- and we  have tried  very

hard to  find out  how often  this happens.   Mr.  Lamie's

firm, for example, has been doing bankruptcy for 23  years

and has represented  the debtor in more  than 4,000 cases.

In that  entire time, the  trustee has hired  the debtor's

counsel two times. 

          QUESTION:   Maybe --  not to  -- not to  be cute

about  it, but maybe  those are  the only times  he should

have.

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:   Well, we  know that that's  not

the  case, Justice  Souter,  because  the Bankruptcy  Code

does,  as  Justice Kennedy  has suggested,  give important

responsibilities to the  debtor qua  debtor, not that  are

distinct from  the duties of the trustee.  And let me give

you an example  of that.  And so those are jobs that can't

be handled by the trustee.   They're the responsibility of

the debtor. 

          QUESTION:    But is  there  any conflict  -- any

conflict of --  of -- you  know, ethical or  quasi-ethical

conflict  if  the --  if  the  trustee says,  look,  these

responsibility   --   you've   got   to   shoulder   these

responsibilities.  It's very  difficult for somebody who's

not a lawyer to do it.  Okay,  I -- I will employ a lawyer

to help  you.  Is  there -- is there  any conflict between

the trustee and the lawyer there?

          MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Yes, actually there is.  The --

the problem is  that the debtor and  the trustee sometimes

have  divergent interests.    That's  why the  legislative

history to 327(e) says we want to limit the times that the

trustee will hire the debtor's lawyer.  But --

          QUESTION:   Would you give me -- just give me an

example, a garden variety example --

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  An exemption fight. 

          QUESTION:  -- of a conflict situation?

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  An exemption fight. 

          QUESTION:  Yes, okay. 

          MR.  GOLDSTEIN:   When  you're  trying to  -- to

decide  whether  or  not  the  debtor  gets  to  claim  an

exemption. 

          And so  let me give  you a couple  more examples

just about how this operates. 

          QUESTION:  Before  you do, Mr. Goldstein,  is it

true  that  in  most  chapter 7's,  this  is  an  academic

question because  there's not any money to pay even the --

any -- the administrative creditors?

          MR.  GOLDSTEIN:    Yes,  but  the fact  that  in

relative terms, in terms of the percentage of chapter 7's,

it's not that  big a deal does not mean  in absolute terms

it's  not.  We know, for  example, that there are at least

40,000 asset cases.   In  particular, we have  complicated

business cases.  Hartford Underwriters,  which you all had

as a case, is an example. 

          QUESTION:  These end up as chapter 7 cases?

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:   Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.   There

are a  lot of converted business cases.  Generally when we

believe there's  going to be an asset, they are pursued as

a 11's, but lots of times the ability to keep up  with the

creditors breaks down and  they can get converted to  7's.

And --

          QUESTION:  Mr. Goldstein, you know, Congress had

this problem  brought to its  attention a number  of times

and -- and has chosen not to enact something, putting that

language back in.  That I find somewhat persuasive.

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  In all candor, Justice O'Connor,

I think that's  a point in their favor.  It's just not one

that's  going  to   overcome  the  other  indications   of

Congress' intent.  So let me  speak to that and then  what

the other --

          QUESTION:    Before  you get  to  the  intent of

Congress, I'm  rather stuck  with the  language.   I mean,

what we'd have to do, in order to come out your way, is to

read the  words,  the court  may award  to  a trustee,  an

examiner,  a  professional person  employed  under  327 or

1103, and the lawyer.  Is there one case that you've found

-- I'm sure you've looked because  you're very thorough --

in the history of the world -- 

          (Laughter.) 

          QUESTION:  -- where -- I couldn't find any,  but

I don't know all the cases in the history of the  world --

where  --  where, in  fact,  a court,  when  faced with  a

definite list  like this and unable to say, and other such

persons or  -- fool with the language.  Maybe you'll think

of some way of doing it  -- where a court is simply  stuck

in words of insignificance that weren't there because they

thought the  legislature had made a mistake.  Can you give

me a  list of the most  relevant such cases,  if there are

such?

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:   Yes, and then I  will come back

to Justice O'Connor. 

          The  point here  is that  there are a  number of

cases  --  and we  cite  these in  our  brief --  that the

expressio  unius canon, on which you're -- to which you're

adverting --

          QUESTION:  No.  I'm not adverting to any canon.

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well --

          QUESTION:   I am adverting to  the fact that the

words aren't there.

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:   Justice Breyer, let me  explain

to  why I think you are, and then  you can tell me why I'm

misguided, I'm sure. 

          (Laughter.) 

          QUESTION:  No.  All I want is the name of a case

where a court --

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  United States v. Wilson.

          QUESTION:  All right. 

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:    United States  v. Wilson,  and

then  I'll come back  to why I think  their argument is an

expressio unius  one, and then I'll explain to you U.S. v.

Wilson.   It's  on page  10 of  the yellow  brief that  we

discuss it. 

          The statute says  that the court may  award to a

trustee,  an  examiner,  or  professional person  employed

under section 327.  I'm back on 2a  of the blue brief.  It

has  a list.   It  doesn't say  only,  and there  are many

cases.  There  are legions of cases in which a list is not

regarded  as  exclusive   when  --   I  think  there's   a

presumption   of  exclusivity,   but  when   the  contrary

indications in  the text or the history of the drafting or

something else tells  you that Congress didn't  intend the

list to be exclusive, and this is such a case.  

          The  reason I  cite  U.S. v.  Wilson  to you  is

that's a case  in which the statute  referred specifically

to the Attorney General.  The Attorney General, before the

statute was revised, was supposed to compute the amount of

time  that  is given  as  credit from  pretrial detention.

Congress,  as it did with section 330, rewrote the statute

entirely, and  this Court  said, look,  we admit  that the

reference to the  Attorney General is  gone, but it  looks

like  it just got  lost in the  shuffle if we  look at the

other indications of Congress' intent. 

          Now, let me just make one other important --

          QUESTION:  Well, you think this just got lost in

the shuffle?

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.

          QUESTION:  That's why I'm  asking you a question

that I hope --

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.

          QUESTION:  -- you'll be allowed to answer --

          (Laughter.) 

          QUESTION:     --  about  what   about  Congress'

opportunity to correct it -- 

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  

          QUESTION:  -- which they didn't --

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:    Well,  this  Court  has  never

really taken  that view of subsequent legislative history,

Justice O'Connor, but let me turn to the events.

          In 1997, there were two bills that were proposed

in  the Congress that  were a  part of  general correction

legislation  that had a  variety of  different provisions,

including  one fix for  this one.   I think  the important

point is that at that time,  the only case in the circuits

interpreting the  statute as it  then stood went  our way.

It was  the 1996 decision of  the Second Circuit  in Ames.

And so I  don't think  you can  infer from  the fact  that

Congress didn't change the statute to confirm the  rule in

the circuits means that they intended to reject it.

          QUESTION:  Isn't there a  current -- isn't there

a current  correction --  bankruptcy technical  correction

bill pending, and isn't this absent from it?

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:   It is, but Justice  Ginsburg --

so now we have not  just the failure to enact  legislation

exists, but  the U.S. Trustee is relying on the failure to

enact legislation that doesn't even exist.

          The point, I think, is  that, look, if you  read

the statute,  if you  look at  it right  now, it's  simply

ambiguous.  There's a reference to  the attorney that's in

there, and a reference to the attorney that's missing. 

          This is  not a  case --  and this  is absolutely

critical  --  in  which  there  was  a  reference  to  the

attorney,  there  was only  one,  and it  disappeared, and

we're asking you to read it back in.  Our position is that

the statute, as written,  stands essentially in equipoise.

The two  references to the attorney in the 1978 version of

the statute were  inextricably intertwined, and so  if you

look at  the text right now, the fact that Congress hasn't

changed  it doesn't tell you anything about whether or not

they intend  it  to be  in there  or not  to  be in  there

because the split is almost even.  There's one --

          QUESTION:  But  now it has been  called to their

attention and it isn't in the bill making  other technical

corrections. 

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Ginsburg, I agree, and I

-- I'm  obviously not making this point well enough.  What

I'm saying is  that the inference  that would be  normally

drawn  from the failure  to fix a  statutory error doesn't

cut in  either direction here because,  as I began  in the

introduction, both sides  believes there -- believes  that

there's an error.  But we both think there's a  mistake in

the statute.  The fact that Congress  hasn't corrected the

mistake doesn't tell  us anything  about what the  mistake

was.

          QUESTION:      But,   Mr.   Goldstein,    you're

overlooking one  -- one  other argument  I think.   Before

this statute was enacted, the Association of Bankruptcy --

whatever the  name of it is  -- called their  attention to

this  drafting error  and  said we  think it's  a drafting

error.

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We -- yes.

          QUESTION:  And nothing was done.

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Stevens, let me put that

series of  events in  slightly more context,  and that  is

that in  the House, when the  bill was not  pending there,

there was a hearing, and there  is one line in a  718-page

record of just written materials submitted that says there

is an inadvertent omission. 

          The -- the  one canon of construction  that runs

through this Court's bankruptcy cases --

          QUESTION:   Let me just  add one thought.   They

said this appears to have been some minor drafting errors,

including the  apparently inadvertent removal  of debtors'

attorneys   from   the   list   of   professionals   whose

compensation awards are covered by 330(a).  NACBA does not

oppose this provision  since it  contains language and  so

forth and so on.  So they  -- it's -- one can read that as

saying even  with the error, we  don't -- we  don't oppose

the provision. 

          QUESTION:     Right.     We  actually   --  that

reference, we do not oppose this provision, we believe, in

the  context  of those  remarks,  to be  referring  to the

addition of section  (a)(4)(B).  Congress in  1994 added a

provision that's much debated in  the briefs about chapter

12 and 13  bankruptcies.  Remember,  this is the  National

Association  of Consumer  Bankruptcy  Attorneys, and  what

they were  not objecting to is the addition of a provision

that relates to consumer bankruptcies. 

           But  let's  be  perfectly clear.    The  -- the

United States has  scoured the legislative record  of this

change and has  found one sentence  in one House  hearing,

and  it  says that  it was  a mistake.   The  principle in

bankruptcy  is if there's a statutory  change and it's not

clear on  the text or at least in the legislative history,

it's presumed not to change --

          QUESTION:  But  isn't -- isn't it  possible also

to read this as saying, yes,  you made a mistake, but even

so, it's  still a good  bill and  we think  even with  the

mistake,  we're  in favor  of  it, and  then  -- and  then

Congress looks at it and says, yes, we did make a mistake,

but  -- but  the -- our  -- we'll  stick to  that decision

because the United States' position  now is that that's  a

wise -- the provision is a wise one?

          MR.  GOLDSTEIN:   It  is  important to  note, of

course, that when  the Department of Justice and  the U.S.

Trustee commented  on the bill at  the time, they  did not

say that this  would be the result of  the statute or that

they proposed it.

          But I don't  -- Justice  Stevens, I don't  think

that when someone  says there's a mistaken omission -- and

remember, it's of course at the time when the U.S. Trustee

says language  is mistakenly  included at  the same  time.

When  someone  says  there's  a  mistake,  that's  a  very

different  thing from Congress  -- let's engage  in all of

the false assumptions that people actually read this thing

in the  Senate and people paid attention  -- that Congress

actually  acknowledged,  yes,  we're  changing  bankruptcy

policy.    The standards  for changing  bankruptcy policy,

particularly a  policy as  settled as  this one, are  much

higher --

          QUESTION:   Well, are the standards for changing

bankruptcy policy in Congress different from the standards

of changing other kinds of policy? 

          MR.   GOLDSTEIN:     Mr.   Chief  Justice,   the

indications in this  Court's precedents  -- the answer  to

that question is yes.

          QUESTION:    And  what --  what  precedents  are

those?

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:   Those would be principally  the

line  of  cases that  begin  with  Midatlantic.   We  cite

several  of them,  Hartford  Underwriters, Ron  Pair, that

sort of  thing.  The Court  has recognized, going  back to

well before the '78 code and subsequent to the '78 --

          QUESTION:    Well,  but  some   of  the  --  the

Midatlantic, for example, was shortly after the Bankruptcy

Code was adopted succeeding the 1898 act, and there, there

was probably a good reason  for saying when you have  that

sort of a comprehensive revision,  the presumption is that

if  something  --  it's  not  clear  where  something  was

changed, we meant to retain the old.  But this wasn't that

sort of thing. 

          MR.  GOLDSTEIN:     That's  correct,  Mr.  Chief

Justice, but  I think that  the relevant  answer would  be

that Cohen v.  de la  Cruz, which deals  with a much  more

minor revision of the Bankruptcy Code than  even this one,

the 1984 revision applies  the same principle and that  is

this  Court  has  recognized that  the  provisions  of the

Bankruptcy Code  are incredibly  interrelated.   There's a

longstanding practice  that has  built up  over time,  and

that Congress doesn't lightly change it. 

          And let  me talk about why this would have to be

the --

          QUESTION:  At some point, will you go back to my

first question? 

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 

          QUESTION:  I just -- you have just a few -- 

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 

          QUESTION:   I mean, why  -- because I  looked at

United  States v. Wilson.   It  doesn't seem like  this at

all.   The statute there said  a defendant shall  be given

credit towards his  sentence for time previously  spent in

prison.    It's in  the  passive voice.    It doesn't  say

whether it shall  be given credit by  the AG or also  by a

district  court.    Well, obviously,  you  could  read the

language either way.

          What I'm  having problems  here with  is that  I

don't see any way  to read this language so that  it comes

out with  your favor without  putting in three  words that

aren't there.  And I  haven't heard from Justinian --  the

time of Justinian, a court  ever having done that, and  if

there is a court that did it, it wasn't Wilson.

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:   Okay.   I think I'm  responding

to --

          QUESTION:  You can have -- 

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I -- I  think -- I think we have

a new thread.   Perhaps the  best answer to your  point is

Green v.  the Bach  Laundry, which  is not  a case  that's

discussed in the -- in the  briefs, but I will explain how

this arises.   And that is,  Federal Rule of  Evidence 609

said, look, if there's going to  be -- if you're going  to

impeach a defendant, you get to use prior convictions, and

the  Court  looked  at  it  and  said,  really,  it   says

defendants, and we  acknowledge it means all  -- you know,

the  plain language  of  that is  all defendants,  and the

Court inserted the word criminal and said from the --

          QUESTION:  Inserted the word what?

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Inserted the  word criminal.  It

said  that  rule   609  would   only  apply  to   criminal

defendants. 

          QUESTION:  But  that's -- you're not  missing --

you're missing my point.  There are millions of ways --

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 

          QUESTION:  -- to read language in a statute --

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 

          QUESTION:   -- so that it has a limited scope or

a scope over here or only applies there.  That's so common

every day of the week, and very often I look at the policy

and I see if the statute is possibly construed in that way

through that  kind of limitation.  What I've never seen is

a statute which you just can't word by -- read by limiting

the scope or saying other things like this, et cetera.

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right. 

          QUESTION:   I've never  seen a  court just  take

three words out of the blue and insert them in that way in

a statute.

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:   All right.   Justice Breyer,  I

think  that I probably  am not going  to have a  case that

satisfies you, but I think that I can dispute successfully

the premise, and that is,  I do believe that your  premise

is that  expressio unius applies.  I promised I would come

back to  that point.   And  the text  says, the  court may

award to a  trustee, an examiner, or  professional person.

It doesn't say to only those people.  What I'm telling you

is  that  the  other  --   the  remaining  indications  of

Congress' intent indicate that Congress  did not intend to

limit the payment to go to those people.  

          And second,  this is not a case in which only we

have  a textual problem.  Remember  that the U.S. Trustee,

just as  you say we have to read in a -- a word, they have

to read out a word. 

          QUESTION:  Well, they don't have to read it out.

They just say the word is superfluous.  There's -- there's

no explanation for why it's  there.  But, you know,  there

are a  lot of  statutes that  have superfluous  words, and

that does  a lot less violence certainly to the statute to

leave in a word that doesn't have to be there than -- than

to insert a phrase, which is what you're asking us to do.

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:   I think you and  Justice Breyer

may be making a similar point here, and that is,  look, if

we had the text  and all we had was the  text, it would do

less violence you say, and I think  I can concede it would

do less violence to read in the -- the word rather than to

render the other one  superfluous or read it  out.  But  I

don't think  that's the  question before  you because  you

don't just have  the text.   If you --  this was all  that

there was,  you could  apply a  canon like  that one.   It

would do less harm, you know, the principle of  sort of do

no harm.

          But what  I'm telling  you is that  there is  an

ambiguity  in  the  statute, that  the  provisions  of the

payees'  and   the  providers'   lists  are   inextricably

intertwined, that the trustee can be paid for the services

of the trustee, the examiner for services of the examiner,

the  professional person for  services of the professional

person.   And then  there's this  gap for services  of the

attorney.   There's an  ambiguity.   And so just  like any

other  case  in  which you  have  to  resolve a  statutory

ambiguity, you look to other things. 

          QUESTION:    Why don't  you  just say  the first

correction, which is -- or the  first, in -- in your view,

slip is the elimination of four words?  That's really what

they wanted to do because  that's the lead provision,  and

then in the  subsidiary provision,  there's only one  word

that they  left in.   So  if you  -- just  looking at  the

statute, I  assume you would say the lead provision is the

main one  and the  other, the  subsidiary provision,  four

words in one case, one word in the other.

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:   I don't  think that we  have to

get down to the number  of words or syllables or  anything

like that.   I think perhaps  a more fair  -- if we're  --

again,  in the world  of tie-breakers looking  only at the

text, it's that  the U.S. Trustee's position  requires you

to  conclude  that  there are  mistakes  in  two different

places, in both the payees'  list, the missing conjunction

or, and the providers' list, the inadvertent --

          QUESTION:  But there  were umpteen illustrations

of missing or's.  I mean, we  really can't put much weight

on that. 

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, Justice Ginsburg,  I don't

think there's any greater canon  that says we find  errors

presumptively in second provisions rather than first ones.

There  are much  greater indications  of  Congress' intent

than that.  We have a lot more to work with.

          I do think I need to make two points.  The first

is Justice  O'Connor has, to some extent,  focused on what

happened here,  you know, what did Congress know.  I think

it's  important to recognize,  as I  started to  say, this

would be a change without any consideration by Congress at

all.  This statute started --

          QUESTION:   But  how can  you  say that  if this

material  I called  to your  attention was  called to  the

attention at  least of the staff of the committee?  Surely

the staff  would have  recognized that  because I  presume

they read it, and presumably they would have  discussed it

with the  Congressmen and said, do  you think we  ought to

make a change, and somebody said no.

          MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Right,  Justice Stevens, let me

distinguish two different periods of time.  I was about to

talk about  -- and  we'll come  back to  when this  -- the

words got  dropped out.  You're focusing later, and so let

me answer  your question  with -- try  and answer it  in a

somewhat different way,  and that is, the  only thing that

was pointed out to them was that there was a mistake.  And

if  you look at  the text,  you don't know  what Congress'

intent was.  Was it to leave the language in or  to delete

it?     Because   there  are  two   parallel,  intertwined

references to the attorney. 

          I had said that I would come back to  the '84 --

the '94 change.  This  is what the Fourth Circuit  thought

was so important.  That is, it mistakenly thought --

          QUESTION:  May I just get one other thought out?

What is the parallel provision that you say remains in?

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:   That is the reference in -- I'm

on  2a  of the  blue brief,  11 U.S.C.  330(a), subsection

(1)(A), what we've  called the providers' list.   And this

providers' list parallels the one in section 331. 

          QUESTION:  Right. 

          MR.  GOLDSTEIN:    Reasonable  compensation  for

actual,  necessary  services  rendered  by  the   trustee,

examiner,  professional  person,  or attorney.    So  what

happened is that --

          QUESTION:   Why -- why couldn't that refer to an

attorney appointed by the trustee? 

          MR.  GOLDSTEIN:    Well,  it   --  as  has  been

suggested,  literally  it  could.    You could  render  it

surplusage  or  you could  say  it's the  attorney  of the

trustee.  But a few things about that. 

          We know it really is  surplusage because there's

already  a  reference  to  the  attorney of  the  trustee.

That's the professional person.  This was one of the first

questions --

          QUESTION:   No, but it --  not -- the --  the --

there's another possibility:  any attorney employed by the

trustee.   And that's not surplusage.  You have given me a

reason why there may be a conflict involved if the trustee

does employ  an attorney for  the debtor, but  whatever it

is, it's not surplusage.

          MR.  GOLDSTEIN:   It  is,  Justice Souter.   The

reference in this  line to  a professional  person is  the

professional  person employed under  section 327.   That's

the  trustee's attorney.   The  -- and  the United  States

doesn't  dispute  this.    It   acknowledges  that  it  is

surplusage.

          QUESTION:  No,  but if  the trustee appoints  an

attorney not for himself, but for the debtor --

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Ah.

          QUESTION:  -- then it's not surplusage.

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I apologize.  The trustee is not

empowered to -- I -- I think I may have confused  you back

at the beginning of this.  The trustee is not empowered to

hire a person to represent the debtor.

          QUESTION:    I  --  let me  --  let's  assume  I

misspoke.  The trustee may  very well be empowered to  pay

the person employed by the debtor.

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No. 

          QUESTION:   That's a  way of  reading these  two

sections together. 

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  If so, we win. 

          (Laughter.) 

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  And there will be an explanation

to follow.

          (Laughter.) 

          QUESTION:  Why? 

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We all should assume that all --

the answer  to all the questions,  if so, we  win, because

what  would   happen  is  that,  remember,  literally  the

debtor's attorney may be -- provides compensable services,

and then the  ambiguity that Justice Breyer has focused on

and then you  have is that we have the  question of, okay,

who -- who gets the money.  Does it go to the trustee, the

examiner, or the professional  person?  So if  the trustee

gets paid  for the  services of the  debtor's attorney  --

remember, this  is a case in which  Mr. Lamie acted at the

request of the trustee -- then the trustee has to turn the

money over.  The money actually belongs  to Mr. Lamie.  He

provided  the services.    That's how  it  would all  work

together.  And that is, in a case like this one, where the

debtor's  attorney acts at  the request of  the trustee --

this  case is your  hypothetical.   The money goes  to the

trustee  who  then  obviously  has  to turn  it  over  the

attorney.  That's who would have the equitable interest in

it.

          If I could retain the balance of my time.

          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Goldstein.

          Ms. Blatt, we'll hear from you.

              ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

          MS. BLATT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

          The Bankruptcy Code contains no authority to use

estate funds that are held for the benefit of creditors to

compensate the chapter 7 debtor's  attorney.  Before 1994,

the code authorized  estate funds to be used to compensate

all   debtors'   attorneys,   but  the   1994   amendments

unambiguously  deleted the  chapter  7 debtors'  attorneys

from the class of persons eligible to receive compensation

under the statute.

          QUESTION:   It eliminated  them unambiguously  I

guess  from the  class  of  persons  entitled to  be  paid

directly,  but did  it eliminate  them from  the class  of

persons  who  might ultimately  be compensated,  i.e., the

class in -- in -- what is it?  Subsection (a).

          MS. BLATT:  Yes.  Only the -- if -- an attorney,

including the debtor's attorney, can still be compensated,

but he has to be appointed  by the court under section 327

and  then  he  stands  as  a  professional  person  that's

retained under 327, but that has to be retained under 327.

          QUESTION:  So -- so  the -- so the reference  is

surplusage in (a).

          MS. BLATT:  It's superfluous in this sense.  Our

reading of  the statute is the same regardless because the

attorney is  nothing more  than a  subset of  professional

persons. 

          QUESTION:  Yes. 

          MS. BLATT:   But  Congress  may --  it may  have

failed to make a conforming change, but it's also possible

that  Congress  specifically  left  the  word  in  because

Congress often  uses overlapping  terms to  accomplish its

objectives.  And it was doing  no harm there, and it would

at least  remove any doubt that even the debtor's attorney

could be  paid as long as  he qualified as  a professional

person that was retained under 327.

          QUESTION:  But  the word  attorney in 330  would

then have a different meaning after the amendment than  it

had  before  because  before  the  amendment,  it  clearly

referred to the debtor's attorney, did it not?

          MS.  BLATT:    That's  correct,  but there's  no

question  that the --  the code, as it  now stands, has --

omits the  debtor's attorney  from one  of the  authorized

people.  And what petitioner is basically seeking, Justice

Stevens, is a substantive enlargement  of the code because

he wants to do something, that is, receive a --

          QUESTION:  Well, he's arguing  the word attorney

means the same thing it always meant.  In other  words, in

330.

          MS. BLATT:  That's fine.  The debtor's --

          QUESTION:  And you're saying  it means something

different. 

          MS. BLATT:   It  could still  mean the  debtor's

attorney, but there's no question  in this case petitioner

was not  authorized to  be retained  by the  trustee under

section 327.   The debtor's attorney is  unambiguously not

one of the list  of people in 330(a) who  is authorized to

receive compensation, just  like a creditor's attorney  is

not on that list or a debtor's spouse is not on that list.

          QUESTION:     Why  does  it   make  any   sense,

considering  that the  code does give  obligations, duties

that must be  done by the chapter  7 debtor?  And  some of

them are pretty complex. 

          MS.  BLATT:    Well,  I  think it  reflects  the

fundamental distinction between  chapter 7  and all  other

codes.  That's  chapters 11, 12, and  13.  In a  chapter 7

case,  the bulk of  the work  is done pre-petition.   It's

advising the debtor  about which chapter to  file, filling

out the  schedules, telling  the debtor  what property  is

exempt, and so forth.  And in chapters 11, 12, and 13, the

whole game  is in doing a plan which is all post-petition,

and the  trustee and the debtor,  the -- excuse me  -- the

debtor and  the creditors  work together  to figure  out a

plan.

          QUESTION:   But -- but why doesn't that help the

petitioner?  As Justice Ginsburg is indicating, before the

petition is filed, a chapter  7 debtor has to comply  with

some rather  complex forms, plus be  advised of --  of his

duties and liabilities.   Don't take  assets out the  back

door and  so forth.   So  there's a  chronological problem

here that -- the -- the trustee can't appoint the attorney

until the proceeding  is filed, but the attorney is really

required to do some advance work.

          MS. BLATT:  Justice Kennedy, there's no question

that both before and after the  1994 amendments, chapter 7

debtors  retained  counsel,   but  they   do  so  in   the

overwhelming majority  of cases  with a pre-petition  flat

fee,  usually  $750-$850.    They  pay their  lawyer  pre-

petition.

          QUESTION:  And that can be paid.

          MS. BLATT:  Absolutely. 

          QUESTION:  That is paid the lawyer --

          QUESTION:     Is  it   established  that's   not

avoidable preference? 

          MS. BLATT:   Absolutely.   It's in the  ordinary

course of --

          QUESTION:  For current services? 

          MS. BLATT:   Yes.  This  is done day in  and day

out.    The  United States  Trustees  have  supervised the

liquidation of a million cases each year.

          QUESTION:  It  would be avoidable preference  if

it's too high, wouldn't it?

          MS. BLATT:   If it's  too high, but  I'm talking

about  the  standard,  routine  fee  of  under  $1,000  if

somebody  walks  in  because they've  been  overwhelmed by

credit card debts or gambling debts or had a divorce, they

need representation on how to fill out the schedules, what

types of property are exempt, and they retain counsel, the

counsel takes that money, gets the standard flat fee, that

-- and all the  services are earned pre-petition  with one

exception.

          QUESTION:   What  if the  -- what  if the  check

bounced and there's  now been a conversion to 7 and the --

and the lawyer  says, I ought to  be paid for my  11 work?

On your theory, does he get paid?

          MS. BLATT:   Not out of estate funds.  He should

probably  clear  --  have  the  check  cleared  before  he

performs the services. 

          QUESTION:  He clears the check. 

          QUESTION:  Yes. 

          MS. BLATT:  Bankruptcy counsel do this --

          QUESTION:    So  you're  saying at  this  point,

regardless of chapter 11 work,  chapter 7 work, no payment

out of the -- the estate funds.

          MS. BLATT:  Not out of estate funds, but it's --

it's critical to understand that in  chapter 7, unlike all

other chapters, the -- the estate is frozen at the time of

petition.    98  percent  of all  chapter  7  debtors  are

individuals.   If they  have  a job  or any  post-petition

income or there are exempt assets, they can use that money

to  pay the --  pay counsel  to assist them  in completing

bankruptcy.

          And I want to -- do  want to address one very --

one class of very important  services that came up that  I

think, Justice Souter,  you raised, and  that is when  the

debtor  and  the trustee  or  creditors are  fighting over

objections to exemption.  They could also be fighting over

objections to discharge.  These  are serious matters where

often the debtor  is accused of misconduct  and the debtor

will need  a lawyer.  There's no question that even before

the  1994 amendments, the  overwhelming majority of courts

would have held that those  are services that benefit  the

personal --  that go to the personal benefit of the debtor

and  not  the estate.    And  they  would  not  have  been

compensable even before 1994, and if this -- if this Court

is going to take the extraordinary step of writing it back

in, it will not affect those cases.  And so --

          QUESTION:  Let me ask you about --

          MS. BLATT:  Sure. 

          QUESTION:   -- a  provision of  the statute  you

didn't include in your brief, or at least in the appendix.

Section 329 --

          MS. BLATT:  Yes.

          QUESTION:     --  specifically   authorizes  the

debtor's attorney to  receive a retainer, as  I understand

it.

          MS. BLATT:  That's for the code as it -- what --

this is a -- a pro-creditor provision that recognizes that

debtors  will  often  go  to   counsel  before  they  file

bankruptcy,   and  anyone,   whether   or  not   you  seek

compensation under the statute, any  lawyer for any debtor

who ultimately files for bankruptcy  has to disclose their

fee arrangement, and the court  can order the cancellation

of  it   or  return  of  the  fee  if  it's  excessive  or

unreasonable.

          QUESTION:   But  -- but  if the  court  does not

order a  cancellation of it, it seems to me that provision

contemplates a payment  to the  debtor's attorney for  his

services to the debtor.

          MS. BLATT:   Pre-petition.  This is for a -- any

type of fee arrangement that's pre-petition whether or not

you apply for  compensation.  There  are many cases  where

the chapter  -- excuse me -- the debtor's counsel will, in

fact, be paid under 12, under 13, under 11, and those --

          QUESTION:    This  refers to  7.    I  think 329

applies to chapter 7 cases. 

          MS. BLATT:   Right.  Any -- any debtor.  Even if

there was an express prohibition  for money for the estate

to be paid, section 329  would still independently operate

to require  the counsel to disclose his fee agreement.  It

applies whether or  not compensation is ever  sought under

330.

          QUESTION:  Well,  in section (b), it  authorizes

the  court to cancel  it --  cancel the agreement  if it's

unreasonable compensation.  So  it seems to me  it applies

that  if  the  compensation  was  reasonable,  they  could

approve it.

          MS. BLATT:   Right,  but that's  -- that's  pre-

petition. 

          QUESTION:  Well, I understand, but the money has

to be paid pre-petition.   Here, of course, it was, but he

kept it in escrow instead of putting it in his pocket.

          MS. BLATT:   That's right.   So it  remained the

funds of the estate and it had to be paid under 330 and it

was -- it was not a question of 329.

          But the  other -- other point I want to get back

on why this serves reasonable  policy objectives, not only

does the individual debtor have the ability to pay counsel

with either  his exempt assets, his  post-petition income,

or a  pre-petition flat  fee, but  chapter  7, unlike  all

other cases,  it is  the trustee  and not  the debtor  who

manages, represents, and  liquidates the estate.   And the

code  gives  the  trustee  the  explicit  authority  under

section 327  of the code to retain  counsel, including the

debtor's counsel, to take actions that further the benefit

-- the best interests of the estate.

          QUESTION:  But not that  would assist the debtor

in the exemption example.

          MS. BLATT:  No.   That's exactly right.  If  the

--  if  for some  reason  the trustee  could  not read  an

accounting form and  the debtor's counsel  couldn't answer

it, the trustee  can go retain a  professional person like

an accountant, and if the  trustee needs a lawyer to  take

actions to further the best interests of the estate, it is

true  that  that lawyer  represent  the --  represents the

estate,  but  there's no  reason  he can't  meet  with the

debtor and help him explain something. 

          But 96 percent of all chapter 7 cases, there are

no assets in the estate to begin with.  These are the kind

of cases I was talking about, where they are  covered by a

routine flat fee that covers --

          QUESTION:    I  really   don't  understand  that

argument  because  this  case just  involves  the  other 4

percent, and  there are a lot  of cases in  the 4 percent,

aren't there?  Several thousand.

          MS. BLATT:  That's true, and in those cases --

          QUESTION:  So what difference  does it make that

96  percent -- it  doesn't make  any difference.   I don't

understand that argument. 

          MS.  BLATT:  I  think it  goes to the  idea that

given  that  there's  a  plain  absence of  any  statutory

authority to do this, the  question is, is this some  sort

of absurd result  that Congress  could not have  plausibly

intended?   And in the 4 percent of categories where there

are assets,  Justice Stevens, the  trustee represents  the

estate.   He  manages it  and he  liquidates it.   And  if

there's  money  to  be  paid to  --  for  counsel  and the

counsel's services are  needed, the  trustee can use  that

money and retain counsel.  At the same time, the chapter 7

debtor --

          QUESTION:  Has  retained counsel  to do work  to

benefit the estate, not retained  counsel to represent the

debtor.

          MS. BLATT:  That's right.  And at the same time,

there is --

          QUESTION:  Which he could have done before 1996.

          MS. BLATT:   Right.  And there's  nothing in the

1994 amendments that  prevents the debtor from  taking his

post-petition salary, his exempt assets --

          QUESTION:   Not  if he's  a company, as  in this

case.

          MS. BLATT:  Right.  In  a -- in a company,  Your

Honor, it's important,  Justice Ginsburg, to keep  in mind

everything  like objections to discharge, exempt assets --

none  of that  applies  to  corporations.    Corporations,

unlike individuals, do not survive bankruptcy, and so they

don't have  issues like  exempt assets  and objections  to

discharge.    You   have  a  defunct  corporation   that's

liquidating.

          And we think this case is a perfect illustration

of what  happens when you have a case with marginal assets

in  chapter  7,  and  that's  usually  where  the  --  the

businesses  with  no  assets  or  marginal assets  go,  is

chapter  7.   The trustee  had ample  authority to  retain

petitioner's   counsel,  and   in   fact,  what   happened

ultimately  in  this case  is  what --  the  bulk of  what

petitioner's counsel was doing was representing the estate

in a fight with a creditor and --

          QUESTION:   Well, he didn't have ample authority

to do it before the chapter 7 was filed, did he?

          MS. BLATT:  No.  When the case is in chapter 11,

the debtor is the debtor in possession with all the powers

and duties  of the  trustee, and  it's solely  the debtor.

There is  no trustee.  The  debtor has to  take actions to

represent the estate.   All that changes when it  converts

to  a 7.   Then it's  the trustee.   The  keys have  to be

turned over to the trustee and the trustee runs the show.

          QUESTION:  But  -- but  I thought you  indicated

that the trustee had ample authority to hire the  debtor's

attorney, and  I --  in the  chapter 7  proceeding, and  I

said,  true, but does  he have  the authority to  hire the

debtor's  attorney before the chapter  7 is filed?  That's

what we're talking about.  He doesn't have that authority.

          MS. BLATT:  This -- I mean, I'll try to take you

chronologically.  The case started out an 11, and then the

petitioner  was -- was  retained under section  327, had a

specific order, and therefore was entitled to be paid from

the estate.  Once the case --

          QUESTION:  For work done from that time forward.

          MS. BLATT:  Work done  just while it was an  11.

Once it's  in a  7, all  those duties  ceased.  There  was

nothing for  the corporation  to do  except liquidate  and

cooperate  with  the   trustee,  who  had   the  statutory

responsibility to represent and  manage and liquidate  the

estate. 

          QUESTION:    Well,  there's  no  trustee   until

chapter 7, is there? 

          MS. BLATT:   That's right.  Right.  Once -- once

it converts to chapter 7,  then it's the trustee's job  to

take over.  And the  trustee eventually did take over  the

adversary proceeding and  bring the  -- continue the  case

against the creditor.

          QUESTION:   And he  can hire  the -- and  he can

hire the  debtor's attorney to do  work in the  chapter 7,

but that  doesn't compensate for what -- the work that was

done before chapter 7.

          MS. BLATT:  That's right.

          QUESTION:  The work that was done before chapter

7 was compensated in this case. 

          MS. BLATT:   Yes, it was paid.  There was $2,000

of fees  in this case and  $3 in expenses, and  $1,000 has

been paid for all the work  in 11.  And what will  happen,

if  the Court  affirms the Fourth  Circuit, is  when cases

convert, the  debtor's counsel will cease  performing work

unless the trustee  actually gets a court  order approving

their retention.  The trustee  can hire its own lawyer  to

assist with its -- with -- with his or her duties  and can

hire the debtor's counsel for a special purpose.  And that

would have been like this case  where there's an adversary

proceeding either by or against the debtor.

          United  States  Trustees  have  supervised   and

overseen the liquidation of millions of chapter 7 cases in

the  9 years since  the 1994  amendments, and it  has been

their experience  that the  statute, as  written, has  not

interfered with the smooth functioning of chapter 7 cases.

          QUESTION:  Are  all trustees in chapter  7 cases

United States Trustees?  They're not, are they?

          MS. BLATT:  None of them are.  The United States

Trustees supervise and  oversee the administration  of all

cases  under 7, 11, 12, and 13,  and one of their specific

duties is to supervise trustees,  private trustees, who --

who perform their -- their jobs and duties as trustees.

          QUESTION:  Even if the Government isn't involved

in the case.

          MS. BLATT:  Right.  There's  always a -- there's

always a private trustee appointed except in 11 cases, but

the United States Trustees supervises and oversees, serves

as a watch  dog, looks at things  to make sure  there's no

waste, fraud, or  abuse, reviews all fee  applications for

the -- by the trustee, the examiner, the  debtor's counsel

in chapter 11 cases, and --

          QUESTION:   The  bankruptcy  judge appoints  the

trustee.

          MS. BLATT:  I don't know if -- Justice Ginsburg,

I'm not sure whether it's the -- the bankruptcy court does

appoint the trustee.  That's right.  But the United States

Trustees within the  Department of Justice manages  a pool

of available  trustees who  can serve  to be  appointed by

bankruptcy  courts.  And  so we oversee  trustees and make

sure they're fulfilling their duties.

          QUESTION:  Does  the bankruptcy court appoint  a

U.S. Trustee in every single case? 

          MS. BLATT:  No, no.  There are -- no.  There are

21 United States Trustees that oversee all the regions  of

this country,  with the  exception of  North Carolina  and

Alabama,  and   they  just  overview  and   supervise  the

administration of the cases in the sense of make sure that

the cases are actually proceeding  through the court, make

sure that cases that need to be converted --

          QUESTION:    They --  they  do that  without any

appointment by the bankruptcy court then I take it.

          MS. BLATT:  That's right.   Under 28 U.S.C. 586,

it's --  it's a laundry list of  specific statutory duties

that  the  United  States Trustees  have  to  comply with.

Under the  Bankruptcy Code itself,  in 11  U.S.C. 307,  it

says that the United States  Trustees may be -- may  raise

or be  heard on  any matter  in any  bankruptcy case,  and

that's why  they've been in  all of these  cases involving

fee applications because in their view,  given the -- that

there's just  complete absence of any  statutory authority

to pay chapter 7 debtor's  counsel, they've been objecting

to fee requests. 

          The one thing I just want to get back to  on the

statute is petitioner says that  the statute is ambiguous,

and we could  not disagree more.  There is  no language in

the code  that authorizes the chapter 7  to be paid.  What

petitioner  has  relied  on  is  a  missing  or  and  this

overlapping or redundant reference to  attorney.  But it's

critical to understand  that nothing about the  missing or

or  the  reference to  attorney  in (a)(1)(A)  affects the

substantive meaning of the statute or in any way prohibits

the  Court from applying the  literal language of the code

or requires  the code to  do --  requires the Court  to do

something the code prohibits. 

          By  contrast, what  petitioner  is seeking  is a

substantive  enlargement, and as far as we can tell, there

is no case  of this Court's jurisprudence  where the Court

has added  back language  in a statute  and where --  in a

substantive way  that Congress has specifically  taken out

when   there's   no   language   that   will   bear   that

interpretation. 

          If there --

          QUESTION:  If you're through, let me just --

          MS. BLATT:  Sure.

          QUESTION:   Maybe this is a  little repetitious,

but I  want  to read  you two  sentences  from Collier  on

Bankruptcy, the  treatise that most of us  rely on perhaps

too much in this area.

          After describing  the  Government's position  in

this, it  would represent a fundamental change in the law.

The treatise goes on.  Section 329 of the code permits the

debtor's attorney  to  receive a  reasonable retainer  for

services rendered in contemplation of or to be rendered in

connection with  a case under the Bankruptcy Code.  Such a

provision would be superfluous if  the deletion in section

330(a)  is construed  as  excepting  debtor's counsel  for

compensation under section 330. 

          What's  your  response to  that  again?   You've

partly responded, but I want to be sure you cover it all.

          MS. BLATT:   This is the reference  to attorney,

the reference to attorney in (a)(1)(A).

          QUESTION:  Yes. 

          MS. BLATT:  Your Honor, it's -- the -- the short

answer it's  -- it's  in the  wrong place.   The  critical

operative list  that provides the  type of people  who can

receive compensation is  in (a)(1),  and the reference  to

attorney just describes the type of compensable  services,

which also includes paralegals, para-professionals.

          QUESTION:  No.   They  -- they  rely on  section

329, which talks about -- 

          MS. BLATT:  Oh, I'm -- 329. 

          QUESTION:  --  that that's  -- they say  section

329 permits all this, and they say that provision would be

superfluous if your reading of 330(a) is correct.

          MS.  BLATT:    Collier  is   just  wrong.    The

provision is --

          (Laughter.) 

          MS. BLATT:    -- on  this point  --  is that  it

operates  independently and  requires a disclosure  of all

fee agreements  whether or  not there's compensation,  and

maybe another way of putting  it is is whether or not  the

Court rewrites the code, 329 is going to apply as -- as it

always has and require a disclosure of  -- of pre-petition

fees. 

          QUESTION:  What  was the --  the fees that  were

attributed  to  the chapter  11  phase, when  approval was

sought, wasn't that under 329  when -- there -- there  was

the --  the lump sum $6,000, and something over $1,000 was

attributed to the  pre-petition chapter  11 time.   Wasn't

the approval of that under this section 329?

          MS. BLATT:   Yes, Justice Ginsburg, by  both the

bankruptcy  court  and  the  district  court  because they

proceeded on  the erroneous  assumption, as  found by  the

Fourth Circuit, that this  was money that belonged  to the

lawyer instead  of the estate.  And if  it had been -- and

this was  an 11 case.   You don't  see in chapter  7 large

pre-petition retainers like  this because  the chapter  11

usually contemplates ongoing work after bankruptcy.

          But in this case, they did what most lawyers do,

is put  the  money in  the trust  account,  and it  wasn't

earned  --  it  wasn't  earned  by the  lawyer  until  the

services were performed.  But the bankruptcy court and the

trial court proceeded on the assumption the money belonged

to the lawyer, and so if the -- if the pre-petition  money

is money of the lawyers, then it's reviewed under 329. 

          But then the Fourth Circuit said, well, no, this

is actually money of  the estate and it has to  be -- it's

estate funds.  Those are held for the benefit of creditors

and there's  no statutory authority to use estate funds to

pay the chapter 7 debtor's attorney. 

          If there are no questions, we'd ask the Court to

affirm the Fourth Circuit's --

          QUESTION:  Very well, Ms. Blatt. 

          Mr. Goldstein, you have 3 minutes remaining.

         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

          MR. GOLDSTEIN:   Mr. Chief  Justice, the  reason

that the U.S. Trustees are not finding that this ambiguity

creates  a  problem is  that  there has  been  a shift  in

practice in those courts like the Fourth Circuit that hold

that  you can't  be compensated  as a  chapter 7  debtor's

attorney under 330, and that is people in bigger cases are

getting bigger and bigger retainers.   What's happening is

the scenario that Justice Stevens  described, and that is,

people are saying  I'm not going to be paid  on an ongoing

basis, so I've got to get more money up front.  That can't

be  a  result that  Congress  contemplated under  the U.S.

Trustees' vision of what Congress was up to --

          QUESTION:    But can't  that  be checked  by the

court under 329 and say that's too much?

          MR.  GOLDSTEIN:    Precisely,  precisely.    But

that's my point.  What results is the 329 fees are subject

to a Lessing standard.   They just have to be  reasonable.

They aren't subjected to all the laundry list of  330.  So

the result  of this change, if  there was a  change, would

only have been to decrease  judicial oversight.  Retainers

are subject to less judicial scrutiny.

          The second  point I  should make  is that  don't

come away  from the argument  that this --  believing that

this case is limited to chapter 7.  It applies equally  to

chapter  11 debtor out of  possession cases and chapter 12

and 13  cases  for services  that  are beneficial  to  the

estate, but not the debtor.   The U.S. Trustee has  always

pitched this as somehow a  case limited to chapter 7,  but

that's not accurate.  And the Pro-Snax case from the Fifth

Circuit,  for  example, is  a  chapter  11 debtor  out  of

possession case. 

          Third, Justice Souter,  I still don't understand

what the answer is to your reading of the statute. 

          Justice Breyer, Justice Souter said, okay, there

are a list  of three people  who can get  the check:   the

trustee, the  examiner,  the professional  person.   Fine.

But we  also know, as Justice  Stevens has said,  that the

statute's reference to the attorney has always been to the

attorney, the same reference to  the attorney in 331 is  a

reference to  the attorney.  321 says a chapter 7 attorney

can  get a retainer.   Justice  Souter has said  isn't the

literal language,  if we're  going to  follow the  literal

language, that the money can go to the trustee, to which I

said, and that's  -- you  know, the  trustee directed  Mr.

Lamie to do  these things, and therefore the  trustee just

owes  the  money back  to  the  debtor's attorney.    That

rationalizes all of the text. 

          The important thing then  in deciding whether to

follow the literal text is, is there anything  to support?

Is there a whit -- a whit  -- of indication in the history

of the  statute that Congress intended to do what the U.S.

Trustee has  hypothesized?  Is there a word that from 1898

to 1994 Congress decided to make  this choice to eliminate

fees  that are both  necessary and beneficial?   Those are

the only fees we're talking  about, those that benefit the

creditors.   Did  Congress intend to  eliminate them?   Is

there any  indication of  that?   And the  answer to  that

48

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

question is no.

          And that's important because the U.S. Trustee is

not correct  to say that when a  chapter 7 is initiated or

if the case is converted, that the debtor and the debtor's

attorney  leaves  the field.    There are  ongoing duties.

There's the 341  hearing, the meeting with  the creditors.

There is the duty of the debtor's attorney to transfer the

materials to the  trustee, to cooperate with  the trustee.

Here,  there  was an  adversary  proceeding.   The trustee

wasn't substituted as  counsel for 8 months,  and somebody

had  to  tell the  trustee  about that.    There are  real

responsibilities.   And we're  not talking  about, in  any

particular case, a ton of money, but it is important. 

          CHIEF  JUSTICE   REHNQUIST:    Thank   you,  Mr.

Goldstein. 

          The case is submitted. 

          (Whereupon,  at  10:54  a.m.,  the case  in  the

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
