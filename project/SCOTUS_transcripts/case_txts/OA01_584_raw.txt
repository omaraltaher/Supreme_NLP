CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now on number 01-584, Wanda Adams vs. Florida Power


Corporation and Florida Progress Corporation.  Mr. 


Crabtree.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. CRABTREE


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. CRABTREE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:  There are three core reasons why the


Court should hold that disparate impact is an available


method of proof in age discrimination cases.  First, the


Court held in Griggs that identical prohibitory language


prohibited facially neutral actions by an employer to


disproportionately impacted the protected class. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Crabtree, we are not talking


about a situation where you are claiming that the fact of


disparate impact gives rise to a permissible inference of


intentional discrimination.  You are relying just on


disparate impact alone, are you not? 


MR. CRABTREE:  No, Your Honor.  We believe that


disparate impact both serves the purpose of proving


indirectly that perhaps subconscious biases exist, as well


as detecting biases that could otherwise be concealed. 


QUESTION:  Well, now in Washington against

Davis, we held that disparate impact was not enough by


itself under the statute or Constitution that you could


infer from it an intent to discriminate.  Now, are you, I


didn't get the impression from the court of appeals


opinion that you are arguing that this plan by the


Respondent supports an inference of an intent to


discriminate on the basis of age. 


MR. CRABTREE:  We believe it does support an


inference of an intent, an intent that does not need to be


proven, that it justifies that it can justify the


necessity for the doctrine because without it, it would be


easy for an employer to conceal its intent for example, an


employer could choose a device like a five-year rule in


which they said that we won't hire anybody with more than


five years' experience or we'll have speed tests. 


QUESTION:  That's a very handy prophylactic


rule, but with it, once you, once you acknowledge that


indeed the malicious intent is necessary with it, with the


rule that you propose, you are going to get a lot of


employers that have no such malicious intent. 


MR. CRABTREE:  Justice Scalia, we are not


suggesting that malicious intent is required at all for


disparate impact.  We are suggesting that disparate impact


will detect that as well, or at least the provision --


QUESTION:  You just say it is bad in itself.

It is not bad because it shows malicious intent. 


MR. CRABTREE:  That's certainly true.  We


absolutely believe that. 


QUESTION:  Because if the only reason it's bad


is because it shows malicious intent, my goodness, it


seems to me it goes much too far.  There are a lot of


employers who have in place policies that may affect


elderly employees more harshly who, you know, have no


intent to do that. 


MR. CRABTREE:  That's certainly true, and


definitely, the doctrine goes beyond that.  But what we


are suggesting is it will also, it also prevents an


employer from being able to hide behind --


QUESTION:  Well, you want us to consider the


case on the assumption that the employer has no intent to


discriminate.  He actually has, his intentions are


absolutely pure, but in some instances, he is still going


to be liable under the adverse, pardon me, disparate


impact theory. 


MR. CRABTREE:  In many instances, that is


correct, Justice Scalia. 


QUESTION:  And that's your position. 


MR. CRABTREE:  That is our position.  That's


correct. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  So you are relying on

disparate impact alone? 


MR. CRABTREE:  That is correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  May I ask, because it's always


helpful to me to know, what's at stake in the particular


case.  What is the practice that you claim has a disparate


impact in this case? 


MR. CRABTREE:  What we have alleged in this


case is that the employer's reduction in force has had a


disparate impact upon the older workers, the selection


device of the older workers. 


QUESTION:  Are you saying reductions in force


are always practices that if they have a disparate impact,


give rise to a, an age discrimination claim? 


MR. CRABTREE:  No, Your Honor, because in


virtually every instance where there is reduction in force


it will be quite easy for an employer to satisfy the


defense under the reasonable factors of the age provision


of the act. 


QUESTION:  What is different about the


reduction in force in this case? 


MR. CRABTREE:  Well, in this case, Your Honor,


as the district court acknowledged in its opinion that we


are proceeding from, we had evidence at the highest levels


that the decision to undertake the downsizing was actually


a decision to get rid of, intended to get rid of older

workers. 


claim? 


QUESTION:  That's the disparate treatment


MR. CRABTREE:  Unfortunately, it's not, Your


Honor, because as the district court judge acknowledged,


we could not make a disparate treatment case under these


facts because in the disparate treatment case, we would


still have to prove, unless we could make a cat's paw


analysis that the actual decision maker harbored an animus


against the employee who is terminated.  But what we are


suggesting under this model and under this framework is


that if we can make a prima facie case of disparate


impact, then the employer can justify that impact by


showing that its decision was based upon reasonable


factors and that those reasonable factors --


QUESTION:  But this is what I -- excuse me for


interrupting, but is it the decision to downsize that it


has to be reasonable or the particular discharge decisions


on each individual have to be reasonable? 


MR. CRABTREE:  We have identified in this case


the action of the employer as being the decision to


downsize itself. 


QUESTION:  The decision to downsize itself? 


MR. CRABTREE:  Which for most instances will be


much more difficult probably for plaintiffs than it would

be if you want on a more micro-level.  However --


QUESTION:  Why would it be more difficult?  All


you have to prove if I understand your theory is that


there are more older workers in the group that were


discharged than younger workers? 


MR. CRABTREE:  Will, it would have to be a


substantially disparate impact between the two groups.  It


would be more difficult because it would be much easier


for an employer to justify a reduction in force in almost


any circumstance. 


QUESTION:  I thought you conceded that it was


not enough for you to show disparate impact.  That you


had, say 70 percent of the people and my problem with your


presentation is the same as Justice Stevens.  In every


disparate impact case that I know, a rule neutral is on


its face that disparate impact like the high school


diploma requirement in Griggs, there is the standard that


has a differential effect.  A high school diploma, a pen


and paper test as in Washington V. Davis, a height, weight


requirement as in Dothard vs. Rawlinson, but you don't


come to us with any rule, standard, practice.  You just


say reduction in force. 


MR. CRABTREE:  Well, what we are saying is


this, is that the Court indicated in Wards Cove that the


plaintiff in an age -- in a discrimination case is to

identify a specific practice or action by an employer that


results in disparate impact that cannot be justified.  We


have identified this downsizing as being such a practice


because we don't believe the employer can justify it


because the downsizing was motivated by desire to --


QUESTION:  Why don't we leave motive out of it


for purposes -- forget motive.  Let's imagine in your


case, that's what I thought this case was about, we


imagine in your case the employer had a wonderful motive. 


There are other cases where the rule in question was we


are going to fire some tenured teachers to save money. 


That was the real reason to save money.  The tenured


teachers tend to be older teachers.  There was another


case in which they said the court looked at a rule that


said we will fire people in the higher-paid positions. 


That was their real reason to save money. 


But the court said each of those rules like


your case, too, has a disparate impact on older employees. 


And just saving money is not a justification and therefore


the plaintiff wins.  Now, I take it that's the proposition


you are defending. 


MR. CRABTREE:  We are defending that


proposition.  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  Then the other parts to me


are easy.  Of course you can use it to prove bad motive,

et cetera, but that's the hard proposition.  Now, I wish


you would explain why as a matter of law that tough


proposition nonetheless is the law. 


MR. CRABTREE:  Well, we believe it's the law


because the prohibitions themselves as construed in Griggs


apply to actions and then the reasonable --


QUESTION:  Well, the background in Griggs was


racial discrimination, and the policies there seem to me


to rest on a long history of societal and historical bias


against black people.  Now, we don't have that background


with age discrimination, do we? 


MR. CRABTREE:  No, Justice O'Connor, we do not.


QUESTION:  So it might be quite a different


proposition here. 


MR. CRABTREE:  Respectfully, no, Your Honor. 


And here's why.  As the court acknowledged in Watson, the


court is not limited a disparate impact to remedying past


problems with discrimination.  Disparate impact goes


beyond that.  Disparate impact exists to detect


subconscious stereotypes operating in the work force,


exactly what the court identified as the primary form of


discrimination that exists under the ADEA. 


Thirdly, in Griggs the court said that the


legislative purpose of the act was "plain from the


language of the statute", so the court was looking at the

statute itself. 


QUESTION:  That's a good idea.  What is the


statute that we are dealing with here?  Can we look at the


language of the statute? 


MR. CRABTREE:  Sure, Your Honor.  It's on page


5.A, the appendix to the petitioner's brief.  And when you


look at the statute itself, what you see between (a)(1)


and (a)(2) is a difference between a micro and a


macro-orientation.  In (a)(1), we are concerned about an


employer's individual actions directed towards an


individual employee, but in (a)(2), we are concerned with


an employer's macro-actions directed towards its employees


and how that impacts individuals. 


QUESTION:  In each of those cases, Mr.


Crabtree, it says because of such individual's age.  Now,


doesn't that suggest that there is some motive


requirement? 


MR. CRABTREE:  No, Your Honor.  We don't


believe it does and I'll explain why.  When you look at


(a)(2), the clause because of such individual's age, the


word individual is critical because at the beginning of


two, it reads, to limit, segregate or classify his


employees in any way which would deprive or tend to


deprive any individual of employment opportunities or


otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee

because of such individual's age.  So the clause relates


to the effect and not to the motive of the actor. 


QUESTION:  I would think it relates to, to the


limit, segregate or classify. 


MR. CRABTREE:  It cannot, Your Honor, because


the word his employees follows those words. 


QUESTION:  In any event, the wording is


identical to Title VII, and Title VII on that wording has


been held to have this differential impact theory for sex,


as well as race. 


MR. CRABTREE:  That's absolutely correct,


Justice Ginsburg.  And of course, Congress has never acted


to expressly prohibit disparate impact under Title VII. 


The only prohibition of disparate impact under Title VII


is in its age as the court construed in Griggs and Griggs'


progeny. 


QUESTION:  Was this language adopted in this


form after it had been clearly established that the Title


VII language did include disparate impact?  You know, as


an original matter, I wouldn't have thought it did. 


MR. CRABTREE:  Oh, it did not. 


QUESTION:  We held that.  Now, was this


language adopted after we held that or before it? 


MR. CRABTREE:  It was before, Your Honor.  It


certainly was.  However --

 QUESTION:  After Title VII, but before Griggs? 


MR. CRABTREE:  That's correct.  And to hold


that this language does not prohibit disparate impact


would mean that there was no disparate impact under Title


VII.  Even in the 1991 Civil Rights Act, all Congress did


was define a defense. 


QUESTION: But it seems to me that even if we


accept your reading of the statute which I am not sure is


the more natural reading, you still have because of such


individual's age, that is to say what you would call


disparate impact, what the statute says adverse impact


must still be because of such individual's age and if we


think because of, implies or necessarily requires a bad


purpose, you still have the same problem.


MR. CRABTREE: If because of did require a bad


purpose, we would, however, there is two reasons why we


can, why it is not. One is that the first one is that the


reasonable factors other than age defense cannot make


sense if the prohibitions only apply to intentional


actions.


QUESTION:  Now you are going to the second. Just


so I'm focusing in on this.  (A)(2), it seems to me that


your reading of the statute doesn't explain because of,


then you have to go to this other part of the statute,


which you have to do any way.  So I mean this whole

argument over how to interpret 2 it seems to me doesn't


get you there. 


MR. CRABTREE:  Again, we are relating because


of back to the effect of the individual and we are relying


upon the court's interpretation of that language in


Griggs. 


QUESTION:  Well, one, one might feel that


Griggs is stare decisis because it could feel that perhaps


it reasoning would not readily be extended if there was


some reason for distinguishing it. 


MR. CRABTREE:  That might make sense.  I would


agree, Your Honor, however we don't believe there is any


basis to distinguish here given the court's subsequent


cases post-Griggs. 


QUESTION:  But as -- may I go back to the


question that we opened with, and that is I don't know of


any case under Title VII where someone could just say


reduction in force affected more women than men,


therefore, I have an impact case or reduction in force, it


affected more minorities than majorities so therefore. 


It's always been some specific practice that you could


identify some rule, some neutral rule.  In fact, it's even


sometimes referred to as neutralized base discriminatory


and impact. 


Here I don't -- reduction of force in and of

itself is not such a neutral rule.  It's -- it's too


general.  So I, what is the precise rule practice standard


that's comparable to a high school diploma, a height and


weight.  What is there in this case? 


MR. CRABTREE:  Your Honor, two answers.  First


of all, that we equate reduction in force to a test.  It's


a selection process.  We are not challenging a question on


the test.  We are challenging the test itself.  But even


if the court were to find that we have inadequately


identified the action of the employer that should be


subject to disparate impact analysis, we would still, it's


an interlocutory proceeding.  We would be happy to proceed


on the theory as the court redefines or the court defines


disparate impact under the ADEA.  We would amend our


complaint in accordance with the court's ruling. 


QUESTION:  I don't think that the district


court finding allows you to say the standard is the


reduction itself because the district judge said that the


people involved held a wide variety of jobs, were managed


and supervised by different people and were terminated at


different times by different decision makers based on


different considerations of criteria, and that seems to me


just wholly to reject that there is a rule or a standard. 


MR. CRABTREE:  The reason why we believe it's


important to be able to do the analysis with the reduction

of force being the action is because otherwise it would


allow an employer to purposely choose to do a reduction in


force to get rid of its older workers where there is a


corporate culture pervaded by ageism and have consequences


as it did here where it greatly reduced the age of its


work force. 


QUESTION:  What is your closest precedent under


Title VII dealing with race or dealing with sex where you


have something so groundly general as a reduction in force


with different decisions, different standards, different


times? 


MR. CRABTREE:  There are cases dealing with


reduction of force under Title VII.  There is one NAACP


vs. Medical Center, Inc., It was out of the third circuit. 


657 F.2d 1322.  There have probably been others. 


QUESTION:  And nothing more specific than a


reduction in force? 


MR. CRABTREE:  Candidly, Justice Ginsburg, I


don't recall. I just know --


QUESTION:  Mr. Crabtree, I thought the question


on which we granted certiorari was not whether this


particular claim of disparate impact was too general or


not specific enough.  But whether the whole, I'll read it,


is a disparate impact method of proving age discrimination


available to plaintiffs.

 MR. CRABTREE:  That's correct, Justice Scalia. 


QUESTION:  And I would hope you would address


Justice Breyer's question in which he said why should we


do this to say that tenured employees are the higher


salaried employees?  What would be the justification in a


case such as that for using your theory of liability? 


MR. CRABTREE:  Well, in most instances,


employer is going to be able to explain why he engages in


any selection process. 


QUESTION:  Most instances, they can't explain


it very well.  In most instances, I think in a business or


a university, you begin to look into it, and it dissolves


in front of your eyes.  People say you could do it this


way, you could do it that way, you could do it some other


way, and it will turn out you haven't thought about it


that much.  Now, it may well be sensible to make an


employer go to that effort we were talking about race and


gender, and yet here, there is so many rules correlated


with age.  There are so many that how could the employer


run his business where you are going to have a court


second-guessing every single rule that's correlated with


age.  That's the problem.  What's your response? 


MR. CRABTREE:  And that may very well be why


Congress chose to use the result factors other than age


language, and that is why there are, although we don't

agree with them, why there were good intellectual


arguments that reasonable factors other than age is


something less than business necessity.  That it is easier


to justify. 


QUESTION:  What would your test be?  I mean do


you think the ninth circuit in the cases I mentioned was


right?  I mean, if you are going to apply exactly the same


tough tests as in these other places, maybe they were. 


What's your opinion about that? 


MR. CRABTREE:  We believe that the term is


ambiguous.  And we believe for that reason the court


should defer interpretation. 


QUESTION:  Which is what? Say what you think


the form of words is? 


MR. CRABTREE:  That it is that the employer


must justify the action as being business necessity. 


QUESTION:  But reasonable factors other than


age provision doesn't really solve Justice Breyer's


problem, does it, because it puts the burden on the


employer to establish that, doesn't it? 


MR. CRABTREE:  It does, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  So you are still in a situation


where the employer said well he could have done it a lot


of different ways and you are saying I'm sorry, that's no


good.

 MR. CRABTREE:  But if the employer must only


show that its action was reasonable, it is not as


demanding as showing that it was necessary. 


QUESTION:  You said emphasize reason. 


QUESTION:  It's still a burden on him. 


MR. CRABTREE:  It is still a burden on him. 


Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  May I go back to the --


QUESTION:  Please. 


QUESTION:  May I go back to your argument of a


minute ago that the, that the various defenses make no


sense except on the disparate impact theory possibility of


disparate impact theory.  What is your response to the


argument that they make equally good sense on the theory


that they respond to mixed motive discharges?  What's your


answer? 


MR. CRABTREE:  They don't make sense on the


mixed motive analysis because in the mixed motive analysis


there is still an issue as to whether or not the


employer's illegal motive caused an illegal action.  In a,


in a statute, it provides that the action is otherwise


prohibitive, so you already have an action that is itself


a violation of the act but-for the defense that follows. 


We don't have the same concerns we have in a mixed motive


case where we don't know if the motive of the employer

actually caused the action.  It's already been determined


as a premise of the defense.


There is an additional reason why we believe


that the court should hold that disparate impact applies


under the ADEA.  And that is Congress passed the OWBPA and


provided that employees who were terminated in reductions


in force should be entitled to, were entitled to receive


physical information prior to deciding whether or not to


take the termination package, presumably of substantial


economic value, or take their chances in litigation. 


Given that disparate treatment can generally


not be predicated upon nothing more than statistics.  And


given that employees terminated in RIF's usually do not


have an independent basis to suspect that they are being


singled out for discrimination.


QUESTION:  Mr. Crabtree, could I just come back


for a moment to, to your argument which I think is an


important one that some of the defenses don't make sense


unless there is a discriminatory impact basis.  What about


the defense that says it will not be unlawful to discharge


or otherwise discipline an individual, an individual, for


good cause?  I mean, that's obviously a redundancy.  It


can only imply to an intentional discrimination case, not


to a, not to an impact case.  But it's obviously redundant


because if you are disciplining him for good cause, you

are obviously not disciplining him with a motive of


punishing his age.  It's just thoroughly redundant.  It


seems to me a lot of these defenses are redundant.  They


are just there to make clear that there are safe harbors,


one of which is disciplining an individual for good cause. 


Another one is observing the terms of a seniority system


and so forth. 


MR. CRABTREE:  Well, when you are observing the


terms of a seniority system, you know, you may be looking


at age directly.  You may have, you can easily have a


violation that exists under the act otherwise. 


QUESTION:  Well, no, I don't, I don't know any


seniority systems that go on the basis of people's age as


opposed to how long they have been working there.  Do you


know any seniority systems that say you have more


seniority if you are 65? 


MR. CRABTREE:  I'm not sure, Your Honor.  I


don't have an answer to that.  But I don't think that we


can disregard the words of the reasonable factors other


than age in this case.  I don't think we can ignore the


term reasonable factors, and when you look at, at (f)(1),


and you look --


QUESTION:  It's redundant.  It's just redundant


the way to discharge, it's lawful to discharge an


individual for good cause.  Of course it's redundant.  You

don't have to say that once you say that there has to be


either intentional discrimination, or as you would say,


adverse impact.  You are talking about disciplining an


individual.  You really don't need that.  Once you say


there has to be intentional discrimination, but it's there


just to make everything that much clearer.  And you can


make the same argument about the BFOA provision. 


MR. CRABTREE:  You might be able to make that argument,


but it is not the most logical argument.  It does not


respect Congress' words.  It does not respect the fact


that Congress required that the factors not just be


neutral, but that they be reasonable because even if we


ignored the otherwise prohibitive language, Justice


Scalia, we still have to give effect to the term


reasonable. 


Congress not merely required that the factors


exist or that they be legitimate or bonafide as in the EPA


or as Gunther acknowledged, but that they be reasonable as


well. 


QUESTION:  I don't want.  I think you should be


able to reserve your rebuttal time.  But I do have one


question.  You seem to acceed to Justice O'Connor's


suggestion that Griggs involving racial discrimination


involved deeply rooted attitudes which called for special


rules, and that those just don't apply with the age

factor.  Would you want us to write the opinion that way,


or are there some subtle biases against elderly workers


that are important to support your theory? 


If you train a worker, you are going to get a


better return on your investment as the worker is younger,


etc. 


MR. CRABTREE:  That's certainly true, Justice


Kennedy.  There are those subtle biases and that's what


Secretary Ward's report acknowledged and that's what the


court acknowledged in Hazen Paper when it said that subtle


biases, stereotypes are largely an issue, not animus in


age discrimination and that is consistent with the court's


holding in Watson that disparate impact exists largely to


detect subtle biases.  If I may, Your Honor, I'll reserve


the remainder of my time. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Crabtree.  Mr. Nager,


we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. NAGER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court: If I may, I'd like to address why fully


consistent and giving full respect to Griggs vs. Duke


Power Company, this Court can and should hold that the age


discrimination and employment act does not make --


QUESTION:  Even though the language is

essentially the same? 


MR. NAGER: Justice O'Connor, it's not.  It is


common language in Section 4, but this Court doesn't


construe language in a statute in isolation from the


remainder of the statute, and the remainder of this


statute is quite different. The remainder of the statute


includes the reasonable factors other than age provision. 


The remainder of this statute is based upon a report of


the Secretary of Labor which said that the problems of age


discrimination in the workplace were quite distinct and


quite different from the problems that motivated the


enactment of Title VII and it's the problems that


motivated the enactment of Title VII which gave rise to


Griggs.  That's what this Court said in Griggs.  It's what


your opinion for the court says in Watson.  So what, if we


look at the statute, statutory language not in isolation,


because in fact, we can read all of the court's Title VII


disparate impact cases and we won't see the language


parsed.  The court looked at that language in terms of the 


overall objectives of the statute, and rendered a decision


in light of the distinct and enormous problems of race


discrimination that this country has faced and dealt with. 


Age discrimination, the Congress itself recognized was


different.  That's why it didn't include age in Title VII. 


Instead it commissioned a report from the secretary of

labor to tell us about the problems of older workers. 


Recommend legislation to us. 


And the bill, the report that was commissioned


was submitted.  This Court repeatedly in EEOC vs. Wyoming,


in Hazen Paper, has repeatedly recognized that that report


set the foundation for the statute.


QUESTION:  I thought you were going to tell us


that because of age, is one of your strongest points, and


as Justice O'Connor said, that's the same language


structure that we had in Griggs, and that we would have to


interpret them differently. 


MR. NAGER:  You are right, Justice Kennedy. 


QUESTION:  But, but, but then you automatically


throw me over I guess to part (f) and talk about


reasonable factors other than age, which is exactly what


the petition wanted to do.


MR. NAGER:  That's my lack of clarity, Justice


Kennedy.  What we are suggesting to the Court is the more


natural construction of the language in 4(a), the because


of language, is an intent requirement.  The fact of that


intent requirement is confirmed and compelled by the


remaining provisions in the statute.  Our suggestion is


just as your opinion in Public Employee Retirement System


vs. Betts did. 


QUESTION:  May I just interrupt.  I want to be

sure I have -- you think that because of such individual's


age or more normally refers to the very first part of the


paragraph that talks in the plural rather than the


singular? 


MR. NAGER:  Yes, Justice Stevens, because the


structure of the statute says that the employer can't


limit, segregate or classify his employees in a way that


has an adverse effect on an individual. 


QUESTION:  On any individual. 


MR. NAGER:  Because of such individual's age. 


QUESTION:  Correct.  The effect that that


modifies, not the classification. 


MR. NAGER:  No.  The comma in that provision, I


think eliminates any ambiguity about what the because of


phrase modifies.  That it modifies the verbs to limit,


segregate or classify. 


QUESTION:  Even though the former is plural and


the because of is singular? 


MR. NAGER:  Because the sentence has to be read


as a whole.  It says limit, segregate or classify the


employees in a way that has an effect on an individual


because of the individual's age. 


QUESTION:  Right. 


MR. NAGER:  But the --

 MR. NAGER:  It is -- I would grant you that it


is not the most elegantly written sentence in the world,


but I would also urge upon you, Your Honor, that the comma


in that sentence grammatically compels that the because of


phrase modifies the to limit, segregate or classify. 


QUESTION:  Your view is well, Title VII, the


court really got it wrong.  They are not good grammarians,


so they got it wrong, but that's stare decisis so we'll


leave it alone, because it's the identical wording, the F


part I think you may have more of an argument there


because it's not found in Title VII.  But if your grammar


argument has to be saying, and tell me if I'm wrong about


this, the court really got it wrong in Griggs because


there is no room for an impact test under Title VII any


more than under age, but because the court said it in 1971


and continued to say it, we are stuck with it, but we


don't have to make the same mistake again.  Is that your


argument? 


MR. NAGER:  Justice Ginsburg, I'm not here to


challenge Griggs in any respect.  I am here to say that


the more natural construction of that language was not the


one the court adopted in Griggs, and just as this Court


does that on occasion because of other materials that


influence the construction of a statute.


QUESTION:  I mean, we look at the whole

statute, as you said, not just the comma. 


MR. NAGER:  That's the point. 


QUESTION:  The comma could be outweighed by


other factors in one statute, and not in the other. 


MR. NAGER:  And that is what the court has


found in its Title VII cases. 


QUESTION:  A comma is not a very big thing, is


it? 


thing. 


MR. NAGER:  I'm sorry, could you --


QUESTION:  I say a comma is not a very big


MR. NAGER:  Well, it is part of the statute,


and we think it has to be taken into account, but our


argument that the age discrimination employment act should


not be allowed to recognize disparate impact claims does


not rest solely on the comma.  Our point about Section


4(a), Justice Kennedy and Justice Ginsburg is that the


more natural construction of that language is the, an


intent requirement, as Chief Justice Rehnquist recognized


in his separate opinion on certiorari in Geller vs.


Markham.  The fact that the court found other


considerations to lead to a different conclusion in the


context of a limited class of Title VII cases does not


compel a particular construction of the Age Discrimination


Employment Act.

 We have to look at those other considerations


that inform the construction of the Age Discrimination


Act. 


QUESTION:  Well, I can see you point to (f) in


the reasonableness because there is no counterpart to that


in Title VII, but frankly --


MR. NAGER:  That's --


QUESTION:  Frankly, I would find it unseemly to


take the identical words and say we ignore the comma in


one case.  If we had paid attention to the comma, you have


to reach the same result. 


MR. NAGER: 


I don't think it's unseemly at all,


Justice Ginsburg. 


QUESTION: 


If you are wrong the first time. 


MR. NAGER: 


Well, I'm not here to take --


QUESTION: 


Which stare decisis would require us


to accept for Title VII but wouldn't require us to accept


for this statute. 


QUESTION:  That's the very point I made to you,


and you rejected it.  I said --


MR. NAGER:  Justice Ginsburg, this Court has on


any number of occasions, and I'll use the Chief Justice's


opinion in Fogerty vs. Fantasy as an illustration, said


that identical language in two separate statutes can be


given two different meanings by this Court if a single

meaning isn't compelled by the words themselves and if the


statute has different purposes or different legislative


history.  You coined that opinion. 


QUESTION:  But here we know even though Griggs


didn't come until sometime later, the Congress did, when


it wrote the Age Discrimination Act, it did copy quite


deliberately the Title VII language. 


MR. NAGER:  That is true.  But it is also the


case that it did not copy the 4(f)(1) language.  It is


also the case that at the time --


QUESTION:  But that's a different argument,


looking at the statute as a whole and saying whatever the


first part means, here we have another part that's absent


from Title VII so we don't have to interpret it the same


way. 


MR. NAGER:  I have two points.  Congress


couldn't have known about Griggs at the time that the,


that it used the language from Title VII in 4(a) because


Griggs hadn't yet been decided, so that was not a


well-established construction by this Court in 1967.  But


you are also right, it is the essence of our argument


here, not to ask the Court to construe 4(a) in isolation. 


It's to ask the Court to do as it did in Betts and as it


does in any number of cases to construe 4(a) in light of


the other provisions.  Justice Scalia has made the point


30

about the discharge for cause.  We also make the point


about the reasonable factors other than age.  That is an


intent-based provision and it shows that this statute at


every turn was concerned with employer intent, whether it


be good cause, whether it be decisions . 


QUESTION:  What you do you with the argument,


which I think is an interesting one, that it is a


reasonable factors other than age requirement. 


MR. NAGER:  It is --


QUESTION:  If, if there were an intent


requirement in the act, it wouldn't matter whether you are


using reasonable factors or not, so long as you are not


using age.  You know, I don't like people with blue eyes. 


That ought to be good enough, so long as blue eyes has


nothing to do with age. 


MR. NAGER:  As you have pointed out, Justice


Scalia, it's perfectly appropriate for Congress to clarify


and make unambiguous in any respect conceivable that it


does not want any decision that's based upon a reasonable


factor to be subject to liability under this statute. 


Secondly --


QUESTION:  Okay, but that argument is equally


compatible with the position that your brother is taking


on the other side, and if you take the ambiguity that is


left, and you combine it with the argument that Justice

Ginsburg is making about the parallel language with Title


VII, doesn't it lead you to say all right, the parallel


language is answered only by an argument which in fact,


boils down to an ambiguity and an ambiguity doesn't defeat


the policy of construing like statutes, like drafted


statutes in a like manner.


MR. NAGER:  The answer to that is no.  The


reason that it's no is because whatever one thinks the


reasonable factor other than the word reasonable and the


reasonable factors other than age means, it's still a


motive-based test based upon what considerations are you


taking into account, and --


QUESTION:  Why does it have to be a reasonable


factor other than age?  I'm not sure you have answered my


question?  So long as it's not age, the intent factor is


not satisfied.  You should be able to use an unreasonable


factor other than age. 


MR. NAGER:  You absolutely can.  Section 4 F


simply clarifies what's lawful.  It doesn't tell us what's


unlawful.  We only can find what's unlawful by going to


4(a) and reading it in light of the provisions in 4(a). 


QUESTION:  So you say it's a safe harbor


provision for sure if it's a reasonable factor other than


age, it's okay? 


MR. NAGER:  And it tells us more than that,

Justice Scalia.  It tells us that intent is what counts. 


Interestingly enough, our opponents in both their opening


brief and their reply brief concede that the phrase based


upon reasonable factors other than age is a reference to


an intent requirement, and the whole notion, as Justice


Breyer has pointed out through his questioning at the


opening of this argument, is what distinguishes a


disparate treatment case from an impact case is that


intent is irrelevant, so if reasonable factors other than


age --


QUESTION:  I don't really understand -- I must


say, I don't entirely follow the argument.  Supposing you


have a test that you have to have an IQ above 110,


something or other, in order to avoid discharge, and you


find that that has a disparate impact on older workers for


some reason, they lose their intelligence quota or


something like that.  Beyond the age. 


MR. NAGER:  Bad news for us. 


QUESTION:  Bad news for many of us.  But there


is statistics that show that.  And you might come back and


say I didn't realize that or something like that.  It


would be enough for you to show that, that that's totally


irrelevant because you just didn't realize that fact.  But


why then would they need to say you have to defend that as


a reasonable practice?

 MR. NAGER:  The legislative history and the


secretary's report makes quite clear why they put the


reasonable in there, because they were concerned about the


mixed motive cases.  This statute, when it was originally


discussed, the question came up, does this mean age has to


be the only factor that's considered in order for it to be


lawful solely?  And the answer to that was the secretary


came back and said no. 


We recognize that employers have been


considering age for a long time.  What we think the


Congress should prohibit is the use of age as a screening


device to filter.  Now, it will still be the case because


human beings are human beings that employers will still be


cognizant of employees' age.  They can't help but be. 


But so long as a reasonable factor other than


age is the basis of the decision, there should be no


liability for it. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but why is that necessary to


deal with mixed motive?  Why can't you recognize mixed


motive by recognizing unreasonable factors other than age? 


That's an equally mixed motive, if you would have an


unreasonable factor. 


MR. NAGER:  Well, every time that the mixed


motive issue has been discussed, this Court in construing


Title VII, in construing the National Labor Relations Act,

in construing the Constitution, the 1983 and Mt. Healthy


cases, has always put a verb -- an adjective, motivating


factor, substantial factor.  Congress is speaking in


common sense terms in writing these clarifying provisions


to make it clear that age had to be the but-for cause of


an employment action, and the employer had to intend it


that we give you the illustration, our brief of Judge


Wright's opinion for the D.C. circuit in Cuddy vs. Carmen,


which talks about how the two provisions were intended to


work in tandem just as Justice Kennedy's opinion for this


Court in Betts said that 4(f)(2) and 4(a) were supposed to


work in tandem to define the elements of a plaintiff's


case. 


Could 4(a) have been written and construed


without a clarifying provision?  Of course.  And we would


be taking that position whether that additional language


was there or not.  But it doesn't weaken our argument in


the slightest that Congress went further and clarified


what the standards would be in a mixed motive case. 


QUESTION:  Well, what, what does seem to weaken


the argument is leaving even aside the mixed motive


argument, you were, you are arguing that a reasonable


factor test is proof that in fact it was a, an, a


malicious motive-based liability in the first place.  And


it seems to me that what you are saying, if that is true,


35

then any motive other than the proscribed one is going to


defeat liability. 


MR. NAGER:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  And the odd thing is that you are


saying that by specifying a reasonable factor defense,


Congress was indicating that there would be an


unreasonable factor defense because reasonable or


unreasonable, if it's not age, there is no liability.  And


that it seems to me is an odd argument to say that by


putting in the word reasonable they are, they are in


effect confirming that an unreasonable defense would be


equally good. 


MR. NAGER:  I think the answer to that question


is that reasonableness goes, is a permissible, the


reasonableness of a nondiscriminatory factor that an


employer offers is something that a judge can consider and


if he finds a disputed issue of fact, a jury can consider


in deciding whether or not the nondiscriminatory factor


that is offered is a pretext for age discrimination. 


QUESTION:  But if you really held that reason. 


In other words, the reasonableness of the, of the


employer's alleged motive goes somehow to the credibility


of the employer's argument that it was his motive, is that


what you are getting at? 


MR. NAGER:  Correct.

 QUESTION:  As an evidentiary point, I see it. 


As a logical point for defining the statute, it seems to


me that it's clear. 


MR. NAGER:  Well, I understand your point,


Justice Souder, and I will be the first to acknowledge


this case would be easier if the word reasonable weren't


there.  But all the Court has to decide in this case is


whether or not the statute embraces a disparate impact


test. 


QUESTION:  Is there anywhere we can go, is


there any way if you were finished, were you? 


MR. NAGER:  Well, I just wanted to make the


following point.  Whether it's a reasonable motive or an


unreasonable motive, it's still a motive and that's


incompatible with disparate impact.  The question is one


of intent, not one of statistical correlations with age


and not one of accuracy and verifiability of business


judgment which are the two core issues in a disparate


impact case. 


What distinguishes fundamentally a disparate


treatment case from a disparate impact case is that in a


treatment case while statistics are appropriate statistics


that would satisfy Delbare are admissible, and can go to


motive, the issue that we argue to the jury is motive.  We


don't argue about whether or not the correlation is so

substantial that it itself would state a prima facie


violation and the jury is not allowed to question the


employer's business judgment if it finds that in fact the


employer was not motivated by age, and that makes a huge


difference at a practical level and a legal level in the


resolution of age discrimination cases, and that of course


is why we would say that impact claims should not be


recognized.  I'm sorry. 


QUESTION:  Is there any way, which I'm sure you


don't want to bring up necessarily, but is there any way


short of saying there is never a disparate impact claim? 


The problem that you mention could be alleviated.  If I


think, for example, that unlike race or gender, we might


go into an ordinary company and find dozens or hundreds or


maybe virtually every rule or practice or limitation


connected with promotions is correlated with age. 


MR. NAGER:  That's true. 


QUESTION:  On the other hand, you might have


some rules that are really correlated with age very


heavily and have no justification.  All right, so is there


a way of dealing with that problem short of saying there


is never a disparate impact case? 


MR. NAGER:  Well, there is a way of dealing


with it.  I think Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court


in Hazen Paper sets it out for us, but it doesn't require


38

the recognition of a disparate impact claim.  Justice


O'Connor's opinion for the Court in Hazen Paper says that


merely showing a correlation is not enough to create an


inference of disparate treatment, but the court left open


the question if the employer, the reason they used the


factor, there was evidence that they thought that that


factor should be used. 


QUESTION:  That denies my hypothetical.  That's


saying you are going to go over to intent.  What I'm


asking you is if in fact the language here does justify a


disparate impact case, a real one, what I have been


talking about throughout.  Is there any way to deal with


the problem of practicalities, which is a big one?  That


distinguishes this from race and gender. 


MR. NAGER:  Well, I can only answer the


question the following two ways.  I don't think Congress


contemplated which may be my legal answer for you. 


And I can answer it to you practically because


I advise employers on these issues, and the way we deal


with these issues now is not to change the practices


unless we find they are really ridiculous.  The way we


advise our employers to deal with these practices now is


to use quotas.  When we advise employers if they are doing


a reduction in force as to how to reduce the probability


of a disparate impact claim and the circuits that have

recognized them, we take out little five-year age bans and


under 40 and over 40 and we assess who is included within


it and who isn't included within it, and we tell them if


you don't change the numbers, you face a greater exposure


to a claim. 


Now, that is, I guess one way of discouraging


employers from having thoughtless, even though not aged


biased practice by the sword of a major lawsuit.  Whether


or not that's a legally common --


QUESTION:  But you don't have the power to do


which this case I guess does ask us to do possibly, and


that is also to look at the question of the defense here


and say what does it mean in context?  I mean, you could


say, for example, reasonably necessary means necessary. 


Or you could say that reasonably necessary means a


reasonable practice giving weight to the employer's


reasonable judgment in this.  There are a lot of things


you could say.  So I want your opinion on that. 


MR. NAGER:  Well, my opinion is that the


statute doesn't say reasonably necessary.  That's what the


BFOQ provision says. 


QUESTION:  BFOQ.  Based on reasonable factors. 


It's hard to get around that.  Based on --


MR. NAGER:  Yes.  It's, the entire phrase has


to be read.  It says based on it.  What are the factors?

And that's a reference to motive.  We know that from the


ordinary English language, we know it from this Court's


own cases talking about factors, and we know it from the


legislative history because the secretary of labor in


studying and reporting to Congress at Congress'


legislative direction distinguished between purposeful


uses of age as stereotypes of the abilities of older


workers, and other forces that adversely impact older


workers and what the secretary of labor recommended to


deal with your problem that you pointed out, Justice


Breyer, is not a coercive sanction that used, made neutral


practices with disparate effects illegal.  What the


secretary of labor recommended to Congress and Congress


adopted his recommendation in enacting the statute was the


promotion of education, training and manpower programs


both to get employers to better understand the talents and


capabilities of older workers and where older workers 


were --


QUESTION:  Isn't the answer to Justice Breyer's


concern about the employer who has an  unreasonable


criteria that in fact has a bad impact upon older workers? 


Isn't the answer that there is a sanction, and that is a


jury is unlikely to believe it. 


MR. NAGER:  Yes. 

That's the answer I gave,


but he told me I --

 QUESTION:  Any lawyer advising such, such a,


such an employer would say boy, if you are dragged into


court, and nobody is going to believe that you didn't


adopt this for the reason of getting rid of older


employees.  That seems to me --


MR. NAGER:  It's a much better answer than I


gave. I thought --


QUESTION:  It's a very good answer.  I wanted


to know whether there was also any other answer. 


QUESTION:  You gave that answer.  May I just


ask you this just to think through the problem a little


bit.  Assume I agree with you 100 percent that the


reasonable factors other than age defense is a


motive-based defense, why couldn't you have a good motive


defense to a prima facie case that's based on objective


factors? 


MR. NAGER:  Well, I don't think it's a defense. 


I should state that.  I think that the provision is not in


there as an affirmative defense.  I think the provision is


in there to clarify what the scope of the prohibition is. 


QUESTION:  Well, even as read in a defense, it's


an exclusion category case, the motive.  But whether it's


a defense or an exclusion, the fact that it is


motive-based doesn't seem to me necessarily to mean that


the prima facie case must also be motive-based.

 MR. NAGER:  If we are talking about a disparate


treatment case, I agree with you, Justice Stevens, that in


an appropriate case with an appropriate statistical


presentation, a judge would be justified in saying that


the plaintiff has presented enough evidence to require the


employer to respond to a disparate treatment allegation. 


Now, you know, it's hard to speak universally about


statistical presentations.  Most of them in my experience


may satisfy Delbare, but don't tell us very much about the


real merits of the case, but if we adopt as the premise


that you have got a particularly powerful statistical


presentation, I don't think there is any case law and


certainly not from this Court because Teamsters and cases


like that say that statistics are admissible to prove


intent, that a plaintiff couldn't have statistics alone as


their prima facie case, but it would be about intent, and


the employer would be responding about its own intent.  It


wouldn't be responding about as the employer does in Title


VII cases, about -- now, we not only had a good motive. 


Here's the proof that we were right about what we were


trying to predict, because that is what the rebuttal


burden in a Title VII dispute. 


QUESTION:  May I ask you --


QUESTION:  I understand that.  But it seems to


me that it would be perfectly reasonable if you treat

disparate treatment as prima facie -- I mean a disparate


impact as prima facie evidence of a wrongful intent.  But


I'm not sure that it would not also be an appropriate


response even if disparate treatment was sufficient


regardless of the actual intent.  It makes good sense for


Congress to put this defense in any way.  I'm not sure you


have --


question. 


MR. NAGER:  I'm not sure I understood the


QUESTION:  Assume your opponent is right.  That


disparate impact, which is totally innocent in terms of


any malicious intent creates a prima facie case.  Would it


not nevertheless be sensible for Congress to say yes, all


that is true, but if you have the right kind of good


motive described in this paragraph, that shall


nevertheless be a defense?


MR. NAGER:  Well, I think that would make good


sense, but I think that Congress was advised by the


secretary of labor that we are going to see correlations


between age and neutral selection criteria all the time,


and I don't think that Congress had in mind that


foreseeable adverse impacts, not done because of but in


spite of, should be a common basis for a prima facie case,


whether it be called disparate treatment or disparate


impact.

 QUESTION:  May I understand better than I have


from your argument why you say it's the reasonable factor


is not a defense?  You are saying it's like the Equal Pay


Act, which says any factor, any other factor other than


sex.  And that's always been regarded as a defense to an


equal pay charge.  You are charged with a violation of


equal pay and you say no, it was based on any other factor


other than sex. 


Why isn't it, since you are using the Equal Pay


Act to say there is no impact theory under the Equal Pay


Act, why isn't this equally a defense, rather than as you


say, part of the definition?


MR. NAGER:  Well, perhaps our argument was not


clear.  We were not referring to the Equal Pay Act in the


way that your question suggests. The only mention we made


of the Equal Pay Act was where we made the point that the


court in construing Title VII disparate impact doctrine


has suggested in county of Washington vs. Gunther and in


Justice Stevens' opinion for the Court in Manhart, the


disparate impact claims would not be cognizable in the


areas of pay disparities correlated with gender because


the Bennett amendment incorporated the effect of the Equal


Pay Act defenses into Title VII.  It's our opponents who


have made arguments based upon Gunther that there is


something different about this.

 QUESTION:  I thought you were both making


arguments?  I thought, maybe I'm wrong about this, that


your opponent was saying that this F provision is just


like business necessity under Title VII and you said I


thought, no, it's as in the Equal Pay Act when, where


there is no impact test under the Equal Pay Act.  I


thought that was your argument.  Maybe I misread you.  But


I think --


MR. NAGER:  No.  That was not our argument,


Justice Ginsburg.  Our argument was that the reason, one


of the reasons why this Court can and should rule that the


Age Discrimination Act doesn't recognize disparate impact


claims and be completely consistent and respectful of


Griggs is that the court in Title VII cases has recognized


that other provisions of the statute may cause Griggs to


yield to other congressional manifestations of intent


requirements in specific areas.


QUESTION:  Well then, let's just take the two


statutes.  One says reasonable factor, and the other says


any factor, any other factor other than sex.  Same kind of


provision.  Why in one case is it a defense and the other


case, part of the definition of the --


MR. NAGER:  Well, I think the answer to that is


that the court construed the four so-called affirmative


defenses as affirmative defenses under the Equal Pay Act.

This Court in Betts recognized that when Congress wrote


4(f), they didn't intend for all of the provisions in 4(f)


to be affirmative defenses.  Some of them were affirmative


defenses.  This Court in Criswell held that the BFOQ was


an affirmative defense.  4(f)(2) was held not to be an


affirmative defense but was held to be an exemption that


redefined the elements of a prima facie case and our


suggestion to the Court is since the reasonable factor


other than age provision is not a provision in which the


employer is trying to justify the use of age, employer is


saying our decision should be held lawful because it's


based upon factors other than age that it's not


appropriate to characterize that as an affirmative


defense, but rather --


QUESTION:  I don't follow why it isn't, you


couldn't make the very same argument about the Equal Pay


Act. 


MR. NAGER:  Well, I suppose if I had been


before the court in 1974 arguing that case, I might have


made that argument. 


QUESTION:  Well, that's another one we are


stuck with it because it's stare decisis, isn't it? 


MR. NAGER:  Well, no.  We just recognize that


we have a different statute and we also have a different


court.  I mean, the fact that --

 QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Nager.  Mr. Crabtree,


you have three minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. CRABTREE


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. CRABTREE:  Thank you, Your Honor.  Justice


Scalia, you asked earlier why we should not construe the


good cause provision as just something similar to the


reasonable factors provision. 


The difference is the absence of the words


otherwise prohibited.  The same words that did not exist


in (f)2 when Betts was decided.  Without the words


"otherwise prohibited" there would be a good argument that


the reasonable factors defense was not a defense.  But


because of those two critical words, it is inescapable


that there has already been a violation of the act. 


Second, Fogerty was a copyright case, not


another discrimination case in trying to import the


attorneys fee provision, prevailing party fee provision in


that case did not make sense as it does here because the


ADEA in Title VII share a common purpose and the common


legislative history and the common language. 


In Gunther, the court did not hold that there


was not disparate impact for a wage disparities under


Title VII.  What the court held was that the defense was


any other factor and that that applied or suggested that


48

it might apply in a facially neutral practice.  But the


court also said in Gunther that the, that the Defendant,


in proving its defense, must establish that factors were


legitimate and bonafide.  Here, of course, we have the


additional word reasonable so mere legitimacy, or merely


being bonafide cannot be enough. 


While the, as counsel conceded in mixed motive


cases, the court's analysis is whether or not but-for, the


but-for analysis must be connected and whether or not the


employer's motives caused the employer's action is at


issue.  And again, going back to the words otherwise


prohibited, we don't have that under the reasonable


factors defense for the ADEA.  I have no more to offer. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Crabtree. 


MR. CRABTREE:  Thank you very much. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  The case is


submitted.
