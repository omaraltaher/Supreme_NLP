ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH L. FRENCH 


            9                

ON BEHALF OF THE STATE PETITIONERS 


           10              

MS. FRENCH:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 


           11    

may it please the Court: 


           12              

In 1995, the Ohio General Assembly responded to 


           13    

an unprecedented educational crisis by enacting the Ohio 


           14    

Scholarship and Tutorial Program.  Under this Court's 


           15    

decisions, especially Mueller, Witters, and Zobrest, and 


           16    

in light of this Court's teachings, most recently in 


           17    

Agostini and Mitchell, the Ohio program is constitutional 


           18    

because it offers a neutral program that offers true 


           19    

private choice to parents. 


           20         

First, the principle of neutrality.  There are two 


           21    

criteria that determine where the benefits will go under 


           22    

the program.  First is residence in a school district that 


           23    

is or has been taken over by State control.  Second is 


           24    

family income.  Neither of these criteria has anything to 


           25    

do with religion, but even beyond these basic elements --

            1              

QUESTION:  Well, do you -- you don't take the 


            2    

position that that guarantees constitutionality, do you? 


            3              

MS. FRENCH:  We do not, Your Honor. 


            4              

QUESTION:  Okay. 


            5              

MS. FRENCH:  We have a two-pronged approach. 


            6              

QUESTION:  You take it as a necessary condition, 


            7    

but not a sufficient condition? 


            8              

MS. FRENCH:  We do, Your Honor.  We offer both 


            9    

neutrality and true private choice, but even beyond the 


           10    

basic elements of neutrality, there are a number of 


           11    

provisions within this program that guarantee that it's 


           12    

open to all-comers, both in terms of students and schools. 


           13              

First, the program requires schools not to 


           14    

discriminate based on race, religion, or ethnic origin, 


           15    

that ensures that even a religious school may not 


           16    

discriminate in favor of students of their own religious 


           17    

faith. 


           18              

QUESTION:  And you think it would be 


           19    

unconstitutional if it didn't have that --


           20              

MS. FRENCH:  Not necessarily, Your Honor, but it 


           21    

certainly goes to the neutrality of the program, but even 


           22    

beyond the --


           23              

QUESTION:  Well, why does it matter?  I mean, if 


           24    

they're proselytizing, doesn't it make good sense for them 


           25    

to admit anybody who may come along, and yet the

            1    

proselytizing can't be established under the Establishment 


            2    

Clause? 


            3              

MS. FRENCH:  We, of course, Your Honor, do you 


            4    

agree that they're proselytizing.  Whatever proselytizing 


            5    

is happening in the religious schools is at the behest of 


            6    

the parents, not at the behest of the Government, and 


            7    

perhaps I should move to the second prong, then, and talk 


            8    

about --


            9              

QUESTION:  Well -- go ahead. 


           10              

MS. FRENCH:  And talk about the true private 


           11    

choice that is at issue here for the parents. 


           12              

QUESTION:  Well, but I take it that the first 


           13    

part of your argument as demonstrated is to try to show 


           14    

that there are certain indexes, indicia of neutrality. 


           15              

MS. FRENCH:  Correct. 


           16              

QUESTION:  And you just -- and you tick them 


           17    

off. 


           18              

MS. FRENCH:  Yes, Your Honor.  Yes, that there 


           19    

is the Nondiscrimination Clause, and secondly that there 


           20    

is a cap on the number of students that -- who are already 


           21    

in the program, and the limit on the number who can 


           22    

continue in the program.  Only 50 percent of the 


           23    

scholarships awarded each year may be awarded to students 


           24    

who are already in the program.  That again assures that 


           25    

the program be open to all-comers, to those eligible in

the Cleveland School District. 


            2              

Thirdly --


            3              

QUESTION:  What percentage of the students in 


            4    

the school system are -- get vouchers? 


            5              

MS. FRENCH:  Well, there are 57,000 students, 


            6    

elementary students in the Cleveland School District, Your 


            7    

Honor.  About 4,000 of them get scholarships. 


            8              

QUESTION:  About how many thousand get 


            9    

scholarships, 2,000? 


           10              

MS. FRENCH:  In 1999 the number was 3,700.  It's 


           11    

now about 3,4 --


           12              

QUESTION:  So it's about 10 percent of the 


           13    

student body? 


           14              

MS. FRENCH:  Yes, Your Honor, a little less than 


           15    

10 percent, but all the students in the Cleveland School 


           16    

District are eligible.  They all receive information about 


           17    

the program, all are invited to attend, as long as the 


           18    

resident is in the school district, and then family income 


           19    

determines the amount of the scholarship that they 


           20    

receive. 


           21              

The third and final prong of the neutrality here 


           22    

is the benefit itself.  It is, of course, money.  It is 


           23    

inherently neutral.  There is nothing about that benefit 


           24    

that suggests any sort of reference to religion. 


           25              

The second prong this Court has looked to is the 


7

            1    

true private choice available for receiving the benefits. 


            2    

Here, Cleveland parents have a number of alternatives 


            3    

available to them.  They can stay in the Cleveland Public 


            4    

Schools --


            5              

QUESTION:  May I ask you a question about 


            6    

private choice which is a very important part of the case? 


            7    

Supposing you had a situation with a small community that 


            8    

had one public school and one religious school, and they 


            9    

would pay for the voucher to go to the religious school if 


           10    

the family on its own private choice wanted the child to 


           11    

go to the religious school.  Would that save the program 


           12    

in that case? 


           13              

MS. FRENCH:  I think it would, Your Honor --


           14              

QUESTION:  Yes. 


           15              

MS. FRENCH:  -- given -- if -- of course --


           16              

QUESTION:  So in this case it's irrelevant, 


           17    

really, that there are four or five choices available, as 


           18    

long as there's a free choice either to go to the public 


           19    

school or to go to the religious school? 


           20              

MS. FRENCH:  Well, we have a number of choices 


           21    

within the traditional public schools, Your Honor. 


           22              

QUESTION:  But they're not -- it's not necessary 


           23    

to your argument is what I'm trying to --


           24              

MS. FRENCH:  They are not necessary, Your Honor. 


           25    

However, this Court has viewed other programs in view of

            1    

the entire -- viewed as a whole of the program.  For 


            2    

instance, in Rosenberger, Justice Powell's decision in 


            3    

Witters --


            4              

QUESTION:  In Witters, there's such a dramatic 


            5    

difference between a choice from the great universe of 


            6    

colleges and universities, what a particular student will 


            7    

choose, and here, the difference -- you just explained to 


            8    

Justice Stevens that maybe it doesn't matter.  The 


            9    

difference is that in fact there is only one alternative, 


           10    

if you don't take account of the community schools, the 


           11    

suburban schools say no, they don't want any part of this, 


           12    

private schools can't make it on that low tuition, so in 


           13    

fact, isn't it true that something like 99 percent of the 


           14    

students who were receiving these vouchers are in 


           15    

religious schools? 


           16              

MS. FRENCH:  That's currently true, Your Honor. 


           17    

That number has fluctuated over the years of the program. 


           18    

It's fluctuated a great deal from 1995 to this year. 


           19    

That's true. 


           20              

QUESTION:  May I ask why we don't take account 


           21    

of the availability of the community schools in analyzing 


           22    

this program? 


           23              

MS. FRENCH:  We would like the Court to take 


           24    

very much account of the community schools, Your Honor. 


           25              

QUESTION:  The court below didn't do that.

MS. FRENCH:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


            2              

QUESTION:  Is that an option, in fact, to the 


            3    

parents? 


            4              

MS. FRENCH:  Very much so, Your Honor. 


            5              

QUESTION:  And the tuition assistance would be 


            6    

provided if the selection were for a community school? 


            7              

MS. FRENCH:  There would be no tuition 


            8    

assistance, Your Honor, only because they are public 


            9    

schools, so there's no need for a scholarship there. 


           10    

Parents can choose a traditional public school, they can 


           11    

choose a tutoring grant if they're in a public school, 


           12    

they can choose a magnet school, they can choose a 


           13    

community school, or --


           14              

QUESTION:  And if a community school is 


           15    

selected, no additional money then is provided, as would 


           16    

be provided if the religious school were selected? 


           17              

MS. FRENCH:  That's true, Your Honor.  If the 


           18    

parent chooses a community school, because it's considered 


           19    

a public school, there is no money exchanged.  It's 


           20    

only --


           21              

QUESTION:  Have some of the private nonsectarian 


           22    

schools in the city become community schools? 


           23              

MS. FRENCH:  They have, Your Honor.  There were 


           24    

two schools in particular who in 1997 chose to be 


           25    

community schools rather than be in the scholarship

            2              

QUESTION:  Because they get more money.  Because 


            3    

they get more money. 


            4              

MS. FRENCH:  In part because they get more 


            5    

money, and in part because of the uncertainty of the 


            6    

litigation.  There certainly has been a chilling effect as 


            7    

a result of the litigation that's been going on in some 


            8    

form since 1995. 


            9              

QUESTION:  Are slots available in the community 


           10    

schools for these children that we're talking about? 


           11              

MS. FRENCH:  Yes, Your Honor, there are spots 


           12    

available. 


           13              

QUESTION:  There are vacancies? 


           14              

MS. FRENCH:  Available in both community 


           15    

schools --


           16              

QUESTION:  Can you get a tutoring grant if you 


           17    

go to a community school? 


           18              

MS. FRENCH:  Yes, Your Honor, you can.  As long 


           19    

as you're in a public school, and that would include 


           20    

community or magnet schools, you're eligible for a 


           21    

tutoring grant. 


           22              

QUESTION:  Is there anything in the record about 


           23    

the quality of these community schools?  There was one 


           24    

brief that said they were too new, too few, too 


           25    

unregulated, too untested to tell.  Was there any evidence

            1    

of what these schools are, when -- there is evidence that 


            2    

the public school system is deplorable.  What evidence is 


            3    

there of these community schools, of whether they are a 


            4    

better choice to educate the child than the regular public 


            5    

schools? 


            6              

MS. FRENCH:  I would direct the Court to two 


            7    

places in the record, particularly the joint appendix. 


            8    

One is the affidavit of Mr. Puckett, which is at 157a, 


            9    

which simply describes what a community school is, the 


           10    

number of schools that are available, the number of spaces 


           11    

that are available.  There is also the affidavit of Paul 


           12    

Peterson, at approximately 98 of the joint appendix, a 


           13    

very lengthy affidavit that describes the different kinds 


           14    

of options available and what their benefits are. 


           15              

The benefit for a community school is, it is 


           16    

considered a public school.  There is some amount of 


           17    

accountability that might not be there with respect to a 


           18    

private school, but for a parent who's looking for an 


           19    

alternative to the public schools, that might be a good 


           20    

option for them. 


           21              

QUESTION:  Is there a description of the precise 


           22    

community schools that are participating in the program, 


           23    

and the quality of education in those schools? 


           24              

MS. FRENCH:  There is to the first part of your 


           25    

question, Your Honor, and that's in Mr. Puckett's

            1    

affidavit, of just describing what the schools are, why we 


            2    

have them in Ohio.  It's a State-wide program.  It's not 


            3    

just for Cleveland.  It's actually a State-wide program 


            4    

that was implemented in 1997, and was specifically 


            5    

complemented by the district court in a desegregation 


            6    

order relating to Cleveland as an option for Cleveland 


            7    

parents. 


            8              

QUESTION:  Is there information in the record 


            9    

available about the quality of the religiously affiliated 


           10    

schools? 


           11              

MS. FRENCH:  There are a number of studies that 


           12    

have been done both in Cleveland and with respect to other 


           13    

scholarship programs, Your Honor.  I would point 


           14    

specifically to, again to Mr. Peterson's affidavit at 105 


           15    

to 107 in the joint appendix. 


           16              

QUESTION:  I mean about these particular schools 


           17    

in the program. 


           18              

MS. FRENCH:  Yes, Your Honor, in general the 


           19    

scholarship program, not just specifically the religious 


           20    

schools, but the voucher, or the scholarship program as a 


           21    

whole, as to whether the students are showing academic 


           22    

achievement or, you know, significant results beyond that. 


           23    

Yes, there are, but not specific, again, to the religious 


           24    

schools. 


           25              

QUESTION:  Before we leave the community

            1    

schools, when the State calculates the funding that goes 


            2    

to the community schools, it takes account of the number 


            3    

of students that go to the community schools, I take it? 


            4              

MS. FRENCH:  Oh, yes, Your Honor. 


            5              

QUESTION:  And there's a figure of something 


            6    

like $5,000 --


            7              

MS. FRENCH:  Yes. 


            8              

QUESTION:  -- per student.  It's not quite that. 


            9              

MS. FRENCH:  Right.  $4,500 to $5,000.  It's 


           10    

calculated on the basis of the normal State aid number 


           11    

that a public school would receive for educating a child 


           12    

and, again, it's a per capita kind of number. 


           13              

QUESTION:  Does the same amount of money per 


           14    

capita go to a community school as would go to the regular 


           15    

public school? 


           16              

MS. FRENCH:  Yes, Your Honor, approximately. 


           17    

There's a slightly different amount, but it's 


           18    

approximately the same as the State aid number. 


           19              

QUESTION:  May I ask you if this Court would 


           20    

have to overrule the Nyquist case to support your 


           21    

position?  It certainly points the other way, doesn't it? 


           22              

MS. FRENCH:  It does point the other way, Your 


           23    

Honor, but we think that there are a number of 


           24    

distinctions which this Court has drawn between the 


           25    

programs at issue, say, in Mueller and Witters that

            1    

distinguish it from the New York program at issue in 


            2    

Nyquist. 


            3              

The New York program took a class of 


            4    

beneficiaries, that is, the students already within the 


            5    

private schools, and offered them a benefit.  The Ohio 


            6    

program approaches the problem very differently.  It 


            7    

approaches the problem from all of the schoolchildren in 


            8    

Ohio, or in the Cleveland Public School System, and offers 


            9    

them a benefit which --


           10              

QUESTION:  How does that change the legal 


           11    

concern about the Establishment Clause? 


           12              

MS. FRENCH:  Well, this Court has pointed to 


           13    

specifically footnote 38, where the Court reserved 


           14    

judgment in the Nyquist decision for programs that offered 


           15    

a benefit, the specific example was scholarships there, 


           16    

and offered to a broad base of beneficiaries without 


           17    

regard to the nonpublic or public or nonsectarian, 


           18    

sectarian nature of the institutions benefited, which is 


           19    

precisely what is happening here. 


           20              

QUESTION:  Well, but doesn't that simply then go 


           21    

back to this neutrality point, and you're saying because 


           22    

it's neutral, in the sense that it's offered in an even-


           23    

handed way, query -- your friends on the other side 


           24    

dispute that, but just accepting that categorization, 


           25    

because it's neutral in that sense, that's a distinction 


15 


ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

            1    

which ought to make a difference in the result. 


            2              

But as you agreed earlier, the neutrality that 


            3    

you're talking about is a necessary condition, but it's 


            4    

not a sufficient condition of constitutionality, and at 


            5    

the end of the day, I think what's bothering me about 


            6    

Nyquist and, I suspect, Justice O'Connor, too, is that 


            7    

Nyquist depended not merely on a question of neutrality, 


            8    

but on the effect, and at the end of the day, the effect 


            9    

is a massive amount of money into religious schools in 


           10    

Nyquist, a massive amount of money into religious schools 


           11    

here.  That, I think, is the sticking point here. 


           12              

MS. FRENCH:  We, of course, disagree, Your 


           13    

Honor, that there is a massive amount going to religious 


           14    

schools as a result of something that the Government is 


           15    

doing.  It's true, it's very true --


           16              

QUESTION:  Well, your adding a term as a result 


           17    

of what the Government is doing, which is a separate issue 


           18    

as to what the significance is of the private choice, but 


           19    

the effect that Nyquist was concerned with, and the effect 


           20    

that I think has been shown here, is a substantial amount 


           21    

of money, aid to the schools themselves, in relation to 


           22    

the amount of money spent on the program, and in those 


           23    

respects the two are identical. 


           24              

MS. FRENCH:  Well, in that respect, Your Honor, 


           25    

there's no question that there is money that is ending up

            1    

in religious institutions, because that's what the parents 


            2    

have chosen, but that nondiscrimination provision that I 


            3    

spoke of earlier did not exist in Nyquist.  The New York 


            4    

schools at issue in Nyquist could discriminate based on 


            5    

religion, and that, of course, means that the program, the 


            6    

New York program was not open to all-comers. 


            7              

QUESTION:  Well, Miller also made the point, I 


            8    

think, that where the parents do the choosing, as they did 


            9    

not do in Nyquist, it was a different ball game. 


           10              

MS. FRENCH:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  In 


           11    

Mueller, of course, the percentage of religious schools or 


           12    

the number of parents receiving benefit because they paid 


           13    

tuition to religious schools was 96 percent, and this 


           14    

Court has been very clear that where there is private 


           15    

choice, that percentage that changes from year to year is 


           16    

simply not relevant.  The wisdom of that rule --


           17              

QUESTION:  What is the closest of our cases, do 


           18    

you think, to the Ohio program?  Is it Witters? 


           19              

MS. FRENCH:  I would suggest Witters, Your 


           20    

Honor, because it's a financial aid going to, there it was 


           21    

a college student, but an adult, to make a decision about 


           22    

where to send the money.  Here, it's an adult parent 


           23    

making a decision about where to send the money on behalf 


           24    

of the child. 


           25

QUESTION:  Here, the difference would be, 


            2    

however, that according to respondents the choices are 


            3    

much more limited here than in Witters. 


            4

Mueller the Court did address that concern, as Justice 


            6    

Powell said in his concurrence in Witters, that it didn't 


            7    

matter that there was only one person, Mr. Witters, using 


            8    

the money for seminary, for the Inland Empire School of 


            9    

the Bible, nor did it matter in Zobrest that there was 


           10    

only one child or one parent, set of parents for a child 


           11    

looking for an interpretive or religious school.  Mueller 


           12    

teachers that the percentage that changes from year to 


           13    

year is simply not relevant. 


           14              

QUESTION:  I suppose part of the design of the 


           15    

program is to have a structure which will encourage over 


           16    

the long term more and different kinds of school choices, 


           17    

including, of course, the community schools. 


           18              

MS. FRENCH:  Absolutely, Your Honor. 


           19              

QUESTION:  May I ask you about your suggestion 


           20    

that in Nyquist, it's a difference when the parents do the 


           21    

choosing, but who chose where the children would go to 


           22    

school in Nyquist?  Did the parents make the decision? 


           23              

MS. FRENCH:  The parents, of course, did, Your 


           24    

Honor. 


           25              

QUESTION:  So it's the same case.

MS. FRENCH:  I disagree, Your Honor.  I think 


            2    

it's different in that we fall under the question that was 


            3    

reserved by the Court that there, because they didn't have 


            4    

the nondiscrimination provision, because of the purpose 


            5    

behind that Nyquist program was specifically to aid the 


            6    

private schools, that's very different from the Ohio 


            7    

program that's at issue here. 


            8              

Your Honor, I'd like to reserve my remaining 


            9    

time. 


           10              

QUESTION:  Very well, Ms. French. 


           11              

Mr. Young, we'll hear from you. 


           12                  

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. YOUNG 


           13               

ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE PETITIONERS 


           14              

MR. YOUNG:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the 


           15    

Court: 


           16              

I'd like to start out by addressing the 


           17    

questions concerning Nyquist and the basis for 


           18    

distinction.  I would refer specifically to 463 U.S. page 


           19    

398, and there this Court, when it distinguished -- in 


           20    

Mueller, when it distinguished Nyquist said, in this 


           21    

respect, as well as others, this case is vitally different 


           22    

from the scheme struck down in Nyquist.  There, public 


           23    

assistance amounting to tuition grants was provided only 


           24    

to parents of children in nonpublic schools -- pardon 


           25    

me -- in nonpublic schools.  This fact had considerable

            1    

bearing on our decision striking down the New York statute 


            2    

at issue, and then it goes on.  It talks about Allen and 


            3    

Everson. 


            4              

So this Court made it very clear in Mueller that 


            5    

there was an important distinction between that and 


            6    

Nyquist. 


            7              

QUESTION:  Does the money went to children --


            8    

the money went to families with children in nonpublic 


            9    

schools, but that's exactly what's happening here. 


           10              

MR. YOUNG:  Your Honor, if --


           11              

QUESTION:  Aren't the vouchers just for people 


           12    

in the nonpublic schools? 


           13              

MR. YOUNG:  Your Honor, it isn't exactly the 


           14    

same at all.  In Nyquist --


           15              

QUESTION:  Well, am I right that the vouchers 


           16    

are just for people in nonpublic schools? 


           17              

MR. YOUNG:  In this case, no, Your Honor.  We 


           18    

have tutorial vouchers for people in public schools, and 


           19    

tutorial vouchers for magnet schools and community 


           20    

schools. 


           21              

QUESTION:  Speaking of the tutorial vouchers, 


           22    

why is the number of tutorial vouchers limited to the same 


           23    

number of vouchers paid to the private schools? 


           24              

MR. YOUNG:  Well, I would -- Your Honor, I would 


           25    

suspect the answer to that is to try to provide some form

            1    

of equality and to make sure that there was no Government 


            2    

endorsement of one choice or another, so the equality of 


            3    

having the same number of grants for tutoring being the 


            4    

same as the same number going for scholarships. 


            5              

QUESTION:  Of course, the amount of money is 


            6    

vastly different, isn't it, because the -- I forget the 


            7    

figures exactly, but isn't the limit on the tutorial 


            8    

something like $350 a student, as opposed to the $2,000-


            9    

some-odd limit on the tuition vouchers? 


           10              

MR. YOUNG:  Your Honor, there is a difference, 


           11    

but there is less a difference than the difference between 


           12    

the public school and the nonpublic school deductions 


           13    

taken in Mueller. 


           14              

QUESTION:  Well, you wouldn't limit it to the 


           15    

vouchers anyway, would you?  I mean, you would think that 


           16    

we'd have to look at the money that goes to the community 


           17    

schools --


           18              

MR. YOUNG:  That is --


           19              

QUESTION:  -- which does not go via vouchers, it 


           20    

goes directly to the schools, and it's a greater amount of 


           21    

money that goes to the private schools, isn't it? 


           22              

MR. YOUNG:  Your Honor, I think the fact --


           23    

there is no question that when this program was initially 


           24    

implemented, every single secular school in the district 


           25    

signed up to participate.  Additionally, two brand-new

            1    

secular schools were established by reason of this 


            2    

program, the two HOPE schools.  They remained in the 


            3    

program until the Community School Act was adopted.  That, 


            4    

indeed, doubled the amount of money available to the 


            5    

families.  In other words, the maximum scholarship grant, 


            6    

$2,250, and -- but if those same children elected to go to 


            7    

a community school, the State would pay for each child at 


            8    

least double the amount that it would pay if they selected 


            9    

the scholarship --


           10              

QUESTION:  So what is actually involved?  I'd 


           11    

like to hear what you say about the endorsement point that 


           12    

Justice Souter initially raised, and my thought is, I'll 


           13    

assume no discrimination, and I'll assume it's a fine 


           14    

program, but imagine you came from Europe or Africa, or a 


           15    

different place, and said, what do they do in the United 


           16    

States by way of educating their children, and you're 


           17    

told, well, $60 billion a year, $40 billion, or some very 


           18    

large amount of money is being spent by the Government to 


           19    

give children K through 12 what is basically a religiously 


           20    

oriented education taught by a parochial school.  Wouldn't 


           21    

you then say, in the United States of America, like France 


           22    

or like England, the Government of the United States 


           23    

endorses a religious education for young children by 


           24    

putting money up, massive amounts? 


           25              

Now, I'm putting it that way to get your 


22

            1    

response, and that's the problem that bothers me most 


            2    

about the word, establishment. 


            3              

MR. YOUNG:  Thank you, Your Honor.  There is no 


            4    

governmental endorsement of religion in this program, and 


            5    

there are several reasons why there isn't.  The first, 


            6    

Your Honor, reason would be the amount of money that is 


            7    

spent, first of all, on a public school education, which 


            8    

is approximately $8,000, the amount of money paid for a 


            9    

community secular education, $4,500, and the maximum 


           10    

amount provided to a family that selects a nonpublic 


           11    

school, $2,250. 


           12         

So if -- the first thing you look at is the amount of 


           13    

money that is spent depending on the nature of choice made 


           14    

by the child, and the preference, the -- in that instance 


           15    

is clearly a preference for the secular schools. 


           16              

Secondly, Your Honor, if you look at the 


           17    

history, as well as the context of this particular 


           18    

program, this program was adopted because of one of the 


           19    

most serious educational, public school crises in the 


           20    

United States, and I think anyone trying to determine what 


           21    

was the Government doing, was it endorsing religion, no. 


           22    

The Government was trying to permit low income 


           23    

educationally disadvantaged children who were trapped in a 


           24    

failing system to exercise an alternate choice. 


           25              

So I think any person -- the Cleveland district 


23 


ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

            1    

has been in litigation, Your Honor, for some 20-plus 


            2    

years, in Federal court, because of the difficulties that 


            3    

have been encountered in the public school system.  I 


            4    

think anyone looking at this legislation as it was adopted 


            5    

and as it was implemented would conclude that there is 


            6    

certainly no Government endorsement of religion. 


            7              

The Government was trying to resolve a problem 


            8    

of these disadvantaged low income children, and giving 


            9    

them alternate choices, which parents ought to have in any 


           10    

event so that's certainly another reason.  When no money 


           11    

flows, not a dollar flows to a religiously sponsored 


           12    

school under this program, but for the independent, 


           13    

private choice of a parent.  The State does not direct a 


           14    

dollar to a religiously sponsored school.  No --


           15              

QUESTION:  There's an irony, I -- are you -- is 


           16    

that --


           17              

MR. YOUNG:  I could go on, Your Honor, but --


           18              

QUESTION:  No, if -- I mean, the irony is that 


           19    

the better the parochial school, in a sense, the less the 


           20    

freedom of choice.  I mean, I -- if it were my children 


           21    

and I saw these comparisons, I'd say, send them to the 


           22    

parochial school.  Would you like them to learn that 


           23    

religion, I'd say, frankly not, that's not my religion, 


           24    

but it's very important my child get the best education, 


           25    

and therefore I would be feeling I had to send them there,

if that's what I want. 


            2              

MR. YOUNG:  Your Honor --


            3              

QUESTION:  I mean, no one's complaining about 


            4    

the quality of the program.  It's this concern about the 


            5    

endorsement, and not even that that's what they intend, 


            6    

but that that's the effect. 


            7              

MR. YOUNG:  For reasons I've already noted, Your 


            8    

Honor, I believe there is no governmental endorsement, and 


            9    

you have to realize that the overwhelming majority of the 


           10    

eligible children elected to remain in the public school, 


           11    

and incidentally there are --


           12              

QUESTION:  I assume Justice Breyer could send 


           13    

his child to one of the community schools, which is 


           14    

entirely nonsectarian, under this program, right? 


           15              

MR. YOUNG:  Your Honor, that's another 


           16    

alternative, and I think we --


           17              

QUESTION:  Which schools would get more money 


           18    

than the sectarian schools anyway. 


           19              

MR. YOUNG:  Your Honor, I see that as another 


           20    

reason why no one could say there's a reasonable message 


           21    

of governmental endorsement in this case. 


           22              

QUESTION:  And you agree that the Sixth Circuit 


           23    

erred.  Was it legal error? 

The Sixth Circuit said, 


           24    

we're not going to take account of the community schools 


           25    

because that's a whole other program.  This case was about

the voucher program.  In the district court, what 


            2    

development was there about the community schools? 


            3              

MR. YOUNG:  Your Honor, the same approach was 


            4    

taken by Judge Oliver, but I don't feel that the Sixth 


            5    

Circuit really understood how the community school program 


            6    

worked, or how one could use the tutorial vouchers to help 


            7    

the children that elected to go to the community schools. 


            8              

QUESTION:  Well, there's really no record on the 


            9    

community schools, you're saying, because you weren't 


           10    

permitted to make a record? 


           11              

MR. YOUNG:  Your Honor, there is an extensive 


           12    

record in affidavits in terms of the creation of the 


           13    

community schools, the transfer of the two secular 


           14    

scholarship schools to community school status.  The 


           15    

children who were enrolled as scholarship pupils in the 


           16    

scholarship secular schools just transferred when those 


           17    

schools became community schools, so this legislation 


           18    

clearly enabled the same children, the same low income, 


           19    

educationally disadvantaged children to elect a community 


           20    

school, so there is record evidence to that extent, Your 


           21    

Honor.  Why the Sixth Circuit refused to consider the 


           22    

community schools is beyond me. 


           23              

The -- I think in order to fully understand the 


           24    

choice issue, Your Honors, I think you have to really look 


           25    

into more detail into the tutorial grant program.  We

haven't addressed at all the subject of the --


            2              

QUESTION:  Do we have to link the two programs 


            3    

together to resolve the case --


            4              

MR. YOUNG:  Your Honor, I believe not. 


            5              

QUESTION:  -- the tutorial program and the money 


            6    

paid to the parents and endorsed over to the schools in 


            7    

the case of choice?  Do we have to consider both together? 


            8              

MR. YOUNG:  Your Honor, I would consider them 


            9    

together, but it was -- it's the, all of the indicia of 


           10    

choice, not just the endorsement. 


           11              

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Young. 


           12              

General Olson, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON 


           14         

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 


           15                    

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 


           16              

GENERAL OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 


           17    

please the Court: 


           18              

I'd like to follow up on the point that was just 


           19    

being made.  This Court has taught repeatedly that the 


           20    

history, the context, and the purpose for programs like 


           21    

this are a very, very important part of the determination 


           22    

of what the endorsement test or the effects test would be. 


           23    

There is no question that the purpose that inspired, and 


           24    

the history and the context that inspired the Ohio pilot 


           25    

program could not have been more compelling and more

focused on the needs of children. 


            2              

QUESTION:  No, but I would think you would say 


            3    

the program was still constitutional, even if it was just 


            4    

conceived in the healthiest school system in the world. 


            5              

GENERAL OLSON:  Well, perhaps, Justice Stevens, 


            6    

I might, but this -- as this Court has taught repeatedly, 


            7    

the background history and the context informs the 


            8    

decision which this Court has endorsed with respect to 


            9    

what the effects or endorsement test would be, measured by 


           10    

what a reasonable, objective observer would believe the 


           11    

State or the Government was doing, is the Government 


           12    

endorsing religion, and that has to be considered in the 


           13    

context of what was going on. 


           14              

Here we have a manifestly failing system in 


           15    

which -- no one disagrees with that.  Efforts had been 


           16    

made, and a Federal court had decided the system had to be 


           17    

taken over. 


           18              

QUESTION:  The thing that puzzles me about that 


           19    

argument is, why did they make this wonderful solution 


           20    

available to such a small percentage of the student body? 


           21              

GENERAL OLSON:  I would invite the Court's 


           22    

attention to page 41 of the Taylor petitioner's brief, 


           23    

which contains a chart which shows the various choices 


           24    

which were made available to the students as a result of 


           25    

the composite, the context of the program that we're

            1    

considering. 


            2              

It shows -- that chart shows, along with the 


            3    

other statistics in the brief, that there are 57,000 


            4    

students in the school system.  16,000 went to the magnet 


            5    

schools, 2,000-and-some are going into the community 


            6    

schools -- these are present facts -- 3,700 accepted 


            7    

scholarships to use in religiously affiliated schools, 


            8    

1,400 accepted the tutorial program, and another 100-and-


            9    

so took scholarships with respect to nonreligiously 


           10    

affiliated schools.l  There were more nonreligiously 


           11    

affiliated schools available, but two of those, the major 


           12    

ones, decided to become community schools. 


           13              

I would like to invite the Court's attention --


           14              

QUESTION:  Mr. Olson, I didn't quite understand 


           15    

Justice Stevens' question.  You acknowledge that it was 


           16    

made available only to a small number of the students? 


           17              

GENERAL OLSON:  No.  I -- what I meant --


           18              

QUESTION:  I thought the program was available 


           19    

to all the students. 


           20              

GENERAL OLSON:  I stand corrected.  What I mean 


           21    

to say, the choices were -- there was a broad range of 


           22    

choices, but the program itself was made available to all 


           23    

of the students. 


           24              

QUESTION:  Any student could have gone into a --


           25    

one of the community schools, or to one of the private

schools, isn't that right? 


            2              

GENERAL OLSON:  That's correct, and the record 


            3    

is quite clear on this, also.  Any student who wanted to 


            4    

go to a nonreligiously affiliated private school, no 


            5    

student who wanted to do that was declined the opportunity 


            6    

to do that, so your child, Justice Breyer, could have gone 


            7    

to a nonreligiously affiliated school. 


            8              

QUESTION:  Ah, but there doesn't seem to be a 


            9    

record on this very clear, that my impression was really 


           10    

the parochial schools are an awful lot better. 


           11              

GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I think that's an 


           12    

impression that you may have, but --


           13              

QUESTION:  So are we supposed to send the case 


           14    

back?  Does it turn on that? 


           15              

GENERAL OLSON:  No, no.  There's no record 


           16    

evidence to support that.  Remember, this is a pilot 


           17    

program, an experimental program.  The best evidence may 


           18    

be found in the affidavit or declaration of Howard Fuller, 


           19    

who was the former superintendent of the Milwaukee system, 


           20    

who watched the Milwaukee system develop and get put into 


           21    

practice.  That's at the joint appendix pages 228 to 236. 


           22              

During the period of time that the Milwaukee 


           23    

program has been in existence, the number of private, 


           24    

nonreligiously affiliated schools have increased from 7 to 


           25    

30, the number of students in those private,

            1    

nonreligiously affiliated schools has increased tenfold, 


            2    

from 337 to 3,025. 


            3              

He also points out that the existence of the 


            4    

alternative has improved the public school systems as 


            5    

well.  Parents are involved in the choice of the 


            6    

educational opportunities for their children.  He 


            7    

demonstrates they get more involved in the school system. 


            8              

QUESTION:  General Olson, if a private 


            9    

individual challenges a State law as unconstitutional, the 


           10    

burden of proof is on that individual, isn't it, to show 


           11    

the necessary facts to establish unconstitutionality? 


           12              

GENERAL OLSON:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, 


           13    

absolutely, but the record here goes even further than 


           14    

that, because the record that is available shows these 


           15    

many alternatives.  It shows that when the program has 


           16    

been allowed to exist free of constitutional objection, it 


           17    

has shown improvement at the student level, and 


           18    

improvement at the public school level as well as the 


           19    

private school level. 


           20              

Let me emphasize that in response to the 


           21    

question Justice Souter raised at the very beginning of 


           22    

the argument, it isn't just neutrality, but there is 


           23    

clearly neutral criteria here for opting in or out of the 


           24    

program. 


           25              

Another factor that the Court has thought was

            1    

important in the past was, the parents have an option not 


            2    

to participate in the program, and that's a part of the 


            3    

optional choices that are available. 


            4              

QUESTION:  I want to ask how the courts faced 


            5    

with this challenge have to view the case.  Must they view 


            6    

it as having the whole range of options available, public 


            7    

school, magnet, community, and religious schools? 


            8              

GENERAL OLSON:  Yes, Justice O'Connor, I believe 


            9    

that is the correct context. 


           10              

QUESTION:  And why did the court below not do 


           11    

that? 


           12              

GENERAL OLSON:  I think the court made a legal 


           13    

error in failing to do so, because this Court has taught 


           14    

over and over again that the context is extremely 


           15    

important --


           16              

QUESTION:  Now, is it limited only to low income 


           17    

children, or does it just -- does that affect the amount 


           18    

of money to be given? 


           19              

GENERAL OLSON:  It affects both the amount of 


           20    

money to be given and the preference.  To the extent that 


           21    

there are any limitations on the program at all, the 


           22    

priorities are given to low income students on the 


           23    

theory --


           24              

QUESTION:  There's only a finite amount of money 


           25    

available.

            1              

GENERAL OLSON:  Well, that's always the case, of 


            2    

course --


            3              

QUESTION:  Right. 


            4              

GENERAL OLSON:  -- in any Government program, 


            5    

but the priorities are given to the low income people. 


            6    

The evidence that's in the record demonstrates that the 


            7    

vast majority of these scholarships are used by people at 


            8    

the poverty level.  The rationale for that, of course, was 


            9    

that people in the higher income level can afford the 


           10    

alternative. 


           11              

QUESTION:  Now, there was no attempt in the 


           12    

program to make sure that the money that ends up in the 


           13    

parochial schools is not used for religious training, or 


           14    

teaching.  There have been other Federal programs, for 


           15    

example, where there have been such limitations on usage. 


           16    

There's none of that here. 


           17              

GENERAL OLSON:  That's correct, Justice 


           18    

O'Connor, but the Court has made the point in connection 


           19    

with those types of programs that there's a significant 


           20    

difference between a direct aid program, where funds are 


           21    

going from the Government to the school, as opposed to the 


           22    

private, genuinely independent, purely private choice 


           23    

programs where the choices are being made by individual 


           24    

parents, and being made by individual parents motivated by 


           25    

the best education for their children.

So to go back to the reasonable observer test 


            2    

with respect to endorsement, would a reasonable observer 


            3    

believe that the Government's putting its thumb in favor 


            4    

of religion on the scales here under all of these 


            5    

circumstances, the wide range of choices --


            6              

QUESTION:  May I ask on that very question, do 


            7    

you think these alternatives are essential from a 


            8    

constitutional point of view, or would you make the same 


            9    

argument if there were merely the one choice, religious 


           10    

school or the private school? 


           11              

GENERAL OLSON:  I think applying the standards 


           12    

this Court has adopted, that if the criteria are 


           13    

neutral -- and I'm answering -- I'm saying yes. 


           14              

QUESTION:  The criteria is neutral.  You can 


           15    

either go to the public school, or you can go to the 


           16    

parochial school, and if you go to the parochial school, 


           17    

we'll pay the tuition. 


           18              

GENERAL OLSON:  Which we're also offer -- yes. 


           19    

Yes. 


           20              

QUESTION:  I understand there's a lot more here, 


           21    

but what would you do with that case? 


           22              

GENERAL OLSON:  I think if there was a purely 


           23    

neutral criteria in terms of eligibility for the program, 


           24    

and it's a purely private choice, that the -- because this 


           25    

Court has emphasized that we're looking at whether the

            1    

Government's being -- going to be perceived by a 


            2    

reasonable observer as endorsing religion, if it is a 


            3    

purely private choice program, the teaching of this Court 


            4    

is, it's not unlike a Government check that goes to an 


            5    

individual who then spends it, all of it on his church. 


            6              

QUESTION:  My hypothesis is, it's purely 


            7    

private.  Either I'll go to the parochial school or the 


            8    

public school, and the Government doesn't care which one. 


            9              

GENERAL OLSON:  It's purely neutral --


           10              

QUESTION:  And you would say that's perfectly 


           11    

all right. 


           12              

GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I would probably be making 


           13    

that argument in another case.  I don't have to make that 


           14    

argument here, because we have all of these other 


           15    

alternatives, including private schools. 


           16              

QUESTION:  But I'm trying to decide whether 


           17    

those alternatives are constitutionally necessary, or just 


           18    

make your argument stronger. 


           19              

GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I think that what this 


           20    

Court has taught, that because these establishment Clause 


           21    

cases are so difficult, that they are made in the context 


           22    

of the particular facts of the case, and that the facts 


           23    

and circumstances in history illuminate what the 


           24    

Government was involved in, because we're not talking 


           25    

about --

QUESTION:  Why don't we -- why don't you --


            2    

well, I know why you don't stress, but why shouldn't we 


            3    

stress as one of those facts the bottom line of 96 percent 


            4    

of the kids taking the tuition aid, or taking it in 


            5    

parochial schools? 


            6              

GENERAL OLSON:  Well --


            7              

QUESTION:  And doesn't that suggest that there 


            8    

is perhaps something specious about this notion that it's 


            9    

a matter of wide-open choice here?  In practical terms, 


           10    

the money is going to end up where it ends up, and the 96-


           11    

percent figure is pretty persuasive. 


           12              

GENERAL OLSON:  That was the same factor in the 


           13    

Mueller case, and one of the other cases that has been 


           14    

cited, the Court said that is not of constitutional 


           15    

significance.  We're not going to --


           16              

QUESTION:  Oh, I'm asking you a question about 


           17    

practical significance, and why do we eliminate that fact 


           18    

from our judgment about what in the real world seems to be 


           19    

going on? 


           20              

GENERAL OLSON:  Because those choices this Court 


           21    

has said are the result of purely private choices, and 


           22    

that that will not be associated by a reasonable observer 


           23    

with a governmental decision. 


           24              

QUESTION:  Thank you, General Olson. 


           25              

Mr. Chanin, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. CHANIN 


            2        

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS SIMMONS-HARRIS, ET AL. 


            3              

MR. CHANIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 


            4    

please the Court: 


            5              

Under the Cleveland voucher program, millions of 


            6    

dollars of unrestricted public funds are transferred each 


            7    

year from the State Treasury into the general coffers of 


            8    

sectarian private schools and the money is used by those 


            9    

schools to provide an educational program in which the 


           10    

sectarian and the secular are interwoven.  It is  a given 


           11    

that, if those funds are properly attributable to the 


           12    

State, the program violates the Establishment Clause. 


           13              

We submit that the answer to that attribution 


           14    

question is yes, and it is yes because, regardless of the 


           15    

decision that individual parents may make, it is 


           16    

inevitable, it is a mathematical certainty that almost all 


           17    

of the students will end up going to religious schools 


           18    

that provide a religious education --


           19              

QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Chanin, wait just a minute. 


           20    

A couple of things.  Do we not have to look at all of the 


           21    

choices open to the students, the community schools, the 


           22    

magnet schools, et cetera?  How is it that we can look 


           23    

only at the ones looking to the religious schools? 


           24              

MR. CHANIN:  The limitation to looking at the 


           25    

voucher program as a freestanding program is consistent

both with the precedents of this Court and with absolute 


            2    

logic, Your Honor. 


            3              

QUESTION:  I don't understand either point, to 


            4    

tell you the truth.  I mean, if you want to look at what 


            5    

the parents' choices are, do you not have to look in 


            6    

reality at the whole program, then it isn't a 96-percent 


            7    

thing? 


            8              

MR. CHANIN:  Your Honor, this Court has always 


            9    

been program-specific in its financial aid cases.  In 


           10    

Nyquist, the Court looked at three separate programs under 


           11    

the one statute, viewed them all in independent terms, and 


           12    

viewed them all independently of whatever else was going 


           13    

on in the New York City Public Schools and New York State. 


           14              

QUESTION:  But I'm not sure that's proper. 


           15    

That's what I'm asking you.  Why should we not look at all 


           16    

of the options open to the parents in having their 


           17    

children educated? 


           18              

MR. CHANIN:  Because what that does, Your Honor, 


           19    

is, it mixes together programs that are quite 


           20    

qualitatively different in both function and purpose.  The 


           21    

magnet schools, the charter schools, the tutorial program, 


           22    

those are all ways in which the State is attempting to 


           23    

discharge its basic legal obligation to provide a public 


           24    

education for all of its students. 


           25              

QUESTION:  But the question is whether or not --

MR. CHANIN:  All of the parents are entitled --


            2              

QUESTION:  The question is whether or not there 


            3    

is neutrality in this program, and it seems to me that if 


            4    

you ask us to put on blinders, and not inquire as to 


            5    

what's really happening in Cincinnati, what really was the 


            6    

reason for this, what all of the choices are, that you're 


            7    

asking us to make a decision based on an a fictional 


            8    

premise. 


            9              

MR. CHANIN:  Your Honor, I think we're doing 


           10    

precisely the reverse.  We are asking you to look at the 


           11    

reality.  What the State of Ohio has set up here --


           12              

QUESTION:  You're asking us to look at part of a 


           13    

reality. 


           14              

MR. CHANIN:  No, Your Honor.  We're asking you 


           15    

to look at a special benefit that the State of Ohio is 


           16    

making available to a selected group of parents over and 


           17    

above the benefit that they have, along with all other 


           18    

parents, to send their children to a public school.  That 


           19    

benefit is a qualitatively different benefit to take my 


           20    

child out of a public school and put my child into a 


           21    

private school and be educated with public money. 


           22              

QUESTION:  You don't have any problem with that. 


           23    

You say it would be perfectly okay if it went to a private 


           24    

school.  It's only the portion of it that goes to a 


           25    

private school that is religiously affiliated that you

object to, isn't that right? 


            2              

MR. CHANIN:  No.  What I am saying --


            3              

QUESTION:  Oh, this money could not even go to 


            4    

nonsectarian private schools? 


            5              

MR. CHANIN:  Pardon me, Your Honor? 


            6              

QUESTION:  This money could not, in your view, 


            7    

even go to nonsectarian private schools? 


            8              

MR. CHANIN:  Yes, it could, Your Honor. 


            9              

QUESTION:  It could, and that would be a 


           10    

rational way for the State to provide for the education of 


           11    

children --


           12              

MR. CHANIN:  It would be a constitutional right. 


           13              

QUESTION:  -- some in publicly run schools and 


           14    

some in private schools, but if any of those private 


           15    

schools is a religiously affiliated school, that is a no-


           16    

no. 


           17              

MR. CHANIN:  No. 


           18              

QUESTION:  -- and that, in your view, is 


           19    

neutrality? 


           20              

MR. CHANIN:  No, Your Honor, that is not my 


           21    

position.  We are not saying, if any of those schools are 


           22    

sectarian it is a no-no, or the program fails.  We are 


           23    

saying, if you take a program which is designed to give 


           24    

parents the option to go out of the public schools and 


           25    

educate their children in a private school, and then you

say to 99 out of 100 of those parents, if you choose that 


            2    

option, you must send your child to get a religious 


            3    

education, that is not --


            4              

QUESTION:  Well, the percentage in Mueller was 


            5    

96 percent. 


            6              

MR. CHANIN:  I believe, Your Honor, that this 


            7    

Court, this case is not controlled by Mueller, for the 


            8    

very same reason that Mueller was not controlled by 


            9    

Nyquist.  The Court distinguished a Nyquist-type program 


           10    

in Mueller on three grounds, all of which are equally 


           11    

applicable here.  The Court --


           12              

QUESTION:  The State does not say here, as you 


           13    

put it, that you must go to these religiously affiliated 


           14    

schools.  What you're saying is, they happen to be the 


           15    

schools that are currently up and running.  In fact, 


           16    

originally in this system it wasn't -- what is it, 96 


           17    

percent you say?  Originally it was something much lower, 


           18    

something like 62 percent, except that two of the schools, 


           19    

two of the largest nonsectarian private schools, decided 


           20    

to be come community schools, so originally it was a much 


           21    

different percentage.  Are we supposed to examine this 


           22    

program year by year to see what the percentage is? 


           23              

MR. CHANIN:  No, Your Honor.  What we would like 


           24    

the Court to do is take the language of this program and 


           25    

look at it, not simply on its face, but in the empirical

            1    

context in which it will operate.  Let me give you the 


            2    

percentages, if I may, just to track what you have done. 


            3              

This started out in 1996 with 80 percent of the 


            4    

schools being sectarian and 80 percent of the students 


            5    

going to those schools.  By 1999, 2000, the universe had 


            6    

become even more skewed toward the religious.  It was 82 


            7    

percent of the schools and 96 percent of the students. 


            8              

QUESTION:  But isn't that because some of the 


            9    

private schools had become community schools, and is it 


           10    

not true that parents can choose to have their children 


           11    

educated in a community school and, if they do, that 


           12    

school gets more money from the State than if they had 


           13    

chosen the religious school?  If anything, it's skewed 


           14    

against the religious schools --


           15              

MR. CHANIN:  Your Honor --


           16              

QUESTION:  -- in terms of public support. 


           17              

MR. CHANIN:  I think there are two parts to your 


           18    

question, if I may take them in sequence.  The first is, 


           19    

why is the universe moving in the direction it is, and 


           20    

just, if I may, to complete the point, we now have this 


           21    

year 99.4 percent of the students in that program going to 


           22    

religious schools. 


           23              

QUESTION:  So far, you're doing a very good job 


           24    

of not answering Justice O'Connor's question. 


           25

MR. CHANIN:  Well, the answer to it is this, 


            2    

Justice Kennedy.  From our perspective, it is not 


            3    

determinative why the universe is the way it is.  From the 


            4    

point of view of the --


            5              

QUESTION:  Well, but now, wait a minute.  Why do 


            6    

you not put the community schools and the magnet schools 


            7    

in the universe of choices?  That's the problem I'm having 


            8    

with your argument.  You say the figures are skewed, but 


            9    

they're skewed only because you will not look at those 


           10    

choices.  Why? 


           11              

MR. CHANIN:  We do not look at them for two 


           12    

reasons, Your Honor.  One is that the Court in Nyquist 


           13    

explained why it did not go beyond the program itself.  It 


           14    

said this.  If you extend the -- if you look at the 


           15    

choices that parents have to go to public schools as well 


           16    

as the vouchers in the private schools, you allow, through 


           17    

the tuition grant program, to do precisely what the 


           18    

Establishment Clause prohibits, which is to use tuition 


           19    

grants to pay totally for private, sectarian religious 


           20    

education, the Court said.  It's a back-door approach to 


           21    

do precisely what the Establishment Clause prohibits. 


           22              

Secondly, people talked a moment ago about 


           23    

perception, and I think they're completely mistaken.  This 


           24    

is the perception.  The reasonable observer does not look 


           25    

at public education and the multiple, changing, various

programs that are offered.  The person looks at this.  The 


            2    

State of Ohio has set up a special, well-publicized 


            3    

program which allows a certain number of students to 


            4    

escape from a troubled school district, and appropriates a 


            5    

pot of money into that program, and what the reasonable 


            6    

observer sees is, that program and that pot of money ends 


            7    

up 99.4 percent giving children a religious education. 


            8              

QUESTION:  Mr. Chanin, that's only true if you 


            9    

say the person is reasonable in not looking at all the 


           10    

choices, which include community schools, certainly. 


           11              

MR. CHANIN:  Your Honor --


           12              

QUESTION:  And probably magnet --


           13              

MR. CHANIN:  Your Honor, if it extends that way, 


           14    

there is no meaning any more to the concept of genuinely 


           15    

independent and private choice.  We don't need magnet 


           16    

schools.  We don't need community schools.  We should just 


           17    

say, you people have 57,000 options.  You can stay in the 


           18    

Cleveland public schools, or you can leave that school 


           19    

district, take public money, and go get a religious 


           20    

education.  The magnet schools, the community schools, 


           21    

they're not unique.  They're part of the way in which a 


           22    

State provides a public education.  There are small 


           23    

classes and large classes.  There's distance education, 


           24    

and face-to-face education.  Magnet schools have been 


           25    

around for 50 years.

            1              

QUESTION:  But suddenly it changes, and it's 


            2    

not education any more if you're getting it in a religious 


            3    

school.  Why is that? 


            4              

MR. CHANIN:  We're not saying it's not --


            5              

QUESTION:  Unless there's an endorsement of 


            6    

religion involved here, I don't see why the fact that some 


            7    

of the money, even most of the money goes to religious 


            8    

schools makes any difference. 


            9              

MR. CHANIN:  Well, because you have a basic 


           10    

proposition that we build our case on, which the Court has 


           11    

adopted, and it is this.  If public money that is 


           12    

reasonably attributable to the State is used to pay for a 


           13    

religious education, it violates the Constitution.  The 


           14    

only way in which it's not attributable to the State is if 


           15    

it doesn't go there by virtue of a State action or a State 


           16    

decision, but the circuit is broken, and the circuit is 


           17    

broken because in between, standing between the State and 


           18    

standing between the schools, is an independent party with 


           19    

decisionmaking to divert it away. 


           20              

There is no intervening party with 


           21    

decisionmaking here.  The parents play a ritualistic role 


           22    

in the transmission process, and if I am a parent, and I 


           23    

am holding a voucher in my hand, I can say, where can I 


           24    

use it, and 99 of my 100 choices is, send my child to a 


           25    

religious school.

            1              

QUESTION:  Well, suppose it weren't that number. 


            2    

I mean, our decision, I take it, would have to govern lots 


            3    

of programs in lots of school districts, and suppose that 


            4    

a particular program in a particular school district was 


            5    

set up for the best possible reason, educate the children, 


            6    

and there's no other way, and suppose, too, that you would 


            7    

have very, very good parochial schools, and also some 


            8    

very, very good private schools, and let's suppose the 


            9    

numbers were several hundred million dollars, and so 


           10    

parents getting the money, about half of them sent them to 


           11    

parochial schools and about half of them sent them to 


           12    

private schools.  Now, suddenly, does the constitutional 


           13    

balance change? 


           14              

MR. CHANIN:  Not in my mind, Your Honor. 


           15              

QUESTION:  And so all this 99 percent doesn't 


           16    

make that much difference.  Why not? 


           17              

MR. CHANIN:  It -- I focus on it because it 


           18    

makes it clear to the Court, I hope, that this isn't even 


           19    

a close-to-the-line case.  This is so far to the polar end 


           20    

of the continuum that even if the Court may, in particular 


           21    

cases, have to make judgments on the specific facts, this 


           22    

is not one of those cases. 


           23              

QUESTION:  All right, so what is your response 


           24    

if it's 50-50, and you have hundreds of millions of 


           25    

dollars, and --

MR. CHANIN:  My response is --


            2              

QUESTION:  -- what they're saying, remember, is 


            3    

private --


            4              

MR. CHANIN:  My response is it's 


            5    

unconstitutional. 


            6              

QUESTION:  Because? 


            7              

QUESTION:  Your response --


            8              

MR. CHANIN:  Because of the criteria that this 


            9    

Court used in Witters.  What the Court used in Witters, it 


           10    

didn't just say the program is constitutional in Witters. 


           11    

It told us why it was constitutional.  It said, it's 


           12    

constitutional because the aid recipients have generally 


           13    

independent and private choice, and then the Court went on 


           14    

to say what that meant. 


           15              

It said, Witters could choose from a huge 


           16    

variety of options, most of which were secular.  It said 


           17    

that only a -- an insignificant portion of the total 


           18    

program money will end up going to sectarian schools. 


           19    

Those were the criteria. 


           20              

It seems to me there may be a case, a different 


           21    

case, in which the Court will have to determine what do 


           22    

the words, substantial portion, significant amount, huge 


           23    

array of choices mean, but the Court does that all the 


           24    

time.  It's the normal line-drawing. 


           25

MR. CHANIN:  This is not a line-drawing case. 


            2              

QUESTION:  Let me just be sure I understand your 


            3    

position.  Supposing there are 10 schools out there, 10 


            4    

private schools, nine of which are nonreligious, and one 


            5    

of which is religious, but the Government money will pay 


            6    

the tuition of the -- for the parents who choose the 


            7    

religious school.  Is that, in your view, consistent with 


            8    

the Establishment Clause or not. 


            9              

MR. CHANIN:  Oh, that's clearly 


           10    

unconstitutional, Your Honor. 


           11              

QUESTION:  So even if it's 10 percent. 


           12              

MR. CHANIN:  Oh, no.  That -- I'm only -- I'm 


           13    

responding to I think --


           14              

QUESTION:  So we've got two extreme --


           15              

MR. CHANIN:  -- Justice Breyer put to me was, 


           16    

there's a choice --


           17              

QUESTION:  See, the interesting thing, if I 


           18    

understand the case correctly, your view is, if any one 


           19    

school gets the money, it's unconstitutional. 


           20              

MR. CHANIN:  No.  No, Your Honor. 


           21              

QUESTION:  Oh, I thought you said yes. 


           22              

MR. CHANIN:  No.  I'm sorry if I -- I did not.

Or, I may have, but I didn't mean to.

are 10 schools, nine nonsectarian, one sectarian? 


            2              

MR. CHANIN:  I think that is a borderline case, 


            3    

but if it's structured this way, I'm a parent --


            4              

QUESTION:  Well, say there are 100, and 99 


            5    

nonsectarian and one --

QUESTION:  Well, I'm really trying to find out 


           10    

what your position is. 


           11              

MR. CHANIN:  I think I can explain it relatively 


           12    

simply.  If Government money that is attributable to the 


           13    

Government is paid directly to a religious school to pay 


           14    

for a religious education --


           15              

QUESTION:  Well, my hypothetical --


           16              

MR. CHANIN:  -- it's unconstitutional. 


           17              

QUESTION:  -- is that in this -- and the 


           18    

Government says -- you pick your school.  There are 100 of 


           19    

them out there.  One of you picks a parochial school, 


           20    

we'll pay the tuition. 


           21              

MR. CHANIN:  Okay. 


           22              

QUESTION:  We'll send a check direct to the 


           23    

school. 


           24              

MR. CHANIN:  All right. 


           25

            2              

QUESTION:  And your opponent says it's 


            3    

constitutional if 100 percent, so --


            4              

MR. CHANIN:  But I have to know the choice 


            5    

you're giving me as an aid recipient.  Are you saying to 


            6    

me, I can use that money at this one religious school, or 


            7    

at the other 99? 


            8              

QUESTION:  No, I want to use that money at that 


            9    

one -- my private choice is to have my child go the 


           10    

sectarian school. 


           11              

MR. CHANIN:  Absolutely violates the 


           12    

Establishment Clause, in my opinion. 


           13              

QUESTION:  Why? 


           14              

MR. CHANIN:  Because certainly I can say, 


           15    

without hesitation, nothing broke the circuit between the 


           16    

State and the general coffer of the sectarian school, your 


           17    

aid recipient in your hypothetical had no choice 


           18    

whatsoever.  The only choice was to stay in the public 


           19    

schools or go into a religious school.  That is not the 


           20    

kind of choice that this Court referred to in Witters or 


           21    

in Nyquist. 


           22              

QUESTION:  Well, what if, in Justice Stevens' 


           23    

hypothetical, the State would pay the tuition to the 


           24    

nonsectarian private schools, too? 


           25              

MR. CHANIN:  Oh, I think that's Witters.

QUESTION:  What breaks the circuit in my 50-50 


            2    

case?  You say it doesn't break the circuit, but they're 


            3    

saying, well -- the petitioners say, we gave the money to 


            4    

the individuals.  It was the individuals who decided, and 


            5    

they had an equal choice between church-related schools 


            6    

and private ones, other ones, and so that broke the 


            7    

circuit.  Now, your response to that is what? 


            8              

MR. CHANIN:  My response to that is, if this 


            9    

Court concluded that the words, significant amount, huge 


           10    

array of choices, if the Court concluded, as an abstract 


           11    

proposition, that those standards were met on 50-50, I 


           12    

would be most unhappy, but I would conclude that the 


           13    

program was constitutional. 


           14              

QUESTION:  No, no, but give me -- not the case, 


           15    

but give me the rationale. 


           16              

MR. CHANIN:  The rationale is this.  We need to 


           17    

break the circuit.  The only case --


           18              

QUESTION:  They say it does.  Now, forgetting 


19 

the cases, they say it does, so why doesn't it? 


20 

MR. CHANIN:  Well, I would not forget the cases.

I'd say, I don't accept what they tell me.  I want to hear 


22 

what you've said, and I would say the one case in which 


23 

you allowed financial aid to go to pay the tuitions of a 


24 

religious school was Witters, and then I'd say to myself, 


25 

why did you do it in Witters, and words would pop out to

me, huge array of options, only an insignificant portion 


            2    

would end up in sectarian schools.  That, said the Court, 


            3    

is genuine, independent private choice, because of the 


            4    

numbers. 


            5              

QUESTION:  Well, let me ask you this.  Suppose 


            6    

the program were, if the parent chooses the sectarian 


            7    

school, we'll give you a voucher of $2,500.  If the parent 


            8    

chooses the community school, we'll give you a voucher of 


            9    

$4,500? 


           10              

MR. CHANIN:  Your Honor, it's an unreal 


           11    

hypothetical. 


           12              

QUESTION:  Well, it's not, because in effect 


           13    

that's what's happened here. 


           14              

MR. CHANIN:  No, it isn't because the --


           15    

everybody --


           16              

QUESTION:  The community school gets $4,500 a 


           17    

head, and parochial school $2,500, so if it were done by a 


           18    

little voucher working that way, then what is your answer? 


           19              

MR. CHANIN:  It would be no -- it would be un --


           20

           21              

QUESTION:  Would it?

            2    

the religious school. 


            3              

MR. CHANIN:  It's no different than saying, you 


            4    

can take a voucher, you can leave public education and go 


            5    

to a religious school, or you don't limit it to community 


            6    

schools, or, I'll give you money to go to a community 


            7    

school, I'll give you money to go to a magnet school, I'll 


            8    

give you money to go to a traditional school. 


            9              

The choice that you are positing for me is, the 


           10    

choice is between staying in the public schools with 


           11    

whatever the public schools may offer --


           12              

QUESTION:  Well, we haven't been --

           14    

school. 


           15              

QUESTION:  We haven't been referring to 


           16    

community schools as public schools.  The public school 


           17    

system that failed was the traditional old public school 


           18    

system in the community.  The community schools are 


           19    

basically private schools that are getting a different 


           20    

kind of State aid.  Why shouldn't they be considered? 


           21              

MR. CHANIN:  They are not private schools, Your 


           22    

Honor.  They are public schools.  They are subject to 


           23    

Government control.  They are just a method or a mechanism 


           24    

by which the State has chosen to provide a species of 


           25    

public education.  There is a bright line distinction

schools fit, and private education in which the voucher 


            3    

parents can take their money.  It is simply --


            4              

QUESTION:  Do these community schools have to 


            5    

accept all-comers? 


            6              

MR. CHANIN:  There are certain -- they cannot

discriminate on certain bases.  There are a lot of --


            8              

QUESTION:  Right, but can they say, we're only 


            9    

going to take kids who pass a certain test, a certain 


           10    

entry exam?

           12    

academic achievement.

           19    

schools do that. 


           20              

QUESTION:  Well, but why is there the bright 


           21    

line that you talk about which separates community schools 


           22    

from private schools and aligns them with -- other than 


           23    

the fact that they're run by the Government?  Here, the 


           24    

community schools, as I understand it, were set up because 


           25    

they wanted to get away from the kind of failing system

            2    

different. 


            3              

MR. CHANIN:  Because, Your Honor, if the concept 


            4    

of breaking the circuit is going to have any meaning, you 


            5    

have to draw a line, and the only rational line to draw is 


            6    

between public education and private eduction.

QUESTION:  So those are all free schools, 


            3    

supported -- where the others, there's tuition.  That's 


            4    

the line, isn't it? 


            5              

MR. CHANIN:  Can I -- could I try once again on 


            6    

another --


            7              

QUESTION:  By all means. 


            8              

MR. CHANIN:  -- example here? 


            9              

The prototype that this Court has set out for us 


           10    

of genuine, independent, and private choice, is a 


           11    

Government employee.  The Government can pay that employee 


           12    

the paycheck, and that -- even knowing that the employee 


           13    

intends to donate all or part of it to a church, all, with 


           14    

no constitutional problem, because the employee has 


           15    

independent discretion.  He can spend that paycheck any 


           16    

way he wants, for whatever purpose he wants, with no 


           17    

control or direction from the Government. 


           18              

Now, you use that as your analogy of genuine and 


           19    

independent choice.  You don't say that Government 


           20    

employee has independent choice --


           21              

QUESTION:  Mr. Chanin --


           22              

MR. CHANIN:  -- because he didn't have to come 


           23    

work for the Government in the first place.

could have worked everywhere else. 


            2              

QUESTION:  Mr. Chanin, may I ask you a question, 


            3    

because I think we understand the case of the Government 


            4    

employee turning over his paycheck to the Salvation Army, 


            5    

or whatever. 


            6              

Suppose the suburban schools had been included 


            7    

in this mix, that instead of saying, come in if you want, 


            8    

and then the reality is that none of them do, suppose all 


            9    

those school districts surrounding the city were made to 


           10    

be part of the program, and the parents had the choice of 


           11    

sending their children to those public schools, or to the 


           12    

religious private schools, would you then say that --


           13    

would it make any difference, that is, if the public 


           14    

schools in the suburban communities were made to 


           15    

participate in this program? 


           16              

MR. CHANIN:  It would make a difference, but I 


           17    

could not answer as to whether it would be constitutional 


           18    

or unconstitutional as far as the program is concerned, 


           19    

until I saw the specifics of that program, are those 


           20    

public schools a really meaningful type of choice for an 


           21    

inner city child in Cleveland, and I'd also have to make a 


           22    

legal analysis of whether that really is just another way 


           23    

in which the State of Ohio is providing a public 


           24    

education. 


           25              

QUESTION:  Mr. Chanin, can you tell me how we

            1    

get from here to there?  Here we have a failed inner city 


            2    

school system, and the State says, part of the problem 


            3    

with this is monopoly.  We just have to provide diversity, 


            4    

let parents choose a good education. 


            5              

Now, it so happens that the only up-and-running 


            6    

schools that happen to be in the inner city are religious 


            7    

schools, educating the poor people in the city at 


            8    

relatively low rates.  The State of Ohio adopts a program 


            9    

which allows suburban schools to accept these inner city 


           10    

kids, but the suburban schools say, oh, heck no, we don't 


           11    

want the inner city kids come into our suburban schools. 


           12    

How does one get from here to there?  The only schools 


           13    

that happen to be there right now are religious schools. 


           14              

This doesn't mean that the program will always 


           15    

be that way.  The experience in Milwaukee was that as the 


           16    

program continued, there were more and more nonreligious 


           17    

private schools, but right now, to start off with, of 


           18    

course they're mostly religious, and that is going to 


           19    

destroy the entire program, so that we can never get from 


           20    

here to there. 


           21              

MR. CHANIN:  I do not believe, Your Honor, that 


           22    

a crisis in the Cleveland public schools is a license to 


           23    

ignore the mandate of the Establishment Clause, nor do I 


           24    

think it's a mandate to say, ignore it for a while because 


           25    

in a few years it may --

it for 10 years to restructure it and put in more remedial 


            5    

classes, smaller classes, free kindergarten classes --


            6              

QUESTION:  Mr. Chanin, it's very clear to me 


            7    

that Ohio had that option.  The question is, is it 


            8    

unconstitutional for them to choose an option that they 


            9    

think has more likelihood of success, and Justice Scalia 


           10    

put the point that what they're trying to do is have a 


           11    

structure in which different school systems, different 


           12    

curriculums, curriculums that do not inflict terminal 


           13    

boredom on students, can begin to flourish, and the 


           14    

question is, how can they do that in the long term, and 


           15    

you say they cannot do it. 


           16              

MR. CHANIN:  No, I say this, Your Honor.  I say 


           17    

that the Ohio legislature has the right to make an 


           18    

educationally unsound judgment.  It does not have the 


           19    

right to make an unconstitutional judgment.  It must solve 


           20    

the problems in Cleveland within the parameters of the 


           21    

Establishment Clause, and as the brief that -- the amicus 


           22    

brief filed by the National School Boards Association 


           23    

indicates, there are numerous programs that were available 


           24    

to it.  There are problems being solved in urban school 


           25    

districts all over the country without voucher program.

We have not said much about the educational 


            2    

value vel non of voucher programs, because we don't think 


            3    

that this is a forum for an educational policy debate, but 


            4    

they are a lousy option, and we refer you to the amicus

brief of the National School Boards Association.  The 


            6

competition improves the lot for the 96 percent of the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN E. FRANKEL 


           15            

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS GATTON, ET AL. 


           16              

MR. FRANKEL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 


           17    

please the Court: 


           18              

Coming in at this point, I come in in a way 


           19    

toward the beginning and also toward the end of Mr. 


           20    

Chanin's argument.  The discussion of this problem long 


           21    

ago began with talk of a crisis in the public schools of 


           22    

Ohio, and that talk in a strange way has gotten lost in 


           23    

the shuffle as the Court has ranged widely, necessarily 


           24    

but widely, over Establishment Clause questions for which 


           25    

I am now about to submit this may be a strangely

            1    

incongruous vehicle for a decision. 


            2              

As was just pointed out toward the end of what 


            3    

Mr. Chanin was saying, you had a determination sometime 


            4    

ago by the supreme court of the State of Ohio that its 


            5    

system of public school financing is unconstitutional 


            6    

under Ohio's own constitution.  Now, we in our submissions 


            7    

early felt that that was an important threshold question 


            8    

to be looking at, very possibly before you got into big, 


            9    

Federal constitutional questions, and so we have briefed 


           10    

it.  We briefed it in the Sixth Circuit, and we briefed it 


           11    

in this Court. 


           12              

Somewhat remarkably, that question of whether 


           13    

Ohio's school financing system is unconstitutional under 


           14    

its own constitution --


           15              

QUESTION:  But Judge Frankel, wasn't that on the 


           16    

ground that it used the single subject title, rather 


           17    

than --


           18              

MR. FRANKEL:  No, Your Honor, it had nothing to 


           19    

do with that case.  That was a quite separate case called 


           20    

DeRolf, which was decided in 1997.  Under that decision, 


           21    

ever since 1997, Ohio's system of financing its public 


           22    

schools has a) been unconstitutional as a matter of Ohio 


           23    

constitutional law and b) under ongoing repair, which is 


           24    

in progress this very day, and is approaching completion 


           25    

of repair.

QUESTION:  Judge Frankel, you are going to tie 


            2    

this in to the question presented in this case? 


            3              

MR. FRANKEL:  I hope so, Your Honor.

QUESTION:  That was a program designed to rescue 


            5    

economically --

MR. FRANKEL:  I hope so, Your Honor --

QUESTION:  All right. 


            8              

MR. FRANKEL:  -- for this reason, because I want 


            9    

to raise a question whether this Court doesn't reach hard 


           10    

questions first is present here, whether the much-debated 


           11    

Establishment Clause questions are as essential as the 


           12    

Court has been led to believe they are in this case, and 


           13    

whether a decision leaving the Establishment Clause 


           14    

jurisprudence where we think it should stay will be an 


           15    

appropriate resolution for the interests of Ohio and its 


           16    

poor children. 


           17              

QUESTION:  Your assumption, Judge Frankel, is 


           18    

that the problem is a problem of money.  That's all that 


           19    

the supreme court of Ohio --


           20              

MR. FRANKEL:  Is what, Your Honor? 


           21              

QUESTION:  Is a problem of money --


           22              

MR. FRANKEL:  Not only --


           23              

QUESTION:  -- and the studies that I'm familiar 


           24    

with suggest that that is not the case.

QUESTION:  Please let me finish, sir. 


            2              

MR. FRANKEL:  I'm sorry. 


            3              

QUESTION:  The studies that I'm familiar with 


            4    

say that the inner city parochial schools, which spend 


            5    

much less per child on education, do a much better job 


            6    

than the public schools that spend much more, so I just 


            7    

don't think it follows that once you solve a 


            8    

constitutional problem that will get more money, you're 


            9    

going to solve the difficulty that the people of Cleveland 


           10    

found with their public schools.  I don't think that 


           11    

necessarily follows. 


           12              

MR. FRANKEL:  Your Honor, there is mostly 


           13    

anecdotal material comparing the kind of job that's done 


           14    

in parochial and secular schools. 


           15              

QUESTION:  Oh, I don't think it's anecdotal at 


           16    

all.  I mean, there are extensive studies that show that 


           17    

parochial schools do a better job. 


           18              

MR. FRANKEL:  With all --


           19              

QUESTION:  I mean, these are studies by, you 


           20    

know, educational scholars. 


           21              

MR. FRANKEL:  With deference, Your Honor, I 


           22    

don't think that the difficulties that I'm trying to 


           23    

suggest about the Court's getting into the details of some 


           24    

of the Establishment Clause cases that have been mooted 


           25

comparison between parochial schools and public schools. 


            2              

Certainly, as you compare the subject of 


            3    

affluence from district to district, which was the guts of 


            4    

the Ohio decision that I refer to, the problem of 


            5    

comparative qualities changes quite markedly, and you 


            6    

don't have the same kind of problem.  In fact, what you 


            7    

have in Ohio, and a basis for the holding of 


            8    

unconstitutionality, is vast regional disparities between 


            9    

the public schools in affluent districts and the public 


           10    

schools in impoverished districts. 


           11              

QUESTION:  Mr. Frankel, did you make this 


           12    

argument to the court of appeals? 


           13              

MR. FRANKEL:  Yes, Your Honor.  We raised --


           14              

QUESTION:  And how did they deal with it? 


           15              

MR. FRANKEL:  Well, Your Honor, it sort of 


           16    

slipped by --


           17              

(Laughter.) 


           18              

MR. FRANKEL:  -- but we made a point that -- let 


           19    

me put it this way.  I think in fairness to me and the 


           20    

court of appeals, arguments undergo some sea changes as 


           21    

you go from court to court.  We raised this 1997 decision, 


           22    

DeRolf, as a threshold problem that ought to be looked at 


           23    

before you got into wide Establishment Clause questions. 


           24              

On the Establishment Clause, I should add we are 


           25    

as one with our friends here.

in this case? 


            3              

MR. FRANKEL:  No, Your Honor, we didn't think we

had any occasion to do that.

Now, what's happened --


           12              

QUESTION:  Mr. Frankel, may I ask you, has 


           13    

the -- have the Ohio courts ever passed upon this 


           14    

question?  I know they passed on the single statement 


           15    

issue under the Constitution.  Was that issue before the 


           16    

Ohio courts when they passed on the single issue matter? 


           17              

MR. FRANKEL:  The Ohio supreme court, Your 


           18    

Honor, in what we consider obiter, said it found 


           19    

consistency with the Establishment Clause, but it had 


           20    

already held its statute unconstitutional on State 


           21    

grounds, so we never could reach that.  That's why we came 


           22    

to the Federal court.  Now -- so we've never had that 


           23    

question adjudicated. 


           24              

QUESTION:  But the fact that it issued the 


           25    

obiter indicated that it was not concerned with the point

QUESTION:  With the point that you're now

addressing to us. 


            7              

MR. FRANKEL:  No, Your Honor, it didn't take 


            8    

proper concern of everything that we thought it should 


            9    

have looked at.  What I am saying is that in the midst of 


           10    

Ohio's efforts, which are almost completed, to resolve 


           11    

whether Mr. Justice Scalia has the answer or not, the 


           12    

great core problem of public education in Ohio, in the 


           13    

midst of that, they come slicing across this situation, 


           14    

having held their own system unconstitutional in 1997, and 


           15    

they create this voucher program. 


           16              

Well, there we are.  We're served up with a 


           17    

voucher program, so we look at it, and looking at it, we 


           18    

have argued, and Mr. Chanin has sufficiently covered that, 


           19    

that it is unconstitutional, and we think their effort to 


           20    

defend it is somewhat slap-dash, especially, for example, 


           21    

when they try to defend proselytization in a few hasty 


           22    

paragraphs, overturning 50 years of precedent, as they 


           23    

would hope, and saying proselytization with Government 


           24    

money is okay, where we say that the law since 1948 has 


           25    

been to the contrary, and that's because this voucher

upheld the constitutionality of this program under the 


           15    

Establishment Clause, and approved its use as one solution 


           16    

for solving the problem in Cleveland and for any school 


           17    

district that might find itself in a similar unfortunate 


           18    

situation. 


           19              

Second, it appears that respondents have either 


           20    

ignored or do not accept the last 20 years or so of this 


           21    

Court's jurisprudence.  Each of the legal principles they 


           22    

have raised here today and in their briefs have been 


           23    

expressly rejected by the Court. 


           24              

Their reliance on percentages was expressly 


           25    

rejected by this Court in Mueller.  Their arguments about

substantiality of the aid going to religious schools was 


            2    

rejected by five members of the Witters Court. 


            3              

Their question about indoctrination, or 


            4    

proselytization, has been specifically rejected by this 


            5    

Court in the cases involving true private choice, Mueller, 


            6    

Witters, Zobrest, and confirmed again in Agostini and 


            7    

Mitchell most recently. 


            8              

Third, and Your Honor, I believe this goes to 


            9    

your question, Justice Breyer, and your concerns, Justice 


           10    

O'Connor, about the breadth of options that are offered to 


           11    

all Cleveland students, the State of Ohio has looked to 


           12    

every conceivable educational option available, to include 


           13    

all Cleveland students, to include all-comers in terms of 


           14    

students and schools. 


           15              

QUESTION:  Are community schools public schools 


           16    

in Ohio? 


           17              

MS. FRENCH:  They are considered public schools, 


           18    

Your Honor. 


           19              

QUESTION:  They have separate boards? 


           20              

MS. FRENCH:  They do. 


           21              

QUESTION:  Separate employees? 


           22              

MS. FRENCH:  They do.  They do have separate 


           23    

employees. 


           24              

QUESTION:  And not the same control over content 


           25    

of programs?

            1              

MS. FRENCH:  That's right, Your Honor.  It is 


            2    

separately, it's not --


            3              

QUESTION:  It's publicly financed? 


            4              

MS. FRENCH:  Yes, Your Honor, and it does have 


            5    

the same sorts of financial requirements.  They get 


            6    

audited a little differently.  There are more controls, 


            7    

but it is slightly different, because it's not --


            8              

QUESTION:  They charge tuition, though?  They 


            9    

charge --


           10              

MS. FRENCH:  Community schools do not charge 


           11    

tuition, Your Honor. 


           12              

QUESTION:  Do not charge tuition? 


           13              

MS. FRENCH:  And in answer to your question 


           14    

earlier to Mr. Chanin, it's open to all-comers.  If they 


           15    

have -- if they don't have enough spaces available for all 


           16    

who have applied, they must accept students on a lottery 


           17    

system the way that a public school would have to accept 


           18    

all-comers.  The scholarship program, though, among all of 


           19    

this array of options, is really the poor relative.  They 


           20    

get less money, parents have to pay tuition, and they get 


           21    

no tutorial grants. 


           22              

Perhaps the best way to describe the array of 


           23    

options is that at the eye-level of parents.  This Court 


           24    

has said it is important in Rosenberger and again in 


           25    

Justice Powell's concurrence in Witters, that it is

important to view all of the circumstances, view all of 


            2    

the consequences as a whole. 


            3              

What respondents seem to want us to do is 


            4    

exclude the religious schools as an option.  This Court on 


            5    

many occasions has told us that we can neither inhibit nor 


            6    

advance religion, and that would certainly be the cause 


            7    

there. 


            8              

Finally, it is apparent from the Court's 


            9    

questions and respondents' arguments that the Ohio general 


           10    

assembly had a number of competing and conflicting 


           11    

considerations before it in the face of and in an 


           12    

environment of an educational crisis it needed to solve, 


           13    

and to solve quickly.  It seems that Ohio did it right. 


           14    

It didn't take too much money away from the public 


           15    

schools, but gave enough for a limited program that is 


           16    

targeted to the most needy, the poorest of the poor, the 


           17    

low income students who would not otherwise have choice. 


           18    

It is for that reason that we ask the Court to overturn 


           19    

the decision of the Sixth Circuit and uphold this program. 


           20              

Thank you. 


           21              

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Ms. French. 


           22              

The case is submitted. 


           23              

(Whereupon, at 11:25 a.m., the case in the 


           24    

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
