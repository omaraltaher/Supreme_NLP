10

12  determination that a defendant is not guilty is a final 
13  determination of an acquittal for -- for double jeopardy 
14  purposes, even if that determination is wrong as a

23  determination of something else, as in Scott, for 
24  example, pretrial delay.

the facts of the case; in other words, without making a 
determination of the defendant's guilt or innocence.

3  dwelling -- midway during the trial, I'm the judge, I 
4  consider this has to be a dwelling, is there any way I 
can make that point, make that ruling, without invoking 
5

18  the defendant -- once the judge has made a final 
19  determination that the defendant is not guilty, even on 
20
21  multiple times that that is a final determination --
22  that is an acquittal, for double jeopardy purposes. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because, I suppose, the

 MR. MORAN:  If a state chooses, 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even when the defendant 

to make this incorrect notion that you have to negate 
the higher crime, in order to convict of the lesser 
crime, it was the defendant that led the -- the trial 
judge into error.  The trial judge didn't come up with 
this on his own.

1  government --
2
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So whether the unfairness 
3  adheres in the prosecution or in the judge, the guy's 
4  been treated unfairly.
5
6  Justice Scalia, to vest acquittal power in its judges, 
7  it must accept the double jeopardy consequences of that.

10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  Your Honor, on defendant's motion, that's correct.  But 
17  it was actually supported by the jury instructions that 
18  were in use.  And actually, it was supported by the 
19  structure of the statute in question.  The statute in 
question, under which Mr. Evans was charged, explicitly 
20
21  said that the building other than one specified in the 
22  preceding subsection --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you don't --

there is one of the two counsel urging the court to do

6  the wrong thing; right?

9  system consists of.
 MR. MORAN:  Yes.  And in Sanabria, this 
10
11  Court noted that point exactly, that all acquittals, 
12  whether they're by the judge or by the jury -- or I 
13  should say almost all acquittals, some are sua sponte --
14  almost all acquittals, whether by judge or by jury, are 
15
16
17  provide a procedure where, if a judge makes a critical 
18  ruling mid-trial, that at the request of the opposing 
19  counsel, jury proceedings are suspended for 48 hours, 
20
21  to get a mandate? 
22
23  that, Justice Kennedy, because of Smalis. 
24
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because of?
 MR. MORAN:  Because of Smalis.  So that was 
25

upon invitation of defense counsel. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- could a state 

and the aggrieved party can run to the court of appeals 

 MR. MORAN:  I don't think the state could do 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company

and go to the court of appeals. 

And this Court said it couldn't do that because that was 

1  essentially the situation in Smalis.  You had a bench
 
2  trial.  The judge grants a demurrer.  He says the
 
3  evidence is insufficient.  And then the prosecution
 
4  attempted to run to the Pennsylvania appellate court.
 
5
6  a final determination.  I think --
7
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, in my hypothetical, 
8  the state said -- and this isn't a final determination; 
9  the ruling doesn't become final until you have 48 hours 
10
11
 MR. MORAN:  Well, I think a state could 
12  make -- could -- investing acquittal power in judges 
13  could put limitations on that acquittal power. 
14
15
16  easy when you have a jury because what happens is a 
17  judge can decide whether, at the end of the 
18  prosecution's case, he's going to dismiss for 
19  insufficiency, or he can give it to the jury, and if the 
20
21
22  dismisses the case after the prosecution's judgment, but 
23  not if he sets aside the verdict, correct? 
24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How would they do that? 
I'd like to go back to Justice Kennedy's question.  It's 

 MR. MORAN:  Well, jeopardy attaches both 

ways, but a retry -- a reversal is possible in the -- in 

jury renders a verdict, set it aside. 

 Jeopardy attaches only if the judge 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In the latter. 
 MR. MORAN:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what can a state 

do -- some have done something -- to ensure that, even 

 MR. MORAN:  Well, the easy --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So give us an example of 
what, in a judge trial, a state could do to ensure that 

1  the latter. 
2
3
4
5
6  if jeopardy has attached, that there can be a valid 
7  reversal; if the judge is wrong on a legal theory. 
8
9
10
11  a legally wrong judgment is still reversible. 
12
13
14  could it do?
15
16  trial, if the judge has the power to acquit or convict 
17  and the judge acquits, I believe the Double Jeopardy 
18  Clause would preclude the state from coming up with a 
19  clever mechanism allowing -- for allowing appellate 
review.  The Court, of course -- I mean, the state 
20
21  could, of course --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I thought there were, in 
22
23  your briefs, some examples -- in someone's brief, there 
24  were some examples --
25

 MR. MORAN:  In a bench trial, Your Honor? 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In a bench trial.  What

7
 MR. MORAN:  Well, they could withdraw the 
8  power of judges to grant acquittals or convictions in 
9  the first place.  In other words, they could abolish 
10
11
12  Counselor?  You're sinking your hole deeper.  You're not 
13  helping yourself in this argument because how does that 
14  help the system?
 MR. MORAN:  Well, with all respect, Your 
15
16  Honor, the Double Jeopardy Clause here transcends the 
17  state's --
18
19  mean no state could ever say to a judge, given --
given -- render a verdict on the prosecution's theory, 
20
21  and then set it aside?  If you think the theory is not 
22  legally --
 MR. MORAN:  After Smith, it's clear that 
23
24  immediate reconsideration is a possibility.  And if a 
state set up a system, as in Lydon v. Municipal Court, 
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't disagree.  You

1  where you have essentially a magistrate making a 
2  preliminary determination, and then it goes to a higher 
3  judge who goes trial de novo, that, of course, is 
4  permissible.
 But if the judge is the final arbiter -- in 
5
6  other words, if the judge sits in the place of the jury, 
7  this Court has said, over and over again, that a judge 
8  verdict is equivalent to a jury verdict, for purposes of 
9  Double Jeopardy.
 So, yes, courts -- a state could set up 
10
11  systems, in which judges have less power than a jury 
12  does.  I'm not aware of any state that's done that.  I 
13  am aware of what Nevada has done, which has said that 
14  judges can't grant mid-trial directed verdicts.  And 
15
16
17  "mid-trial." 
18

20

23  those states? 
24

 MR. MORAN:  Yes.  Yes.  Nevada. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, what happens in 

 MR. MORAN:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What -- what is not 

 MR. MORAN:  Well, in that case, then there 

is no problem because, if the judge makes a

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You keep saying, 

mid-trial?  Some states require a judge to wait.

focus on the bench trial process. 

 MR. MORAN:  If -- but if the judge at the 

that determination, consistent with the Double Jeopardy 
guarantee, unless the state has set up a system as in 
Lydon -- as Massachusetts did in Lydon.  But short of 
that, a judge's determination is entitled to the same 
respect.

17  grants an acquittal and says, I think that prompt 
18  prosecution is an element of the offense, and there 
19  wasn't prompt prosecution here.  Now, could there be a 
20
21
22
23  he thinks that that's an element of the offense? 
24
25

 MR. MORAN:  Because no part of my argument 
depends upon the judge's labeling.  What the judge has 

re-prosecution in that situation? 

 MR. MORAN:  Yes, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Even though the judge says 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

characterized what he had done as acquitting the
 

1  done in that case is -- is a mid-trial dismissal that he 
2  called an acquittal, but it was actually a dismissal for 
3  another purpose.  That's exactly what Scott was talking 
4  about.  And that is like Scott, where the judge may have 
5
6  defendant, but he --
7
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, he saw a phantom
 
8  element, and -- and that's what happened here, too,
 
9  isn't it?

 MR. MORAN:  Well, pretrial delay is not an 
10
11  element of the offense.  Pretrial delay is another part 
12  of criminal procedure in this state. 
13
 JUSTICE ALITO:  And this -- and the fact 
14  that this was not a dwelling wasn't an element of the 
15
16
17  offense.  And then Scott clarified what Martin Linen 
18  meant.  Martin Linen was an attempt to distinguish 
19  between cases in which the judge makes a ruling relating 
20
21  some other purpose. 
22
23  Supreme Court drew here is that it is completely 
24  impossible to administer.  And if I can give a couple of 
25

examples, the Lynch case, from the Second Circuit, was 

to guilt or innocence and a ruling designed to serve 

offense, either. 

 MR. MORAN:  But it is clearly related to the 

 The problem with the line the Michigan

willfulness element?  In which case, all you've done is 

1  an effort by one circuit to attempt to administer -- to 
2  follow the Maker line, and you get questions that are 
3  completely unanswerable in that case. 
4
5
6  misconstrue an existing element.  Or is it, as the 
7  dissent claimed in Lynch, a -- a new element?  And these 
8  are questions like how many angels can dance on the head 
9  of a pin.  They're simply semantics.  It's all labeling. 
10
11
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, there -- that's a 
12  problem.  But you're -- to come back to my earlier 
13  question, your -- what is your answer?  Your answer is 
14  that, if the judge grants an acquittal based on the 
failure to prove anything that the judge thinks the 
15
16  prosecution has to prove, that's an acquittal.  Is that 
17  fair? 
18
19  this Court's footnote in Scott, that courts are 
20
21  relating to guilt and innocence and rulings designed to 
22  serve other purposes.  So if you have a devious judge 
23  who's determined to package a prosecutorial misconduct 
24  ruling as an acquittal, I have no doubt that an 
25

appellate court would be able to -- to smoke that out. 

 MR. MORAN:  Yes.  And -- and I fall back to 

perfectly capable of distinguishing between rulings 

13

limitations defense was raised.  Would that be -- would 

something the prosecution has to prove in order to 
establish guilt. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, to come back to the
 
1
2  argument we just heard, so suppose the judge grants a
 
3  mistrial for failure to prove an action within the
 
4  statute of limitations, even though no statute of
 
5
6  that be an acquittal? 
7
 MR. MORAN:  Only -- I think my answer to 
8  that would depend on how you rule in the prior case, 
9  depending on whether the statute of limitations is -- is 
10
11 
12
 JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Assuming, for 
13  the sake of argument, that it's not an element -- it's 
14  not really an element, but the judge thinks it's an 
15
16
17  that could result in an acquittal, if it is -- if the 
18  defendant raising the statute of limitations is 
19  something that could result in an acquittal -- because I 
come to Burks, where Burks says an affirmative insanity 
20
21  defense, the prosecution fails to disprove that, that is 
22  an acquittal -- when the appellate court concluded that 
23  there was failure to disprove the affirmative insanity 
24  defense.

element. 

 MR. MORAN:  Well, if it -- if it's something 

 That shows that that language in Martin 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company

which include affirmative defenses or --

really isn't.  Then you said the court of appeals could 
straighten that out? 

1  Linen can't be taken as if it was construing the terms 
2  of an easement.  You have to look at what was Martin 
3  Linen getting at.  And Martin Linen is trying to 
4  identify those rulings relating to guilt or innocence, 
5
6
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm not sure I understand 
7  the rationale for your answer to your own hypothetical. 
8  The judge characterizes a prosecutorial -- or a 
9  misconduct incident as a grounds for acquittal; it 
10
11 
12
 MR. MORAN:  Yes.  That's Scott. 
13
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  On what rationale -- so 
14  what's the general principle that allows the court of 
15
16
 MR. MORAN:  If the judge has made a ruling 
17  going to the defendant's guilt or innocence and finding 
18  that, as in Martin, examining the government's evidence 
19  and finding that they have failed to prove the 
20
21  if the judge has made a ruling that is designed to serve 
22  some other purpose, so if the judge, in my hypothetical, 
23  were to say --
24
25

defendant's guilt, final.  There can be no appeal. But 

appeals to do this sometimes and not others? 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Oh, I thought -- I thought 

it was the judge just subjectively does this, but he 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

demonstrates the problem of -- of the Michigan Supreme 

1  doesn't say any -- he just characterizes it as an
 
2  acquittal?
 
3
4  actually, quite a bit like some of the cases, and it
 
5
6  Court's line.  So example, in Martin Linen, all the 
7  judge said is, this is one of the weakest cases I've 
8  ever seen. 
 Presumably, if the Respondent were to win, 
9
they would be entitled to appeal a determination like 
10
11  that to at least try to convince the appellate court 
12  that the reason the case seems so weak to the trial 
13  judge was that the trial judge had added an extra 
14  element.
15
16  said -- he granted a demurrer by looking at the 
17  prosecution's case and saying that, I find the evidence 
18  insufficient.  And, in fact, in Smalis, the --
19  Pennsylvania tried to argue that the judge had actually 
20
21  murder. 
 And -- and so -- you know, they would be 
22
23  entitled to make these arguments.  And so then we get 
24  into questions of, in granting acquittals, would judges 
25

heightened the burden for mens rea for third-degree 

 Same thing in Smalis, where the judge simply 

Official

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I see the problem, but I am 

1
2  still back to where Justice Kennedy was -- and that is 
3  my own failing here.  I didn't quite understand.  I 
4  thought, when you grant a dismissal and you dismiss the 
case in the middle of the trial because the prosecution 
5
6  was brought too late, all you're doing is, in the middle 
7  of the trial, granting something you should have granted 
8  in the first place before you impaneled the jury. 
9
 But I thought that, in Fong Foo, Judge 
Wyzanski had dismissed the case after empanelment 
10
11  because he wrongly thought that the U.S. attorney had 
12  been talking to a witness or a juror or something at 
13  lunch time and that he had -- and that's an acquittal. 
14  And I thought Justice Harlan, for the Court, wrote 
15
16  again.  And I didn't think the Court ever overruled 
17  that.  That -- what -- in where? 
18
19  explicitly overruled, but I think it has been limited by 
20
21
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So Scott says that even in 
22  judge-wise -- Scott says Fong Foo was wrong, that that 
23  -- because the reason that Charlie Wyzanski dismissed it 
24  is he has this idea of a -- the AUSA doing something 
25

improper at lunch.  And -- and that's -- that's -- now, 

Double Jeopardy, Jeopardy attached, you can't try him 

 MR. MORAN:  Fong -- Fong Foo has not been 

Scott. 

17
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
 MR. MORAN:  But the second one was the total 

1  on your theory -- on the theory you just enunciated, 
2  there would -- there would -- Double Jeopardy wouldn't 
3  protect against the second indictment, right? 
4
 MR. MORAN:  Well, Justice Breyer, Fong Foo 
actually listed two reasons why the trial judge granted 
5
6  the directed verdict.  One was prosecutorial misconduct. 
7  The judge apparently thought that the prosecutor had 
8  been speaking with a witness. 
9
10
11  lack of credibility of the prosecution's witnesses. 
12  And -- and when the case came --
13
14
15
16  good for Double Jeopardy purposes, but I would make 
17  clear that the prosecutorial misconduct rationale is 
18  not. 
19
20
21  of prosecutorial misconduct on dumping this case 
22  mid-trial, yes, the prosecution gets another bite at the 
23  apple, assuming that it's done on -- on the defendant's 
24  motion.
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, this business 
13  about the judge being a representative of the state, I'm 
14  not sure how far that gets you.  The government is one 
of the adversaries appearing before the judge, and the 
15
16  judge is not supposed to take the government's side.  So 
17  he is not really a part of the government.  And it does 
18  seem to me that, if they had been thrown out of court 
19  because of a legal error, that's not a fair shot.
 MR. MORAN:  Well, I understand that view, 
20
21  Mr. Chief Justice, but it's contrary to a lot of this 
22  Court's cases.  I think this Court would have to review 
23  a lot of its cases, most recently, Smith and Smalis and

affects the quality of a judgment -- and Scott also

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's looking at it 
from the defendant's perspective.  We have said that the 
15
16  government should have one fair shot at conviction.  And 
17  it seems to me that, if they lose because of an error, 
18  that's not a fair shot. 
19
20
21  purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause is, is to protect

because there are lots of these cases in which legal 
error was made.  And so -- in Rumsey, you could say 
exactly the same thing about Mr. Rumsey. 

1  hard to argue with a notion that your client has gotten 
2  a windfall here?  I mean, this is not continuing 
3  government oppression and -- and -- you know, that's --
4  that -- that suggests a real harm on the part of your 
client.  I mean, here because of a legal error, your 
5
6  client walks away the winner when he shouldn't have. 
7
 MR. MORAN:  Well, Your Honor, without the 
8  error, the trial would have -- would have continued. 
9  But I think that argument, respectfully, proves too much 
10
11 
12 
13
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, I think that's right. 
14  This is -- this is an argument against this whole line 
of cases, that this whole line of cases essentially has 
15
16  set up a system where the real purposes of the Double 
17  Jeopardy Clause do not apply and where defendants walk 
18  away with windfalls.  And I guess what's your best 
19  argument against that proposition?
20
21  equivalency of a judicial acquittal to a jury acquittal, 
22  you have to accept that both actors are capable of 
23  error.  Both actors are human.  Juries are incapable --
24  are capable of making legal errors, as well as factual 
25

 MR. MORAN:  Well, once you accept the 

errors.  They are capable of misunderstanding the

5
6  acquitted Mr. Evans for the same reason. 
7
8  factual errors, especially when -- and often, there are 
9  mixed questions of fact or law that are at stake here --
I think, is a losing proposition.  I think it -- I think 
10
11 
the Court has decided to draw a firm line, recognizing 
that an acquittal is special.  An acquittal is the most 
12 
13 
fundamental thing that can happen. 
14
you have Double Jeopardy looming in -- in -- in the 
15
16  case, then arguments like the one that the defendant 
17  made and the judge bought have to be made pretrial, and 
18  if they are not made pretrial, they are waived.  I mean, 
19  here, the -- the -- the case was ongoing when the 
20
21  had built into it a requirement that defendants that are 
22  going to make this kind of plea do it pretrial. 
23
24  it would have been right for Mr. Evans to make this 
25

defendant made this suggestion, as opposed the system 

argument pretrial because it was only with the

1  prosecution's proof that it became clear that what the 
2  prosecution was proving was that the building burned 
3  was, in fact, a dwelling house and, therefore, seemed to 
4  be excluded by the statutory language and especially the 
commentary to the jury instructions from the definition 
5
6  of the offense. 
7
 Michigan is an information state.  Michigan 
8  does not require an indictment that lists every -- every 
9  little bit of the crime and all of the details.  All 
Michigan requires is a very simple statement of the 
10
11 
crime and the statutory citation and, of course, who the 
defendant is and the date and venue of the alleged 
12

14
 And so here, Mr. Evans would have had no way 
of knowing in advance what the prosecution was going to 
15
16  prove.  That's why this case is unlike Lee.  This is --
17  Lee is an effective indictment.  Nobody claims that Mr. 
18  Lee was innocent and that the prosecution couldn't prove 
19  the elements of the crime against Mr. Lee.  The problem 
was just that the indictment failed to allege a specific

4  thereof, other than those specified in the next

And the thinking -- the thinking of the defense attorney

22  were complementary to each other; in other words, that

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. BAUGHMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
 Mr. Baughman.

 This trial here was ended before verdict

15
16
17  has been conceded throughout the appellate history of 
18  this case, from the Michigan Court of Appeals on, that 
19  there is no such element in -- in the -- in the crime.
 The statute that Mr. Moran mentioned, that 
20
21  refers to the next preceding section, over three decades 
22  ago, was held to be words of limitation; in other words, 
23  you don't have to prove it's a dwelling, to prove that 
24  other real property -- a building or other real property 
25

that the crime charged contained an uncharged element on 
which insufficient proof had been presented for a 
rational factfinder to find guilt beyond a reasonable 
doubt; that uncharged element being that the offense be, 
for want of a better term, of a -- excuse me -- the 
structure be, for want of a better term, a non-dwelling. 
 We had -- that had not been alleged.  But it 

has been burned.

 And so the proofs were adequate -- were 

appropriate here, and the charging document was

 So in the 1970s, it was held the difference 
1
2  between the two statutes is the greater requires proof 
3  of a dwelling or a habitation; the lesser does not.  The 
4  judge held that you have to prove the negative of the

7  And, again, that's been conceded to be error throughout 
8  the entire appellate history here.

10
11  appropriate here.  And the question becomes, on these 
12  facts, does termination of the trial by the judge 
13  constitute an acquittal, so that jeopardy should bar a 
14  second trial?
 The Jeopardy Clause is aimed at prohibiting 
15
16  certain governmental abuses that occurred historically. 
17  One of them is when the government would terminate a 
18  trial that was not going well, without the consent of 
19  the defendant, in order to take another shot at it -- to 
build a better case or perhaps get a better factfinder. 
20
21
22  that kind of conduct by establishing, through this 
23  Court's cases, that mistrials without the consent of the 
24  defendant bar retrial, that abhorrent practice is 
25

barred, unless a manifest necessity is shown. 

 And the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits 

28

 And we've even extended that to the 

 But if there is consent, as there was in 

valued right to a decision by this tribunal -- if he 
does that, then that -- the other side of that coin is, 
that is ordinarily outcome-determinative the other way. 

1
2  circumstance that, if the judge is intending to help the 
3  defendant, if he is doing something that he believes is 
4  in defendant's favor, if defendant has not consented, 
then that valued right to a verdict from the tribunal 
5
6  that he is before trumps everything. 
7
8  this case -- the defendant asked the judge to terminate 
9  the trial without going to this jury, so he gave up his

11 
12 
13
14  government has achieved the first harm by the back door;

17  this on her own, that would have been okay?  And there 
18  would be Double Jeopardy attaching?

22  source of the error?

3  really saying exactly something like this -- you know, 
4  that the jury has to find this additional element that, 
in fact, it doesn't have to find?  But your theory, I

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, we've historically

6  you are asking us to overrule go back 50 years.

promulgated and adopted into the Constitution.

Fifty years is not back to when we were determining what

noted, there is very little explanation in Fong Foo as 
15
16  to how the Court came out where it came out, and there 
17  has been very little explanation since as to how we got 
18  from the common law prohibition of a retrial after 
19  acquittal on the merits by a jury, to a ruling of law by 
20
21  reasonable doubt being the same thing, which is where we 
22  are today.

the judge that no jury could find guilt beyond a 

 And as I think most of the commentators have 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You cannot necessarily --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, we didn't have it, at 

the time of the founding, any mechanism for a judge to 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 It's not as though this procedure existed at 

the time of the founding or in English law before then 

acquittal, does -- does that constitute Double Jeopardy? 
 MR. BAUGHMAN:  Well, I think you are exactly 

1  do that.  I mean, this -- this is a new procedure, and 
2  how it fit into the prohibition of Double Jeopardy was 
3  certainly a -- an open question. 
4
5
6  and was never adequate to -- to constitute Double 
7  Jeopardy.  It's a new procedure introduced, so the 
8  question for the Court was, well -- you know, if it's 
9  the judge rather than the jury that pronounces the 
10
11
12  right.  It, of course, is a new procedure.  It didn't 
13  exist at the time of the founding.  So our question then 
14  becomes is this new procedure sufficiently equivalent to 
that procedure that is historically protected, that 
15
16  it's -- that the protections that it is designed to 
17  guard against are served when we bar retrial in these 
18  circumstances? 
19
there are many circumstances where what -- what we are 
20
21  doing is giving the defendant a windfall while serving 
22  no interest that was protected by the Jeopardy Clause. 
23  So if it's to be an analog, then we need to see does it 
24  really closely approximate a retrial after acquittal on 
25

 And I think, as Justice Kagan has indicated, 

the merits by a jury --

33
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

and we don't have any mechanism for inquiring, so we 
treat -- you have to have a line somewhere.  Jeopardy 
terminates with the jury verdict, which may have been 
misinstructed, but we don't know why they came out the 
way they did.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the point I was making 
1
2  was that the same windfall is received by the defendant 
3  that gets an acquittal from an improperly instructed 
4  jury.
 MR. BAUGHMAN:  But -- that is true, except 
5
6  we -- we could speculate that's -- that's true, but we 
7  don't know why the jury came back the way it did.  The 
8  jury may have acquitted for an entirely different 
9  reason.  We don't know.  We don't have special verdicts, 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  you -- you -- you agree that sometimes the 
18  prosecution -- I'm not saying anyone would -- but 
19  they -- the defendant's acquitted by the jury so --
because he doesn't find -- they don't find enough 
20
21  evidence, and so the prosecutor thinks, I think I'd like 
22  to try him again, and then he's acquitted again.  I'd 
23  like to try him again, and he's acquitted again. 
24
25

 If they --

problem of the Double Jeopardy Clause. 

 And where I'm driving is that -- that there 

that's it.  That's what we're after.  And where it's 
some procedural thing or not, maybe we aren't.  Okay. 

1  there's no answer to that, is there?  And if there's no 
2  answer to that, the same bad thing could happen.  Well, 
3  then you're going to have to start distinguishing among 
4  which judge or jury acquittals do or do not invoke the 
5
6
7  is a principle, and the principle was -- it seems the 
8  simplest way to put it, is where in fact the acquittal 
9  rests upon a judgment that there isn't enough evidence, 
10
11 
12
 Now, the virtue of that is it's simple, it's 
13  consistent with the cases, it's been clear.  And you're 
14  advocating, let's go into that and change it or at least 
15
16  we're saying there wasn't enough evidence, is because 
17  the judge had in mind a legal point that he was wrong 
18  about, then Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't work.  But if 
19  the judge was right, it does work.  Well, except for the 
matter of substantive evidence.  Now, that way, as your 
20
21  opponent, lies a mess. 
 I just went through that long thing because 
22
23  I don't want you to get -- sit down without addressing

 The other side of it, where the clause 

 MR. BAUGHMAN:  Well, I think -- I think

2  attorney, I didn't like it," or "Talk to the witness,"

attaches, is where it was done on a substantive basis, 
5
6  not enough evidence.  I said -- I don't want to repeat 
7  myself, but I'm saying what he's coming up with is a 
8  simple, clear rule, basically consistent with the cases, 
9  and why shouldn't we follow it?
10
11  consistent with the cases, and also clear, is to apply 
12  Martin Linen Supply by the very terms that it uses; that 
13  is, the resolution that we're talking about the judge 
14  making is moored to something.  It's moored to the 
15
16  being twice tried for the same offense.  How do we 
17  define offense in the law? 
18
19  has taken an elements approach.  Two -- two offenses 
20
21  element, the other does not.  We look to the elements. 
22  And to direct a jury trial, this Court has been very 
23  active very recently in determining how is it that we 
24  determine when somebody has a right to a jury trial on 
some fact before punishment can be imposed?  We look to 
25

elements of the crime.  We're talking about somebody

to identify them in every case. 

 This is not a -- a strange process you have

1  what are the elements that have to be proven beyond a

add a new element, you say that there would be Double

 And you will find a great many dissents in 
cases between appellate judges on whether or not this 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me give you an example. 
Suppose the -- a statute makes it a crime to burn down a 
dwelling, and the judge interprets dwelling to mean a 
building that is currently lived in and, therefore, not 
including a vacation home.  And let's assume that's an 
incorrect interpretation. 

1  was changed in Jackson v. Virginia, to whether a 
2  reasonable juror could find guilt beyond a reasonable 
3  doubt. 
4
5
6  case itself involved sufficient proof for a jury to find 
7  guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  The test is not always 
8  easily -- easily applicable.  And neither was the no 
9  evidence test.  So there might be some --
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  Or is that the addition of a new element to the statute, 
18  namely, that it is a building in which people -- that's 
19  one element, and the other is people are currently 
20
21
22  would draw the line at any time the court requires the 
23  prosecution to prove a fact that, under the law passed 
24  by the legislature, the prosecution never has to prove 
25

living there? 

 MR. BAUGHMAN:  I -- I would define -- I 

 Now, is that an incorrect interpretation? 

in order to make out the case. 

39
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's every 

misinterpretation, you can -- which goes beyond the 

of an element.  The judge didn't here say, you can't 
prove that this is a building, unless it was a dwelling, 
you can't prove it was real property unless it was a 
dwelling. 

1
2  misinterpretation.  I mean, I don't know why this case 
3  doesn't involve simply a misinterpretation of what the 
4  elements of the crime are.  I mean, any 
5
6  minimum that the -- that the statute requires, can be 
7  recharacterized as adding an additional element. 
 MR. BAUGHMAN:  Well, it does involve a -- a 
8
9  mischaracterization of what the elements were, but not 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  prove that it was a non-dwelling in this case. 
17
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But in several of our cases, 
18  what the court has done wrong is to make the prosecution 
19  prove additional facts in order to prove an element.  So 
the distinction that you're drawing is one between 
20
21  incorrectly making the prosecution prove additional 
22  facts and incorrectly saying that the prosecution has to 
23  show an additional element.  And I guess I just don't 
24  understand that distinction.
25

 The judge said, you have -- you can prove 

those things, and it's not enough, you also have to 

 MR. BAUGHMAN:  Well, I would suggest that

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, if I understand your 

I'm looking at them, and they're just not enough for a 
reasonable juror to find guilt --

1  this is an opportunity for this Court to draw the line 
2  at does -- does the judge require -- has the judge 
3  required the prosecution to prove something the statute 
4  doesn't require to be proven, it's not one of the 
5
6
 Or has the judge -- the error the judge can 
7  make under Martin Linen Supply -- has the judge simply 
8  misassessed the evidence?  The judge has looked at it 
9  and said -- you know, I -- I understand all your proofs, 
10
11 
12
13  test correctly, under your test, Rumsey, Smalis, and 
14  Smith would all have come out differently.
 MR. BAUGHMAN:  No, I don't think so.  Rumsey 
15
16  is -- is a difficult case, but Rumsey is a verdict case. 
17  Rumsey is not a directed verdict case.  The judge in 
18  Rumsey was the factfinder.  Rumsey is your bench trial. 
19  It's -- it's -- it's complicated because it was a 
sentencing case -- a death penalty sentencing case that 
20
21  this Court treats the hearing the same as the trial for 
22  Double Jeopardy purposes. 
23
24  more like a misinstructed jury.  The judge himself --

19  something the judge isn't allowed to do.
 So the directed verdict isn't, I don't 
20
21  think, a perfect analog to the jury trial.  But the

 There is, in fact, a case -- the Lynch case

3  court split evenly as to whether or not the judge's 
4  verdict, where the judge had actually specifically found 
all of the elements -- the crime is elements A, B, and 
5
6  C, I find them; I don't find element B, so I acquit --

15
16
17  off-the-beaten-track kind of a situation.  In a jury 
18  trial, where a judge simply takes the case from the jury 
19  on the motion of the defendant and resolves the fact 
that the legislature has not said that one needs to be 
20
21  proven, that is not one of the constituent parts of the 
22  crime, that is not something that need be proven to 
23  impose punishment under the law, then he's done 
24  something very different than what the jury has done.

it was. 

 Smith is about a completely separate 

judge had taken the case away, as a matter of law, from 

1  friend suggested.  It was actually a case involving 
2  factfindings by the judge.  The Court characterized it 
3  as a special verdict made by the sole decisionmaker 
4  there.  It was not an instance like this, where the 
5
6  the jury because there wouldn't be any sufficient 
7  evidence.  It has been cited later on in this cases, in 
8  particular, in Smalis, as being about something like a 
9  sufficiency decision, but on its facts, that's not what 
10
11
12  question because there is no dispute there about the 
13  appropriate construction of the element.  The firearms 
14  offense there, the element in question was whether the 
15
16  question about whether certain evidence that the firearm 
17  in question was a pistol was sufficient to satisfy that 
18  burden, but there was no doubt about what the -- what 
19  the element was.  It was 13 inches or less.  And so it 
20
21
22  context, but if you look at what actually happened in 
23  Smalis and what was at issue in the demurrer there, the 
24  decision that the Court was reviewing was one that was 
principally about whether there was sufficient evidence

now, we have the judge -- for some reason or other, this

1  of causation, which was an undisputed element of each of 
2  the counts at issue there, and only in footnote 7 of the 
3  Court's opinion did it address potential misconstruction 
4  of the element.
5
6  what my -- my friend Mr. Moran mentioned --
7
8  basic question:  Normally, a judge will wait till the 
9  jury comes in and then decide, if the jury convicts him, 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  down his reasons.  So he might just say there isn't 
17  enough evidence.  And now, it happens that, just before 
18  he did that, the defense lawyer argued to him an 
19  erroneous theory.  All right.  An added element or 
something or other, some kind of misconstruction of 
20
21  this.  What happens then? 
22
23  normally expect judges to give reasons for their 
24  decisions.
25

 Now, this is unusual, I think -- I hope. 

And if so, though, the judge might not think of writing

 MR. GANNON:  Many -- many states --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And many states permit 

1  rule in Michigan, and in the Federal Rule 29, does 
2  require the judge to make a determination of -- to

4  mean that there is no -- no sufficient evidence to -- to 
5

7  different rule. 
8

10
11
 MR. GANNON:  My -- my understanding is that 
12  most states do not permit that.  The Federal government 
13  only started permitting that in 1994, and even the last 
14  time the Justice Department studied this, about ten 
15
16  rule amendment in the Federal rules, which came with 
17  advisory committee notes, strongly encouraging judges to 
18  reserve these sorts of decisions precisely to preserve 
19  the public's interest.  So notwithstanding --
20

 MR. GANNON:  Notwithstanding that, in

2  Federal system, at least in the early 2000s, is the only 
3  data collection that I'm aware of. 
4
 And so this -- this still is a problem.  I 
think that if -- if it looks like the decision is based 
5
6  on classic insufficiency of the evidence and there is no 
7  argument about whether it was -- it's based on a 
8  misconstruction or an erroneous addition of the 
9  elements, then we -- we would have to be -- we would 
lose, unless the Court's willing to overturn the broader 
10
11  line of cases in Martin Linens, Sanabria, Scott, and the 
12  other cases that were --
13
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you add to that -- your 
14  -- just your idea of what the empirical situation is in 
the last 30 or 40 years?  Have most U.S. prosecutors or 
15
16  prosecutors in these states thought that they could 
17  appeal an acquittal on the -- in the middle of the trial 
18  on the ground that the judge made a mistake of law? 
19
20
21  certainly has maintained that that -- that that is 
22  appropriate.  In -- we think that in the Maker decision 
23  in the Third Circuit in 1984 recognized this. 
24
25

Mr. Moran asks the Court to conclude that any decision 

 We do think that there is -- my -- my friend 

 MR. GANNON:  I don't think that they -- they 

have mostly thought that, but the Federal government 

49
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 And I think that -- that while, at some 

formal level, that -- that that might be theoretically 

1  like this, that is predicated upon a supposed erroneous 
2  addition of an element, could easily be recharacterized 
3  as a misconstruction of another element. 
4
5
6  true, in an egregious case like this, there is a 
7  distinction, which is that if -- if this were an element 
8  of the offense that needed to be charged in the 
9  indictment -- at least in the Federal system, then the 
failure to have alleged that the structure here was a 
10
11  non-dwelling would have made the indictment invalid. 
12
 And the Defendant would have been able to 
13  make exactly the same legal argument he made to the 
14  judge here, which is to say that the prosecution has 
15
16  necessary elements of the offense, which is that this 
17  structure is not a dwelling.  We know that that 
18  particular --
19
20
21  only.  And I -- I think this characterization, 
22  nonexistent element -- or a court's misconstruction of 
23  an element, I think, in many cases, you could do -- call 
24  it one or call it the other, so that -- that's a

Smalis, and Smith, even the Petitioner doesn't

2  difficult, in the sense that most -- most of the cases 
3  that we are talking about don't involve this type of 
4  error.  The cases that this Court has decided, Rumsey, 
5
6  characterize this case as involving additional elements. 
7
 And this Court has recognized, in Lee, that 
8  when the error is one that kept the indictment from 
9  being valid because it failed to charge a relevant

18  earlier the statistics of how many judges grant Rule 29 
19  motions in trial.  I think you said 76 percent.  What's 
the gross number, relative to the number of actual 
20
21  verdict decisions by juries or the judge himself? 
 MR. GANNON:  The only data that I have seen 
22
23  about this is data that the Justice Department collected 
24  about ten years ago.  It was from the early 2000s. 
And -- and the conclusion there was that there were 
25

element and the judge did not rule on that until after 
jeopardy attached, the government was still entitled to 
appeal that decision, and if it were erroneous -- the 
government's only going to get a chance at retrial if 
the judge's decision was legally erroneous, then, 
therefore, it demonstrates that there was no so-called 
acquittal on the -- on the offense charged --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, you gave us 

51
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Out of what number? 
 MS. GANNON:  -- which actually is a larger 

kind, the non-existent element error, which -- which the 
government had also pointed out in its amicus brief in 
Smalis, we think is the most egregious kind of error. 
It's one that demonstrates that the court is engaging 
in -- it's usurping the province of the legislature in 
redefining the scope of the offense. 

1  approximately 73 pretrial Rule 29 dismissals per year --
2
3
4  number than you -- than you might at first think, 
because that represents about ten percent of the number 
5
6  of cases that were actually resolved by jury verdicts. 
7  And so it -- it is not uncommon. 
 I mean, this particular type of error that 
8
9  we have in this case, we think, is the most egregious 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  Jeopardy Clause itself, which talks about whether 
18  there's been -- somebody's been subject to being twice 
19  in jeopardy for the same offense -- then it -- it 
20
21
 And when the judge has redefined the -- the 
22  crime so extensively that the indictment literally would 
23  have been invalid and could have been dismissed as not 
24  adequately alleging the elements of the offense, and we 
25

know that that is something that the government would 

 And we think, under the terms of the Double

Alderson Reporting Company

 We also know that the government would be 

1  have been able to appeal. 
2
3  able to appeal if the judge had reserved decision until 
4  after the jury had returned a jury -- a guilty verdict.
 We acknowledge, as the state does, that jury 
5
6  verdicts are different.  If a jury is misinstructed and 
7  a jury returns an acquittal, that we are not quarrelling 
8  with that in any way.  We don't think there's any 
9  purchase in the Court's case law to do that.  And I 
think one of the reasons is because the jury verdict 
10
11 
might be attributable, not just to mistake or error, but 
12 
also to lenity or compromise. 
13
 There -- there are lots of reasons why we 
14  don't exactly know why a jury did what it did, and why 
15
16  it different from what we have here.  We have here an 
17  instance where the court, as a matter of law, at the 
18  defendant's behest, took the case away from the jury. 
19  We think the fact that the defendants chose --
20
21 
22
23  important by analogy to the Court's mistrial cases in

 Is there a problem here that justifies going 

 Turning to the -- the broader question about 

1  There is no difference between the two 
2  characterizations. 
3
4  this whole line of cases and should this Court go back 
and revisit this whole line of cases, is there really a 
5
6  problem here?  We have no amicus briefs from any states 
7  indicating that there's a problem.  We have only the 
8  amicus from the United States saying that there's a 
9  problem.
10
11  back and revisiting 50 years -- or possibly 108 years, 
12  all the way back to Kepner -- all of this case law?  We 
13  submit not, especially since, as this Court noted just 
14  six years ago in Smith, there is an easy solution if 
15
16
17  going wild and granting directed verdicts mid-trial for 
18  no apparent reason, all that has to be done is the 
19  states can fall into that, as we can say, judges can't 
do that, or judges as an intermediate -- states as an 
20
21  intermediate step could at least give judges the power 
22  to reserve that decision --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Have any states done that? 
23
24  I -- I'm somewhat concerned about telling a judge that, 
if the judge's best judgment says there's insufficient 
25

there really is a problem. 

 If there really is a problem with judges

 MR. MORAN:  I would be, too,
 

through a trial that is going nowhere. 

 And so there are good reasons why states 

 I'm not aware of any state, since this

4
decision -- since this Court's decision in Smith -- that 
5
6  have followed Nevada's lead.  There are good reasons to 
7  give judges this acquittal power, namely, preserve the 
8  state's resources, preserve the jury's time, and 
9  present -- and prevent the defendant from having to go 
10
11
12  don't do this.  States have apparently made the 
13  decision, even after being alerted in Smith, that 
14  there's something they can do about it, that the good of 
giving judges this mid-trial directed verdict acquittal 
15
16  power outweighs the bad. 
17
 Finally, I'd just like to respond to 
18  Mr. Baughman's point, and it was also raised by 
19  Mr. Gannon, about how jury verdicts are different. 
20
21  don't always know why they granted the verdict. 
 But we have the same problem with judicial 
22
23  directed verdicts.  And we have Martin Linen, where the 
24  judge just says, this is the weakest case I -- I have 
ever seen.  We have Smalis, where he just says, it's 
25

There's something special about jury verdicts because we
