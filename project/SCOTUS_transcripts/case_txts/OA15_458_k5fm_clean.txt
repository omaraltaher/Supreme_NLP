Bouldin.                   Mr. Shanmugam.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief       Justice, and may it please the Court:                   When a judge discharges a jury after it          reaches a verdict, the jury's service is at an end and            the jurors return to being ordinary members of the         public. This case presents the question whether a         district court has inherent authority under Article III        of the Constitution to recall discharged jurors for        further service in the same case, here, for the purpose          of deliberating anew and reaching an entirely different        verdict.             The answer to that question is no. The         established rule of common law forbade the recall of         discharged jurors. In numerous respects, the Federal        Rules of Procedure reflect the understanding that a        district court's authority ends at the point of        discharge.             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you had a          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review clear bright­line rule until I got to page of your             reply brief, where you say, "A jury may remain         effectively undischarged despite a judge's pronouncement       of discharge."              There are cases where you agree that if the         judge says you're discharged, they're not really       discharged, and the judge can say, oh, come on back.          I've got something else you've got to do.                    MR. SHANMUGAM: Mr. Chief Justice, our rule        is clear. It's a rule that a district court lacks the              authority to recall discharged jurors. The question        that we discuss at page of our reply brief is the             question of what the definition of a discharge is. And            what we offer ­­               lawyerly. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's pretty                   (Laughter.)             Justice. MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief                   (Laughter.)             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Saying anytime      you're discharged, it's over. Now, discharge may not be          discharge in every case. Because you recognize that         there are cases where the judge says you're discharged         but you would allow them to come back.        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             MR. SHANMUGAM: And that is simply, Mr.        Chief Justice, because we believe the discharge is an         act; it's not just a pronouncement. And that's what the            vast majority of the lower courts have said. They have           said that a jury is discharged when, having been          released from service, the jurors have left the judge's         presence and control.               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Presence and        control. Now, that's ­­ that's the key distinction that          you have?              MR. SHANMUGAM: That is what lower courts        have said, and we're certainly comfortable with that        distinction. And if ­­                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if they're       still ­­ if they're still in the courtroom, he can say,           wait, hold up. You've got to come back and do this.                        MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes, that is correct. And         that is basically the line ­­                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if they're in        the hall outside the courtroom?                             MR. SHANMUGAM: The hall ­­     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Nothing's happened.      They're all still there.                MR. SHANMUGAM: The hall is outside a        judge's presence and control. And the only cases where          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review jurors have been permitted to be recalled outside the         courtroom under this standard are cases where the        jurors, say, have gone back to the jury room. And I            think it's fair to say under those circumstances, that         the jurors are no longer ­­ are still within the judge's           presence and control.                 Certainly, we don't think that that    definition could be stretched to facts like this case,         where the jurors have not only left the courtroom, but          at least two of the jurors have left the immediate          vicinity of the courtroom. And it appears from the          record as if one of the jurors has left the courthouse           altogether.             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What they're worried       about ­­ what they're worried about with the rule about          discharge and then bringing them back is that the jurors          may have talked to somebody about the case, heard         something about it, had information that's going to be         prejudicial to the defendant that they shouldn't have        gotten. Why doesn't it make sense to say, well, if           they're right out in the hall or, you know, they're down           the hall, bring them back in and ask, just as the judge            did here, have you talked to anybody about the case?                      MR. SHANMUGAM: Mr. Chief Justice, I think         that the courts that have adopted that functional        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review definition of discharge, that have looked at discharge        as the point at which jurors have separated or         dispersed, have focused on the potential for influence,        not the fact of influence. In other words, those courts           aren't applying ­­ aren't engaging in a prejudiced         inquiry under the guise of defining discharge.                   Instead, what they are saying is, in       essence, the point at which the jurors are no longer          together as a unit and, again, no longer within the           Court's instruction and direction is the point at which         they've been discharged. And I think that that has           proven in the case law to be a relatively easy line to             apply.             And many of the cases on which Respondent        relies are cases in that category; in other words, cases          where courts, at the same time as they have recognized          the common law rule, have applied this functional        definition of "discharge."               Now, again, we think that this case plainly        does not fall even within that somewhat broader        definition, and the issue of whether the jury has been          discharged in this case is obviously not in dispute         before this Court. But I do think that in practice, if             this Court were to adhere to the common law rule, that           definition would be pretty easy to apply in practice,         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review and there aren't a lot of lower court decisions that           seem to have struggled with the application of that         decision. And once you take those ­­                               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I ­­     MR. SHANMUGAM: I was just going to say that           once you take those cases away, Respondent really does         not have very much by way of common law authority on           which to rest.               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Am I ­­ are you         confirming that you're not raising a constitutional        barrier to the recall of jurors?                  MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes. I think we have          consistently made the point all along that this issue         obviously implicates the underlying right to a fair         trial. And the rule that we're articulating is         certainly protective of that interest, but it ­­                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. But not ­­        not directly.              MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes, that is correct.                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In most fair trial       analyses, we look to prejudice. You don't get a fair            trial unless there is a likelihood of prejudice. So why            is it that we would make an absolute rule barring the           recall of the jury, except in the circumstance you're         conceding? Why don't we go back to what the Chief           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Justice said? Why aren't we looking for more specific          prejudice?             MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Sotomayor, that is       for the simple reason that we believe this is really a           question about a district court's authority. And in          analyzing whether a district court ­­                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there's no      statutory bar.              MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that is correct, and        there is no explicit bar in the rules. But when you are             considering whether a court has inherent authority under         Article III of the Constitution, the three       considerations on which this Court has relied are,        first, the history ­­ and we believe that, far from          there being a long history in Respondent's favor, that          the history really points decisively in our direction.        The Federal rules, and while it is true that the Federal           rules do not explicitly prohibit jury recall after        discharge, time and again the Federal rules indicate        that a court's authority is limited at the point of           discharge and that a court's authority after discharge         is constrained in various respects. And critically, the         Federal rules also provide specific and concededly       adequate remedies for the defect at issue here, an         invalid or ambiguous verdict.    Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, we don't have a        specific rule that permits district courts to rescind        any order they've issued. But we've routinely, through         history, permitted district courts, when they think       they've entered an erroneous order, to just rescind it.         Why isn't this one of those orders?                   MR. SHANMUGAM: District courts have      authority to be sure to rescind certain types of orders.          In our reply brief, we point to various examples of          orders that cannot be rescinded, such as a decision by a            district court to transfer venue, a decision by a          district judge to ­­               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But those are      statutorily barred from happening.                MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I don't ­­ I don't           think that that's right. I think that courts have said            that those orders are essentially like the order at         issue here, final in the relevant sense; in other words,          a district court's authority is at an end when a          district court transfers the case to another district,        when a judge recuses himself or herself, when a district            court enters final judgment over part of a case under           Rule (b), so ­­               JUSTICE GINSBURG: But until ­­ until final        judgment, is the ­­ the rule is everything is         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review interlocutory. The ­­ when ­­ when the judgment is          entered, that's it, that's an end of the case. District           court loses authority over it. But here we haven't had           a final judgment. Yes, the jury was discharged, but          there's no judgment that's been entered in the case.         Why doesn't the judge retain authority up until the         point where he enters ­­ where judgment is entered on          the jury verdict?               MR. SHANMUGAM: And, Justice Ginsburg, all       of the examples to which I just pointed are orders that,            notwithstanding the fact that final judgment in the case         has not yet been entered, are nevertheless orders that         the entering judge cannot revoke. And so, too, here.          Our submission is a quite straightforward one. It is           that the active discharge denotes the point at which a          district court's authority over the jury is at an end,          and the jury's authority over the case is at an end.                       And to finish my answer to Justice Sotomayor        about the Federal rules, I think it is critically          important here for the purposes of analyzing whether        there is inherent authority that there are specific and         conceivably adequate remedies for correcting an invalid       or ambiguous verdict both before a discharge and after          discharge.             So first, before a discharge, we certainly        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review concede that before the jury is discharged, a district          court has the authority to recall a jury, and it's not            even recalling the jury. It's simply reinstructing the         jury and ordering the jury to engage in further         deliberations. That conspicuously did not take place        here, notwithstanding the fact that both the district        court and Respondent's counsel acknowledged that a       verdict of $ would be invalid.                  After discharge, there are actually two      remedies. The first is the remedy of a new trial, and             we certainly think that that has long been the remedy          for the type of defect at issue here, a verdict that is             contrary to the weight of the evidence, and indeed, not          only contrary to the weight of the evidence, but         contrary to any of the evidence.                  The other remedy, which I do want to focus          the Court's attention on, is the remedy that is provided          in Civil Rule (a). And that is the remedy that           enables a district court to essentially conduct a         streamlined proceeding to correct clerical errors and       oversights and omissions in a judgment. And so in the            other major category of cases on which Respondent        relies, those are cases in which there were simply         mistakes in the original verdict, cases where two        verdict forms might have been found in the record or          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review cases where the recorded verdict ­­                 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In your ­­ in your view ­­         let's suppose the jury were truly discharged and they ­­         they were away for a day, could ­­ but the judgment            hasn't been entered yet. Could the judge amend the          judgment or state in the judgment that $, be         awarded?             MR. SHANMUGAM: No, for the simple reason        that I don't think you would know what a correctly            instructed jury would have done in that circumstance.        And indeed, in this case, the further complication was         that the jury was required not only to award the $,           in stipulated damages for past medical expenses, but        also to award some amount for future expenses. And          indeed, when the jury came back, it returned a verdict           of $,. So I don't think that that could have been             done in this case.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the jury is         discharged and the judge is looking at the verdict and,          I don't know, shows it to the lawyers and says, okay,           it's ,. The lawyer says, no, that's a three. It's             ,. Can the judge just stop the jury and say, well,            here, what is it? Is this or ?                      MR. SHANMUGAM: The proper remedy in that        circumstance, Mr. Chief Justice, would be the one that         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review I've just suggested, namely a proceeding under        Rule (a) of the Civil Rules. And in aid of that            proceeding, the judge has the ability to call back the          jurors, but not as a jury. That's the critical point.            It can call back the jurors, essentially, as witnesses,         and the judge could subpoena the jurors if necessary,         and take affidavits or oral testimony from the jurors to          correct the verdict.               And, again, I think that that's an answer to          the other significant category of cases that Respondent        relies on. Those are cases where you have these various           types of clerical errors, mistakes of a verdict being          recorded. That's different from the verdict that was         actually orally delivered in court. And all of those          cases, under our interpretation, are readily correctable       under Rule (a) and what does not need to be a           particularly complex proceeding.               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but does, in a         certain sense ­­ I don't know if I ­­ it's certainly not              a clerical error, but it is a simple error. I mean, the               point is the judge told the jury, you have to award this            amount in medical expenses, and the jury didn't. Why          doesn't that fall under a different category than the,          you know, questions of certainly guilt or ­­ or         liability or no liability?    Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             MR. SHANMUGAM: So, Mr. Chief Justice, I        think it's certainly fair to say that the error in this           case was an obvious one. Indeed, it was so obvious that            less than an hour earlier when the jury issued a note            asking about whether the damages had already been paid,         again both the district court and Respondent's counsel        acknowledged that if this was heading in the direction         of a $ verdict, that verdict would be invalid.                      But I think it's critically important to        realize that we're not dealing with a case here where           the verdict is somehow facially invalid. I mean, if you            look at the verdict form, which is at Page A of the            Petition Appendix, the four corners of that verdict form         are fine. The verdict simply says, we're finding in          favor of Petitioner, but we're awarding $.                   This is a case that falls into the ­­ the           category of cases where the verdict is contrary to the          weight of the evidence.                And, again, the remedy for that, both under        the Federal rule ­­               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you mean with        respect to the amount they were ­­ they were obligated          to award?              MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that is correct.       Well, with regard to the award, more generally. In          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review other words, they could not have awarded $ as a matter            of law by virtue of Respondent's stipulation, and        that ­­             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the only sense        ­­ the only sense in which it was contrary to the           evidence was that they didn't award the $,. They          awarded zero.              MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If they had ­­                   MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, plus some amount for        future medical expenses. But my point is simply that          even at common law, the remedy in these circumstances         has always been a new trial.                   So in other words, Rule (b) is not some         newfangled invention. If you go back and look at the           cases prohibiting the recall of discharged jurors, going        all the way back to Loveday's case, the case that we           cite from the Exchequer from , those cases say that          the remedy in these circumstances is a new trial.                      JUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you about the          basis for the legal rule you're asking us to adopt? And            let's just assume, for the sake of argument, that there          isn't any Federal rule that sheds very much light         directly on this question.                So then your argument seems to come down to          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review two points: One is that there's nothing that gives          the ­­ the ­­ expressly, or maybe even by implication,          gives the trial judge the power to do this. But trial            judges do hundreds of things that are not expressly         authorized by rule. So what ­­ we ­­ we certainly           couldn't adopt that rule, a Federal judge ­­ a trial            judge can't do anything unless there's a rule that says           the judge can't ­­ can do it. Trials would come to an             end.             The other is based on the common law. But          there were all sorts of common law procedures, and         procedures that continued into the th century, that        have been abandoned in modern practice.                  So you want us to say if there was a ­­ an             established practice at common law, and into the ­­        maybe the late th century. Trial judges today in the           Federal courts today must follow that rule unless        there's something that gives them a dispensation.                    MR. SHANMUGAM: So Justice Alito, we're       certainly not here arguing that there has to be an          express grant of authority in the Federal Rules. And it           certainly is true that Federal courts have brought        authority to structure their proceedings as they see fit         while the case is pending. And I think if you            identified various specific procedures, you would find       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review that they would comfortably meet the standard for        inherent authority.              And so to take the government's seemingly       favored example, in limine rulings by district courts,        district courts obviously have the inherent authority,       and indeed the express authority to make evidentiary        rulings. And the question of the timing of those          rulings is simply incident to the exercise of that         authority.             Our point is simply that to the extent that         a court has that broader authority, it has never been          understood to confer the specific authority to recall        discharged jurors.              And to get back to the Federal Rules,        because I really don't think that this is a case where             the Federal Rules are silent on the issue ­­                    MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, before you do that,        what ­­ what rule should we adopt with respect to common           law practices, common law trial practices where not ­­        or th century trial practices? Courts have to follow          them unless there's something that says they don't?                    MR. SHANMUGAM: No, not at all. And the          perfect example of that is sequestration. Again,        certainly a ­­ a district court has the inherent           authority to sequester the jury, but a district court is           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review not bound to adhere to that practice simply because that          was the practice in .                 Our argument is simply that you have to look         under this Court's decisions on inherent authority to        the history. And in the absence of a long history, you             should not be recognizing an inherent authority, at        least absent some necessity. And that's really what         this case boils down to.                 Respondent and the government's argument at      the end of the day turns entirely on considerations of          efficiency. It turns on the argument that it's going to           be more efficient, in at least some of these cases, to           recall the jury rather than to conduct a new trial.                       JUSTICE ALITO: But it has to be absolutely         necessary. What should the ­­ what should the ­­ the           trial judge ­­ at one point jurors weren't allowed to          eat during deliberations ­­ so what did ­­ the first          trial judge who said it might be a good idea to allow             them to have lunch.                (Laughter.)             JUSTICE ALITO: What ­­ was that absolutely        necessary? What ­­ what would be the thought process          there?             MR. SHANMUGAM: A ­­ a district court surely           has the authority to permit the jury to eat. And           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review that ­­ and this just sort of goes back to the question            of, you know, what is the affirmative source of the          authority here?               And this Court has never, in its inherent       authority cases, as Respondent freely concedes at       page of his brief, said that efficiency alone is a           sufficient justification for the exercise of inherent       authority. And again, this is where the Federal ­­                     JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? Why not? Why          isn't it? I mean, it's very expensive to have new            trials. Hardly anyone can use a court. You've been            calling all these jurors back as witnesses costs money.         And you're arguing that rather than ­­ it's going ­­         okay, that's their efficiency argument. And ­­ and the          difference here turns on whether the jury is still in          the courtroom or whether they've gone into the hallway         and is asked, did anybody talk to you? No. Okay.                        Now, if it saves a lot of money, and that's           the only difference, why don't we say the efficiency         argument's what counts? It matters to people. It means           whether they can get their cases resolved or not.                     MR. SHANMUGAM: So Justice Breyer, in       analyzing questions of inherent authority, this Court       has never engaged in policy balancing, and it's focused         on the three considerations: It's focused on history,         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review the rules and on necessity, and the availability ­­                    JUSTICE BREYER: We never have. I'll look         it up. Why don't we begin?                   MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, if this Court wishes        to engage in policy balancing ­­                 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, we ­­ we don't need         the words ­­ saves people a lot of money, this           particular ­­                         MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, and I ­­       JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ exercise, and there       really isn't much reason in terms of fairness not to do           it.             MR. SHANMUGAM: And I'm not sure that that         is always going to be true. I think that Respondent and             the government in their briefs try to sort of set up           this dichotomy between technical defects in the verdict        on the one hand and burdensome new trials on the other.                       With regard to technical defects in the       verdict, truly technical defects, those can be       corrected, short of a new trial, under Rule (a). And            recall of the jurors is going to be burdensome in cases           such as this one where the jury is being asked, not           simply to correct a technical defect, but to deliberate          anew and to reach an entirely different verdict. And I           would respectfully submit that of all of the cases in          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Respondent and the government's briefs, they would be        hard­pressed to identify any case that actually fits        that pattern where a district court is being told ­­          where a district court is telling a jury to go back and              reach an entirely different verdict.                 With respect to the policy considerations, I       do think that there are policy considerations that        strongly support the bright­line rule that we are        advocating. As we point out in our brief, fairness and           finality considerations point strongly in our direction.                   And while it is certainly true the district        courts are able to engage in prejudice inquiries, we         think the risk of prejudice is particularly great in         this context. And at least the government seems to          recognize as much when the government attempts to cabin         its rule under the guise of the abuse­of­discretion        standard in various respects. And I'll come back to the           defects with that proposed rule in a minute.                     But the only other thing that I would say          with regard to the policy balancing is that I think that            there's a very strong workability argument in support of          our position.              If you accept what I understand to be         Respondent's position; in other words, to confer on        district courts essentially an unbounded power to recall        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review discharged jurors subject only to the constraints of the         outer bounds of due process, courts and litigants are         going to have very strong incentive to pursue this         option to correct all sorts of errors.                   And I think this case actually illustrates        the problem. There's a lot of back and forth in the             briefs about who should have raised this issue before         the district court before discharge. Well, in a case           like this one, my co­counsel, Mr. Angle, would have had          no incentive to raise this issue before discharge for         the simple reason that the jury was last seen returning          a verdict that, not only did not award the minimum          amount, it awarded nothing at all to our shared client.                      By contrast, in cases such as this one,        parties like Respondent, upon recognizing that there is        an obvious error with the verdict, are going to have          every incentive to pursue recalling the jury as an         alternative to a new trial, because after all, for the           same reasons that my co­counsel probably didn't like        this jury very much, Mr. Katyal's co­counsel presumably        thought this jury was the best jury on earth. And so in             every case ­­              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The policy      arguments, I think, ring a little hollow. This is just             not going to come up very often, right? So the idea            Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review that this is going to cause all sorts of problems, only           in the rarest, rarest case.                             MR. SHANMUGAM: But I think ­­       CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And yet, when it        does come up, we have this concern that Justice Breyer          pointed out, that it's a big waste of money to have the             jury have to start ­­ I guess a new jury, right ­­ have               to be a new jury ­­ start all over again.                       MR. SHANMUGAM: But I think, Mr. Chief         Justice, that that counts in our favor. I think we            would freely acknowledge that this issue doesn't come up         all that often, though it does seem to come up with some            frequency in the State courts. And there are a number            of cases cited in ­­ in the briefs going back all the            way to the early days of the Republic. But I think what              I would say is that to the extent that the Court thinks            this isn't a problem that comes up very often, it           indicates to us that it is simply not worth the candle           to adopt either Respondent's approach, which would       really create a motion to recall the jury, as an           alternative to the remedy that's actually provided in        the rules, a motion for a new trial, or the government's             approach, this sort of presumptive, one­hour limit.                   We simply don't think that there is any need         for this Court to move the line from the point of           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review discharge to the point of discharge plus one hour and          what other ­­ whatever other limitations the government        wants to impose under the abuse of discretion standard,         particularly because a court will have the ability to          correct obvious defects before discharge.                 And if this Court adopts our rule, it will,         if anything, create incentives for courts and litigants        going forward to pause for a moment at the point at            which the jury's verdict is returned and published        before discharge to determine whether there is an        obvious error that can be corrected, consistent with the         Court's power to do so prior to discharge.                    And we freely acknowledge that if a court         wants to, for instance, take a short recess at that           point, it can do so.                 And to the extent that the specter is given         of elaborate new trials in complex cases where the         trials have been particularly lengthy, I would        respectfully submit that it is precisely in those cases         where courts and litigants ought to have the incentive         to do that.               And the last thing I would say before         reserving the balance of my time for rebuttal, to get          back to Justice Alito's question, is that with regard to          the Federal Rules, we're not just pointing to the         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review specific rules like Rule and Rule , the rules on           polling and the rules on instructing juries. We're         pointing as well to Rule (a)(), which is the rule          that says that in nonjury trials, a court has the           authority upon receiving a motion for a new trial to            conduct further proceedings to take evidence to reach a         different judgment, but conspicuously does not confer       any such power in jury trials. And that, to us, while            not an express prohibition on the recall of discharged         jurors, is the next best thing.                    I would respectfully reserve the balance of      my time.              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   Mr. Katyal.               ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                 MR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,        and may it please the Court:                  As the Chief Justice and Justice Breyer have        indicated, under Petitioner's rule, a trial lasting a         week, a month, a year would have to be entirely done             just because one juror took one step outside one         courtroom one minute after a verdict. Now, Petitioner          says that new trial is required, not because of anything          in the Constitution or, Justice Sotomayor, actual       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review prejudice, but because of inferences that he draws from         the Federal rules.               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Katyal, my problem       is I have problems with his rules; I have problems with             yours.             (Laughter.)             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you've got to ­­       and ­­ and I think it's some of what the government is             saying.             Putting aside the questioning here, which      troubles me in its adequacy, okay, it's not uncommon ­­         it was perhaps uncommon in this case for families to be           crying outside of courtrooms, for families to be talking         to each other and visibly expressing either their        pleasure or displeasure at what a jury did. Not           uncommon for court correction officers in the State of         New York to get very close to juries ­­ when they used            to sequester them, but even today ­­ and a corrections           officer saying something like, good job, guys, at the         end of the verdict, okay, when the jury's discharged.                     There is expressions in the courtroom. If        we do a prejudice test, how are we going to ensure that             that concept of a fair trial is wholesome enough to not            permit what I consider some ­­ could be potentially          great contamination of the jury and of their emotional         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review state?               I mean, there are juries all of the time who         have the   night to think about a case who change their          mind.             MR. BASH: So ­­                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And the next day,       they're reaching out to the court or they're reaching         out to one of the party's attorneys and wanting to undo           the verdict.              But what's the rule that takes care of all         of those things? Is ­­ is it the boundless ability to            recall juries? What are the circumstances a court          should look at? What's your rule? Give me a rule             that ­­             MR. KATYAL: Justice Sotomayor, I'll give       you a rule, and then, hopefully, I can explain why I             think his rule is really problematic.                  So our rule is very simple and deals with         all of those things, which is that power after discharge          is parallel to the power before discharge. So all the           things ­­             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know, but you're        making that up.               MR. KATYAL: No, no, no.                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And it doesn't take care        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review of the things I talked about.                   MR. KATYAL: Well, it does. I think it           does. Because as this case comes to the Court ­­ and            their reply brief at page admits this ­­ the jury           could have been resubmitted with this and had all of the           things, the juror crying, the folks crying outside. All          of those things could have happened if the judge just          used a different word, "recessed" instead of        "discharged."             says ­­             We are not here defending some rule that        JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it depends on the        courthouse. In most courthouses, certainly the Federal        system and a lot of State systems, the jury doesn't get            to go out and mix with the public.                    MR. KATYAL: Quite ­­ quite right,       Your Honor. But all I'm saying is whatever the rules           are for predischarge, those rules are just parallel        after discharge so long as you have, like here, a          discharge of a couple of minutes where there is no           prejudice to the other side. And I think courts are            well­versed in ­­ in kind of evaluating those prejudice         inquiries. They do it all of the time. Governments           would have ­­              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think ­­      Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would your rules ­­      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ but you're not ­­      JUSTICE KENNEDY: ­­ apply equally in a                                            criminal case?              MR. KATYAL: We think that ­­ that you don't          have to get into it, but we do think that they generally            do here. And that underscore ­­                  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about impaneling the       jury? Suppose the judge impanels the jury and then          decides that the impanelment was defective ­­ one juror         wasn't there ­­ and three hours later, reimpanels the         jury. Is that proper?                 MR. KATYAL: Well, I think in that         circumstance, again, it's ­­ you know, the discharge has         nothing to do with it. It's either proper ­­                     JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm talking about      impanelment.             MR. KATYAL: Right. And so I don't think           that, you know, we have a position on impanelment. Our            position is just simply ­­                JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you said it applies        in criminal and civil cases. And you say that what ­­           in your brief, you say whatever the judge can do, he can            undo.             MR. KATYAL: Correct.    Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             JUSTICE KENNEDY: Which is a sweeping        statement when we talk about ­­ but in double jeopardy          rules, double jeopardy applies the moment there's an        impanelment.             MR. KATYAL: Absolutely. They should have        said that, Justice Kennedy ­­                JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I'm not ­­ and I'm not          sure how your rule would accommodate that principle.                    MR. KATYAL: So we have a very limited undue           principle. It is not anything ­­ that anything goes,          but rather it's tempered by the Constitution and by this          Court's inherent power cases which say it's got to be a           reasonable exercise.              So for the answer to that is it's a double           jeopardy violation; it's a double jeopardy violation and         the discharge has nothing to do with it.                    Now, if I could go back and explain why I           think their rule is really problematic.                  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but your ­­ your        principle is whatever ­­ you say whatever the judge can          do, he can undo. What ­­ what a court can do, it has an                inherent power to undo.                MR. KATYAL: That's ­­ but we do make very          clear that's tempered by the inherent power limitations        of this Court, which are very extreme. And so I don't             Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review think that we're here saying that you can undo anything.          We're saying it's got to meet the Degen and Chambers          test. The Chambers test is at page and of the             opinion, which says that it's got to be actual         legitimate response.              And ­­ and I think Mr. Shanmugam is         absolutely wrong when he says, oh, if there's an         alternative, that means there is no inherent power.        Chambers on those two pages is absolutely crystal clear:         The existence of an alternative doesn't deprive inherent        power.             Now, our concern about their rule, and,       again, going back to the first questions the Chief         asked, it's not even clear what their rule is, because          for most of this case, before the entire Ninth Circuit          on the blue brief, the rule was the magic words rule,           which was discharge ends things. Now ­­ the word          discharge ends things. Now the rule happens to be a           geographic limitation.              By the way, his reply brief at page has          yet an entirely different rule, which is the Burlingame         rule, which is, you can, even after discharge, even the          next day, have the jury come back and reorder ­­ and           impose an additional verdict.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I'm not ­­ I'm         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review not sure you're the one that should be complaining about          a rule that's not very clear. I mean, yours is            basically look at all the circumstances, have the judge         ask the questions, and particularly ­­ it's a variant on           what I asked earlier ­­ particularly if this doesn't          come up very often. It seems to me to be ­­ make some              sense to say it's a bright­line rule. We don't want to             waste courts' time, you know, figuring out whether        there's adequate prejudice, how far is too far.                    Let's just have a clear rule. If the judge           says discharged, you're discharged. And if he's made         some mistake, you know, he'll be more careful in the          future.             MR. KATYAL: Mr. Chief Justice, our rule is         consistent with the way Federal courts deal with jury         issues, the rules in the inherent power cases generally,         which is to leave this and the hundreds of decisions to           district courts to handle in the first instance. And I           think it would be a terrible idea to adapt a bright­line             rule for a ­­ this is a solution in search of a problem.                It doesn't come up very much.                  It's never come up ­­ all his worries ­­ in          the Federal system, even once. He can cite to you two            cases in his reply brief saying there is any problem.          One is a California case that he cites and he tells you             Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review that there's been a discharge of five months and a           recall. He doesn't tell you that that case was reversed           by the California Supreme Court for exactly the concerns         we're talking about, which is it might be dangerous and          prejudicial.             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Suppose we tell ­­ I        mean, look at the totality of the circumstances is a          great test, but it doesn't give much guidance to courts          below. Tell me what the guidance is that we give. I'm             thinking of something like, if they've been exposed to         any extraneous reactions, words, information,     conversation ­­ I can go on with a list of verbs ­­ but               you can't recall it? Are there any limits to this           power?             MR. KATYAL: There ­­ there are strong        limits. And those limits are found, for example, in the           Ninth Circuit's decision below, which says that it's got         to be a short recall. There's got to be an inquiry into              whether or not there's contamination. And if there is          any contamination, absolutely.               JUSTICE GINSBURG: How short is short?                   MR. KATYAL: Well, I think, again, that         should be left to the district court's decision ­­        discretion for the following reason. Cases vary in all          sorts of ways ­­ ways.     Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             Sometimes the trial lasts a year, a year and           a half, Justice Sotomayor. In Russo, I think your trial            was one­and­a­half months, and you wouldn't want to        necessarily throw something out for quite the same        length of time. And in some cases, the jury is just            asked a very simple question that they have to answer,           and so it might be something that could be more than a            couple of minutes. So I think ­­                    JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what about      geographic ­­ you wouldn't draw a line at, say, the           courthouse door? Once they leave the courthouse, that's         it. While they're in the court, it's okay.                     MR. KATYAL: I think the Federal case law,          and this is clear, actual prejudice is the inquiry. And           if you adopt his test, what is that door? Do you have             to have an NFL referee to adjudicate whether or not          someone is outside the threshold of the door or inside?          I just think that gets very unworkable. I think there            is no reason to do that.                  JUSTICE GINSBURG: They have to ­­ to        question each juror. Now, when you went out on the           street, did you talk to anybody?                  MR. KATYAL: I think ­­ I think that would            be preferable, but I do think an en masse, you know,            questioning, depending on the circumstances of the case,        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review may be appropriate, or something like this in which it's          just a couple of minutes and there's no allegation          whatsoever of any actual prejudice that anyone talked to         anyone besides the clerk of the court. You know, I           think that that's perfectly appropriate. But in a         different case, absolutely probably different.                 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Katyal, I wonder whether         there's one difference between the postdischarge case       and the predischarge case. You've been talking a lot           about contamination and outside influence. In there it         seems as though the inquiry is roughly the same, but          there's no way in which the postdischarge case seems         different, which is that once you are discharged, you         just take off your juror hat psychologically, mentally,        and you start thinking about a case in a different way,             and you start even wondering whether, when you had your          juror hat on, you were thinking about it in the right           way. And I wonder whether that is a difference that             makes a difference in this context.                   MR. KATYAL: I can certainly see a Federal           court, particularly if the length of discharge is        lengthy, getting into that and saying, that's why we're         not going to have a recall. But, you know, there ­­ no              Federal court ever has adopted the version of ­­ has          adopted that argument or Mr. Shanmugam's argument and        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review said, the courts lack authority for that reason.                    Now, maybe the Rules Committee at some point        wants to get into that and say, we're really concerned          about people taking their hat off and this psychological         difference. But that is not something either in the          rules, and it's certainly not something in this Court's         inherent power ­­              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's certainly not going       to help courts if we adopt a Federal rule. I'm looking             for a principle that would apply for where this problem           occurs the most often, which is State court. So tell me            how we rule in a way that, because this is what I             mentioned before, how many jurors change their mind?                    MR. KATYAL: Right. Well, with respect to         State court, at least as I understood the new position           now, nothing this Court will do will ­­ will solve that           particular problem. So because this is ­­ is ­­ it's           coming up, as he characterizes it, an Article III issue.                        I think State courts overwhelmingly have     solved this problem. different States permit        recalls. Only do not. And, yes, it's true in the             old common law we had a different ­­ a difference in             variable times. But starting in , courts have         permitted recall, and the Federal system has permitted        recall. Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess in answer to my          question, I was not looking so much for a historical            answer. You both have your historical arguments. But          for an answer about why we should take this very          seriously and think that it makes the postdischarge        context different from the precharge ­­ predischarge       context where the ­­ the inquiry that we do in the           predischarge context about have you talked to anybody,        have you read a newspaper, just really doesn't get to           the heart of the matter in the postdischarge context,         which is that you've just taken off your juror clothes          and maybe started thinking about what you did when they          were on in an entirely different way.                   MR. KATYAL: Justice Kagan, I do think that          you should take it seriously. I think district courts           do that all the time, which is why recalls don't happen,           except in circumstances like this, and why he can't         point to any abuse. I'd caution the Court because of           this ­­ if the Court is animated about the psychological          concern about adopting some one­size­fits­all solution      for the entire country and undoing trials that sometimes         are lengthy, sometimes impose huge psychological costs       to those who testify before them.                  For example, the first time I was before you          this year in Kansas v. Carr, the Court was concerned          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review about the Wichita murders and the witnesses having to         retestify, but that's his rule. He's going to force          redo in all of these cases. That is ­­ you know, that             is certainly not the efficient result, and we're        certainly not saying efficient is the only thing, as our          brief makes clear on the pages. It says that ­­                      JUSTICE GINSBURG: When the jurors come       back, do they get ­­ do they get resworn? I mean, the              judge just said, thank you very much for your service.          You are now discharged. You are no longer jurors.                      Then he recalls them. Do they get sworn in          again as jurors?               MR. KATYAL: I think that would be the          preferable thing to do. But what, again, in response to           Justice Kennedy, what was happening in a case like this,           they're undoing the earlier pronouncement of discharge.       We're turning it to the status quo ante. And then you            have that swearing again. You have the ­­ effectively          that first swearing working out. And here, as this case           comes to the Court, there is no allegation whatsoever         that there was any prejudice to Mr. Dietz from the          recall.             JUSTICE KENNEDY: Again, you would apply the        same rule in a criminal case ­­                   MR. KATYAL: Again, I think the Court         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review shouldn't get into it. But, in general, inherent power          decisions are treated the same way. But, you know, that           could be ­­              JUSTICE KENNEDY: A defendant who thinks        he's been acquitted, five minutes later, an hour later         can find out that he's guilty?                  MR. KATYAL: Well, as the government in this         last footnote points out, that does happen in the double          jeopardy context with respect to mistaken      pronouncements. And this Court already said that's not         a problem. Now if, Justice Kennedy ­­                   JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the jurors haven't       been discharged in those cases.                 MR. KATYAL: In those cases, yes, that's        right. So Justice Kennedy, if you're concerned about         that, I suspect that could be something that is          determination ­­ the district court's determination as       to what is and is not a reasonable response to the            problem at hand. And there is no example whatsoever of           anything like this hypothetical happening, and that's       why, as the Court writes its opinion, we think you          should bracket those types of concerns. See if they          ever arise. They should first, I think, be dealt with            by the Rules Committee, but not in a one­size­fits­all          solution by this Court.    Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The rules ­­ the        Rules Committee is, I would say, unlikely to address          this for the simple reason that it doesn't come up very           often. I gather no Federal cases at all. So the             Federal Rules Committee probably has bigger fish to fry.                                             How ­­ how long was the trial in this case?          MR. KATYAL: The trial was two days.        And, Mr. Chief Justice, the Rules Committee       does handle a lot of issues that do, you know, involve            small issues. But here, of course, there have been six           different Federal circuit courts that have ruled on this         issue, which is what the cert. petition focused on. So           I don't think that this is something that, you know,          wouldn't attract the attention of the Rules Committee.        And my friend's idea, which is somehow the Rules         Committee has already resolved this issue, I think, is          intentioned with that very ­­ very notion.                               If there are no further questions.      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   Mr. Bash.                ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. BASH                 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,                      SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT               MR. BASH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:   Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             I'd like to begin by stating very simply        what we think the rule is, and in doing so, hopefully           clarify something about this case that I think generates          a little bit of confusion.                 The rule we would apply is that if this is a           situation where before the discharge the judge could        have sent it back to the jury with a clarifying           instruction, then the mere formal pronouncement of       discharge does not bar the judge from doing that in a           situation where no actual prejudice would result.                   The reason I said I think that relates to an            area of confusion in this case is that in his argument           up here, Petitioner's counsel has characterized this as        a weight of the evidence problem. But that's not how           Petitioner or the judge understood the problem below.        They understood the problem as a legally impermissible         verdict that demonstrated that the jurors were confused        about the instructions, and Petitioner has not       contested, as this case comes to the court, that the          judge could have sent it back to the jury before          discharge. I'm not sure that's true if the judge says,           well, I think it's against the weight of the evidence.           That would utterly be coercing a verdict.                    So as the case comes to the court, it is          conceded that the judge could have sent it back before          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review discharge. The only question, as I understand it,          before this Court is whether the formal pronouncement of         discharge irrevocably barred the court from rescinding       the discharge and resubmitting the case.                  And for reasons we've set out in the brief,         we think the prejudice standard comports with how this         Court always thinks about jury impartiality issues.                   In far more extreme circumstances, take the       foundational Remmer decision. That was a criminal case          in which a juror ­­ there was an attempted bribe to a             juror and then the FBI investigation of that juror for          the attempted bribe. So the juror had a huge incentive            to quit at that point because he had been bribed by the            defendant to ­­ excuse me ­­ to convict, because he had           been bribed by the defendant to convict. The FBI knows           he's been bribed. And what the Court said in Remmer is            that it is an actual prejudicial determination after        hearing, and it's within the discretion of the district         court, subject to abuse­of­discretion review, how to       remedy even that kind of problem. And that's a very            significant problem.              And it's the same thing when, for example, a         judge forgets midtrial to admonish the jurors to avoid         outside influence, which is parallel to a situation here          with one caveat, which relates to Justice Kagan's        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review question earlier, in that jurors are exposed to outside         influence without an instruction. And even in that         case, courts have been uniform in saying ­­ courts have          been almost uniform ­­ I think there's an Eighth Circuit           that went the other way ­­ in saying that you conduct a            prejudice inquiry.              Now, Justice Kagan's question was is there       something different postdischarge. And I think it may          be reasonable to think that at some point,        postdischarge, it's kind of like getting out of the bar          exam. Or you studied all the stuff, you remember it,           but now the commercial paper information is, you know,         receding from your brain in a way that it wouldn't           before the bar exam.                (Laughter.)             MR. BASH: But I ­­ I don't think that's ­­            and I think a district court could properly take that            into consideration, but I don't think that's true a few            minutes after the discharge.                It's one thing to say when you get home and          you go back to your spouse or your friends and you say,            this is what we did, and they say, wow, I can't believe             you did that. That ­­ that's going to cause you to            start to reconsider your verdict as a citizen, not what           the juror had on. But here it was a few minutes.             Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Everybody concedes it was a few minutes.                    At the time, Petitioner's counsel ­­ I think         this is on (a) of the Ped AP ­­ said we ­­ I don't               think the jurors talked to anybody about the case. They           were talking to the clerk about other stuff, about         reimbursement. Didn't talk to anybody about the case.         It was a few minutes.                  And given that where a juror is attempted         bribed, or jurors sleep through trial, or jurors are         actually exposed to extraneous information where jurors       speak to counsel, we always conduct a prejudice inquiry.          It would be entirely anomalous to say in this one          circumstance there's a three­minute break, you can't        bring the ­­ the jurors back and resubmit it.                     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why can't we recall a         jury six months later? Just this case.                                MR. BASH: Well, I think that the ­­         JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I mean, they didn't talk         about it afterwards. It's not an earth shattering case.          Why can't we call them back the next day, the day after,            just ask them did you talk to anybody? They say no.            Then you go back and resubmit the case now.                     MR. BASH: Well, Petitioner had ­­ we don't         think that would be possible.                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why? Give me the        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review limiting prejudice.              standard.             MR. BASH: Because of the prejudice       JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What prejudice? You       haven't shown any prejudice. They didn't with anybody         about the case. They didn't ­­                  MR. BASH: I think it would be reasonable          for ­­ so I guess we're in the situation where six            months later some party says we'd like to call ­­                     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm talking about one to        infinity, because if ­­ presumably I'm interested in        some limits to this.                MR. BASH: And we think it would be         reasonable for a district court to say, and even for           this Court to say, as a matter of giving guidance to            lower courts, that once jurors have returned to their         daily lives, they've probably spoken to friends and        family about the case. They've taken off their jury          hats for more than a de minimis period. It's so likely             that there's going to be prejudice that we're just not          going to allow that anymore.                 I'd also say there's a more formal        limitation, which this Court has said in cases like         Casey and Quackenbush, that once final judgment is        entered, a court can't rescind interlocutory orders.        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review               I think there would be a question about when         that occurs in this case. We don't think it would ever            get that far under the prejudice standard, but it might          just be when the Rule judgment is entered, which in           this case happened the same day as the second verdict.          In a case I did last year, it happened five days later.              It often happens very soon. Or you might say that once            the notice of appeal is filed, or once the time is           expired for filing post verdict motions, that's when the         final judgment occurs. So there'd be that more formal          bound on the time limit, but I think in practice there            would be an actual prejudice limit that would bound it          very tightly.                I just want to emphasis, this case has come        up ­­ this issue has come up for the United States.           It's come up in, actually, a surprising number of lower           court cases. And if you look at the cases cited in both             parties' briefs, they're almost invariably very short       periods.               I mean, this is a judge wanting a do over           after a few minutes where he made a mistake. This is              not people calling things back months later. There was          the five­month case that Petitioner cites, but as Mr.         Katyal noted, that was reversed as gross error by the          California Supreme Court. We don't think our standard         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review would allow that. But where there's a minutes­long          error, judges ought to have the opportunity to fix that          if they can.                  I know Mr. Shanmugam said that it hasn't      been the case in any of the cases cited in the briefs            that juries retired for future deliberations, but       actually one of the circuit split cases that the United          States was involved with, the Third Circuit case        Figueroa, the judge discharged the jurors and then        realized there was a bifurcated felony possession count         to try. And it was only a few minutes, and the judge              brought them back, and they were reinstructed. There         was evidence presented on that count, and ­­ and then          they deliberated further.               So it does happen. It's ­­ it's rare,         hopefully, because it's a mistake. But it's not so rare            that I think it ­­ it warrants a bright­line rule that             would impose really serious costs on ­­ on parties and          litigants.             If there are no further questions.                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   Four minutes, Mr. Shanmugam.            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Justice.             The rule that we are proposing to the Court         is a simple one. It is that, consistent with the common             law and the Federal rules, a district court lacks the           authority to recall discharged jurors for further       service in the same case, with "discharge" being defined         as the point at which a jury released from service           leaves the judge's presence and control.                  In writing an opinion in that direction, we        would respectfully submit that the Court should       reiterate the district courts have multiple available       remedies to cure the perceived problem here.                   Again, we do freely concede, as Mr. Katyal        points out, that a district court has the authority to           reinstruct the jury and to order the jury to engage in           further deliberations prior to discharge, and that will        take care of many of the cases in the category of           obvious errors.              After discharge, it is true that a court has          the authority to recall jurors, but not for the purpose          of reconstituting them as a jury. Instead, simply for           the purpose of correcting clerical errors and other        oversights in the judgment. And where the errors are          more substantial, however ­­               JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about ­­ what about        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review clerical errors? I understand that's what the rule you           pointed to deals with, clerical errors. But you said          "and others," so what's the others?                  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think that the         others are these cases like the ones I referred to in my             opening argument where, you know, a jury returns two          verdict forms and the question is which verdict form is          the correct one.               In other words, courts have the authority to        deal with situations where what you're trying to do is          to intuit the jury's intent at the time of the original           verdict; to take evidence on historical facts concerning        what the jury actually did. And the relevant Federal          Rule of Evidence, Federal Rule of Evidence (b), makes         clear that that is an exception to the ordinary         applicable rule that evidence from jury deliberations is        inadmissible.             And of course, finally, the last available       remedy is to order a new trial. And again, however you             characterize the error at issue here, whether you        characterize it as a verdict that's contrary to the          weight of the evidence or an instructional error, a new           trial has always been the default remedy in those         circumstances.               I think that the problem with Respondent and       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review the government's rule was well pointed out in Mr. Bash's          argument. To the extent that the driving concern here          is prejudice, the government's limitations ­­ proposed       limitations really don't make a lot of sense, and          neither does Respondent's suggestion made for the first        time at oral argument today that there is a limitation           on the time period in which juries can be recalled.                        And that is for the simple reason that you       can have a jury that's been out for a long period of              time where you don't have prejudice, and conversely you         can have prejudice almost instantly, particularly in the        world of smart phone communications. And the rule that          this Court articulates here is going to apply in civil          and criminal cases alike.                And Justice Ginsburg, the final judgment      limitation really provides little solace in the criminal        context because when a jury returns a verdict, final           judgment is typically not entered until after       sentencing, which again typically takes place sometime       later.             And at bottom ­­ or the question in this         case is really whether extending a court's power beyond          the point of discharge is worth the candle. And again,           in light of all the available alternatives in this         situation, we would respectfully submit that it is not,         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review and the judgment of the Ninth Circuit should therefore         be reversed.              Thank you.                                      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       The case is submitted.    (Whereupon, at : p.m., the      case in the   above­entitled matter was submitted.)    Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review
