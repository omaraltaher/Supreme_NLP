CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-1684, Michael Yarborough v. Michael


Alvarado.


Ms. Chuang.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEBORAH J. CHUANG


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. CHUANG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


For nearly 4 decades, the ultimate inquiry as to


whether a person is in custody is whether there is formal


arrest or restraint in freedom of movement to the degree


associated with formal arrest.


The Ninth Circuit acknowledged that the State


court had identified the correct legal standard for


determining custody, that no Supreme Court case had


addressed whether age and experience needed to be


considered for that determination, and that it was


borrowing legal principles from another area of


jurisprudence.  Yet, it held that it was objectively


unreasonable for the State court to have abstained from


innovating such a new role.


This case illustrates why Federal habeas relief


cannot be granted under 28 U.S.C., section 2254(d), when a

State court decision does not extend Supreme Court


precedent to a new context.  Such relief is incompatible


with the provisions of section 2254(d) for three reasons.


First, to require a State court to extrapolate


Supreme Court precedents from the voluntariness context to


the custody context cannot be fairly characterized as


applying this Court's custody precedents.


QUESTION:  Ms. Chuang, there are two questions


presented in the petition for certiorari.  One is what I


took it to be -- is the rule that the Ninth Circuit


announced correct under our precedents, and the second,


under AEDPA, was it objectively unreasonable for the State


court to rule otherwise.  Are you going to address both


those questions? 


MS. CHUANG:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Thank you. 


MS. CHUANG:  The Ninth Circuit fundamentally


changed the rule for resolving custody claims by juveniles


and, second, Federal law as determined by the Supreme


Court refers -- is limited to the Supreme Court's


holdings.  The Ninth Circuit substituted its holding for


that of this Court when it recognized that this Court had


never held so in the custody context.


And third, to say that an extension of Supreme


Court precedent to a new context is clearly established

law would define clearly established at such a high --


QUESTION:  But how is it a new context?  I mean,


the -- the rule was how a reasonable man in the suspect's


position would have understood his situation.  So is it


new to say you -- I mean, it might be new if in fact there


was blind person and the agent who was holding him wrote


on a note, you are free to leave.  You know, he can't read


it.  Now, would you need a new, special Supreme Court case


to say that's ridiculous?


MS. CHUANG:  No, Your Honor.  You -- you would


not.  What --


QUESTION:  Then why do you need a new, special


Supreme Court to say a very young person might feel very


differently about whether he's in custody from a person 

who's a -- not -- not a child and not a minor?


MS. CHUANG:  Well, because this Court's


precedence as for custody determination has only


considered the circumstances encountered by the person --


QUESTION:  Well, we haven't considered blind


people either.  We haven't considered deaf people whom


someone might whisper, you're free to go.  I mean, the


point is it's so obvious that -- that being a child or a


juvenile would make a difference, that you don't have to


write it in all the cases.  So my question is, why isn't


that obvious?

 MS. CHUANG:  I believe that the answer is that


the ultimate inquiry for custody determinations is whether


there is a formal arrest or restraint in freedom of


movement. 


QUESTION:  How old was the respondent in this


case?  17-and-a-half, wasn't he?


MS. CHUANG:  Yes, Your Honor.  He was 17-and-a-


half years old during the interview.


QUESTION:  And I suppose, in the view of the


Ninth Circuit, he would have had to be treated quite


differently if he were 6 months older, if he were 18.


MS. CHUANG:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  I thought --


QUESTION:  What -- what if he were 6?  Would --


would you acknowledge that -- that that factor should be


taken into account? 


MS. CHUANG:  No, Your Honor, I don't believe


that a 6-year-old -- that age and experience should be


considered because the test -- the ultimate inquiry is


whether there is a formal arrest or restraint in freedom


of movement.


QUESTION:  No, but that depends upon what a


reasonable person in the circumstances would understand to


be his situation whether a reasonable person would believe


he was being detained.  Isn't that the test?  So, I mean,

it doesn't -- it doesn't help to simply say that, you


know, the question is whether there's an arrest.  Yes,


there is.  That is the question.


But our standard for whether there has been an


arrest is what would a reasonable person believe.  Would


he believe he was arrested?  Which gets you right back


into the determination of what a person would believe.


Now, would we take into account the fact that


somebody is 6 years old?


MS. CHUANG:  We don't deny that a 6-year-old


would certainly be more vulnerable to overall coercion. 


Yet, that is -- overall coercion is addressed by the


voluntariness test and really the custody question is only


concerned with one aspect of coercion and that is custody. 

And to --


QUESTION:  Why -- why isn't it?  Look, I'm not


-- I guess let me try again because I can understand you'd


say there's only 6 months difference here.  So in this


case, being a juvenile didn't matter.  But that's not what


you're talking about.


You're talking about the standard that says the


nature of a person as a child or an adult is something


that can make a difference.  All right?  To custody.  You


agreed being blind could make a difference to custody. 


You agree being deaf could make a difference to custody.

Why can't being a child in principle make a difference to


custody?  That's the question.  And it has only to do with


whether the first part of your argument, not the second.


MS. CHUANG:  Well, Your Honor, I suppose that a


blind person, if you hand the blind person a note saying,


you are free to leave, would not -- you could not use that


note as an indication that he was free to leave.  You


couldn't use that as a circumstance to show that he was


free to leave.


QUESTION:  Well, isn't what you're objecting to


in the Ninth Circuit's decision the idea that there is


some sort of a bright line cutoff date when the person


turns 18?  You don't deny that a person 6 -- 6 years old


would be treated differently than a 17-year-old, I 

suppose, for determining the objective test. 


MS. CHUANG:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Is that -- I thought you said age is


irrelevant.


MS. CHUANG:  Yes.


QUESTION:  That age is -- you -- you said age is


irrelevant to the custody determination.


MS. CHUANG:  That's correct.  Age --


QUESTION:  Other things like language is --


language is relevant if the person doesn't -- is not


conversant with English.

 MS. CHUANG:  Language might not be relevant,


Your Honor, because -- or -- or it might relevant because


if the person did not understand English and the officer


said, you are free to leave, that is -- that is a


circumstance that the person encountered that is within


the officer's control that the -- and the person doesn't


understand English, that would be something that could not


be relied upon later on to show that he was -- he


understood that he was free to leave.  But then again,


that might not mean that he could use it to show that he


was in custody as well. 


QUESTION:  Let -- let me ask you about two facts


in -- in this particular case.  The first one is this. 


And correct me if I'm wrong. 
 I think I'm right on these. 

When the -- when the sheriff's department wanted


to question this -- this young man, they went to his


parents and the parents said, in effect, yes, we will --


we will bring him down or take him down with us, and they


took him to the station, so that as I understand it, the


sheriff's department didn't ask him to make a choice as to


whether they would go down to the headquarters and talk


with him.  The parents did that.


The second fact I want you to comment on is that


when they got down there, the parents said, in the boy's


hearing, can't we go in with him or can we go in with him?

They -- they made it clear that they would like to go into


this interrogation.  And the deputy sheriff said no, kept


them out.  The sheriff and the boy disappeared. 


Are those two facts relevant in making the


determination of whether he would reasonably understand


that he was being under -- held under conditions


equivalent to a formal arrest?


MS. CHUANG:  No, Your Honor, I don't believe


they are relevant.


QUESTION:  Why -- why not?  Why not?


MS. CHUANG:  Because once -- again, if his -- if


his parents were asked for permission to interview, the


detective had asked the parents for permission to


interview him, and his parents said yes, the meaning of 

that question was that he could have said no, and --


QUESTION:  Wait a minute.  You just lost me. 


How -- how is it that he could have said no?


MS. CHUANG:  He could have refused to have


submitted to the interview, and there's no indication in


the record --


QUESTION:  Well, but he -- but he -- he didn't. 


His parents said, yes, you can interview him.  We will


bring him down, and the boy came along.  That's all we


know.


MS. CHUANG:  That's correct, Your Honor.  That's

-- that's what we know.


QUESTION:  And why is that?  And that is


irrelevant you say because the boy might have said, well,


I won't go?


MS. CHUANG:  That -- yes, Your Honor.  It's --


QUESTION:  You don't know whether he would have


felt free to say that or not, do you?  Do we have anything


in the record on that?


MS. CHUANG:  There's no indication one way or


the other.  But there was no indication that he was not


voluntarily being interviewed.


QUESTION:  Well, there is an indication.  I -- I


mean, that's what I'm trying to get at.  The -- the


indication is that he was taken down to the station house


by his parents.  He didn't make the choice.  And when they


got down there, the parents, who wanted to be present


during the interrogation, were told that they couldn't.


The -- the -- it seems to me that the objective


appearance of -- of these two facts is, number one, the


boy appears to be under the control of his parents and his


parents appear to be under the control of the sheriff's


department when they get down to headquarters.  And on


those two facts, I would think it would be difficult --


standing alone, those two facts, it would be difficult to


infer that this boy would have felt that he was free to

turn around and -- and walk out of the interview and


leave.  And -- and I don't understand why those facts are


not relevant.


MS. CHUANG:  Well, Your Honor, I -- I -- there's


no indication, though, that he was at the station


involuntarily.  Certainly he came with his parents, but --


QUESTION:  Well, the indication is that his


parents brought him.  That's all we know.


MS. CHUANG:  Well, Your Honor, Mr. Alvarado --


it indicated in the record that Mr. Alvarado lived at home


with his parents and that he did not have a car.


QUESTION:  He's a minor, isn't he?


MS. CHUANG:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION: 


He has to go where his parents tell 

him to, doesn't he?  Isn't that what being in the status


of -- of a minor means, that if your parents tell you stay


at home, you're grounded, you're grounded?  Isn't that


essentially the disability of being a minor? 


So I guess maybe the proper inquiry is whether


his parents thought that they could let him leave if they


wanted to.  Either that's the proper inquiry or perhaps no


minor can be interrogated in -- in a police station


because it always requires the consent of the parents, and


when the parents tells him, you know, you go be


interrogated, he thinks he can't leave.  It's a terrible

problem, isn't it?


MS. CHUANG:  Well, Your Honor, I -- I believe


that custody by -- custody in the sense of a parental and


juvenile situation is not the same as custody as you are


under formal arrest or restrained in freedom of movement


to the same degree --


QUESTION:  Well, then that's the whole point. 


That's why I think Justice Souter asked that question,


saying, look, you're -- you're used to your parents


telling you what to do and maybe even sometimes you do it. 


All right? 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  So the parents bring them down --


bring him down.  He doesn't think he has any choice.  He


then asks Ms. Comstock, I guess, who was the arresting


officer that brought him in there, can I take my parents


in this room.  The parents say we want to go in the room. 


And the policewoman -- I think it was a woman, wasn't it? 


I think she said no.  And they, who desperately -- or


certainly want to get into the room, can't.  So he's


sitting there and that, together with all the other things


that are going on -- and there are quite a few -- would


lead a reasonable person, who's used to being under the --


the rule of his parents, to think, my goodness, this


police woman controls the situation.  Of course, I have to

do what she says, and of course, I can't leave until, as


she said, I've finished answering the question and she can


-- tells me I can leave.  I'm in custody.  Now, maybe an


adult wouldn't be thinking that.  Maybe he would.  But


that's a reasonable question.


But our standard here is, you know, not whether


they were right in the State but whether they were


reasonable.  But a juvenile certainly would be thinking


that.  That's -- that's I think what the point is. 


Now, I'd like to hear sort of a full-blown


response to that. 


MS. CHUANG:  Yes, Your Honor.  Well, first a --


QUESTION:  Just as full-blown as the question. 


QUESTION: 


I mean, not just yes or no. 

(Laughter.) 


MS. CHUANG:  Yes, Your Honor. 


A juvenile -- unless the Court is willing to say


that the parents in this case operated as agents of law


enforcement by bringing him into the sheriff's station and


that when the officer -- the detective had asked him if he


-- if the parents would give permission, that somehow that


really wasn't an option that the detective was giving, Mr.


Alvarado was not in custody.


QUESTION:  What I -- what I can't understand --


and this was Justice Souter's question.  Forget how these

factors play out one way or the other.  Are these factors


-- the circumstance that the parents brought the juvenile


to the station; two, that the parents wanted to go in or


asked someone -- asked to go in and they couldn't -- are


those objective factors that the Court can consider in the


custody determination?


MS. CHUANG:  No, Your Honor, because --


QUESTION:  So -- so if -- if the defense counsel


bring this up, the judge rules that it's to be excluded. 


It's irrelevant. 


MS. CHUANG:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  All right. 


MS. CHUANG:  Because as this Court alluded to in


Colorado v. Connolly what the Fifth Amendment is concerned 

with is government coercion, and to the extent that the


parents brought Mr. Alvarado to the station, that is not


government coercion. 


And as far as the parents not being allowed in


the interview room, there -- Mr. Alvarado actually did not


present any evidence that his parents were not permitted


into the interview room.  And indeed, the interview room


door was open, as indicated at joint appendix page 150.


QUESTION:  Well, would yo just correct me on the


facts?  I thought the -- the record indicated that the


parents had asked to go in, and as Justice Breyer pointed

out, that in fact the boy at one point said, you know, do


I have to go alone?  Isn't anybody coming with me?  Are --


are -- is there testimony to that effect in the record?


MS. CHUANG:  No, Your Honor.  There is no


testimony to that.  Indeed, it was only argued by his


attorney, but his attorney relied upon the transcript of


the interview.


QUESTION:  This was at the suppression hearing.


MS. CHUANG:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Okay.


MS. CHUANG:  And --


QUESTION:  Did -- did the State object to those


facts as being untrue and not in evidence? 


MS. CHUANG: 


Well, the State didn't -- no, Your 

Honor.  The State did not, but the -- the State was


relying on the fact that it was the interview transcript


that Mr. Alvarado's counsel was using, and indeed, at the


trial when Mr. Alvarado testified, he never stated that he


asked for his parents to be in there, and he had testified


that he didn't feel coerced or --


QUESTION:  May I --


QUESTION:  Where -- where did this fact come


from?  It's in the interview transcript?


MS. CHUANG:  I'm sorry?


QUESTION:  Where did this fact or factoid come

from that -- you know, that -- that his parents wanted to

from?


MS. CHUANG:  His -- it came from his attorney's


argument during the suppression hearing.


QUESTION:  It's not in any evidence. 


MS. CHUANG:  No, Your Honor.  It's not in any


evidence.  And to say that -- to require the State court


to extrapolate from this Court's voluntariness precedents


that predated Miranda to decide what types of individual


characteristics needed to be considered for a Miranda


custody, is not what section 2254(d) requires.  Section


2254(d) --


QUESTION: 


May -- may I ask this one question? 

I thought you conceded that if he were only 6 years old,


that would be relevant.  And the question presented is


whether age is ever relevant.  What -- what is your


position exactly?  Is it it's okay to consider it if he's


6 but not if he's 17-and-a-half?


MS. CHUANG:  No.  Actually, Your Honor, it --


yet -- we -- my position is that a 6-year-old age would


still be irrelevant.  It might be relevant for the


voluntariness as to overall coercion.


QUESTION:  But not as to whether he thinks he's


free to leave.

 MS. CHUANG:  That's correct.  The California


court of --


QUESTION:  Do you know any other category where


age is ever and always irrelevant, any other category in


the law?


MS. CHUANG:  Yes, Your Honor.  In the Fourth


Amendment seizure area, this Court has held that it's a


reasonable person, and indeed in Hodari D. v. California,


this Court used the -- the reasonable person standard


without considering age.  While this Court did mention age


in the Kaupp case, which was cited by Mr. Alvarado, it's


uncertain to what degree age actually was relevant for the


seizure question, whether a person felt free to leave.


A better reading of Kaupp is that it was -- the 

Court may have mentioned the Mr. -- the age of the


defendant in that case for the voluntariness of


accompanying the officers to the station, as this Court


indicated with a citation of Royer v. -- Royer and also


Schneckloth.  Both of those cases indicate that age does


go to the voluntariness of consenting to go with officers.


The California Court of Appeal in this case


identified the correct standard for making a custody


determination, and it engaged in a reasonable application


of existing custody precedent.  The Ninth Circuit


recognized no Supreme Court case has required age and

QUESTION:  Mr. Elwood, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. ELWOOD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The Ninth Circuit erred when it held that a


juvenile's age and experience must be considered in


determining whether or not he is in custody for purposes


of the Miranda test.


QUESTION: 


Do you agree that the fact that the 

parents brought the person to the station and that they


were -- requested to be in the room it -- are -- are not


relevant to the custody determination?


MR. ELWOOD:  I think that they can be considered


by the court in determining the -- the circumstances


surrounding the interrogation, just as in Oregon v.


Mathiason they considered the fact the -- the person came


to the station on his own power.


QUESTION:  So that they are relevant to the


objective inquiry whether or not a reasonable person


thought he was under custody in these circumstances.

 MR. ELWOOD:  I think that they are facts that


can be considered by a -- under the reasonable person


standard to determine whether a reasonable person would


have felt that he was not free to leave or rather that he


was under formal arrest at that point.


QUESTION:  So you disagree with the State on


that point.


MR. ELWOOD:  I -- I think it's a -- it's a


slightly different viewpoint because I -- I don't think


that's what the Ninth Circuit was getting at.  What the


Ninth Circuit was basically saying is that you don't


employ the reasonable person standard.  You, rather,


employ a reasonable juvenile standard, and you view all


the circumstances differently. 


I think, though, that you can consider the fact


that he -- particularly the alleged fact that he -- his


parents were excluded from the interview in determining


what a reasonable person would have felt from that. 


Unfortunately, because it was simply argued by his


attorney at the suppression hearing and there were no


findings on it, we don't know exactly how that happened. 


If --


QUESTION:  But it is true there was testimony on


it, is it not?


MR. ELWOOD:  I --

 QUESTION:  The -- the -- page 2 of the red brief

asked if they could come in and Detective Comstock refused


to do it.


MR. ELWOOD:  I -- I -- I don't -- unfortunately,


I -- I left my transcript at my seat, but it may be that


the defendant testified at the trial itself that that is


what occurred.


QUESTION:  J.A. 49 --


MR. ELWOOD:  In any event, we don't have any


findings from the State court about what exactly


transpired.  I think that if the --


QUESTION:  But your view is different from your


colleague.  She said there was nothing in the record.  You


say there are just no findings on it.


MR. ELWOOD:  That's correct, that there are no


findings on it and that we have the lawyer's assertion and


we may have -- I -- I don't recall -- the defendant's own


testimony at the -- the trial itself. 


But in any event, our point with respect to the


exclusion is you have to look at what -- how a reasonable


person would view that, not necessarily a reasonable


juvenile, but a reasonable person.  And if the --


QUESTION:  But do you think the child whose


parents were denied permission to come into the room would

draw any inference about whether he could leave at --


anytime he wanted to?


MR. ELWOOD:  Again, I think it depends on how it


was put because if they just say, no, you may not come in,


I think a reasonable person could conclude from that that


they're exercising control over the interrogation and that


they -- that might extend to whether or not he's free to


go.  However, if it -- the officer says something more


along the lines of, no, we'd rather you not because he'll


-- he'll be able to be more candid if there's no one else


in there with you, I think that that would express a very


different --


QUESTION:  Do you think it would make a


difference in that inquiry if the person being 

interrogated was 35 years old, on the one hand, and 10


years old on the other hand?


MR. ELWOOD:  I think that it doesn't make a


legal difference for Miranda purposes, and that's our


basic argument, is that Miranda doesn't -- didn't develop


a rule that provides protection tailored for the specific


circumstances of -- of the person who's under


interrogation.  Rather, it's a uniform rule that provides


the same level of protection for all people, regardless of


whether they're very experienced of inexperienced.  And I


think --

 QUESTION:  And you're telling me that the 35-

treated precisely the same.


MR. ELWOOD:  I think that they should be treated


the same for purposes of the Miranda prophylactic rule. 


They should not be treated differently for voluntariness.


QUESTION:  For the purposes of determining


whether he thinks he's in custody.


MR. ELWOOD:  Yes, that is correct.  And I think


that traditionally what the Court has done is it has


viewed the circumstances that you look to, the totality of


the circumstances, as being external to the reasonable


person.  I think that's the inference you get from


Thompson v. Keohane.


QUESTION:  A person of borderline competency who


doesn't speak the language is -- we don't consider that


a --


MR. ELWOOD:  You don't consider that for


purposes of the -- of the altering the reasonable person


view.  You don't say a reasonable person of borderline


competency.  You can, I think, consider it for different


purposes like in Justice Breyer's example of the blind


person.  One of the very important things to figure out


before you apply the reasonable person standard and our


basic objection to the Ninth Circuit's rule is it altered

the reasonable person standard and said it's a reasonable


juvenile standard when you're determining --


QUESTION:  All right.  So your point is instead


of having a standard of a reasonable blind person, you


have a standard of a reasonable person and one -- in the


circumstances and one of the circumstances is that he's


blind.


MR. ELWOOD:  But one of the reasonable under the


circumstances --


QUESTION:  Is that the point?


MR. ELWOOD:  It's not quite right, but it's


getting there.


QUESTION:  No.  And -- and then you say it so


it's right.


MR. ELWOOD:  The point is that one -- one of the


important factors to determine when you're figuring out


what the totality of the circumstances is that you apply


the reasonable person test to is what police officers told


the person about his freedom to leave.  And if you --


QUESTION:  I understand all that.  I'm trying to


get what your objection is to the standard.  I'm not


talking about this case now.  And is the right way to say


it that we don't apply a reasonable blind person test, we


apply a reasonable person test in the circumstances, and


one of the circumstances is that he's blind.  Now, you

said, no, that isn't the right way.  Then what is the


right way?


MR. ELWOOD:  I -- I think that you can consider


-- I think we might be saying basically the same thing but


just slightly different --


QUESTION:  I want you to say it --


MR. ELWOOD:  I'm trying to get --


QUESTION:  -- so that I understand what your


statement is. 


MR. ELWOOD:  Is that the -- is the -- is that


the person -- you can consider what the police officer


communicated to them, and when you're figuring out what


the police officer communicated to them, the police


officer doesn't get to, you know, pretend that a blind 

person can see.  They have to take into consideration that


when you hand them a written notice, they're not going to


see it, just as though -- just as if you whispered it to


them in a voice too low for them to hear.  The basic point


is that you didn't communicate anything to them. 


And our objection to the Ninth Circuit's


standard is they're trying to make you view the entire


world through the viewpoint of a reasonable juvenile,


which means that we're not talking about whether or not


the person was unable to leave the room when they wanted


to because they couldn't reach the doorknob because they

were short.  The point is that we're trying to infer


something about the way they view the entire world because


they're a juvenile.  Because they're a juvenile, they're


more likely to be submissive to authority.  Because


they're a juvenile, they're more likely to feel that --


that anything that the police officer says is a command.


And I think that it's very different to adopt a


whole different world view thing versus simply asking


police officers to take notice of things that are


objectively very plain or rather observable and very


plain, such as a blind person cannot see the warning that


you give him.  And I think that that is the basic


difference between what is permissible under the


reasonable person test, as it has always been applied, and 

the Ninth Circuit's innovation of it.


Now --


QUESTION:  On -- on your view of this case, is


it -- suppose we say, all right, reasonable person doesn't


mean 16.  Could -- would a remand be appropriate to view


the totality of the circumstances and see if they add up


to in custody using the reasonable person standard?


MR. ELWOOD:  Justice Ginsburg, I think that a


remand isn't necessary because I think that what the State


court of appeals did is approximately right, or at least


it's within the range of reason.  So, no, I don't think

that you would need to do that.


Now, if I could get back to one -- one of the


questions that Justice Scalia asked, which was do we apply


the same standard for a 6-year-old.  And although it may


seem kind of intuitively wrong, yes, we would apply the


same reasonable person standard that we would to anybody


else, with the point being that it's a very difficult


thing to require police officers not only to know that a


6-year-old is more vulnerable, but also to know exactly


where along the continuum of custody versus non-custody


that -- that puts them because they have to take


themselves out of their reasonable person mind-set that


they're used to applying and figure out how it applies


differently here.


And I think that it doesn't make a lot of sense


to develop this whole different kind of sideline to the


normal Miranda reasonable person test for 6-year-olds


because the very factors that would make them more likely


to view themselves to be in custody would also make them


less likely to be able to use these Miranda rules if they


were actually -- Miranda rights if they were given them. 


If -- if a -- if a 6-year-old is going to feel too


submissive to authority, it doesn't make a lot of sense to


apply a lower custody threshold if then he's not going to


be able to take advantage of it.

 QUESTION:  I really don't understand.  If you


seem to agree that a 6-year-old would be more likely to


feel submissive to authority, is -- does it not follow


inexorably he, therefore, would reasonably feel he could


not leave when -- where an older person would?


MR. ELWOOD:  Justice Stevens, our point is that


basically we don't require police officers to figure out


the mind-set of 16, 17 --


QUESTION:  I wish you would tell me yes or no on


my question. 


MR. ELWOOD:  I -- I think the -- well, I've


already forgotten what it is. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. ELWOOD: 


But I think the point is --

QUESTION:  Let me -- let me restate it.  You --


you say that you -- the 6-year-old would feel more


submissive to -- to an officer.  Does it not, therefore,


follow that he would be less likely to think he was free


to leave than an older person would?


MR. ELWOOD:  I think if -- in generalities, yes,


that's true, but I also --


QUESTION:  But then isn't age relevant?


MR. ELWOOD:  No, it's not relevant because I


think Miranda -- we -- because it's a prophylactic rule,


it's a supplemental protection in addition to the --

 QUESTION:  No.

QUESTION:  Just relevant to the question whether


he's in custody.  That's the only thing we're asking


about, not the Miranda warning.


MR. ELWOOD:  Right.  And our point is that --


QUESTION:  And if it -- if it makes a difference


of his age, why doesn't that make it relevant?


MR. ELWOOD:  Because what we're talking about


here is not just 6-year-olds.  We have to have a rule that


is workable for police officers with respect to 17-year-


olds and people who are 17 years and 7 months and 18 years


and 1 month.  And when you -- when you can say with some


certainty that a 6-year-old is going to be feeling more 

vulnerable, but you can't say with a lot of certainty that


an average 16-year-old is going to be feeling more


vulnerable than an average 18-year-old, and if so, by how


much.  So that, for example, they know that when they


say --


QUESTION:  But it's relevant by even a tiny,


tiny bit if you've got a totality of the circumstances


test.  To say it isn't very much -- I don't see the


difference between a 6-year-old, the 16-year-old, and the


18-year-old in your presentation.

point is that it's not relevant because the law says it's


not relevant, that the police officer -- all they're


accountable for is the way a reasonable person would view


the circumstances, and they shouldn't be required to


figure out -- get inside the head of a reasonable 16-


year-old, a reasonable 15-year-old.  They just have to


apply one reasonable person standard to the circumstances


that are before them.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Elwood.


Ms. Allen, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF TARA K. ALLEN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. ALLEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


I would first like to start by clearing up some


things about the record that the Court was asking about


earlier.  As far as the parents' being refused permission


to attend the interview, that was a finding of fact made


in the Federal district court.  It is contained in the


magistrate's report and recommendations in this case, and


it can be found at joint appendix 49 and also the


petitioner's brief, appendix B3.


QUESTION:  Was that based on testimony presented


in the district court?


MS. ALLEN:  There was no evidentiary hearing in

the district court. 


As far as --


QUESTION:  Then how -- how did the district


court know to make a finding?


MS. ALLEN:  I believe they based it on the


petition for habeas.  This contention --


QUESTION:  Well --


MS. ALLEN:  I'm sorry, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  A written petition?  And what -- what


was the basis for the district court's finding or the


magistrate's finding?  There was no testimony? 


MS. ALLEN:  No, there was no evidentiary hearing


in the Federal court.


QUESTION:  Then --


MS. ALLEN:  And there was no testimony in the


State court either.


QUESTION:  Then what is the basis for the


finding?


MS. ALLEN:  At the motion to suppress in the


trial court, in the State court, the argument was, in both


the written motion to suppress and the oral argument in


front of the court, that the parents were refused


permission to attend the interview.  The State never


objected to that.  They never contested it.  It was in the


briefs on direct appeal and it wasn't contested there.

The -- the first time it's been contested is now.


QUESTION:  So -- so you're saying it was the


subject of evidence at one point, but in a different


proceeding, and -- and when the record of the different


proceeding was used here, no one objected to it.


MS. ALLEN:  No one objected to it.  And the


State has a right to object --


QUESTION:  You're saying it was -- it was the


subject of allegation, not of evidence. 


MS. ALLEN:  Yes, certainly.  And when a


magistrate files a report and recommendation, either party


can object to any facts that are not correct, and they


didn't do that in this case.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MS. ALLEN:  Secondarily --


QUESTION:  What's RT?  It refers to RT 910 as


the cite.


MS. ALLEN:  That was the reporter's transcript


from the motion to suppress at trial -- pretrial.


Secondarily, there was some contention about


whether Detective Comstock was armed.  That is also found


in the joint appendix, page 65, note 29, and it was in the


petition for writ of habeas corpus in the district court


as well, citing the -- Alvarado's interview, which is in


the joint appendix.

 There was some contention about whether Mr.


Alvarado, Michael, was referred to as a suspect.  That can


be found in the joint appendix, page 189.  That was


argument of trial counsel during the motion to suppress. 


It was not disputed at that point.  It hasn't been


disputed until now.  But I would assert that in addition


to that, even if he had not heard another officer refer to


him as a suspect, it was obvious by Detective Comstock's


word and deed to him during the interrogation that he --


he indeed was a suspect. 


And the last contention is my --


QUESTION:  Well, and your -- your argument is


that you think the fact that he thought he was a suspect


would make him less likely to feel he was free to leave? 

MS. ALLEN:  Yes.  And this Court in California


v. Stansbury found that anytime that it's communicated to


a suspect by word or deed that he is a suspect, that that


goes into the totality of the circumstances of whether


that person would reasonably feel free to leave.


Secondly, I would like -- well, one more thing


on the facts.  The fact that Michael said, can't somebody


come in here with me, is found at the joint appendix, page


185.  That's also trial counsel's argument at the motion


to suppress that was not disputed until now.


But next I would like to -- to move to this idea

of this being a new context.  Miranda is the son of


voluntariness and coercion.  This Court found in 1948 in


Haley v. Ohio that juveniles in general are more


susceptible to police coercion than adults.


QUESTION:  That -- that was not a Court opinion,


was it?


Honor. 


MS. ALLEN:  I don't know, Mr. Chief Justice. 


QUESTION:  You're citing it and you don't know?


MS. ALLEN:  Is it a plurality?


QUESTION:  It was a plurality opinion. 


MS. ALLEN:  Plurality of this Court, yes, Your


In that case, it recognized that juvenile status


be taken into consideration when determining the proper 

procedural safeguards. 


In Miranda in 1966, this Court found that those


procedural safeguards would be the Miranda warnings.


And then in In re Gault in 1965, the Court found


that the greatest care must be taken to assure a minor's


confession was voluntary not only in the sense that it was


coerced, but also that it's not a product of ignorance of


rights.


It follows --


QUESTION:  What -- what good does -- does a


Miranda -- I mean, you know -- warning -- what -- what

good does it do if you -- if you recite it to a 6-year-


old?  I mean, isn't it -- isn't it really a -- a warning


that is designed for a reasonable person, meaning a


reasonable adult?  And so that the situation is as -- as


has been portrayed.  It's just an objective thing that --


that the police are supposed to do.


MS. ALLEN:  If you were to recite a Miranda


warning to a 6-year-old, in the waiver determination they


would decide whether that 6-year-old understood the waiver


of his rights, and the evidence would come in there as


well.


QUESTION:  Oh, so -- so that even the giving of


a Miranda warning would not suffice.


MS. ALLEN: 


The giving of a Miranda warning 

doesn't suffice.  It severely cuts down the cases in which


you can contest coercion.


QUESTION:  Well, coercion of what?  I'm not


talking about coercion, whether the statement is -- is


coerced.  They are not contesting that -- that you cannot


get in the age of the -- of the individual when it comes


to deciding whether the confession was voluntary or not. 


They -- they agree that you can for that.


But just for the question of whether the person


was in custody and therefore has to be given a Miranda


warning.  It seems to me strange to say that you take into

account for that purpose the age of the individual even


though you don't take it into account for the purpose of


whether he can understand -- can get any benefit out of


the Miranda warning at all.  You recite a -- a Miranda


warning to a 6-year-old.  It's not going to mean anything


to him.


MS. ALLEN:  However, if you cite a Miranda


warning to a 17-year-old, it may.


QUESTION:  Well, counsel, the -- the person to


whom the warning is given must be found to have waived the


rights so warned and to have understood that a waiver was


being made.  Isn't that true?


MS. ALLEN:  That's correct. 


QUESTION: 


So I -- I think that's the answer, 

isn't it?


MS. ALLEN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  So -- so that means you cannot


interrogate a 6-year-old, neither in custody nor out of


custody.  Right?  6-year-olds just skip away.  That can't


be right. 


MS. ALLEN:  Usually --


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Isn't the question whether we're


going to --

 QUESTION:  Isn't the question whether we're


going to treat them and prosecute them as adults?


MS. ALLEN:  That's -- that's right.


QUESTION:  And we don't -- we don't do that with


6-year-olds.


MS. ALLEN:  And in most circumstances you're not


prosecuting 6-year-olds.  You're -- you're prosecuting


teenagers.


QUESTION:  What is the evidence or the


indication here that the State did not take account of the


fact that he was a juvenile, but having taken account of


it in the State proceedings, they just reached the


conclusion that it didn't in this case matter that much? 


Now, why do we think that that isn't what happened? 

MS. ALLEN:  When you read the California State


opinion in this case, they don't mention Michael's age. 


They don't mention anything about the fact that he was a


juvenile or how a reasonable juvenile would have assessed


the situation.


QUESTION:  I can understand why they might not


-- they would mention things that did matter, but if they


thought it hadn't mattered here, why would we have


expected them to mention it?


MS. ALLEN:  Is your question if they thought it


didn't matter?

 QUESTION:  Well, I mean, is our only indication


that they didn't take it into account the fact that they


didn't mention it?  Because maybe they didn't mention it


because they thought it's only 6 months.  It doesn't


matter that much.  That would be a reason for not


mentioning it.  Or maybe they didn't mention it because


the lawyers then didn't make that much of an issue of it. 


I mean, there are a lot of reasons why, when I write an


opinion, I don't mention things.  Usually it's because I


don't think it matters.


MS. ALLEN:  Well, the objectively unreasonable


thing about what the California court did in this case was


they recited the correct test for custody, yet they


completely failed to imply it. 


When they were looking at 

the totality of the circumstances, they spent their entire


time distinguishing a State case from this case and


finding that --


QUESTION:  To -- to what extent do we require a


State court, when we're talking about the AEDPA rules, to


be absolutely accurate in following, say, precedent of


this Court?  I mean, I -- I thought the rule was that it


was up to the other -- the other side to point out how


they had departed from it.


MS. ALLEN:  As this Court has found, a totality


means a totality.

 QUESTION:  Well, then you say that in any --


every single Miranda case, a court must take into account


in its opinion every single circumstance that is mentioned


in the record?


MS. ALLEN:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Well, then what -- why do you say


totality?


MS. ALLEN:  Most certainly they should discuss


the factors that make a difference, and in this case they


didn't.  They didn't discuss any of the factors that made


a difference. 


QUESTION:  Well, why should they have said that


the age of a 17-and-a-half-year-old made a difference? 


MS. ALLEN: 


It's more than the age in this case. 

Not only is it a reasonable juvenile standard, but also


it's the enlisting of the parental authority to bring him


to the station, the refusing of permission for the parents


to attend the interview in front of him.


QUESTION:  Well, that's mentioned in the court's


opinion, that they brought him to the station house.


MS. ALLEN:  When they're talking about the


facts, they take the facts from Detective Comstock's


interview where she says, I called the parents and had


them come down.  She doesn't say anything about refusing


them permission.

 QUESTION:  That both Mr. and Mrs. Alvarado came


to the sheriff's station with their son.


MS. ALLEN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Well, so then they did talk about


some of these circumstances.  It's not correct to say they


mentioned none of them.


MS. ALLEN:  They --


QUESTION:  It's right in the opinion. 


MS. ALLEN:  They didn't mention that they were


refused permission, and they didn't mention that Michael


was 17.  I guess you can infer from the fact that she


called the parents that he was under the age of majority.


QUESTION:  Well, maybe they didn't mention that


because it's not in the record. 


I -- I -- maybe they were 

being a little more precise about what -- what should be


in their opinion than -- than we have been here today.  I


mean --


MS. ALLEN:  Well, part of the record were the --


the trial transcripts which included the motion to


suppress hearing, and -- and the briefs cited to that and


the motion itself.  So it was in the record.


QUESTION:  I -- I didn't -- well, I -- I'm not


sure that you're required -- or it's even proper to take


into account allegations that are made in -- in a motion


to suppress when there's been no evidentiary hearing on

them.  I don't --


MS. ALLEN:  Well, where they're not disputed by


the prosecution and -- and the judge finds no contrary


finding and they're argued in all the briefs without the


respondent saying that that's not correct, it seems


reasonable that the court of appeal would -- would take


that as fact.


QUESTION:  Why should it matter in the -- in the


-- why would a court say, oh, yes, I know that age could


be -- could be relevant, but this was a 17 and more --


more than 17-and-a-half-year-old, closer to 18 than 17?  I


think in this case age was irrelevant.  I mean, it seems


to me you have a rather bad case on the facts to press the


difference in age of somebody who's almost 18. 

MS. ALLEN:  I think even if Michael had been 18


and the court had no duty to apply a reasonable juvenile


standard, there are plenty of facts that point toward


custody in this case not only the parental involvement,


but the very fact that this interrogation took place in an


interrogation room at a police station.


QUESTION:  That's the question I asked Mr.


Elwood and he -- his answer was a remand wouldn't be


appropriate because what the State court held was a -- was


reasonable.


MS. ALLEN:  What the State court held was

objectively unreasonable because they -- they failed to


apply the clearly established Federal law from this Court,


which is Thompson v. Keohane.  The recited it, but


completely failed to apply it in any meaningful way.


QUESTION:  In -- in what respect?


MS. ALLEN:  In the respect that that case says


you need to look at all of the circumstances surrounding


an interrogation, and once you add up those circumstances,


you decide whether a reasonable person would have felt


free to leave.  That's a cumulative totality of the


circumstances test.


The California court did not look at the factors


together cumulatively.  They took two factors to


distinguish this case, neither of which was proper:  one,


that the police did not tell him affirmatively that he


could not leave until he told the truth, which would be a


finding of custody straight off.  You would never even get


to the totality test.  And two, that the tactics weren't


intense and aggressive enough to prove coercion.


And as this case said in Kaupp, interestingly,


just as you can't require the perversity of resisting


arrest to prove coercion, here you can't require the


perversity of -- of this being coercive to prove custody. 


You can't use a -- say that the -- the police had to have


enlisted intense and aggressive tactics in order for this

to be custody.  That's not even part of the custody


determination.  There are things like location.  Here it


was at a police station.  Who initiated the contact.  Here


it was initiated by the detective.  Whether the defendant


voluntarily came.  Here he was brought by his parents at


the behest of the detective.  Whether he was informed that


he was not under arrest.  Not only was he not informed of


that, he wasn't given anything to sign to say the


interview was voluntarily -- voluntary.  The length of the


interview.  He was interrogated for over 2 hours.  The


familiarity of the surroundings.  And this is where his


inexperience may go into a -- a circumstances test.  He


had never been in a police station or an interrogation


room.  And whether it was communicated to him that he was


a suspect, which it was certainly by Comstock --


QUESTION:  You're -- you're not meeting their


argument, though.  Their argument is it doesn't matter


that although voluntariness of the confession later on is


indeed a subjective inquiry, was it really voluntary on


the part of this person, custody or not, is not a


subjective inquiry.  It is purely objective.  Was this


person in custody or not in custody?  And their argument


is that determination is to be made from the standpoint of


what a reasonable adult would -- would deduce from the


situation.  It is objective.  It has nothing to do with

the subjective feelings of the particular individual,


whether because he's too young or because he's -- he's


mentally not -- not competent or anything else.  It is an


objective determination.  Did the police have this person


in custody?


MS. ALLEN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Now, what is -- what is your response


to that?


MS. ALLEN:  It is an objective determination,


and nobody is arguing that it should be subjective.  The


petitioner is the one who has created this facade that


we're trying to turn an objective test into a subjective


test.  We're not.  The Ninth Circuit is not trying to do


that. 


No one is asking whether Michael Alvarado felt free 

to leave.  We're asking whether a reasonable person in his


position would have felt free to leave because of such


factors as his age and the parental involvement.


QUESTION:  Well, every subjective inquiry uses


objective factors.  I mean, you're -- you're not making it


non-subjective simply because you say whether it's a --


you know, an objective 17-and-a-half-year-old who had been


abused by his parents and who was, you know, off from


Sunday school or whatever and put in every factor in his


life and say, well, of course, you know.  That -- that's


subjective.  That's not an objective test at that point

when you're using all sorts of factors that -- that go to


what his thinking was.  When -- when you use all of that,


you're using the subjective test.


MS. ALLEN:  There's a fine line here.  Because


the custody test asks how a reasonable person in the


suspect's position would have felt free to leave, it's


saying how would a reasonable person have felt, how they


would have felt free to leave.  And that sounds


subjective, but you're using objective factors.  And the


fact of juvenile status -- it's not subjective.  It's not


a state of mind.  It's a status.  It's a class that this


Court has recognized from the beginning.


QUESTION:  Yes, but not in this particular


context.


MS. ALLEN:  In the context of custodial


interrogations and the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth


Amendment.  These are two sides of the same coin.  Miranda


is concerned with exactly the context that this Court has


recognized. 


QUESTION:  But up -- up to now, it's been


concerned with respect to the custody inquiry to the


external circumstances of -- of the person.  You know, how


would a reasonable person have reacted to these


circumstances?  Now, you're -- you're saying we don't any


longer limit it to that.  We look inside the person and

try to figure out on his background how we would react,


and that of course, is -- Justice Scalia says I think --


is -- is not a -- an objective standard.


MS. ALLEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I


respectfully disagree.  We're not asking what was in the


mind of the person.  We're simply saying that this Court


and other courts in the land and the police need to


recognize what is obvious, that juveniles do not assess


their freedom to leave the same way as adults do.


QUESTION:  Well, but you say juveniles, and


you're saying the 17-and-a-half-year-old will not assess


his freedom to leave in the same way an 18-year-old.  That


just doesn't make any sense at all.


MS. ALLEN: 


This Court in its juvenile 

jurisprudence has drawn lines with juveniles versus


adults.  When things are close to the line, it's going to


be fuzzy, but to say what the petitioner is arguing, that


it never matters, that a 12-year-old would assess their


freedom to leave the same as a 35-year-old, it can't be


true.


QUESTION:  Well, it certainly matters for


determining voluntariness of any statement.  Was that ever


challenged at trial?


MS. ALLEN:  No, it wasn't.  The --


QUESTION:  That's kind of odd, isn't it?

 MS. ALLEN:  It is.  The main contentions at


trial were, one, that the Miranda wasn't read and he was


in custody, and two, that when he said, can't somebody be


in here with me, that that as a request for counsel.


QUESTION:  But never an assertion that the


statements were involuntary.


MS. ALLEN:  No, no.


QUESTION:  And all of these things would be


relevant in the voluntariness inquiry, would they not?


MS. ALLEN:  Yes, sure.


QUESTION:  If juvenility must be taken into


account for the custody determination, how -- how is it


that it is not taken into account for the purpose of what


the nature of the warning has to be, assuming custody? 

I 

mean, we have one Miranda warning that presumably I have


always thought is given to everybody from the 6-year-old


to the senior citizen.


MS. ALLEN:  And --


QUESTION:  Now, if -- if, indeed as you say,


relevant to this whole thing is -- is the age of the


person, we ought to have different Miranda warnings, an 8-


year-old Miranda warning, a 17-and-a-half-year-old Miranda


warning, and so forth.


MS. ALLEN:  I have two things to say about that,


Justice Scalia.  One is many States do employ a different

Miranda warning for juveniles in their statutes. 


Secondly, this Court in Miranda, when putting down the


warning, I assume it applies to both juveniles and adults,


and ignoring the -- the juvenile status is basically


making it an adult standard.  If you're applying an adult


standard to juveniles instead of providing for the


greatest care, you would actually be giving them less


protection to which they're entitled under the clearly


established Federal law.


QUESTION:  And is it also not true that in many,


many cases, voluntariness may remain an issue, for


example, as in Oregon against Elstad.  If there's a


preliminary question followed by Miranda warnings, you


first have to look at the voluntariness of the first


interrogation.  So we haven't abandoned voluntariness as a


relevant issue in these cases.


MS. ALLEN:  No, not at all, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Does that help your case or hurt your


case?  I -- I -- I would think -- I thought that was the


argument of the other side, that you -- you can raise all


of this on the voluntariness point.  You don't have to get


it in on the -- on the quite objective factor of whether


there is custody or not.


QUESTION:  Sure you can, but voluntariness is


retrospective, and Miranda is prospective.  So if you're


48 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005 

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 

trying to protect people's rights from the beginning, it


should be taken into account at the beginning instead of


waiting until the end when it's too late essentially. 


It's very hard to meet a voluntariness test when this


could be taken care of on the front end by police giving


people their 15-second Miranda warnings, particularly


juveniles who they know are going to assess their freedom


to leave differently than adults.


So unless the Court has any other questions. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Ms. Allen.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:45 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
