CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


first this morning in Number 01-463, United States v. Fior


D'Italia.  Ms. O'Connor..


ORAL ARGUMENT OF EILEEN J. O'CONNOR


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. O'CONNOR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This case is about the authority of the


Commissioner of Internal Revenue to assess FICA taxes that


Congress has imposed on employers.  It also involves the


well-established principle of tax litigation.  It involves


two key sections of the Internal Revenue Code and how they


relate to each other, and it involves the evidentiary


value of assessment in tax litigation.


The first of the key sections is section 6201. 


It appears at page 62a of the appendix to our petition. 


It authorizes and requires the Secretary of the Treasury


to make inquiries, determinations, and assessments of all


taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.  The second


key section is 3111.  It appears at page 55a of the


appendix to our petition.  This section imposes a tax on


employers. The tax is measured by the wages they pay or


are deemed to have paid their employees.

 QUESTION:  Which section is this, Ms. O'Connor? 


I'm --


MS. O'CONNOR:  Section 3111 at page 55a of our


appendix to the petition.


QUESTION:  Thank you.


MS. O'CONNOR:  This is the tax that imposes --


this is the provision that imposes a tax on the wages


employers pay or are deemed to have paid their employees.


The question this case presents is how the


commissioner carries out his obligation under 6201 to


assess the tax that is imposed by section 3111.  The tax


is --


QUESTION:  Ms. O'Connor, let me tell you what


troubles me a little about the Government's position in


the case, and I hope you will address this.  How can an


employer ever challenge effectively an assessment made


under the position that you approach, because the normal


burden of proof in a tax refund case normally requires the


employer to show exactly how much money was owed, and I


don't see how that would work in this context.


MS. O'CONNOR:  Exactly, Your Honor.  The


Congress has recognized the difficulty that employers have


in this regard, and that is the reason there are several


of the other sections that we will discussing this


morning.  Section 6205, for example, is mentioned in your

materials.  That is a provision that permits employers on


their own, if they discover an error, to correct it later


and have no interest assessed.  That's a very unusual


provision, and it relates specifically to the complexity


of employment taxes and their administration.


QUESTION:  Well, would that error ever be


anything more than a disparity between what the employee


reported and what the employer reported?


MS. O'CONNOR:  Would what, Your Honor?


QUESTION:  How -- I mean, the error that that


section -- I'm wondering what the error is that that


section contemplates, and I can see it's application,


let's say, if the employer simply added up the employee's


reports wrong and got the wrong figure.  Under what other


circumstances would it apply short of the moment at which


the Government makes the assessment which is in question


here?


MS. O'CONNOR:  It could also apply just -- and


6205 is not specific to restaurants or food or beverage


establishments or tips at all, because another common


error that employers can sometimes make is


mischaracterizing a worker as an independent contractor,


for example, and upon determining later that the person is


actually an employee and they should be withholding


FICA --

 QUESTION:  Well, let me ask the question in


another way.  How would it -- how could it apply in this


situation?  In other words, as I understand it -- I mean,


this is -- I didn't mean to side-track you from Justice


O'Connor's question, but I'll raise the thing that bothers


me.  As I understand it, what the employer is obligated to


report is the sum total of all the reports that the


employees give to the employer of tip income.


MS. O'CONNOR:  That's right, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And I'll assume for the sake of the


question that a given employer has done that.


MS. O'CONNOR:  Mm-hmm.


QUESTION:  I also assume that if you are


correct, that employer has this possibility hanging over


it that the IRS is going to make this kind of an


assessment.


MS. O'CONNOR:  That --


QUESTION:  Is there any -- my question is, is


there any way that the employer can anticipate this kind


of an assessment in order at least to avoid the interest


running under this section?


MS. O'CONNOR:  Absolutely.  There are many


different ways, Your Honor, and this case provides a very


good example.  Employees are required to report on a


monthly basis to employers.  You can see from the forms

8027, which are at pages 38 and 39 of the joint appendix,


those are the forms that this restaurant filed for 1991


and 1992.


QUESTION:  And they were all correct, I take it.


MS. O'CONNOR:  Right, those forms were


absolutely correct. 


You will also note at the top of the page it


says that it is an information report, because this is


information that Congress has required food and beverage


establishments to provide to the Internal Revenue Service


exactly for a purpose such as this.


Now, the annual -- the information report at


pages 38 and 39 is an annual report that the food and


beverage establishment provides to the Internal Revenue


Service, but employees provide reports to employers at


least monthly.  You will see on the forms 8027 that 90


percent of the sales of this restaurant were paid for by


credit card, so every single month this restaurant could


have compared the tips that employees were reporting with


the tips that they saw were being charged on credit cards,


and as any business owner would do when faced with a


liability that could occur down the road, you're going to


set up a reserve for it.


You know you have got your annual insurance


premium due next January.  You start setting aside for it.

 QUESTION:  He may set up -- the employer may set


up a reserve, but as I understand it the employer is not


obligated, in effect, to withhold upon himself, is not


obligated to pay the tax on it until the assessment comes,


because under the IRS' instructions the employer pays the


tax on the amounts reported to the employer even if he


knows they're wrong.


MS. O'CONNOR:  That's exactly right, and that's


another indication of the fact that Congress realized that


this was going to be a difficult provision for employers


to enact.


QUESTION:  Well, what would he do --


MS. O'CONNOR:  31 --


QUESTION:  What would he do to anticipate it? 


Would he say, I'm paying you another $10,000, I don't


happen to owe you that in tax now, I paid what the law


requires me to pay, and you haven't assessed anything


else, but here's another $10,000?  I mean, is that what


you're anticipating?


MS. O'CONNOR:  Absolutely not, Your Honor.  In


fact, it is the rare taxpayer who seeks to pay his tax


before it's called for.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  All right, then how does the taxpayer


take advantage of the provision that allows him to make a

correction and avoid the interest in this case?


MS. O'CONNOR:  Well, one of the things that is


somewhat troublesome about some of the briefs in front of


you from the other side is that the other side is looking


at this as though it was a penalty, and it's not a


penalty, it's merely a tax.  In fact, there specifically


are no penalties.  Let me point out --


QUESTION:  I will assume -- no, I will assume


it's no penalty.  I just want to know how it works in this


situation.  He doesn't owe any tax --


MS. O'CONNOR:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- based on what he has to report to


you.


MS. O'CONNOR:  Right.


QUESTION:  You haven't assessed anything yet. 


How can he possibly take advantage of the provision that


allows him to make a correction, to pay in accordance with


that correction, and to avoid any interest that he would


otherwise be liable for?  How can he take advantage of it?


MS. O'CONNOR:  Well, let me point out a couple


of things from your question, Justice Souter.  First, let


me direct you to 3121(q).  Provisions of the Internal


Revenue Code provide a couple of things.  They provide


what is tax, how is the tax measured, when is it


measured --

 QUESTION:  Where is 2131(q)?


MS. O'CONNOR:  3121(q) is in our joint appendix


here -- oh, no, no, it's in the petition.  Thank you. 


3121(q) is at 58(a).  Thank you very much.


QUESTION:  General O'Connor, it might help if


you answered specifically whether interest does run on the


period between the employer paying what the employee's


reports call for and the assessment at a higher amount.


MS. O'CONNOR:  Thank you, Justice Ginsburg.  No,


there is no interest that runs, and that's why I wanted


you to look at 3121(q) in particular.


QUESTION:  Then how does this section have an


application here?  You say, well, this mitigates it,


and --


MS. O'CONNOR:  No, I'm sorry --


QUESTION:  -- it seems to me that about all the


employer can do is pay immediately at the moment of your


assessment and therefore no interest will run.


MS. O'CONNOR:  No, I did not mean to suggest


that 6205 applied to this assessment, and in fact it


doesn't.  6205 applies when the employer himself discovers


an error and corrects it at the next available


opportunity.


QUESTION:  So it wouldn't apply in these


circumstances.

 MS. O'CONNOR:  It doesn't need to, because under


3121(q) -- it's a very interesting provision.  3121


provides definitions, that's all.  It resides in the


subchapter of the Internal Revenue Code that provides for


these employment taxes, and (q) is the definitional


provision that says that tips are wages.  It also tells


you when the tips are wages.


For the purposes of the employer FICA 3121(q)


tells you that the wages are deemed to have been paid when


the employee reports them or if the employer -- employee


doesn't report them, they are wages deemed to be paid when


the IRS issues notice of demand, so until the IRS notifies


the restaurant that there is an additional FICA tax due,


there is no interest or penalty.


QUESTION:  Right, but at that point there is,


and if you would come back to Justice O'Connor's question,


which was, how could the employer ever know that there was


a mistake in the assessment, and you said, well, as soon


as he knows it, he can come forward with the additional


amount and there won't be any penalty, but how does he


know it?  That's the problem.


MS. O'CONNOR:  He knows it because the employees


are reporting on a monthly basis, and in this case there


was clearly -- we have $120,000 of unreported credit card


tips in each of the 2 years involved here, $120,000 in

unreported credit card tips.  Those reports were coming in


every month.  The restaurant has clear notice --


QUESTION:  But your assessment is for more than


that.  Your assessment assumed a certain unreported amount


of cash tips as well.  Now, how is the reporter -- how is


the employer going to know whether that's erroneous or


not?


MS. O'CONNOR:  The same method that he would use


to make any other determination.  For example, he knows by


the basis of the report that all credit card tips are not


being reported.


QUESTION:  But the burden is on him.  The burden


is on him to show what the proper amount was.  I mean, IRS


comes up with a guess based on, well, we assume that the


same amount weren't reported for cash tips as weren't


reported for credit card tips, pay up.


Now, how is he going to prove that there was a


different amount for --


MS. O'CONNOR:  You're exactly right, Justice


Scalia, the burden is on the taxpayer, and in this case


the taxpayer conceded the entire amount of the judgment. 


Page 35 of the joint appendix --


QUESTION:  But the burden is on the taxpayer to


give information as to which the taxpayer is not in the


best position to know, and --

 MS. O'CONNOR:  That's true, Justice Kennedy.


QUESTION:  -- Justice O'Connor's original


question was, how is the employer supposed to know, and


you say, well, if he doesn't know he can amend later.


The whole question is, and the gravamen of the


argument put forth by the taxpayer here is that the


assessment should be on the person, or on the entity that


has the information, and here your information is as good


as the employer's, and you have the ability to do what the


employer can't, i.e., subpoena the individual records of


the employees.


MS. O'CONNOR:  Actually, not all of that is


true, Justice Kennedy.  The employer, if there were a


dispute between the employer and the employee the employer


certainly could subpoena records of the employee in a


matter such as that, and respondent, as you say, does --


QUESTION:  How does he do that, sue the


employee?


MS. O'CONNOR:  Oh, if -- yes, if there were a


dispute between the two over any matter the employer


certainly could.


QUESTION:  You're talking about a tax court or a


district court, or --


MS. O'CONNOR:  No, just as a general


proposition.  Just as a general proposition.  In this

case --


QUESTION:  Well, as a general proposition I


don't think the employer can subpoena the employee.  I


mean, you have to have a legal proceeding, don't you?


MS. O'CONNOR:  Oh, exactly.  That's what I mean,


Your Honor.  If there were some other legal proceeding --


QUESTION:  Well, but I mean, that's not going to


work.  You're suggesting that he ought to fire the


employee and then be subjected to a wrongful discharge


suit and then subpoena the information so that he can give


it to you.  Why don't you just ask for it?


MS. O'CONNOR:  Well, actually, there is no


evidence in the record on whether the individual employees


were audited or not.  I saw that in the Ninth Circuit


opinion, TRAC is asserted on that point.


QUESTION:  But the point is, you have the


capacity to do it and the employee doesn't.


MS. O'CONNOR:  That's true, Justice Kennedy. 


The amount of assessment, though, I think it's very


important to focus on the fact that in this case, as you


can see at page 35 of the joint appendix, the taxpayer


here conceded the reasonableness of the assessment,


conceded it.


QUESTION:  Then that's just luck, because I


thought Justice O'Connor's original question was, look, we

can all do this, it's so simple.  You multiply 14.3


percent times the gross receipts of every restaurant in


the country, all right.  Now, I thought her question was,


what is the restaurant owner supposed to do to show that


that's inaccurate, what can he do, and so far my own


conclusion listening to you is, he can write the check.


MS. O'CONNOR:  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to --


QUESTION:  Now, is there anything else -- is


there anything else that this restaurant owner has it in


his power to do, other than write the check, and not some


theoretical thing.  What I'm interested in is the


practicality of it.


MS. O'CONNOR:  Absolutely, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  What is that?


MS. O'CONNOR:  -- and I don't mean to be


avoiding the question.  Let me point to another line on


the form, 8027.  You'll notice there is a line that refers


to 8 percent, and then there's a blank and it says, or


lower percentage.  The reason for that is that if a


restaurant employees are reporting tips that are less than


8 percent of gross sales, that could raise a red flag that


maybe the restaurant worker --


QUESTION:  It's not about 8 percent.  Everybody


knows all these minimums.  This is about people who are


earning more than the $20 in tips per year.

QUESTION:  It is about people -- per month, or

QUESTION:  It is about people who satisfy all


these other minimums.  It is not about people -- they can


even get a tax credit for this.


MS. O'CONNOR:  Right.


QUESTION:  I'll save that question.


MS. O'CONNOR:  Right.


QUESTION:  I'm interested in the answer to


Justice O'Connor's question in what I'd call the mind run,


mainstream, basic, typical situation, and that is, what is


that answer?  So far I'm concluding he can do nothing.


MS. O'CONNOR:  No.


QUESTION:  Tell me the answer.


MS. O'CONNOR:  What the restaurant can do is


show evidence that would tend to determine, or help


determine the amount of the tip, how many -- what kind of


a restaurant you have, how upscale it is, where it's


located, the kind of meals you serve -- in fact, the IRS


has a procedure where restaurants can show all that


information, a sample menu to get below the 8 percent.


QUESTION:  And then I'm not being clear.


MS. O'CONNOR:  Right.

 QUESTION:  I think in typical cases like this


one, the restaurant will have paid more -- they will have


assumed that it is more than 8 percent.  They wrote a


check for -- they assumed it was $200,000.  That's going


to be more than 8 percent of gross receipts.


MS. O'CONNOR:  Right.


QUESTION:  All right.  Now, we're only talking


about an area that's well above that, and in respect to


the area well above that.  Here it happened to be between


$200,000 and about $350,000.  In respect to that extra


$150,000, you come in and say, we're sure that it was


earned in tips, and now here's what you did.  You


multiplied gross receipts by 14.3 percent, and you


subtracted the $200,000, okay.  I'm saying anyone can do


that, and I thought Justice O'Connor's question was, you


are a restaurant owner.  You are faced with this.  How do


you show that it isn't so?


MS. O'CONNOR:  The taxpayer here had the


opportunity to do that.  One of the things that you --


QUESTION:  Well, but will you acknowledge at


least that it's virtually impossible for the taxpayer to


get that information?  I mean, the taxpayer has the


reports from the employees, and they're false.


MS. O'CONNOR:  What --


QUESTION:  How, as a practical matter, is the

taxpayer going to establish there's something different? 


I mean, we know in terms of generalities, we're told that


there are less tips paid, or bills paid in cash than by


credit card.


MS. O'CONNOR:  That has been an insertion that


is unproven in the record.


QUESTION:  So you don't accept that as proof.


MS. O'CONNOR:  It may or may not be true.


QUESTION:  So what's the employer going to do,


then?


MS. O'CONNOR:  It may or may not be true.


QUESTION:  Let me ask you one other thing. 


There's a so-called TRAC system, right, that Congress


passed to address this very problem.  What percentage of


restaurants have used TRAC?  Does the record tell us that?


MS. O'CONNOR:  No, the record doesn't tell us. 


I understand from news reports that increasing numbers of


employers are entering into the tip rate alternative


commitment, and that is an alternative to justifying or


trying to establish -- in this case, though, let me point


out that at any point during the IRS' examination the


taxpayer could have shown, could have produced information


that would have reduced the number that you see on Exhibit


A.  They never did that --


QUESTION:  But where would he get --

 MS. O'CONNOR:  -- and they didn't do it in the


district court, either.


QUESTION:  Where would the taxpayer get the


information?  The only thing the taxpayer has got are the


employee's returns to the taxpayer and your assessment.


Where is the taxpayer going to get the information that


would allow it to do what you say in theory it could do?


MS. O'CONNOR:  Well, magically, since its


concession in the district court, at the appellate level


and again in its briefs before this Court, the respondent


has come up with all sorts of ideas that might challenge


the amount of the assessment.  Even if the --


QUESTION:  But there is a stipulation in this


case -- whatever may be in the next case, there is a


stipulation in this case that they are not contesting the


method.  I have a question that I think Justice Breyer has


said he was reserving, and that is, I don't understand


what's in this for the revenue, because of the -- the


provision you haven't mentioned, 45B gives the restaurant


a credit against income tax, dollar for dollar, for the


FICA tax, and let's assume we have employers, most of them


are paying at least the minimum wage, what gain is there


to the revenue whichever way this comes out?


MS. O'CONNOR:  We don't know whether the


taxpayer here was paying the minimum wage, because none of

that was in the record, because the assessment amount was


conceded.  The 45B credit, as you point out, is available


only for tips that are not used by the employer to satisfy


his minimum wage obligations, yet it's not a complete wash


to the Treasury, however, because you still have the FICA


tax being paid in and an income tax credit being given, so


it's the trust fund accounting that would have a problem


if you look at it as a complete offset.  From the


Government side it's not a complete offset at all.


Let me emphasize that the concession in this


case --


QUESTION:  Excuse me, I didn't understand that.


MS. O'CONNOR:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Go over that again.  What trust fund?


MS. O'CONNOR:  The social security trust fund,


so to speak.


QUESTION:  So to speak, yes.


(Laughter.)


MS. O'CONNOR:  Well, it is a matter of


Government accounting.  As a matter of Government


accounting.


QUESTION:  It's a fantasy, isn't it?  I mean, it


all goes into one pot, doesn't it?


MS. O'CONNOR:  As a matter of Government


accounting, there are funds that are --

 QUESTION:  Purely as an accounting matter it

As a Government funding matter.


QUESTION:  From the point of view of the


taxpayer it makes no difference, I take it?


MS. O'CONNOR:  From the point of view of the


taxpayer, it will make a difference if they use tips to


satisfy their minimum wage requirement, and on this record


we don't know.


QUESTION:  And if they don't, it won't make


that -- a difference.


MS. O'CONNOR:  It will -- well, no, that's not


entirely true, but it's an optional credit.  The employer


can prove his eligibility for the credit and claim it, or


rather than claiming the deduction, they can claim a tax


deduction, which they might prefer to do.


QUESTION:  What happens if the employer doesn't


have enough, I guess, gross income to offset?  Then he has


to be stuck with the difference, right?


MS. O'CONNOR:  Well, it is a nonrefundable


credit, and that means you can either use the credit as an


offset to your income tax, and what you're suggesting is


they don't have any income tax.  That kind of employer


might prefer to take it as a deduction, which would create

a net operating loss which could carry forward and benefit


a future year.


QUESTION:  But the question -- and to overstate


the point -- I'm not buying into this argument at the


moment, but I do want to hear your response.  From their


briefs I have the impression that it doesn't make a lot of


difference to the Government in this case.  It would make


a lot of difference to the Government in the case of


restaurants that are losing money, in the case of


taxicabs, hairdressers, newspaper boys, and anyone else


who is in a business where people receive tips, and in


respect to those kinds of cases it gives the Government a


weapon.


In this case, it's being used to force them into


a TRAC program that they don't want to enter.  In some


other case, to have a kind of threat that you could make


to people because, of course, a lot of income is


underreported through tips, and you'd always be able to go


out and assess more.


Now, you're asking us to interpret some very


broad language as saying Congress has given you authority


to do a particular thing.  They're saying, don't give them


that authority.  Congress would never have intended the


IRS to do what I've just described.


Now, I want to be sure you have a clear

opportunity to answer that, because I want to hear what


the answer is.


MS. O'CONNOR:  Congress had the opportunity to


say that no, the IRS does not have the authority to do


what has been referred to here as aggregate assessment,


and I might just point out here that rather than aggregate


assessments, which is what the respondent calls what has


happened here, respondent would prefer the individual


audits and aggregating the estimates, because certainly


they would be estimates if they were done on the basis of


the individual waiter's reports also.


But in 1998, when Congress said that the IRS


cannot use a threat of an assessment like this to force


restaurants into a TRAC, it clearly had the opportunity to


say, and besides, you don't have the authority to do these


estimates anyway, these assessments anyway.  The authority


is very clear, and the only thing that the respondent has


ever argued here is that the amount might be wrong, and


they can't tell you exactly what it is, but there is no


rule that an assessment has to be entirely accurate or


precise.  The assessment authority requires inquiries and


determinations, and that's what's happened here.


QUESTION:  The assessment is presumptively


correct, isn't it, under the statute?


MS. O'CONNOR:  Not under the statute, Justice

Rehnquist, Chief Justice Rehnquist, but rather under the


laws that this Court has observed.  In United States v.


Janis, this Court commented on the presumed correctness of


assessments and their evidentiary value in tax litigation.


QUESTION:  Well, you take the position it is


presumed to be correct, don't you?


MS. O'CONNOR:  It is -- United States v. Janis


stands for the proposition that an assessment is valid


unless it is without any foundation.  Clearly, here, when


the assessment is based on the respondent's own report,


and more than three-quarters of the assessment is on the


amounts that are clearly known to be true, clearly this


foundation, this assessment has a foundation.  Thereafter,


once you've established that the assessment is not


invalid, that it has a foundation at all, then you start


talking about the amount.


QUESTION:  Well, I wonder --


QUESTION:  No, please, go ahead.


QUESTION:  Well, it has a foundation if three-


quarters of it is true?


MS. O'CONNOR:  Pardon me?


QUESTION:  It has a foundation if three-quarters


of it is true?


MS. O'CONNOR:  Oh, no.


QUESTION:  Is that what having a foundation

means?


MS. O'CONNOR:  The test under Janis I think is


much, much lower than that.  It's -- an assessment is


valid if it has any foundation at all --


QUESTION:  So if --


MS. O'CONNOR:  -- and clearly, this one has a


foundation.


QUESTION:  -- 1 penny on the dollar is accurate,


that -- it has a foundation?  Is that what it means?  It


couldn't mean that.


MS. O'CONNOR:  Oh, I think that would be pushing


it a little far, Your Honor, and that's not what United


States v. Janis requires.


QUESTION:  I would think it would mean that


there's some reason to believe the full amount is


accurate, not that three-quarters of it is accurate.


MS. O'CONNOR:  That's not what this Court has


held, particularly United States v. Janis, where in fact


the assessment there was based on an estimate of wage-


earning practice.  By looking at 5 days' worth of wages


the commission assessed on 77 days worth of wages.


QUESTION:  Sure, but doesn't the Janis rule


assume that the taxpayer is, in fact, in a position to


prove the correct figure if the assessment is wrong?


MS. O'CONNOR:  Not necessarily, Your Honor, and

it is incumbent upon any taxpayer upon whom a tax is


imposed to maintain whatever books and records they can.


QUESTION:  Exactly, and that comes back to the


question I've asked before.  What can this taxpayer do?


MS. O'CONNOR:  Well, the taxpayer is in a


business that requires a lot of things.  There health,


safety, and sanitation regulations.  There are also tax-


reporting regulations.  You hire reliable people, you tell


them what the rules are, you remind them what the rules


are, and you facilitate their compliance, and that's what


the restaurant here needed to have done, and may even have


done.  Since they didn't challenge the assessment or


amount of the assessment, I think we can assume that --


QUESTION:  Well, short of the restaurant's


hiring someone to bird dog every single waiter and


waitress to see what, in fact, the tip was, I don't see


how the employer here could collect the information.


The gambler, sure, he can write it down in his


little book, but I don't see where the employer here is in


a position to get the figure to write down in a little


book, short of having a third person follow every --


MS. O'CONNOR:  The waiter can also write down


his tips in a little book, and there are --


QUESTION:  Sure, and the whole premise of the


problem is that the waiter is in fact not telling the

whole truth.


MS. O'CONNOR:  That is why restaurants --


QUESTION:  I mean, that's just really


impractical.


MS. O'CONNOR:  -- every employer should hire


reliable people who they can trust to follow the rules.


(Laughter.)


MS. O'CONNOR:  I'd like to reserve the balance


of my time for rebuttal.


QUESTION:  Very well, Ms. O'Connor.


Ms. Power, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF TRACY J. POWER


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. POWER:  May it please the Court, Your Honor:


Congress did not saddle the employer with a tax


while depriving him of any way to defend against it. 


Congress did not require the employer to do what for 30


years it told him it was not required to do. This tax is


not authorized.  Because it's not authorized, that affects


the burden of proof and the presumption of correctness.


I'd like to suggest an analogy.  If Congress had


passed a tax on my chickens and the IRS came along and


said, we're imposing a tax on you, on your neighbor's


cows, and I said, but I don't owe a tax on my neighbor's


cows, and they in turn said, yes, well, what we did was,

we figured your neighbor had X number of acres and


therefore the average number of cows per acre is Y, and


you owe the tax on the cows, and I said, well, I'm not


going to fight that because I don't have any way to know


how many cows my neighbor had.


QUESTION:  But can I just ask one question that


really puzzles me in this case?


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  I can't follow the cows and all --


(Laughter.)


MS. POWER:  I understand.


QUESTION:  But you did have records, written


records that showed that the actual amount of tips paid by


credit card and so forth to the people in question here


was substantially larger than you reported.  Why shouldn't


that put you on notice that you owed a little money to the


Government?


MS. POWER:  We do not know to what extent, if


any, those credit card tip amounts, or the amount on the


credit card tip slot on a credit card, was in fact


received by an employee, a tip received by an employee


that is wages subject to the act.  We do not know what --


QUESTION:  Well, but after those credit cards go


to the restaurant, doesn't the restaurant turn the cash


over to the employee?

 MS. POWER:  The restaurants handle it in a


variety of different ways.  It could be as simple as an


employee at the end of the night starting to turn over all


the money he's collected during the night, first to


satisfy all the credit card bills, then to satisfy all of


the dupes for the food that he had with the balance


remaining in his pocket, which he then turns around and


kicks out to a whole host of other employees.  We do --


QUESTION:  But don't you know what the practice


is in your own restaurants?


MS. POWER:  We would know what -- each


individual restaurant would know what is done in basic


practice in their restaurant, but how much, if any, of


that credit card amount was retained by any individual, we


do not know.


QUESTION:  No, but what may -- I understand the


waiter may have split the tips with the busboy and so


forth and so on, but the total amount of tip on the credit


card slip was paid to some employee, was it not?


MS. POWER:  Well, we don't even know whether


it's a tip.  There are many reasons why it might not be a


tip.


QUESTION:  But this is a particular restaurant. 


I mean, it 's not as if we're talking about the world of


restaurants.  Surely this particular restaurant knows.

QUESTION:  -- as a tip -- I seem to recall

MS. POWER:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  -- that says, tip, X amount.  You


fill it in.


MS. POWER:  And that's correct, and if I went in


and I didn't have any cash in my pocket and I said to the


waiter, you know, I'm going to leave some extra tip on


here, I need to pay for the valet when I leave, I'm going


to put $5 extra on here, can you give me the cash -- yes,


it's possible that there's tips on there.

says -- it doesn't say -- it says the employer, there is


imposed on the employer an excise tax equal to 6.2 percent

how -- what your argument is that the tax isn't

has to --


QUESTION:  Yes, that's right, and the employer


MS. POWER:  It's wages -- and they have, what


their assessment stands for is a tax on my gross tip


payroll.  There has been no -- that is not a tax --


QUESTION:  No, no, but I -- I understand that


basic point.  I'm trying to get you to focus on what I


think would be, despite the rights and wrongs of it, their


very strong legal position, which is very simple. 


Number 1, that there is assessed here a tax on the


employer equal to 6.2 percent of the total, including tip


wages of the employee, all right, and they say, we have


the power under the statute to assess the amount, and


moreover, we think your client didn't pay, and therefore


we took what we think was a very reasonable way of


figuring that out.


We looked at the credit cards and we saw it


said, tips, and we saw 14.2 percent is the typical amount,

and we assume that's it for credit and for cash, and if


you don't like that, you prove to the contrary.  We don't


think you can prove it, not because it just isn't


possible, that probably, in all likelihood, it isn't true,


okay.  Now, that's their point.


Now, you reply to that.  I would like to hear


your argument.


MS. POWER:  My reply to that is, we started out


by saying it's wages, including the tips of the employee,


and they did not give us a bill for wages which are the


tips of the employee.  They gave us a bill for the total


gross tips of all employees collectively, and this Court


has already held that FICA taxes are divisible taxes under


Flora v. United States, that it is a tax imposed upon the


individual wage earnings.  This Court has already


interpreted 3111 to be a tax on individual wage earnings,


and they did not give us a bill for that tax.


QUESTION:  Well, but that's a different argument


from the one that we've been wrestling with, which is


whether or not you have within your authority and control


an ability to calculate the basis for challenging the


assessment.


MS. POWER:  We do not.


QUESTION:  And you began by saying, well, they


differ and, frankly, I don't give much force to that

argument.  The employer knows how the employer distributes


credit card receipts.  That's the employer's job, so I'm


not particularly persuaded by that argument.  If you want


to go ahead and say, well, the cash portion of the tips


don't relate to the -- in the same ratio that the credit


card tips, I would understand that.


MS. POWER:  The employer does not know how the


tips, the credit card tips are distributed.  It's not as


if --


QUESTION:  Doesn't the employer get the credit


card receipt?


MS. POWER:  At the end of the --


QUESTION:  And doesn't the -- the employer can


st up any system the employer wants.


MS. POWER:  At the end of the evening the


employer would cash out all the employees and would turn


over credit card tips to employees who might have received


credit card receipts, and those employees would then


decide among themselves to whom in what amount they are


going to share those tips that they have received, along


with any cash tips that they may have --


QUESTION:  But the employer at least has an


aggregate at that point, some that appears from the credit


cards to have been paid out in tips, no matter how it's


shared.

 QUESTION:  In addition, he has the ability -- in


addition, he has the ability to tell his employees that he


wants to know the ratio in which they're shared.  He can


make that a condition of employment, so I'm not persuaded


by that argument.


MS. POWER:  I don't really think he can make


that a condition of employment.  I think that employers


have to be very careful what happens in the context of


wage and hour laws and tip-pooling regulations and so on


and so forth.


QUESTION:  Well, that seems to me all the more


reason why the employer should have a strong interest in


knowing how the division is being made.


MS. POWER:  Well, I think that there are many


employees who do not want the employer to have anything to


do -- to know -- to do with the tip-sharing arrangements. 


It is -- tips are the property of the employee.  Not only


that, you have --


QUESTION:  But the employer, Ms. Power, has an


obligation to pay FICA tax, and has an obligation to pay


it on the total earnings, and it isn't -- your cow analogy


didn't just pass me by, because the tax on the employer is


independent of the tax on the employee.  Suppose these


employees never paid a cent in FICA tax, and they went off


to beach-comb some place, the FICA tax would be owed by

the employer just the same.


MS. POWER:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  So it's the employer's cow.  The FICA


tax belongs to the employer.


MS. POWER:  The -- there is no question that the


employer owes a FICA tax.  He owes the FICA tax regardless


of whether the employee is ever audited.  He owes the FICA


taxes regardless of whether the employee is ever assessed


or the employee ever pays his taxes.  It can be assessed


against the employer at a completely different time from


when it can be assessed against the employee.


The employer does not dispute that he owes a FICA


tax.  What the employer disputes is, I can't know what I


owe that FICA tax on until you make some determination of


what the individual earnings are, because until that time,


I am denied all defenses employees have that they can


raise, and there's a whole list of long --


QUESTION:  But you know what -- in fact, you


stipulated that you don't dispute the facts, the


estimates, or determinations used by the IRS as a basis


for its calculation of an amount of aggregated unreported


tip income by all directly and indirectly tipped


employees, which is your -- is on page 35 of the joint


appendix.  You agreed that you are in this case, for


purposes of this case not disputing any of that.

 MS. POWER:  I do not -- we do not dispute the


amount of the IRS' aggregate assessments because -- of all


employees collectively, because we simply do not have the


information to dispute that.  Congress has prohibited us


from having that information.  We do not have that


information.  We have never had that information. 


Congress for 30 years has told us we do not have to


concern ourselves with that information, and we do not


have the wherewithal to dispute it.


So in this case, do I dispute that?  No, because


it is not worth disputing that or attempting to even


whittle down that assessment in this case.


QUESTION:  But your position is, we know that


there is a disparity between what is reported and what is


actually paid in tips.  We know that both the employee and


the employer independently owe a tax on that total amount,


and we know about the shortfall, but there is nothing the


Government can do.  It's just stuck by what the servers


put down on the monthly form that they file.


MS. POWER:  There's plenty that the Government


can do.  The Government has the wherewithal to do


everything, and that's exactly what Congress says should


be done.


QUESTION:  Well, the only thing that you've


proposed, and tell me if I'm wrong about this, is that the

Government go one by one after the employees, and am I


correct in saying that the same method would be used by


the Government if it went against an individual server,


that it -- you are resisting the Government using against


the restaurant.  That is, let's take a waiter in this


establishment.  The Government says, you've underreported


your tip income, and the way we figured out that you've


underreported it is the same formula.  Isn't that what


goes on when --


MS. POWER:  No, it's entirely different,


because -- and as the McQuatters case that's cited in the


briefs by both parties illustrates, in that circumstance,


the individual waiter has an opportunity to bring any


defenses that he has to the Government's assessment


forward, and we are denied every possible defense by that


scenario.


QUESTION:  Well, take -- make that specific,


please.  Here is a waiter, and the Government says, you


have unreported income, and this is how we've estimated


it.  We've estimated it based on our formula, and then


specifically what does that employee do when the


Government says, we've made an estimate based on this 14


percent, or whatever it is?


MS. POWER:  The employee disputes the estimate. 


Whether he does it at an administrative level or whether

he goes to the tax court and disputes it, he goes in and


he disputes it, and he raises the issues, and I think a


number of them were identified in the waitresses' amicus


brief.  For instance, they say, well, I didn't work as


long.  I don't have the same experience as the other guy


had.  They was stiffing, a tremendous amount of stiffing. 


We had a European clientele, the tips weren't as great as


you think.


QUESTION:  What is stiffing?


MS. POWER:  No tip whatsoever.


(Laughter.)


MS. POWER:  I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  I just don't understand how any of


that can get you below the amount that shows up on the


credit cards, because for example, say one employee got


$2,000 in tips, and he could have a defense that I passed


out $600 to the busboys, and maybe his liability is less,


but it still seems to me the employer would have to at


least pay the aggregate amount on the credit card.


MS. POWER:  No, because --


QUESTION:  I just don't understand how you get


around that.


MS. POWER:  -- there's a situation where you


could have many employees.  There's a very high turnover


rate, especially with those who are in the categories that

receive the least amount of tips.  Somebody who comes in,


and he's a busboy and he's there for the afternoon, and he


says, boy, forget this job, I'm leaving, and he takes the


tips that he gets that day, and that happens at a much


higher percentage --


QUESTION:  Well, that would explain why


assessments might be wrong as to individual employees, but


it still doesn't reduce the gross amount in the tip column


on the credit card.


MS. POWER:  It does reduce the gross amounts --


QUESTION:  How?


MS. POWER:  -- that the employer would have to


owe, because if any of that credit card tips that you're


assuming isn't in fact a tip was received by somebody who


made less than $20 a month, the employer doesn't owe any


tax on that.


QUESTION:  Okay.  That's a possibility, but


wouldn't it suffice on any rule of probability if the


Government did just what Justice Stevens described?  It's


quite true, yes, there might have been an extraordinary


turnover, if there is, the employer can come in and say


so.  But if the Government made its claim simply based on


what the credit card reports showed, wouldn't the


Government have made an assessment which enjoyed at least


a probability of accuracy?

 MS. POWER:  No, because you go back to 3111 and


Congress did not impose a tax on the aggregate earnings of


all employees collectively.


QUESTION:  So your argument there is that even


if you had the perfect evidence, even if there was a memo


beyond dispute, written by the accountant and signed by


all the employers that said, after the most thorough


investigation of this restaurant I'm telling you


privately, and you agree, that the total tips earned that


are eligible for social security are $350,000, so it's


signed by 15 bishops, you know, absolute, dead right,


we're saying that even if that's so, he still doesn't owe


it because in the memo it doesn't say which employees.


MS. POWER:  I think that it needs to say which


employees learned which amount, and that's what the tax


was imposed upon, and if on the other hand you had all of


the employees say yes, I earned this, yes, I earned this,


yes, I earned this, then you would have that individual


determination.


QUESTION:  But there's never been anything held,


is there, that where an employer clearly owes a tax to the


Government, based because of the earnings of the employee,


and there can be different contexts where that comes up,


the evidence that he owes that has to name or pick out


which employee?  I assume if there were a case that ever

said that you would have cited it, and I doubt that there


is.


MS. POWER:  I don't think that there is.


QUESTION:  All right.  If there isn't, then


that's my problem.  If you're talking about the quality of


the evidence, you run into the problem that Justices


Stevens and Souter mentioned.  If you're talking about the


need for the precision identification of a single


employee, I don't see in the law any requirement for such


a principle.


MS. POWER:  I think that it's in 3111.  I think


that this Court has already held that the tax is imposed


upon --


QUESTION:  But whereabouts in 3111?  If it's


just two sentences, tell us what sentence or what clause


you --


MS. POWER:  Well, 3111, it says wages or -- 3111


says wages -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.


Equal to the following percentage of wages as


defined in section 3121(a), the tax imposed on something


called wages, that is defined in 3121(a).  You cannot read


3121(a) as anything but --


QUESTION:  Where do we find 3121(a) in your


brief?

the Government's appendix to the petition, and it says,


the term wages means all remuneration for employment, and


it goes on -- they only have one of the individual terms


listed.  There are 21 specific --


QUESTION:  But you're telling us this shows your


point, and you -- point to the language that you think it


does.


MS. POWER:  3111 imposes a tax on wages --


QUESTION:  On wages.  It doesn't say


individual -- wages paid to each individual.  It says


wages.


MS. POWER:  It says wages as defined in 3121(a).


QUESTION:  Then we turn to 3121, and where is it


in there that it makes your point?


MS. POWER:  When you go through each one of the


21 --


QUESTION:  Well, that's what we're here for, to


go through something.


MS. POWER:  Okay, well, the 21 exceptions to


2131(a) lists individual things like whether an employee


participates in a health insurance plan, whether an


employee has a 401(k) plan, the extent to which an


employee's wages go above or below the social security


wage base.


QUESTION:  But that goes to the accuracy of the

figure, perhaps, which you said really is not your point. 


That -- none of those exceptions say anywhere,


collectively or in specific terms, that under 3111 you


can't add them all up.


MS. POWER:  Well, this Court has already held


that --


QUESTION:  And that's what we're saying.


MS. POWER:  -- that's not the way the tax works.


This Court has already held in Flora v. United States and


as quoted in Steele v. United States that it isn't a tax


on the aggregate earnings.  It is -- the assessment is an


accumulation of separate, divisible taxes on each


transaction.  What is subject to the tax is each


individual payment --


QUESTION:  There are two Flora cases, neither of


which are cited in your brief.  Which Flora -- there was a


rehearing grant.  Which one are you --


MS. POWER:  Flora v. United States, and I


believe it's footnote 37 in Flora v. United States.


QUESTION:  Yes, but there are two Flora v.


United States that a rehearing was granted, one's 357,


one's 362, and your brief doesn't seem to mention either


of them.


MS. POWER:  Well, we referenced them in our


complaint, Your Honor.  I think it's paragraph 14 of our

complaint.


QUESTION:  Does it give a citation there?


MS. POWER:  Yes, Your Honor.  362 U.S. 145.


QUESTION:  But that was just about whether or


not the tax court had jurisdiction if the assessment


wasn't completely paid beforehand, wasn't it?


MS. POWER:  Yes, but I believe that footnote 37


in that brief, in that opinion said that the Court agreed


that the excise tax, like a FICA tax, is a divisible tax. 


That's the whole basis upon which we're here.  We only


paid $18 of the total tax, and we paid it on the basis of


our estimate, although we cannot prove it one way or the


other, of one employee who would have made less than $20 a


month over a period of time.  If this wasn't a divisible


tax, or one that was imposed upon each transaction of


wages, then we would have had to pay the entire $23,000. 


This hold that it is a tax on an accumulation of all wages


of all employees is to change that 40-year history of --


QUESTION:  Now, Congress passed something called


the TRAC law in 1998 to deal with this very problem of


tips and the FICA tax, did it not?


MS. POWER:  Not technically, Your Honor.  TRAC


is not something that Congress passed.  TRAC is something


that is an agreement between the industry and the IRS.  It


was -- I was the first person who approached the IRS on

coming up with some type of an agreement with the IRS to

that was written between --


QUESTION:  I thought there was a section in 1998


passed by Congress, section 3414 of the Internal Revenue


Service Restructuring and Reform Act providing that IRS


would not threaten a taxpayer audit to coerce the taxpayer


into entering a tip-reporting alternative commitment


agreement, so at least Congress acknowledged --


MS. POWER:  Congress acknowledged --


QUESTION:  -- the agreement, did it not?


MS. POWER:  It acknowledged that the agreement


existed, but Congress --


QUESTION:  Do you think Congress was assuming


there were assessments going on of employers for this


liability?


MS. POWER:  Not at that time, because there are


two documents at the very end of the joint appendix that


are Government documents, and they indicate that they were


not doing the employer-only assessments at that time.  In


fact, they indicate that they were not doing the employer-


only assessments at that time.  In fact, they indicate


that they -- they assured Congress that they were not


doing assessments at that time.


QUESTION:  When did the IRS start doing these

aggregate assessments?  Do you know when they started?


MS. POWER:  I would say that they started doing


them about 1992, 1993, and you had asked the question


earlier, how many TRAC agreements are there that have been


signed.  There are about 25-to-30,000 TRAC agreements that


have been signed.  There are about 200,000 --


QUESTION:  Well, this congressional provision


that I asked you about was made in 1998, so that was well


after the beginning of aggregate assessments.


MS. POWER:  And long after the IRS had announced


that they were not doing aggregate assessments.


QUESTION:  The gravamen of your brief is that as


a principle an assessment shouldn't be imposed on the


taxpayer unless the taxpayer has the information to


contradict the assessment, which certainly makes a lot of


common sense.  Is there a provision in the code, or


something that we've said in the cases that sustains that


overarching principle?


MS. POWER:  Well, I think that --


QUESTION:  Or is it just kind of a due process


fairness thing?


MS. POWER:  Well --


QUESTION:  Is there a specific principle you can


point to to show the correctness of that assumption?


MS. POWER:  Well, I think that there's 30 years

of congressional history that clearly shows that Congress


does not intend for the employer to be put in this


position, that Congress did not intend for the employer to


be required to police and monitor the reporting of


employees, and ostensibly that's what the IRS'


interpretation does.


QUESTION:  But you have no specific authority or


precedent for the proposition that an assessment should


not be imposed on a taxpayer unless the taxpayer is in a


good or perhaps best position to contradict the


assessment?


MS. POWER:  I think that we have plenty of


authority for the proposition that the assessment in this


case is unauthorized because it's on the collective wage-


earning on 31 --


QUESTION:  But that wasn't what I asked you. 


I 

asked you about the general proposition.


MS. POWER:  That a tax cannot be imposed upon --


QUESTION:  An assessment cannot be imposed on


the taxpayer unless the taxpayer has the capacity or the


ability to contradict it.  I mean, that's -- it seems to


me that's the principle argument in your brief.  It makes


a lot of sense, but I want to know if I'm -- if the


Court's writing an opinion for that, what do they cite for


that proposition?

 MS. POWER:  The best I can tell you --


QUESTION:  Other than the fact that this is


something everybody should know, but that doesn't usually


work.


(Laughter.)


MS. POWER:  I think that the burden of


presumption and the burden of proof that they have put


forth is premised upon the understanding that the person


with that burden has the records and is in the best


position to respond, and that does not characterize this


situation, so those policy considerations behind that are


not existing here.


QUESTION:  Are there other situations in the tax


law where the Government knows that income has been


underreported?  Aren't estimates made in many different


contexts where the taxpayer doesn't keep reliable records,


and so the Government has to find some way of measuring


what the tax should be, so it does an estimate?  Isn't


that common?


MS. POWER:  In each one of those cases it's --


the person responsible for keeping the records is the one


taxed.  We have no problem with the IRS attempting to


determine the earnings of the individual employees and


coming back and --

asked you, are they making an estimate in that case, and


you started to say no, because the taxpayer, the


individual servers have all these --


MS. POWER:  Excuses --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. POWER:  -- or defenses?


QUESTION:  Yes.  But I thought that they


could -- I thought that was a given, that if they go after


a single waiter, that they can have an estimate.


MS. POWER:  They can.


QUESTION:  They do make an estimate.


MS. POWER:  They can.


QUESTION:  And the very estimate that you are


resisting when it applies to the employer.


MS. POWER:  Because we are -- we don't have the


same defenses that the waiter and the waitress does.  The


waiter and the waitress can say, you know, all kinds of


things in response, that no, I didn't earn that, here are


my records, here are my individual records of exactly what


I earned.


The IRS sends them a bill based on the same


types of estimates, takes it one step further and says,


okay, well, you worked X number of hours out of the total


number of hours in this restaurant, so of this total share

waitress can come in and say no, here's my individual


record, and this is exactly what I earned, or no, you're


wrong in assuming this, or you're wrong in assuming that,


and then a determination can be made of what that


individual waiter or waitress made, and then turn around


and give it to us.


That's exactly what one of the documents in our


joint appendix on page 92, that's exactly what the IRS did


do before they came up with this aggregate assessment


method, because that is precisely what Congress envisioned


that the IRS would be doing with the 8027 Form data, is


taking that information, using that information to make


examinations of individual employees, and then turning


around --


QUESTION:  Now, practically can the IRS -- are


you suggesting that they go after the employees, and then


when they know the amount based on the extra tax the


employee will have to pay, then say, okay, employer, you


pay the same amount, but practically can the IRS -- does


it have the facilities to go audit every waiter and busboy


and --


MS. POWER:  There's no requirement that they


audit every waiter or busboy.  In the first place, that


letter that I just pointed out didn't require any audit at


all, and not only that, in the context of what's happening

here, they still have an audit problem.  They've only


collected, or are attempting to collect 25 cents out of


every single dollar.  They're leaving three -- 75 cents on


the table here.  They come in here and they say that


they've got this huge, astronomical problem, and we can't


do anything about it.


QUESTION:  Well, the reason is, maybe it isn't


cost-effective to go after the individual employees.


MS. POWER:  Well, I don't think it's very cost-


effective to do this one, when the employer is --


QUESTION:  The employer tax is owed


independently, which is what I started to ask you about


when you gave your cow example.  The taxes on an employer,


that's a discrete tax.  There's a tax on the employee. 


That's a discrete tax.  Why, because the Government is


going to have a hard time collecting the tax on the


employee, is it disabled from collecting the tax on the


employer?


remaining.


MS. POWER:  Because that's what Congress said --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Power.


MS. POWER:  -- that the IRS should do.

 QUESTION:  Ms. O'Connor, at the very outset you


said that 311 imposed a tax on wages paid or deemed to


have been paid.  Is the word deemed in the statute?


MS. O'CONNOR:  Is the word deemed in the


statute?


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. O'CONNOR:  I believe so.  I believe it's in


3121(q), Your Honor, which I keep losing.


QUESTION:  Well, I'll find it.


MS. O'CONNOR:  Yes, it's on page 58a, is where


3121(q) appears, and remember that is a section that


provides definitions.  3121 tells you that wages include


tips which are paid or deemed to have been paid, and


3121(q) also tells you the time.


As we have said, this is a tax on an aggregate


amount.  Form 941 in your joint appendix show how the


employer reports the tax, and shows that it is a tax on


the wages paid.


QUESTION:  Well, except I think the deeming


refers to the time of payment, not to the fact of payment,


but I'll look at that.


MS. O'CONNOR:  I think you're right about that,


Your Honor.  Nonetheless, they are deemed to be paid at


the time, right.  3121(q) tells you that tips are


included, and then the deemed part is -- the tips are

wages, and the deemed part is when they are deemed to have


been paid.  They're deemed to have been paid by the


employer, and then it goes on and tells you when.  It does


say tips are deemed to have been paid by the employer. 


That's the very first sentence.  It's at page 85a.


QUESTION:  How long has IRS been making these


assessments, please, Ms. O'Connor?


MS. O'CONNOR:  I believe, Justice O'Connor, that


it did start around 1992 and 1993, and the information


that the IRS is gathering on the forms 8027 demonstrated


the extent of the problem that Congress suspected did


exist about substantial underreporting of tip income.


QUESTION:  In view of all the questions about


the proper computation, why has the Government resisted


notice and comment rulemaking to come up with a fair


formula, because the contention is that the Government's


formula exaggerates the income, exaggerates the tip


income.


MS. O'CONNOR:  That is certainly the contention,


and there have been, however, no facts to show whether


that's true or not, because in each of the cases, not only


the Ninth Circuit below, but in each of the three cases


that we cite in our briefs decided by the Seventh,


Eleventh, and the Federal Circuits, no evidence was ever


submitted to show that the tips were overstated in any

way.


QUESTION:  But why not -- why not employ that


fair procedure of going through the notice and comment,


and then -- I think that's what Judge Kozinski said to do.


MS. O'CONNOR:  Yes, he did.  Judge Kozinski's


opinion entirely excludes section --


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  I think you've


answered the question.  Judge Kozinski did say that, so


the case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
